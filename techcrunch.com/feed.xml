										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s that magical time of year. No, I&#8217;m not talking about the upcoming holiday season. Instead<strong>,</strong> it&#8217;s time for AWS&#8217;s annual customer extravaganza <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/?trk=www.google.com">re:Invent</a>, which starts next week. The conference is always a newsy event with tons of new features and products being announced. It&#8217;s also a time for AWS to pull together the press, customers, partners and other interested parties to party in Vegas. This year it has a new twist.</p>
<p>Besides the gathering returning to Vegas after a year as virtual event due to the pandemic, this year&#8217;s event will mark the first re:Invent with new CEO Adam Selipsky at the helm.</p>
<p>Selipsky <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tableau-ceo-adam-selipsky-is-returning-to-aws-to-replace-andy-jassy-as-ceo/">came over from Tableau</a> earlier this year after Jeff Bezos announced he was moving into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">the executive chairman role</a>, and former AWS CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/today-is-day-1-for-andy-jassy-as-former-aws-ceo-moves-to-amazon-corner-office/">Andy Jassy moved up to replace Bezos</a> as Amazon CEO.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238296" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With the executive musical chairs shuffle settled, Selipsky will deliver the main keynote, and he&#8217;ll have big shoes to fill. Jassy had an uncanny ability to keep his company&#8217;s vast product catalogue inside his head and talk about how all of the pieces connected to one another seemingly extemporaneously. Pulling off a similar feat would not be easy.</p>
<p>But Selipsky brings his own personal strengths to the table as Jassy pointed out in the email he sent to employees announcing that the former Tableau exec<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/aws-announces-next-ceo"> would be his successor</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Adam brings strong judgment, customer obsession, team building, demand generation, and CEO experience to an already very strong AWS leadership team. And, having been in such a senior role at AWS for 11 years, he knows our culture and business well.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is all true, and the division he is now running remains <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/cloud-infrastructure-market-hits-180b-run-rate-in-q3-as-even-chip-shortages-cant-slow-it-down/">firmly in command</a> of the market, but there have been signals that in spite of that success, that Selipsky could be ready to put his own stamp on AWS and maybe begin to tweak how they do business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/amazon-cloud-ceo-tweaks-strategy-amid-microsoft-google-rivalry?sref=gni836kR">he told Bloomberg</a> last week that he intends to take a page from Microsoft and Google&#8217;s cloud playbook and start to create industry-specific solutions. Under Jassy&#8217;s rule, they avoided this strategy, preferring a more generalized approach, letting partners deal with the specifics.</p>
<p>Perhaps his short time as part of Salesforce when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/salesforce-closes-15-7b-tableau-deal/">Tableau was acquired</a>, which likes the industry-driven solutions approach, convinced Selipsky that this would be a good way for AWS to go as well. But beyond that, he has not revealed if he intends to change things under his command. Maybe he will next week, or perhaps he sees something that isn&#8217;t broken and doesn&#8217;t need fixing.</p>
<p>When asked what advice they would give to Selipsky, a couple of industry watchers had quick responses.</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research says the first thing he would advise Selipsky to do is reduce the growing set of products into a simpler, less comprehensive catalogue. &#8220;CTOs avoid [solutions that have] to rely on the ingenuity of developers instead of a platform offering with version numbers and road maps from AWS connecting the dots for them,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Secondly he would suggest becoming more enterprise friendly by taking a page from how Google and Microsoft (and even IBM and Oracle) about how these companies approach cloud sales to larger companies. He would suggest possibly hiring experienced enterprise executives as Google has done, particularly with CEO Thomas Kurian, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/16/former-oracle-exec-thomas-kurian-to-replace-diane-greene-as-head-of-google-cloud/">who came from Oracle</a> in 2018 or Robert Enselin, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/google-cloud-brings-on-27-year-sap-veteran-as-it-doubles-down-on-enterprise-adoption/">who came on board from SAP</a> in 2019 as president of global cloud operations.</p>
<p>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy has a couple of different recommendations, proposing they move up the stack and start developing more SaaS applications to compete with Google, Microsoft and Adobe, among others. Further, he wants to see them move into hybrid more where their competitors are trying to take the lead.</p>
<p>All that said, the division is immensely successful. In the most recent quarterly report, the company <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results/default.aspx">reported $16.1 billion</a> in revenue, but Selipsky himself told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-11-18/bloomberg-studio-1-0-aws-ceo-adam-selipsky">Bloomberg&#8217;s Emily Chang in an interview</a> last week that you he knows he can not simply rest on his laurels and count on that success continuing with such formidable competitors chasing his company.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really important to continue to act as if we&#8217;re insurgents and not to start to act like incumbents,&#8221; Selipsky told Chang.</p>
<p>Regardless, at re:Invent, he will have his first turn as the face of AWS, delivering the main keynote, and while he is reporting to Jassy, he is his own person and will emphasize what he sees as important to continue growing the lucrative division. We will see next week if that involves any significant changes or not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In what looks like bad news for adtech giants like Facebook and Google, MEPs in the European Parliament have voted for tougher restrictions on how Internet users&#8217; data can be combined for ad targeting purposes &#8212; backing a series of amendments to draft legislation that&#8217;s set to apply to the most powerful platforms on the web.</p>
<p>The Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee (IMCO) today voted overwhelmingly to support beefed up consent requirements on the use of personal data for ad targeting within the Digital Markets Act (DMA); and for a complete prohibition on the biggest platforms being able to process the personal data of minors for commercial purposes &#8212; such as marketing, profiling or behaviorally targeted ads &#8212; to be added to the draft legislation.</p>
<p>The original Commission proposal for the DMA was notably weak in the area of surveillance business models &#8212; with the EU&#8217;s executive targeting the package of measures at other types of digital market abuse, such as self-preferencing and unfair T&amp;Cs for platform developers, which its central competition authority was more familiar with.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238581" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="ep-wysiwig_paragraph">&#8220;The text says that a gatekeeper shall, &#8216;for its own commercial purposes, and the placement of third-party advertising in its own services, refrain from combining personal data for the purpose of delivering targeted or micro-targeted advertising&#8217;, except if there is a &#8216;clear, explicit, renewed, informed consent&#8217;, in line with the General Data Protection Regulation,&#8221; IMCO writes in a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20211118IPR17636/digital-markets-act-ending-unfair-practices-of-big-online-platforms">press release</a>. &#8220;In particular, personal data of minors shall not be processed for commercial purposes, such as direct marketing, profiling and behaviourally targeted advertising.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fair to say that adtech giants are masters of manipulating user consent at scale &#8212; through the use of techniques like A/B testing and dark pattern design &#8212; so beefed up consent requirements (for adults) aren&#8217;t likely to offer as much of a barrier against ad-targeting abuse as the committee seems to think they might.</p>
<p>Although if Facebook was finally forced to offer an actual opt-out of tracking ads that would still be a major win (as it doesn&#8217;t currently give users any choice over being surveilled and profiled for ads).</p>
<p>However the stipulation that children should be totally protected from commercial stuff like profiling and behavioral ads is potentially a lot more problematic for the likes of Facebook and Google &#8212; given the general lack of robust age assurance across the entire Internet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It suggests that if this partial prohibition makes it into EU law, adtech platforms may end up deciding it&#8217;s less legally risky to turn off tracking-based ads altogether (in favor of using alternatives that don&#8217;t require processing users&#8217; personal data, such as contextual targeting) vs trying to correctly age verify their entire user base in order to firewall only minors&#8217; eyeballs from behavioral ads.</p>
<p>At the very least, such a ban could present big (ad)tech with a compliance headache &#8212; and more work for their armies of in-house lawyers &#8212; though MEPs have not proposed to torpedo their entire surveillance business model at this juncture.</p>
<p>In recent months a number of parliamentarians have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/">pushing for just that: An outright ban on tracking-based advertising period</a> to be included, as an amendment, to another pan-EU digital regulation that&#8217;s yet to be voted on by the committee (aka the Digital Services Act; DSA).</p>
<p>However IMCO does not look likely to go so far in amending either legislative package &#8212; despite a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/edpb-call-to-ban-tracking-ads/">call this week by the European Data Protection Board</a> for the bloc to move towards a total ban on behavioral ads given the risks posed to citizens fundamental rights.</p>
<h2 class="ep-wysiwig_paragraph">Digital Markets Act</h2>
<p>The European Parliament is in the process of finalizing its negotiating mandate on one of the aforementioned digital reforms &#8212; aka, the DMA &#8212; which is set to apply to Internet platforms that have amassed market power by occupying a so-called &#8216;gatekeeping&#8217; role as online intermediaries, typically giving them a high degree of market leverage over consumers and other digital businesses.</p>
<p>Critics argue this can lead to abusive behaviors that negatively impact consumers (in areas like privacy) &#8212; while also chilling fair competition and impeding genuine innovation (including in business models).</p>
<p>For this subset of powerful platforms, the DMA &#8212; which was presented as a legislative proposal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">at the end of last year</a> &#8212; will apply a list of pre-emptive &#8216;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8217; in an attempt to rebalance digital markets that have become dominated by a handful of (largely) US-based giants.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers argue the regulation is necessary to respond to evidence that digital markets are prone to tipping and unfair practices as a result of asymmetrical dynamics such as network effects, big data and &#8216;winner takes all&#8217; investor strategies.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out its plan to reboot digital rules and tame tech giants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/embed/#?secret=kFuFZl2frV" data-secret="kFuFZl2frV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Under the EU&#8217;s co-legislative process, once the Commission proposes legislation the European Parliament (consisting of directly elected MEPs) and the Council (the body that represents Member States&#8217; governments) must adopt their own negotiating mandates &#8212; and then attempt to reach consensus &#8212; meaning there&#8217;s always scope for changes to the original draft, as well as a long period where lobbying pressure can be brought to bear to try to influence the final shape of the law.</p>
<p>The IMCO committee vote this morning will be followed by a plenary vote in the European Parliament next month to confirm MEPs&#8217; negotiating mandate &#8212; before the baton passes to the Council next year. There trilogue negotiations, between the Parliament, Commission and Member States&#8217; governments, are slated to start under the French presidency in the first semester of 2022. Which means more jockeying, horse-trading and opportunities for <a href="https://twitter.com/ka_iwanska/status/1463094399949324289">corporate lobbying</a> lie ahead. And (likely) many months before any vote to approve a final DMA text.</p>
<p>Still, MEPs&#8217; push to strengthen the tech giant-targeting package is notable nonetheless.</p>
<p>A second flagship digital update, the DSA, which will apply more broadly to digital services &#8212; dealing with issues like illegal content and algorithmic recommendations &#8212; is still being debated by MEPs and committee votes like IMCO&#8217;s remain outstanding.</p>
<p>So the DMA has passed through parliamentary debate relatively quickly (vs the DSA), suggesting there&#8217;s political consensus (and appetite) to rein in tech giants.</p>
<p>In its press release summarizing the DMA amendments, rapporteur Andreas Schwab (of the EPP and DE political grouping) made this point, loud and clear, writing: “The EU stands for competition on the merits, but we do not want bigger companies getting bigger and bigger without getting any better and at the expense of consumers and the European economy. Today, it is clear that competition rules alone cannot address all the problems we are facing with tech giants and their ability to set the rules by engaging in unfair business practices. The Digital Markets Act will rule out these practices, sending a strong signal to all consumers and businesses in the Single Market: rules are set by the co-legislators, not private companies!”</p>
<p>In other interesting tweaks, the committee has voted to expand the scope of the DMA &#8212; to cover not just online intermediation services, social networks, search engines, operating systems, online advertising services, cloud computing, and video-sharing services (i.e. where those platforms meet the relevant criteria to be designated “gatekeepers”) &#8212; but also add in web browsers (hi Google Chrome!), virtual assistants (Ok Google; hey Siri!) and connected TV (hi, Android TV) too.</p>
<p>On gatekeeper criteria, MEPs backed an increase in the quantitative thresholds for a company to fall under scope &#8212; to €8 billion in annual turnover in the European Economic Area; and a market capitalisation of €80 billion.</p>
<p>The sorts of tech giants who would qualify &#8212; based on that turnover and market cap alone (NB: other criteria would also apply) &#8212; include the usual suspects of Apple, Amazon, Meta (Facebook), Google, Microsoft etc but also &#8212; potentially &#8212; the European booking platform, Booking.com.</p>
<p>Although the raised threshold may keep another European gatekeeper, music streaming giant Spotify, out of scope.</p>
<p>MEPs supported the additional criteria for a platform to qualify as a gatekeeper and fall under scope of the DMA of: Namely, providing a &#8220;core platform service&#8221; in at least three EU countries; having at least 45M monthly end users and 10,000+ business users. The committee also noted their support that these thresholds do not prevent the Commission from designating other companies as gatekeepers &#8212; &#8220;when they meet certain conditions&#8221;.</p>
<p>In other changes, the committee backed adding new provisions around the interoperability of services, such as for number-independent interpersonal communication services and social network services.</p>
<p>And &#8212; making an intervention on so-called &#8216;killer acquisitions&#8217; &#8212; MEPs voted for the Commission to have powers to impose “structural or behavioural remedies” where gatekeepers have engaged in systematic non-compliance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The approved text foresees in particular the possibility for the Commission to restrict gatekeepers from making acquisitions in areas relevant to the DMA in order to remedy or prevent further damage to the internal market. Gatekeepers would also be obliged to inform the Commission of any intended concentration,&#8221; they note on that.</p>
<p>The committee backed a centralized enforcement role for the Commission &#8212; while adding some clarifications around the role of national competition authorities.</p>
<p>Failures of enforcement have been a major bone of contention around the EU&#8217;s flagship data protection regime, the GDPR, which allows for enforcement to be devolved to Member States but also for forum shopping and gaming of the system &#8212; as a couple of EU countries have outsized concentrations of tech giants on their soil and have been critized as bottlenecks to effective GDPR enforcement.</p>
<p>(Only today, for example, Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/facebooks-lead-eu-privacy-supervisor-hit-with-corruption-complaint/">hit with a criminal complaint</a> accusing it of procedural blackmail in an attempt to gag complainants in a way that benefits tech giants like Facebook&#8230; )</p>
<p>On sanctions for gatekeepers which break the DMA rules, MEPs want the Commission to impose fines of “not less than 4% and not exceeding 20%” of total worldwide turnover in the preceding financial year &#8212; which, in the case of adtech giants Facebook&#8217;s and Google&#8217;s full year 2020 revenue would allow for theoretical sanctions in the $3.4BN-$17.2BN and $7.2BN-$36.3BN range, respectively.</p>
<p>Which would be a significant step up on the sorts of regulatory sanctions tech giants have faced to date in the EU.</p>
<p>Facebook has yet to face any fines under GDPR, for example &#8212; over three years since it came into application, despite facing numerous complaints. (Although Facebook-owned WhatsApp was recently fined <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">$267M for transparency failures</a>.)</p>
<p>While Google received an early <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/french-court-slaps-down-googles-appeal-against-57m-gdpr-fine/">$57M GDPR from France</a> before it moved users to fall under Ireland&#8217;s legal jurisdiction &#8212; where its adtech has been under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">formal investigation since 2019</a> (without any decisions/sanctions as yet).</p>
<p>Mountain View has also faced a number of penalties elsewhere in Europe, though &#8212; with France again leading the charge and slapping Google with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">$120M fine for dropping tracking cookies without consent</a> (under the EU ePrivacy Directive) last year.</p>
<p>Its competition watchdog has also gone after Google &#8212; issuing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">$268M penalty this summer for adtech abuses</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">a $592M sanction (also this summer)</a> related to requirements to negotiate licensing fees with news publishers over content reuse.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to imagine such stings as a mere <em>amuse-bouche</em> compared to the sanctions EU lawmakers want to be able to hand out under the DMA.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite Apple and Facebook investing billions into a &#8220;metaverse&#8221; future, in recent years there&#8217;s been a distinct drop-off in venture deals for startups focused on finding opportunities in augmented reality. Many VCs who have been burned by investments in large-scale efforts like Magic Leap now see the near-term spoils of augmented reality tech as opportunities largely left for big tech companies, but smaller startups are still finding inroads that appeal to investors.</p>
<p>For London-based <a href="https://www.dentreality.com/">Dent Reality</a>, one opportunity is in creating specific small-scale experiences that showcase the powers of the technology &#8212; and hyper-localized mapping &#8212; starting in venues like grocery stores. In the case of a grocery store, the team&#8217;s augmented reality platform can provides shoppers with a small-scale layout of the store&#8217;s aisles, while integrating with the store&#8217;s database to provide shelf-specific data on where to find particular items. AR capabilities allow users to hold their phone up to chart a path to the object of their desire.</p>
<p>CEO Andrew Hart says that retailers are more broadly interested in finding ways to bring their online toolsets into the experience of real-world shoppers because those personalization tools have grown to make online shoppers much more valuable to them. Dent Reality isn&#8217;t specifically a platform for finding things in grocery stores, but Hart says that their high density of products makes them an ideal location to stress test their tech.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238675" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We decided on grocery stores, because it’s the hardest challenge that we could have solved,&#8221; Hart tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Investors see an opportunity in Dent&#8217;s efforts, the London startup has closed a $3.4 million seed round led by Pi Labs with participation from Sugar Capital and 7Percent Ventures.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some really exciting AR news &#8211; we <a href="https://twitter.com/DentReality?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DentReality</a> have raised $3.4m to build the digital layer for the physical world!</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In the years following the launch of Apple&#8217;s ARKit augmented reality developer platform, Hart has built up an audience on Twitter showcasing many of the futuristic augmented reality tech demoes he&#8217;s created. Dent Reality was an effort to turn some of these future-flung use cases into a present-day tech platform for developers. While smartphones are an imperfect device for augmented reality, they still offer consumers a way to experience and interact with 3D interfaces which Hart believes will be central to the utility of an upcoming wave of augmented reality glasses devices.</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;Interfaces in general have been trapped in 2D and phone screens,&#8221; Hart says. &#8220;There’s so much opportunity in AR for things we just can’t do with a 2D interface.&#8221;</p>
<p>Down the road, Dent Reality wants to tackle everything from large office complexes to hospitals to college campuses, leveraging hyper-localized map data, augmented reality and their unique approach to localizing users with public WiFi data and smartphone sensors that doesn&#8217;t require buildings to integrate new hardware infrastructure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The venture arm of Volvo Cars, an automaker long synonymous with safety, has invested in an optics and imaging startup developing technology that can be integrated into a car&#8217;s windshield or windows to deliver images to drivers and passengers.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Volvo Cars Tech Fund invested $2 million into o</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ptics and imaging developer </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="http://www.spectralics.com/">Spectralics</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, funds it will use to accelerate the development of its optical film that the company says could make cars safer and provide a better user experience. While the investment might not seem significant, the relationship with Volvo could prove fruitful, particularly if its tech ends up in production vehicles. </span></p>
<p>Spectralics is developing see-through optical overlay, also known as a “multi-layered thin combiner,” that can be integrated onto a car’s windshield or windows. Spectralics says this creates a wider field of view and, crucially, a sense of distance – both necessary for a safe augmented reality overlay.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238676" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Outside of the vehicle, the tech could also be used for smart glasses, optical systems and other head up displays. It’s the latest sign that augmented and virtual reality are moving beyond gaming and consumer goods and into the vehicle. It’s arguably part of a wider shift of automotive OEMs distinguishing new cars not by horsepower but by user experiences and technology offerings.</p>

<p>While the uptake of AR/VR in cars has faced a number of bottlenecks, automakers are leading the pack in investing in companies developing this tech for in-cabin applications. as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/automakers-suppliers-and-startups-see-growing-market-for-in-vehicle-ar-vr-applications/">Abigail Basset notes for TechCrunch+.</a></p>
<p>If Volvo’s investment in Spectralics wasn’t signal enough, a spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the Swedish car giant is looking to adopt this tech in its cars. “Spectralics is a good portfolio fit for us and we believe that their technology has the potential to set a standard for the next generation of displays and cameras,” Volvo Cars Tech Fund’s head Lee Ma said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Spectralics is an alum of MobilityXlab, an accelerator in Götenborg, Sweden, and is also part of Drive-TLV, a mobility hub in Tel Aviv that connects startups with automotive industry investors. Volvo&#8217;s investment arm has been part of both initiatives since 2017, and has recently invested in a handful of other Israeli startups, including MDGo, which develops accident detection sensors, and vehicle inspection tech developer UVEye.</p>
<p>The new funding now brings the Israel-based startup’s total raised to $5 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this month, Netflix&#8217;s new gaming service became globally available across both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/netflix-launches-games-to-iphone-and-ipad-users-worldwide/">iOS</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/netflix-games-are-coming-to-all-members-on-android-starting-this-week/">Android</a> with a debut lineup that included two &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221;-themed games and a few more casual gaming titles. In the days since its launch, Netflix has expanded its lineup with two more games, including another casual game &#8220;Bowling Ballers,&#8221; and now, a reboot of Gameloft&#8217;s &#8220;Asphalt Xtreme,&#8221; which officially <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Asphalt9/comments/p6tgv7/offtopic_asphalt_xtreme_will_shut_down_by/">shut down</a> this September.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bowling Ballers&#8221; is <a href="https://twitter.com/hellofrostypop/status/1461009547447783429">another title</a> from existing Netflix gaming partner Frosty Pop, which already offers two other games for the streamer&#8217;s new service, &#8220;Shooting Hoops&#8221; and &#8220;Teeter Up.&#8221; Like the others, this latest addition is a simple game that&#8217;s described as an &#8220;endless runner&#8221; for bowling, which also includes a level-based mode. And like all Netflix games, &#8220;Bowling Ballers&#8221; is ad-free and doesn&#8217;t offer any in-app purchases.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The other new addition is a bit more interesting. &#8220;Asphalt Xtreme&#8221; was a fairly popular Gameloft title for a few years. It was the second spinoff from Gameloft&#8217;s &#8220;Asphalt&#8221; series of action racing games, and allowed players to go off-roads to explore exotic locales while controlling a variety of vehicles, including rally cars and monster trucks. The gameplay would see the cars having to traverse difficult elements like water, rocks, sand, mud, and snow.</p>
<p>The game was developed from August 2015 to September 2017, but was shut down entirely on September 30, 2021. By Oct. 1, 2021, it was no longer available on the app stores for download. Netflix then licensed the title from Gameloft to add to its mobile gaming collection.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EmPVO0j03TU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Larger gaming publishers like Gameloft tend to shut down titles that have passed their prime, and no longer generate the revenue needed to keep the game active. But a service like Netflix, it seems, could be an interesting new home for such IP, as its goal is not to develop a profit from the games directly.</p>
<p>This format of an all-access &#8220;gaming subscription&#8221; is already used by the various cloud gaming services, like Xbox Cloud Gaming or Stadia, as well as the retro gaming service <a href="https://gameclub.io/">GameClub</a>, and even Apple&#8217;s own Apple Arcade.</p>
<p>But Netflix doesn&#8217;t need the game subscription to stand on its own. Instead, Netflix sees these mobile games as a means of maintaining and growing its paying subscriber base by offering consumers a different type of entertainment beyond its TV shows and movies. Netflix subscribers can browse the available games inside Netflix&#8217;s streaming app, but the titles themselves are listed on the respective app stores as free downloads. When users are ready to play, the games require your Netflix credentials to log in &#8212; making them exclusive to Netflix members.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bowling Ballers,&#8221; which launched earlier this month, is available to global users. Netflix confirmed &#8220;Asphalt Xtreme,&#8221; which launched just this week, is now slowly rolling out to users worldwide. It will become available to U.S. users in the weeks ahead.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We need a new framework for us to use to sort private-market companies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What is a startup? It&#8217;s a question so picked over at this point that it feels like the only answer is <em>it depends</em>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s fair. In the past, we might have said that once a private-market company earns a $1 billion valuation, it is no longer a startup. But with venture capitalists and crossover investors turning an ever-increasing number of less mature startups into unicorns, that demarcation line has lost its rigidity.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>

<p>The $1 billion unicorn term has lost most of its meaning. It was once an indicator of a startup demonstrating abnormal success, the marker of a <em>positive</em> outlier to a degree that the company in question deserved the boosterish sobriquet.</p>
<p>But now, with <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies">907 unicorns out there</a>, the term really just means &#8220;startup that should have its shit together.&#8221; Which is less useful.</p>

Would that be a useful filter to apply to the startup masses, allowing us to filter out the &#8220;must pay attention tos&#8221; from the &#8220;companies heating up&#8221; and the &#8220;potential but few material results yets&#8221;? Yes, but only because there really isn&#8217;t a better option.</p>
<p>I am not the first person to noodle on this point: Dan Primack <a href="https://www.axios.com/unicorn-startup-privately-held-valued-1-billion-c64e66cb-ec22-4c68-9aaf-db7f71431704.html">decided to call</a> the group of startups worth $10 billion or more &#8220;dragons&#8221; earlier this year; Crunchbase News has a <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/decacorn-startups-2021-global-record-data-charts/">great riff on decacorns here</a> from earlier this week that we&#8217;ll cite again shortly; and the term &#8220;decacorn&#8221; is <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=decacorn">simply not new</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unicorn&#8221; has lost its heft thanks to massive rarity dilution. If we turn the clocks back to 2013, when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/">Aileen Lee wrote the post inventing the term,</a> there were fewer unicorns being created than there are decacorns today &#8212; in a nutshell, that&#8217;s how the startup game has changed in the last eight or nine years.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Lee from the past:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>We found <strong>39 companies belong to what we call the “Unicorn Club”</strong> (by our definition, U.S.-based software companies started since 2003 and valued at over $1 billion by public or private market investors). That’s <strong>about .07 percent of venture-backed consumer and enterprise software startups.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/tidal/">Tidal</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/distrokid/">DistroKid</a>, a popular independent music distributor,<a href="https://news.distrokid.com/tidal-artist-payments-95c541f08212" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> teamed up</a> last week to introduce a direct artist payments system. This partnership foreshadows a larger pivot from Tidal toward experimenting with streaming payout models that are thought to distribute funds more equitably to musicians who don&#8217;t get millions of streams on any given day (AKA, people who aren&#8217;t Taylor Swift or Lil Nas X).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re subscribed to Tidal&#8217;s HiFi Plus plan &#8212; which costs $19.99 per month &#8212; up to 10% (or about $2) of your monthly subscription fee will be distributed to your most-listened-to artist (so long as that artist uses DistroKid). That percentage shrinks if you&#8217;re paying for your subscription through a service that takes a cut, like the Apple or Google app stores. Tidal told TechCrunch that it also struck similar deals with independent distributors like CD Baby, Equity Distribution, Stem, Symphonic, Tunecore and Vydia.</p>
<p>This model is an example of a user-centric payment system (UCPS), which is generally favored by artists. As described by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/20/deezer-100/">Deezer</a>, a <a href="https://www.deezer.com/us/ucps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">streaming service</a> that uses UCPS, this system helps individual fans more directly and transparently support their favorite artists, since their subscription fee is distributed to the artists they listen to. So, let&#8217;s say you listen to a 10-track record one time on a platform that pays about one cent per stream, like <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/apple-music-artist-payment-penny-streaming-1156932/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Music</a>. Then, that artist will earn 10 cents (and that&#8217;s before distributors and publishers take their cut). But, on a UCPS platform like Deezer or SoundCloud, if you listen to 10 albums from 10 different artists in a month, then a portion of your monthly subscription fee is divided among those 10 artists, which means they&#8217;re probably getting more than 10 cents each. It&#8217;s similar to buying a CD &#8212; it&#8217;s not how often you listen to that CD, but rather, the fact that you bought it in the first place.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236885" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Tidal told TechCrunch that beyond its deals with independent distributors, a kind of UCPS will come to its HiFi Plus tier starting in January 2022. The platform says it teamed up with more than 100 labels &#8212; both major labels and independents &#8212; to develop what it calls its fan-centered royalties program.</p>

<p>Currently, major streaming platforms like Apple Music and Spotify pay pro rata, which divides a pool of money based on total streams. But the growth of music streaming services &#8212; an attempted answer to the crisis of music piracy &#8212; has been, on the whole, not great for musicians. Musicians&#8217;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-do-musicians-make-money-2018-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> primary source of revenue</a> is now touring, so when the pandemic hit and canceled a slew of concerts, the inequity of streaming payouts became even clearer.</p>
<p>Last year, the<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW)</span> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/justice-at-spotify-demands-better-compensation-and-increased-transparency-for-musicians/">launched a campaign</a> called <a href="https://www.unionofmusicians.org/justice-at-spotify" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justice at Spotify</a>, which demands the streaming giant to adopt UCPS, increase transparency about payouts and pay at least $0.01 per stream. As it stands, the platform is estimated to pay an average of $0.0038 per stream, according to the UMAW, but Spotify itself doesn&#8217;t disclose this value, saying that pay per stream is <a href="https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/?question=spotify-pay-per-stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not a meaningful value</a> to analyze.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&#8220;We applaud Tidal&#8217;s move toward a more user-centric payment system, a shift we&#8217;ve been demanding since we launched our Justice at Spotify campaign in 2020, and one already adopted by Deezer and <a href="https://routenote.com/blog/soundclouds-new-ucps-fan-powered-royalty-system-will-see-soundcloud-take-a-45-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoundCloud</a>,&#8221; said Joey DeFrancesco in a statement to TechCrunch on behalf of UMAW. &#8220;User-centric is no silver bullet, and we still desperately need more fundamental changes in streaming royalties, but it is a step in the right direction.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Comparatively, Apple Music pays <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/apple-music-artist-payment-penny-streaming-1156932/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$0.01 per stream</a> on average, per an internal memo leaked earlier this year. Tidal is thought to pay <a href="https://variety.com/2018/music/news/music-streaming-sites-fraud-1202905665/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about the same</a>, though the company itself hasn&#8217;t confirmed these numbers. But Spotify, which has the most subscribers out of the three streaming leaders, pays the least.</p>
<p>Spotify points out that it appears to pay less per stream than competitors because, according to the company, Spotify users stream more music than users on competitor platforms. Also, unlike Apple Music or Tidal, Spotify offers a free tier, subsidized through ads, which the platform says might skew its pay-per-stream metrics.</p>
<p>Streaming payouts don&#8217;t directly reach the artist &#8212; first, payouts are divided among an artist&#8217;s record labels and publishers. The amount that an individual artist will get per stream depends on their contracts in the industry. But for now, according to the UMAW, an independent artist would need to amass 283,684 Spotify streams per month to pay a monthly rent of $1,078, the U.S. national median.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Spotify took a minority stake in DistroKid in 2018, but just weeks ago, Spotify&#8217;s <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/8aac006e-c0b2-4b52-a682-d5ed53274725.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quarterly SEC filing</a> revealed that it sold two-thirds of its equity interest in the independent distributor for €144, or about $163 million. It&#8217;s interesting timing for DistroKid to immediately strike a deal with Tidal, a more musician-friendly service, to enact a version of the policies that the UMAW are demanding from Spotify.</p>
<p>But Spotify doubts how much user-centric payments would actually benefit artists. <a href="https://cnm.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20210121_UCPS_CNM_Pressrelease.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A study</a> from the National Music Center in France found that yearly payouts would fluctuate by &#8220;at most a few euros&#8221; for artists outside the top 10,000 acts.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We are willing to make the switch to a user-centric model if that’s what artists, songwriters and rights holders want to do. However, Spotify cannot make this decision on its own &#8212; it requires broad industry alignment to implement this change,&#8221; says <a href="https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/?question=user-centric-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the platform&#8217;s website</a>.</span></p>
<p>So, perhaps the model of Tidal&#8217;s deals with independent distributors &#8212; a variation of UCPS &#8212; could be more beneficial for artists. A $2 per month bonus per user for being their most-streamed artist could add up. But, industry-wide changes like these may require trial and error to determine how streaming platforms can run their businesses while also paying musicians fairly for access to their music.</p>

That said, a $2 a month bonus &#8212; only to one artist per user, and only to artists signed up via [independent distributors] &#8212; is not going to add up for too many musicians and feels gestural,&#8221; Sadie Dupuis, a UMAW member, told TechCrunch. Dupius fronts bands like Speedy Ortiz and Sad13. </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&#8220;I’d be curious to know how many self-distributed artists are the #1 most streamed artist for any subscriber per month in general. It also excludes artists with label distribution, who also need fair streaming royalties, especially when they’re splitting 50% or more of those royalties with a label. It would be great to see more of this subscription fee proportionally divvied up to more music workers, regardless of how their songs are distributed.&#8221;</span></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.K.-based digital therapy company ieso announced a $53 million Series B round on Tuesday. The round is the funding the company needs to move in a brand new direction: creating more intuitive autonomous text therapy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, AI trained on thousands of hours of real-life therapy that can provide personalized sessions, over chat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ieso has been around for about 10 years, and has been running a text-only therapy service (with human therapists on one end) through the U.K.’s National Health Service. So far, the company has provided text-based therapy for about 80,000 patients &#8212; though 6,000 are actively receiving therapy, Nigel Pitchford, ieso’s CEO told TechCrunch. That’s a total of 460,000 hours of therapy so far. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238597" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ll deliver some sort of 400 hours of therapy this evening, via our network,” said Pitchford. </span></p>
<p>This most recent round of funding was led by Morningside, with participation from Sony Innovation Fund. It also included existing investors IP Group, Molten Ventures and Ananda Impact Ventures</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, ieso is looking to take itself from a human-based therapist system, to a scaled-up autonomous system. The idea of AI-based chat therapy isn&#8217;t exactly unique in this space (we’ve covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/mental-health-app-wysa-raises-5-5m-for-emotionally-intelligent-ai/">other companies</a> pursuing this) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but the data </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">behind </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eso’s approach is what the company sees as its secret sauce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ieso’s “unfair advantage” is 10 years of real-life text-based conversations between patients and therapists, which Pitchford calls “transcripts of care.” That data set is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">paired </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with real-time data on patients&#8217; clinical outcomes, which the company has also been collecting alongside those transcripts. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ieso has built one of the most impressive data assets I have seen in the space with their text therapy data set,” said Stephen Bruso, an investment partner at Morningside. The data set is one aspect of ieso he finds most attractive as an investor, and called it &#8220;unprecedented.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This data set has been used to track how certain therapeutic conversations or techniques are linked (or not linked) to patient improvement. And, there is some evidence ieso has managed to mine that data for insight. For example, the company published </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2748757" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019 in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">JAMA Psychiatry </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyzing 90,000 hours of therapy. The paper found that aspects of therapy like “planning for the future,” or certain cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, were linked to better patient outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the data suggested that 28 minutes out of every hour of therapy contained conversations or exercises that “directly affected” the patient outcome, said Andy Blackford, the company’s group chief science and strategy officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps counterintuitively, the paper also found that therapeutic empathy was negatively associated with patient outcomes &#8212; though other research has suggested clients </span><a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/156744221.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have better outcomes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when they feel their therapists understand them. Blackford interpreted the empathy finding as evidence that empathy should be employed alongside other therapeutic techniques. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Pitchford sees this data set, and analysis like the type conducted in that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">JAMA </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper as a roadmap for how the AI-based therapists will be trained and personalized. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So essentially, we&#8217;ve been studying what the very best therapists are doing at a very high scale, and then reconstructing that, so it can reach people that are unable to access human psychotherapy delivery, which is a huge problem all over the world,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with this data set, ieso does seem to be working in an increasingly crowded space. Funding for mental health startups is anticipated to crack $3 billion in 2021, per a Q3 Silicon Valley Bank Trend report. That means there are a lot of minds focused on the problems associated with traditional therapy right now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruso sees ieso as one of the few mental health companies that can point to real-world health outcomes, at least using their own data set. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that there is a unique synergy between ieso’s digital products built on real-world data, and their ability to trial these products in their existing user base to generate outcomes data from day 1,” he said. “At the end of the day, the products that will last in the space will be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">those who can demonstrate a measurable impact on both individual health and societal outcomes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blackford is also aware of how packed this space is &#8212; in fact, he sees it as a problem for consumers. These apps, ieso’s leadership figures, are often designed for either self-help, mindfulness or patients with non-severe mental health diagnoses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though ieso can treat people with non-advanced mental health struggles, the company also has a focus on moderate-to-severe diagnoses. It’s not, to use his words, a “wellness solution” &#8212; and can be used by groups who might require more intensive care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This focus means that safeguards for self-harm need to be especially strong. Blackford says the company has risk escalation protocols in place for its human-based therapy model that have been honed over the course of 10 years as one of the largest mental health providers in the U.K. The company has plans to incorporate those programs into the autonomous therapy product in the future.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, Blackford doesn’t anticipate a harder regulatory path because it’s looking to deal with higher-stakes mental health diagnoses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The good thing is that there are precedents and predicates that we can use as we come to market. But the key thing will be about having, you know, demonstrably safe and effective products,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high volume of data the company has already collected will allow it to collect insights into efficacy and safety “many times faster” than you’d expect under regular clinical trial circumstances, Blackford argued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, ieso plans to use this round to build out its AI based therapy arm, and shore up a presence in the U.S. The team is expected to grow to about 200 people by next year, which will set up a push to go to market over in the next two years. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.stepzen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StepZen</a> stepped onto the scene at the end of last year with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/stepzen-snares-8m-seed-to-build-data-integration-api/">an $8 million seed round</a> and a vision for unifying APIs. Today that vision came into clearer focus as the company announced two new free GraphQL tools to help simplify API management.</p>
<p>StepZen CEO and co-founder Anant Jhingran sees the graph as part of what he calls &#8220;a fundamental transformation that&#8217;s taking place in how applications communicate with the back end.&#8221; As companies use increasing numbers of APIs to build software and connect systems, StepZen wants the graph to be at the center of API management, where it handles all of the various connections and dependencies between these APIs.</p>
<p>There is inherent complexity involved in crossing multiple applications to pull together all of the information about something that has interconnections. As an example, a company may want to pull all of the information about a customer together, but it lives in multiple systems. How do you see the connections between customer information, interaction data and previous orders. One of those comes from the CRM, one from marketing and customer service tools and one from an order management system.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238578" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What StepZen wants to do is simplify the act of making those connections. &#8220;The fundamental thing is that while there are individual sub-elements, the use cases really connect the dots because that&#8217;s where the real power of the business [lies],&#8221; Jhingran explained.</p>
<p>To help with that, the company is releasing two free tools today. The first is GraphQL Studio, which helps companies create a map or flow that shows the connections between the various APIs your company uses, whether internal private ones or the public SaaS variety.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it is not the case that developers only deal with private APIs. It&#8217;s not the case that developers only deal with SaaS APIs. And what we want to do is to enable both sides of the story, and our GraphQL Studio is really starting from &#8216;here are your pre-finished APIs&#8217; that you&#8217;re going to kind of pick and choose and then add your own secret sauce,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The second piece is GraphQL Federation, a tool that can take the various graphs inside an organization and can consolidate them into a single graph of graphs that lets companies see how the various pieces fit together. Being able to federate these small graphs has been a real challenge that StepZen wants to solve with this tool.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, the idea is that in a team of teams, there&#8217;s no one graph, and therefore when you look at how applications consume data, they&#8217;ve got to connect across multiple graphs and get to a unified graph. And that&#8217;s what GraphQL Federation does,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He says that the company is offering both tools for free as a starting point for developers to build connections between various APIs, and as they move into more complex use cases, they can sign up for StepZen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once people start using the tools, some of them will say, &#8216;we need to kind of modify it a bit, or we need to add our own private data,&#8217; and that&#8217;s where we want people to sign up for StepZen, but we want people to succeed on this without even signing up.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Looking for the soundtrack from your favorite Netflix show? Now, it will be easier to find thanks to an expanded <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-23/get-even-more-squid-game-bridgerton-and-money-heist-with-our-new-netflix-collaboration-and-dedicated-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnership</a> between Netflix and Spotify. The streaming music service today introduced a new &#8220;Netflix Hub&#8221; on its app, which will offer a centralized place for finding the official soundtracks, playlists and podcasts for top shows and movies on Netflix.</p>
<p>At launch, the Netflix Hub offers soundtracks and playlists from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXc3KPAjGyPdm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stranger Things</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX44eggCvVygr?si=f9b67c3380de47c7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Casa De Papel</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6lVCyaFY768wM8Xea6gTta?si=55b9325882e54b39" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Narcos: Mexico</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7ahCzrtmSSap5KaeI7dJco?si=eb6b189ada23400d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outer Banks</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3LUdxlF9Gq90Jcd9Y24ZH8?si=ou_w_CrmRuOFRgudYbT9ig&amp;dl_branch=1&amp;nd=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squid Game</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4d1XaejoQ5r4jdkV8k5SNJ?si=ILrT_4EBRjKTy7LTvRHRrA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tick, tick&#8230;Boom!</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX5Hl0iWtr5b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bridgerton</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/539jKDvQomLMWGBEkjyTWX?si=Mov_a7zMTxqb_iA2GeuTlw&amp;nd=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cowboy Bebop</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWZWf7hUnPGOw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virgin River</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX1R30zLwU9ZL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On My Block</a> and others.</p>
<p>It will also include Netflix-tied podcasts, like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1v65XLQM0QVsAk1rZlpE7y?si=NoboZsnQSqOfPxWjgNz0tw&amp;dl_branch=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Okay, Now Listen</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0e2HFBiiGl9hMjZsk4WIvW?si=TM8_sJAMTKqu85foBw_pUQ&amp;dl_branch=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netflix Is A Daily Joke</a>,<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/490u5TbLKuI10Bh98nTRim?si=mn2eHojwRUq_PzBVco0AWw&amp;dl_branch=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10/10 Would Recommend</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3hDsTlBt1o1qIizN8phRzO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You Can&#8217;t Make This Up</a> and those that delve into popular shows, like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3a2j3rZCG7cT7yVdHFrMr4?si=bCQ-kT3wREeszYgv3h6f6w&amp;dl_branch=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Crown: The Official Podcast</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/netflix-netflix_podcasts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behind the Scenes: Shadow and Bone</a>, and more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238577" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Other music and fan experiences will be a part of the new destination as well, including an enhanced <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX6IgPnyVYfHg?si=5ee0263deb8b4a4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">album</a> for the Netflix Western film, &#8220;The Harder They Fall,&#8221; which offers fans a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the soundtrack led by Jay-Z. In addition, there&#8217;s a content destination for &#8220;La Casa De Papel (Money Heist),&#8221; Part 5 Volume 2, and <a href="http://www.lacasadepapel.withspotify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a character matching experience</a> where fans get to play a game to find out which &#8220;La Casa De Papel&#8221; character they are &#8211;which feels a bit like a playing a BuzzFeed quiz.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238615" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238615" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2238615" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SpotifyxNetflix_Hub.jpg?w=580" alt="" width="580" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SpotifyxNetflix_Hub.jpg 580w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SpotifyxNetflix_Hub.jpg?resize=145,150 145w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SpotifyxNetflix_Hub.jpg?resize=290,300 290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SpotifyxNetflix_Hub.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SpotifyxNetflix_Hub.jpg?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238615" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify/Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>The hub builds on Spotify and Netflix&#8217;s existing partnership, Spotify tells TechCrunch. The two companies have worked together on many official playlists, including, most recently, the enhanced album for &#8220;The Harder They Fall,&#8221; which had been available before the Hub&#8217;s debut. They also worked on the &#8220;Money Heist&#8221; content experience and the character-matching game ahead of today&#8217;s news.</p>
<p>Netflix didn&#8217;t purchase access to have a hub on Spotify&#8217;s app. In other words, it&#8217;s not an ad product, nor did any money exchange hands here. Instead, both companies see the potential in working together to serve their respective fan bases, where there&#8217;s naturally a lot of overlap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Netflix is not the only major company to debut a thematic &#8220;hub&#8221; on Spotify&#8217;s app. Recently, Spotify and Peleton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/spotify-partners-with-peloton-to-launch-new-playlists-featured-in-its-workout-hub/">announced a similar partnership</a> that introduced a &#8220;Curated by Peloton&#8221; Workout Hub featuring playlists from Peloton instructors. And outside its app, Spotify earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/spotify-partners-with-giphy-to-connect-users-with-artists-music-via-gifs/">partnered</a> with GIPHY to introduce users to music via artists&#8217; GIFs.</p>
<p>Making some of this Netflix content exclusive to Spotify may make sense for the streamer as the other large music and podcast provider on the market, Apple (via Apple Music and Apple Podcasts), is also now a Netflix competitor through its Apple TV+ streaming service. Spotify, at least as of yet, hasn&#8217;t expanded into Netflix&#8217;s core market, which makes them better suited as partners.</p>
<p>Spotify says that it plans to roll out more exclusive content to the Netflix Hub in the months ahead.</p>
<p>The Netflix Hub will available to all users, both Free and Premium, in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., Ireland and India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than six months after raising a $157 million Series D round, AI-powered transcription and captioning platform <a href="https://verbit.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Verbit</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> announced today it has closed $250 million </span>in a Series E round that values the company at $2 billion.<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> The latest funding brings its total raised to more than $550 million.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The new capital was led by <a href="https://www.thirdpointventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Third Point Ventures</a>, with participation from existing investors Sapphire Ventures, More Capital, Disruptive AI, Vertex Growth, 40North, Samsung Next and TCP.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup will use the proceeds to invest in product development and continue its vertical and geographical expansion, CEO and founder of Verbit <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-livne-a039b365/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Livne</a> said, adding that it will also double down its acquisition strategy. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238498" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Verbit is a step closer to its planned IPO in the near future after closing the Series E, Livne said when asked regarding its listing plan.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Verbit was founded in 2017 by Livne, who previously had a career in law. Livne often found himself dissatisfied with the slow turnaround time of transcriptions but did not have the tools as a lawyer to tackle the issue head-on. He founded the AI-powered transcription and captioning platform startup: AI-driven automated transcription services coupled with professional transcribers. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Verbit raises $31M Series B to expand its transcription and captioning service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/verbit-raises-31m-series-b-to-expand-its-transcription-and-captioning-service/embed/#?secret=bbersIvVLg" data-secret="bbersIvVLg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The transcription industry, which is estimated at around $30 billion, is very fragmented, with many small mom-and-pop companies. The market is ready for consolidation, Livne told TechCrunch via email. In May, Verbit <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/verbit-announces-acquisition-of-vitac-to-become-worlds-largest-ai-powered-transcription-and-captioning-platform-301288819.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">completed its second acquisition</a>, <a href="https://vitac.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VITAC</a>, for $50 million, Livne added. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Verbit, as the leading platform, aims to be this consolidator with more than 1,000 targets in our pipeline,” Livne said. </span></p>
<p>Verbit&#8217;s automated speech recognition (ASR) technology platform offers customers word-for-word, interactive and collaborative transcripts and captions.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What makes Verbit’s platform unique is that it harnesses the power of both artificial and human intelligence to provide vertical-specific transcription and captioning, building solutions that fit each industry, Livne continued. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Since our AI is trained based on the vertical and customer at hand, our platform can build custom models that improve over time. It means Verbit’s customers are in the legal, education, media and enterprises sectors. Each has access to transcripts and captions that comply with their unique, industry-specific regulations and standards, such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and SOC II compliance,” Livne said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another major differentiator is that its model uses machine learning and natural language processing (NPL) to achieve over 99% accuracy with a turnaround time that is 10 times faster than the industry standard, according to Livne. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Verbit serves more than 2,000 customers across the media, education, corporate, legal and government sector. Its clients include CNN, Fox, Disney, Coursera, Stanford, Harvard University, Amazon, Microsoft and AT&amp;T, Livne noted. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company is growing rapidly, with 6x year-over-year revenue growth and over $100 million in annual recurring revenue, Livne continued. The company is also cash efficient and has a high customer retention rate of 163%, which are important metrics of trust by its customers, he added. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company competes with <a href="https://www.rev.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rev.com</a> and <a href="https://www.3playmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3Play Media</a> in the transcription space, he noted. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Verbit, which has a strong presence in the U.K. and Australia, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">plans to expand further into Europe, including Germany, France, Spain and others, Livne said. Those countries are compelling because Verbit sees a substantial amount of inbound interest, he added.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The market opportunity is tremendous and, given our position as an industry leader, we can penetrate these markets quickly,” Livne said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://suborbital.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suborbital</a>, the company behind the open source <a href="https://github.com/suborbital/atmo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atmo</a> WebAssembly-centric project for building scalable server applications, today announced that it has raised a $1.6 million seed round led by Amplify Partners. A number of angel investors, including Jason Warner (former CTO of GitHub), Sri Viswanath (CTO of Atlassian), Tyler McMullen (CTO of Fastly), Jonathan Beri (founder of Golioth), Vijay Gill (SVP of engineering at RapidAPI) and Mac Reddin (founder of Commsor), also joined this round.</p>
<p>In addition, the company also today announced the public beta launch of <a href="https://suborbital.dev/compute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suborbital Compute</a>. At first glance, this may seem like somewhat of an odd product. As SaaS services look to make their products extensible beyond basic drag-and-drop integrations, they need tools that allow developers to write these extensions inside of their products. But these user functions open up a lot of security issues, too. With Suborbital Compute, SaaS developers can give their end-users the ability to write their own functions and extend their products, with the sandboxing properties of WebAssembly &#8212; the basis of Atmos and Suborbital&#8217;s other open source tools &#8212; providing many of the guardrails.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s just the start. Suborbital is nothing if not an ambitious project. Its mission, CEO and founder Connor Hicks told me, is to &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">the way we as an industry think about and deploy compute.&#8221; Hicks previously worked on the 1Password platform team, where he worked on tools like the 1Password command-line interface and its enterprise products, eventually leading the company&#8217;s R&amp;D efforts around its enterprise products. But on the side, he started dabbling in building a distributed functions-as-a-service system, first based on Docker, which proved to be too slow, and then, eventually, around WebAssemly. That turned out to be more complicated than he expected, in large part because he had to write all of the glue code to make this work &#8212; but about two years ago, things started to click into place.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238412" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I started going down this path a little more seriously, started spending more time on it, and what came out of it was this scheduler for WebAssembly functions, which today is our <a href="https://github.com/suborbital/reactr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reactr project</a>,&#8221; Hicks explained. While Reactr is a Go library, people started getting interested in seeing what a pure WebAssembly service would look like, which became the Atmo project that is now at the core of Suborbital&#8217;s efforts.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The grand experiment with Atmo was, &#8216;hey, let&#8217;s see if we can take a declarative description of a web server application and figure out how to run it without the user needing to do any boilerplate,&#8221; Hicks explained. &#8220;So we could take this declarative description &#8212; and a bunch of functions &#8212; compile the WebAssembly and we could figure out how to build this web service and make it run, and make it secure, and make it fast automatically, and the user didn&#8217;t have to worry about any of the plumbing.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Atmo, Suborbital is betting on server-side WebAssembly to allow developers to write code in a language like Rust, Swift or AssemblyScript, which is then compiled to WebAssembly and <a href="https://atmo.suborbital.dev/more-info/background" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deployed and managed</a> by Atmo and run in a sandboxed environment. At the core of Atmo is a scheduler that runs the WebAssembly modules and promises to do so with near-native performance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, Hicks believes, this approach could challenge the role of containers for deploying many applications, especially at the edge. &#8220;We think that WebAssembly on bare metal is going to pretty much replace the need for containers in these small, resource-constrained edge environments,&#8221; Hicks said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why then launch with such a niche product? Something like an &#8220;Atmo Pro&#8221; may seem like the more logical choice, but Hicks argues that it is still too early for that. Because the idea is still very new, the market wouldn&#8217;t have been there for a service like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t have the widespread adoption that you would need to make money off of a hosted Atmo service,&#8221; Hicks said.&#8221;After realizing that I couldn&#8217;t just make money selling a pro version of Atmo &#8212; or a hosted version of Atmo &#8212; I went back and I asked, &#8216;hey, what could we actually build that people would want to pay money for and actually build a business around?'&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Hicks tells me that the team, which currently consists of four people, has already started to ramp up its efforts around partnerships, but next year, it plans to really scale up its infrastructure and operations capabilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India plans to introduce, evaluate and enforce a bill to prohibit &#8220;all private cryptocurrencies&#8221; in the country, according to a legislative agenda for the winter session.</p>
<p>The Indian government said Tuesday evening that the proposed law will permit &#8220;certain exceptions&#8221; to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its applications.</p>
<p>The bill &#8212; called Cryptocurrency &amp; Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2021 &#8212; will also create a &#8220;facilitative framework&#8221; for the creation of the official digital currency for the country, the legislative agenda adds.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238593" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out that the description of the bill is identical to the one New Delhi listed for the previous parliamentary session earlier this year. The winter session of the parliament starts November 29.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in India have for several quarters been discussing risks of cryptocurrency trading and trialing a central government-backed digital currency.</p>
<p>An increasingly growing number of Indians, many of whom have never invested in the stock market or any other asset class, have started to trade cryptocurrencies in recent quarters, prompting concerns among some that they might end up losing their money.</p>
<p>Local cryptocurrency exchanges have reported growing volumes of transactions and user bases this year and raised record capital from high-profile investors. CoinDCX, backed by B Capital, and CoinSwitch Kuber, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/a16z-coinbase-coinswitch-kuber-first-india-investment/">backed by a16z and Coinbase Ventures</a>, became unicorns this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>India&#8217;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and several other lawmakers as well as several industry stakeholders have held several meetings in recent quarters to discuss the cryptocurrency space and some of the recent developments.</p>
<p>At least one top Indian minister recently held conversations with a prominent venture capitalist and suggested that India is likely to formulate a law that will support innovation following China&#8217;s decision to ban cryptocurrency trading and mining, according to a source directly familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Many lawmakers, in the meanwhile, have also expressed concerns about the nature of ads carried by cryptocurrency exchanges. A consensus was reached in that meeting that these &#8220;irresponsible advertisements&#8221;, which promised wild profits to consumers by investing in crypto, were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/13/india-eyes-prohibiting-irresponsible-cryptocurrency-ads/">misleading youths in the nation and must be stopped</a>, TechCrunch reported earlier.</p>
<p>Several Bollywood stars, including legendary Amitabh Bachchan, Ayushmann Khurrana and Ranveer Singh, who have starred in several of the country’s biggest blockbusters, have promoted cryptocurrency trading in TV and newspaper ads.</p>
<p>Lawmakers have also expressed concerns around potential misuse of using crypto trading vehicles for laundering money and financing terrorism efforts.</p>
<p>Shaktikanta Das, governor of the central bank Reserve Bank of India, said last week that the country needs to have much deeper discussions on the issue of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the central bank says that we have serious concerns from the point of view of macroeconomic and financial stability, there are far deeper issues involved,&#8221; Das said at an event. &#8220;I&#8217;m yet to see serious, well-informed discussions in the public space on these issues.&#8221;</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">You’ve likely heard of the “creator economy” already — it’s no longer a new concept, although some people are more acquainted with what it entails than others. But the creator economy needs creators. It says so right there on the label.</p>
<p>Essentially, what we call the creator economy encompasses two groups. The first is a large, decentralized and amorphous group of predominantly independent creatives connected to the digital sphere in one way or another. This includes musicians, visual artists, filmmakers, graphic designers, bloggers and influencers. The second is the companies and platforms that provide the tools that enable this creation, and, by extension, distribution and monetization.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237890" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the creator economy’s business side is fundamentally digital, and thus the domain of the tech industry. This has made it easier than ever for independent creators to make a living through their work.</p>
<p>It has also, rather remarkably, kick-started the long overdue unraveling of the superstar model — the old-school way of doing entertainment business in which a small cohort of famous stars made content for everyone, and that was it. That’s not to say subcultures haven’t flourished for decades — they have — but they’ve never made the bulk of the cash.</p>
<p>The creator economy and creator tech sprung up relatively organically. The shift was initially enabled by virality and audience access through newfangled social media channels, but creator tech is now a world unto itself. As such, its very survival depends on the continuation of this slide away from the superstar model.</p>
<h2>Kicking holes into the superstar model</h2>
<p>In a July 16 letter to shareholders, Netflix <a href="https://qz.com/1881983/netflix-says-tiktok-is-now-a-major-competitor/">acknowledged</a> TikTok as a real competitor, going so far as to note its “astounding” growth. One could even argue that Netflix’s initial begrudging acknowledgment of TikTok’s competitive edge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/netflixs-latest-experiment-is-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">happened last year</a> when the platform launched Fast Laughs, a copycat video feed with short clips culled from its comedy catalog.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regardless, Netflix has long hitched its wagon to superstars: Zac Efron travels the globe, Paris Hilton cooks, every household-name comedian has at least one special, and original movies and series net the likes of Timothée Chalamet, Jane Fonda, Sandra Oh and Anthony Hopkins, to name but a few. It’s the old guard.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the biggest stars on TikTok are not “stars” at all, but regular people who happened to be funny or clever or incisive and garnered an audience based on the luck of the algorithm and their creativity alone. They’re not names everyone knows, but many creators have found their niche and a dedicated following. They’re the new guard, and they’re siphoning off precious attention and viewership.</p>
<p>There are no “tentpoles” in the creator economy, a term used to describe a given studio’s big-budget blockbuster that does so well it secures the financial health of the studio itself. This also applies to major labels: Most albums hardly recoup the costs required to make them, but then Adele comes along, drops a record, and pays for all those records that didn’t recoup and then some.</p>
<p>Not so in the creator economy. Yes, TikTok has minted its own type of stars like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@khaby.lame?">Khaby Lame</a>, whose hilarious exasperation at overcomplicated life hacks catapulted him to global fame — <a href="https://twitter.com/Meta/status/1454499897151934464?s=20">he’s now shilling for Meta</a>.</p>
<p>But people who follow Khaby Lame don’t open the app, watch his latest video, then close it. (The algorithm is specifically designed so you don’t do this, but that’s a different story.) They also follow any number of smaller creators <em>in addition to</em> those stars, and the majority of the videos they watch are just statistically bound to be made by creators who are not internationally famous.</p>
<p>Smaller creators finding niche success and devoted audiences are changing everything, and creator tech is rising to meet their needs in real time. This is where creator welfare comes in — and why sustaining it must be paramount.</p>
<h2>Good ethics = good business</h2>
<p>It’s easy to frame the creator payment question as a purely ethical one. But that’s a well-trod argument. Obviously, artists should be paid well for their work. So let’s look at it a different way.</p>
<p>For creator economy tech platforms, fair compensation for smaller creators must be the heart of our business models. Doing so is crucial to our sustainability as platforms and companies. It shores up demand for our platforms by drawing creators to our platforms and retaining them.</p>
<p>It’s also realistic. It’s not the &#8217;90s, and there are no tentpoles in this game. Creator tech needs creator numbers. Large numbers of small creators form the very demand that creator tech relies on.</p>
<p>Creator tech must go all-in on supporting smaller creators. Without supporting small creators and fair payouts, and without continually improving platforms that connect creators to sponsorship and patronage opportunities, all the progress made against the superstar model will be for naught. Creator tech will shoot itself in the foot.</p>
<p>Business plans in which shareholders reap returns that dwarf those of the creators themselves are neither admirable nor sustainable, particularly in a climate with so much audience demand and willingness to pay. Algorithms that punish content creators for taking a day off are ridiculous and need to go. It’s high time for an overhaul of these models and the companies that use them.</p>
<p>Creator tech should continue to embrace and innovate on modern patronage. Creator tech is already fostering a competitive market of patron platforms that cater to specific creators’ needs and, in certain cases, connect brands with creators for profitable partnerships.</p>
<p>Substack is changing the game for freelance writers. Patreon bills itself as ideal for creators of all types, but it’s the unofficial go-to for podcasters. The platforms offering the most &#8212; the most money, the most visibility, the most opportunities, the most accessibility &#8212; will win.</p>
<p>Continued innovation in terms of licensing, distribution and blockchain certification is as good for artist welfare as it will be for the companies that enable these innovations. How can art auction platforms migrate beyond the legacy galleries and toward the people? Digital music, footage and image licensing is only accelerating and represents an important link within the creator economy among, for instance, video content creators, photographers and songwriters.</p>
<p>In colder terms, there’s money to be made, and no one has to be exploited in the process.</p>
<h2>Investing in smaller creators is good for the economic gander</h2>
<p>In the age of the individual creator, creator tech’s responsibility to the creators themselves is as much an ethical position as it is one of self-preservation. (No creator tech without a full thriving ecosystem of smaller creators, to err on the side of the obvious.) The superstar economy is ceding ground to independent creators with dedicated followings scattered across platforms and mediums.</p>
<p>If the creator economy is to thrive, the creators must thrive first. Patrons must come from unexpected places and the bottom up. Audiences must be easier to access. Creator tech can’t take the lion’s share and leave pennies for the creators. In other words, creator tech’s success is inextricable from creator success.</p>
<p>Tech has a bad habit of thinking its fate isn’t tied up with that of its users. From a purely business standpoint, creator tech shouldn’t make this mistake. From an ethical one, it will be glad it didn’t.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Travel and tourism are slowly starting to move again in the wake of COVID-19 crashing over the world and sending us to shelter in place. Today a company focused on experiences &#8212; museum visits, skydiving, local cooking classes and more &#8212; is announcing a round of growth funding on the back of seeing its own business bounce back. <a href="https://www.peek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peek</a>, which provides both a marketplace for consumers to discover and book experiences, a platform for businesses to book team building and other internal events, and tech for tourism companies to digitize, manage and run their own experience businesses online &#8212; &#8220;like a Shopify for experiences,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Ruzwana Bashir said &#8212; has raised $80 million. It plans to use the funds to continue expanding its product, hiring more talent, and taking Peek to more places, after passing some $2 billion in bookings from some 35 million customers, mostly in North America.</p>
<p>The round, a Series C, is notable in part because of who is behind it: the funding is being led by WestCap &#8212; the investment firm founded by another major player in the business of travel, the former CFO of Airbnb, Laurence Tosi. New investor Goldman Sachs Asset Management is also in the round, along with 3L, Cathay Innovation, I2BF Global Ventures, Manta Ray and Apeiron. Other high profile past backers include Jack Dorsey, Eric Schmidt, and Kayak founder Paul English.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based Peek is not disclosing its valuation, but Bashir told us the figure &#8220;has increased substantially because we grew the business a lot and hit profitability this year.&#8221; Peek has now raised over $100 million in the last 10 years.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238544" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Now that we are starting to invest again, we are going into investment mode,&#8221; she added. Worth pointing out, too, that this round was originally pitched to me as a $60 million investment, and then it grew by $20 million just days ago, which speaks also to the confidence investors currently have in the travel and tourism space.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a big shift from a year ago, when travel-related companies were regrouping and trying to figure out how to continue weathering what had turned out to be a very long storm. Many of them had gone into the summer of 2020 hopeful that the pandemic (which really kicked off earlier in the year) would have subsided and led to a wave of exuberant movement in the warmer months, only to find any bounce short-lived. One of the more well-capitalized of the travel experience startups &#8212; Berlin&#8217;s GetYourGuide, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/getyourguide-picks-up-484m-passes-25m-tickets-sold-through-its-tourism-activity-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at over $1 billion</a> just 6 months before Covid-19 first started appearing &#8212; found itself raising first a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/getyourguide-closes-133m-convertible-note-as-travel-startups-continue-to-weather-the-covid-19-storm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big convertible note</a>, and then a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/travel-startup-getyourguide-secures-97m-revolving-credit-facility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big credit facility</a>, as it shored up its business as the pandemic wore on.</p>
<p>Peek was also not immune. When COVID-19 hit, &#8220;it was pretty terrifying for us. We were growing great and then, all of the sudden, bookings crashed,&#8221; Bashir, who co-founded the company with Oskar Bruening (pictured, below) said. &#8220;We then did all the hard things.&#8221; That included Peek laying off 30% of its staff to help it get through the slump.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238586" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238586" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2238586 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OskarBruening_RuzwanaBashir_Peek.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="496" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OskarBruening_RuzwanaBashir_Peek.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OskarBruening_RuzwanaBashir_Peek.jpeg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OskarBruening_RuzwanaBashir_Peek.jpeg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OskarBruening_RuzwanaBashir_Peek.jpeg?resize=768,561 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OskarBruening_RuzwanaBashir_Peek.jpeg?resize=680,496 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OskarBruening_RuzwanaBashir_Peek.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238586" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Peek</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Peek also took to the offensive, thinking of how it could work differently with its customers on both sides of the business. With end users, it doubled down on virtual experiences (for example, online cooking classes); and rethinking and expanding who &#8220;customers&#8221; could be by building out experiences booking for corporate and internal events.</p>
<p>But the real key sounds like how it rethought that it worked with experience providers, where it helped them get their own emergency loans, and it equipped them with the tools to work within the &#8220;new normal&#8221; by helping them shift to focusing more on local activities for local people rather than tourists; and providing them with more software and functionality to run those businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the operating system for those merchants,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2238589" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peek.com_Homepage.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>It turned out to be the right move: it meant that as those businesses picked up in activity, so did Peek, which found itself turning profitable in the midst of the pandemic. Software currently accounts for &#8220;the majority&#8221; of Peek&#8217;s business, she said, although that could well change over the next year as consumer travel starts to rebound and that brings more activity to Peek&#8217;s own marketplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a lot of opportunity, $1 trillion in gross merchandise value, and still a lot of businesses haven’t made the leap online,&#8221; he said. Many of the experiences customers were previously using pen, paper, phone calls, and managing through spreadsheets, she said, &#8220;but [now] you can’t connect with customers now before you connect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Activities that Peek covers range from wine tours and watersports to skydiving and art classes, while Peek Pro, as the B2B2C product is called, offers tech to enable online booking, point-of-sale services, and &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of automations covering things like inventory management, dynamic pricing, waivers, and marketing analytics. Peek says that it has &#8216;thousands&#8217; customers, including businesses like the Museum of Ice Cream, Color Factory, Artechouse (the experiential art venues) and Pennekamp State Park.</p>
<p>Some of those businesses, without a doubt, target younger adults and thus were already pretty digitally savvy to begin with, but more generally Bashir believes that Peek&#8217;s success in building B2B2C tech for experiences companies is part of the bigger trend in the world of business software specifically for offline businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;People underestimate what happened in offline. There was a leap forward in e-commerce,&#8221; she said of the story that&#8217;s often told about the impact Covid-19 had on businesses that were already online. But offline businesses were faced with needing to suddenly make what she calls &#8220;a ten-year leap&#8221; to catch up. Peek is part of the battalion of tech companies have rushed to fill that void for various other use cases, such as building software for restaurants, or building logistics or curbside pickup for brick-and-mortar retailers.</p>
<p>“We have been early adopters and investors in travel technology companies, and have been following Peek.com for years,” said Tosi of WestCap, in a statement. “Ruzwana Bashir is a dynamic leader and Peek.com’s unique approach has allowed them to serve millions of people. This is a transformative solution that will allow a wider audience of travelers and locals to have meaningful experiences, and for activity operators to grow their businesses.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin has announced its next human spaceflight: A six-person launch set for December 9. This is the first time that Blue Origin is flying a full complement of six passengers on its New Shepard reusable rocket and capsule, and the group going on this trip includes Good Morning America co-host Michael Strahan; rocket namesake Alan Shepard&#8217;s daughter Laura Shepard Churchley; Voyager Space CEO Dylan Taylor; Dick Holdings managing member Evan Dick; and father and child pair Lane Bess and Cameron Bess.</p>
<p>In keeping with Blue Origin&#8217;s penchant for notching historic firsts with its human spaceflight missions, this will be the first time a parent and child make the trip to space together. Lane Bess, the Principal and Fonder of Bess Ventures, will be accompanied by Cameron Bess, a content creator and software developer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238570" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ns19-crew-collage.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238570" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2238570" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ns19-crew-collage.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="785" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ns19-crew-collage.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ns19-crew-collage.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ns19-crew-collage.jpg?resize=300,230 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ns19-crew-collage.jpg?resize=768,589 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ns19-crew-collage.jpg?resize=680,521 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ns19-crew-collage.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2238570" class="wp-caption-text">Upper L to R: Lane Bess, Cameron Bess, Evan Dick; Lower L to R: Dylan Taylor, Laura Shepard Churchley, Michael Strahan</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238567" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This will be Blue Origin&#8217;s third human spaceflight ever, and also the third this year. New Shepard previously flew two crews of four people each, first with a manifest that included Blue Origin and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and then just in October it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-launches-4-person-crew-including-william-shatner-to-space/"> sent up William Shatner,</a> along with Blue Origin&#8217;s Audrey Powers, DCVC partner Chris Boshuizen, and Medidata co-founder Glen de Vries, who tragically passed away in an airplane accident just weeks later.</p>
<p>The pace that Blue Origin is hitting with these launches is impressive, especially given the likely price tags for each ticket. With six person flights, the company is likely improving its margins which may lead to slightly more affordable seats for those going up, but it&#8217;s still bound to be an extreme luxury.</p>
<p>Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard flies its passengers to the edge of space, staying sub-orbital but providing them with a few minutes of weightlessness and unparalleled views of Earth, before the capsule returns slowed by parachutes to a landing in the West Texas desert.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitrise is meant to support developers who are busy running processes rather than creating new value for customers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more of the world shifts to doing everything from their smartphones, the ability to build better iOS and Android apps has to move with it. <a href="https://www.bitrise.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitrise</a> aims to be the go-to company closing the gap between that mobile demand and a company’s ability to get apps out faster while also balancing all of the moving parts and complexities.</p>
<p>Today, mobile DevOps company Bitrise announced it secured $60 million in Series C funding, led by Insight Partners, with participation from existing investors Partech, Open Ocean, Zobito, Fiedler Capital and Y Combinator.</p>
<p>The remote-first company was co-founded by Barnabas Birmacher, Daniel Balla and Viktor Benei in October 2014. Between then and now, we reported on their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/bitrise-raises-3-2m-a-led-by-openocean-to-attack-the-complexity-of-building-apps/">$3.2 million Series A</a> round back in 2017, but it also raised <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190619005574/en/Bitrise-Raises-20M-Series-B-to-Transform-the-Way-You-Build-and-Operate-Mobile-Apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$20 million in Series B funding</a> in 2019. The new raise was planned and executed in a few weeks, bringing Bitrise’s total funding to nearly $100 million, CEO Birmacher told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238105" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Two years ago, the company, headquartered in Budapest, went through Y Combinator’s Growth Program to scale its company, and has now tripled its headcount and opened offices in London, San Francisco, Boston and Osaka.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bitrise raises $3.2M A led by OpenOcean to attack the complexity of building apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/bitrise-raises-3-2m-a-led-by-openocean-to-attack-the-complexity-of-building-apps/embed/#?secret=tz5W48c6kh" data-secret="tz5W48c6kh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Mobile made two or three years of advancement in the last 12 months,” Birmacher said. “This means companies have to use mobile to stay competitive, but how they are developing mobile is getting more complex.”</p>
<p>Developers are busy running processes so they can’t concentrate fully on creating new value for customers, he added.</p>
<p>Bitrise aims to create an end-to-end platform for mobile development that automates core workflows, shortens release cycles and provides better understanding of how new pieces of code will affect live apps before their release, so companies can focus on getting out the next big release to customers.</p>
<p>To date, the company has over 100,000 developers using it from more than 6,000 mobile organizations. It is doubling its revenue year over year and plans to increase its employees to 300 across its engineering, product, sales and growth teams.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to hiring, the new capital will enable Bitrise to expand its product so that developers can more easily operate in the continuous integration and delivery space and have better observability into the full DevOps lifecycle.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Josh Zelman, vice president at Insight Partners, will join Bitrise’s board, while Matt Koran, also vice president at Insight, will act as a board observer.</p>
<p>“Bitrise has been building towards the current moment in mobile since its launch eight years ago,” Zelman said in a written statement. “Mobile has become a primary means of communication, entertainment and commerce for people around the world, and Bitrise has enabled enterprises to keep up with mobile innovation at an ever-increasing pace. Bitrise was purpose-built for mobile, and the company has become a leader in the mobile DevOps space.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Klarna has doubled its customer base in the United States to over 21 million customers. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. consumers now have the choice to use Klarna’s “Pay Now” service to pay immediately and in full at any online retailer where Klarna is available.</p>
<p>This adds to the global retail bank, payments and shopping giant’s stateside offerings, where Klarna has doubled its customer base to more than 21 million customers.</p>
<p>In addition to Pay Now, Klarna will be introducing its Klarna Card to U.S. customers, which will enable them to make interest-free payments in four installments using a physical card format, either in stores or online. It works with the Klarna app and also can be added to Apple Pay and Google Pay.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238362" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>U.S. users were already able to use Klarna’s Express button for a seamless checkout, now live at Macy’s and Coach, and its subscription service, a first-of-its-kind tool for paying subscriptions and memberships in four, interest-free payments. Klarna works with over 250,000 retail partners.</p>
<p>Launching these services in the U.S. is a natural extension of what the company has already experienced in its other markets, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. For Klarna, Europe’s volume of Pay Now represents 50%, he added.</p>
<p>“We are super excited to launch a card in the U.S.,” he said. “As we have seen in other markets, we want people to use Klarna everywhere. Some will occasionally use Klarna on websites and the app, but when you give them a piece of plastic, they are also highly appreciative and people love it.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though <a href="https://www.similartech.com/compare/klarna-vs-paypal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behind in market share</a> versus competitors like PayPal, Klarna’s approach as a way to pay online and its share of checkout is providing some competition. Merchants are telling Klarna that its share of checkout is steadily growing after being in the U.S. market for just two years, Siemiatkowski said.</p>
<p>“It feels like a good opportunity to give them a good challenge,” he added.</p>
<p>This latest offering follows a number of updates the company made recently, including <a href="https://www.klarna.com/us/blog/the-future-of-shopping-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releasing its super app</a> earlier this month to provide one app for the entire customer journey from discovery to returns.</p>
<p>And, in October, Klarna <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/klarna-travel-inspirock-acquisition/">acquired Inspirock</a>, an online trip planner using artificial intelligence and local expertise, to add a travel agent component for Klarna’s 90 million users.</p>
<p>While discussing the Inspirock acquisition, David Sandstrom, Klarna CMO, said the super app was an opportunity to bring capabilities seen in other countries, like China, to the Western world and connect a lot of pain points for consumers.</p>
<p>“With the app, we took a look at what more problems beyond payments could we do,” Sandstrom added. “Moving into the space, the online shopping journey is typically spread out to 20 different apps, one each for processes like discovery, payment and return management. The super app is a framework to launch features at mass scale. We can now continuously launch products into the app, and will eventually open it up to third parties.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Mosaic Foods is removing the "taste" excuse from trying plant-based foods by providing delicious frozen meals that come ready to eat.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mosaicfoods.com/">Mosaic Foods</a>, a plant-based food company, announced Tuesday $6 million in seed funding as it continues to develop more products.</p>
<p>The New York-based company came onto the food scene in 2019, co-founded by Matt Davis and Sam McIntire, with its line of frozen veggie bowls that includes recipes like peanut tofu bowl and butternut squash and sage pasta.</p>
<p>Prior to Mosaic, Davis, CEO, and McIntire, CRO, worked with each other at Bain &amp; Co. They realized that to eat better and adopt a plant-based diet, it takes some work, especially to find flavorful dishes that won’t make you miss meat.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238089" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At the core of Mosaic Foods, the co-founders believe that we should all be eating more plants and less meat. However, the excuse they heard most often was lack of taste as a reason not to go plant-based.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238093" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238093" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2238093" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg" alt="Matt Davis, Sam McIntire, Mosaic Foods" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg 5287w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Sam-Co-Founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238093" class="wp-caption-text">Mosaic Foods co-founders Matt Davis and Sam McIntire. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mosaic Foods</p></div></p>
<p>“If we take the excuse out of eating more plants and make it delicious, people will look forward to eating more plants, and it will have a huge impact,” McIntire told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We want to make eating plant-based as easy as ordering takeout,” Davis added. “We ended up cooking our own favorite recipes, and the first six dishes came out of our own kitchen.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s how Mosaic works: choose a meal plan — eight or 12 meals, with the flexibility to skip or cancel; select from the breakfast, lunch and dinner options; you will receive the fast-frozen items to store in your freezer; and it comes with instructions for no chopping, cooking or cleanup. Meals cost, on average, $4.99 per serving.</p>
<p>Two years after launching, the company has gone from six to 50 products, grown 15 times in revenue, opened a 16,000-square-foot kitchen in New Jersey and expanded shipping to California. It has also expanded its product line to include oat bowls, soups and family meals, while also starting Mosaic+, a curated collection of meals created in partnership with top chefs and food personalities.</p>
<p>Gather Ventures led the seed round and was joined by Greycroft and Alleycorp. The latest investment brings Mosaic’s total funding to about $10 million.</p>
<p>“We knew working with Adam (Slutsky) would be going after a huge opportunity,” Davis said. “By raising capital, we would be able to affect more lives faster.”</p>

<p>Slutsky, co-founder of Moviefone, former CEO of Mimeo.com and former president of Tough Mudder, founded Gather in 2019 and only invests in plant-based companies.</p>
<p>The sector is a personal one for him — he was diagnosed with heart disease at 42 years old and had to change his diet. Slutsky’s investment strategy is very hands-on, so he invests in about four companies per year.</p>
<p>“I am a big believer in this as the world moved from convenience to now health, environment and other ethical issues,” he said. “If you can do it for a price point, it makes sense, and these guys are it.”</p>
<p>The company now has 40 employees and is covering approximately 50% of the country, mainly on the eastern seaboard (but most recently added California in July). It is also on track to hit 1 million meals sold by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to build on the team already in place, invest in infrastructure, which involves continuing to own and operate its own kitchens, and launch new products. The co-founders expect to be selling via other channels, in addition to DTC, by this time next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more companies adopt low-code/no-code tools to build their line-of-business applications, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that we are now seeing a new crop of services in this ecosystem that focus on keeping these tools secure. These include Tel Aviv-based <a href="https://zenity.io/">Zenity</a>, which is coming out of stealth today and announcing a $5 million seed funding round. The round was led by Vertex Ventures and UpWest. A number of angel investors, including the former CISO of Google, Gerhard Eschelbeck, and the former CIO of SuccessFactors, Tom Fisher, also participated in this round.</p>
<p>Zenity argues that as employees start building their own applications and adopt tools like robotic process automation (RPA), this new class of applications also opens up new avenues for potential breaches and ransomware attacks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238410" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zenity-Logo.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238410" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2238410" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zenity-Logo.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="75" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zenity-Logo.png 1147w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zenity-Logo.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zenity-Logo.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zenity-Logo.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zenity-Logo.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zenity-Logo.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2238410" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zenity</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238381" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Companies are heavily adopting Low-Code/No-Code, without realizing the risks it employs nor their part in the shared responsibility model,&#8221; said Zenity co-founder and CEO Ben Kliger. &#8220;We empower CIOs and CISOs to seamlessly govern their Low-Code/No-Code applications and prevent unintentional data leaks, disturbance to business continuity, compliance risks or malicious breaches.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Zenity platform helps businesses build a catalog of low-code/no-code apps in their organization, mitigate potential issues and set up a governance policy for their organization that can then be automatically enforced. The company argues that the methods of traditional security services don&#8217;t transfer to low-code/no-code applications, yet the need for a tool like this is only growing, especially given that most of the developers that use don&#8217;t have a security background (or maybe any software development background at all).</p>
<p>The company was founded by CEO Kliger and CTO Michael Bargury, who both previously worked on the Azure and cloud security teams at Microsoft.</p>
<p>“The challenge is mitigating the risks and security threats associated with Low-Code/No- Code solutions without disturbing the business,” said Tom Fisher, Zenity advisor and former CIO of Oracle, Qualcomm, CTO of eBay. “Zenity provides the perfect combination of governance and security tools with a pro-business approach that helps business developers build with confidence.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
