										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three of the popular retail stock market trading apps that have hosted much of the activity related to the Wall Street Bets subreddit-spurred run on stocks including GameStop (GME) and AMC, among others, have removed all restrictions on their exchange by their users. M1, Webull and Public had restricted transactions for the affected stocks earlier in the day, along with Robinhood.</p>
<p>M1, Webull and Public all attributed the restrictions placed on these volatile stocks not to any effort to curb their purchase or sale, but instead cited the costs associated with settling the trades on the part of their clearing firm, Apex. All three platforms employ Apex to clear trades made by users via their platform. In an interview with Webull CEO Anthony Denier, Yahoo Finance confirmed that the restriction was not something the company had any hand in deciding.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: The CEO of Webull tell us the decision to join Robinhood in restricting AMC and GameStop trades came from soaring costs to settle its users trades:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&quot;It wasn&#39;t our choice &#8230; this has to do with settlement mechanics in the market.&quot;<a href="https://t.co/Micz5U6SRc">pic.twitter.com/Micz5U6SRc</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Public confirmed via Twitter that users can now buy and sell GME and AMC and KOSS on the platform, thanks to the resolution of the Apex blocker. Meanwhile Webull noted that all three stocks are now also available for exchange via their app, as <a href="https://twitter.com/M1_Finance/status/1354881668843188226?s=20">did M1 shortly after</a>. Other platforms like SoFi so far haven&#8217;t restricted the stocks, <a href="https://twitter.com/anthonynoto/status/1354879252303286273">CEO Anthony Noto confirmed on Twitter</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Our clearing firm, Apex, has resumed the ability to buy <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$GME</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$AMC</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24KOSS&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$KOSS</a> on Public. We appreciate their cooperation and are grateful to our members for their patience and understanding.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Robinhood earlier <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/keeping-customers-informed-through-market-volatility">issued a blog post</a> noting that it is restricting a number of stocks tied to the r/WallStreetBets action to counter short seller hedge funds, arguing that it&#8217;s doing so in the best interest of users. This has not seemed to have been much appreciated by most users, based on the reaction on social media to that action thus far. Robinhood at no time references any technical barriers imposed by any clearing house.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">2021 is going to be another glorious year for e-commerce.</p>
<p>It is that time of the year when most of us are looking back at the &#8220;total addressable market&#8221; estimates to plan for specific campaigns. Unlike us, if you had your 2021 kick off in Q3, bless your soul. You are an enlightened being.</p>
<p>For the rest of you, for whom e-commerce is a strategic market, I have a question — have you built your total addressable market (TAM) and serviceable addressable market (SAM) estimates for 2021 considering how things evolved in 2020?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			It&#8217;s important to understand the underlying business model dynamics of companies and visualize TAM from those perspectives.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For most of us, research is a mind-numbing, repetitive exercise of clicking through links on Google until they all turn purple — at which point we start seeking the simplest possible explanation. For e-commerce, addressable market estimates come in the form of headlines from platforms like Shopify. The company quotes a merchant count number in its earnings calls and that becomes the basis for guesstimating the current TAM of e-commerce companies.</p>
<p>The other, rather simplistic approach is to look at the user-base count from several databases that publish tech platform-level user stats.</p>
<p>In reality, the simplest answer is not the right answer.</p>
<h2>Mind the gap</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s take e-commerce shopping cart installations. Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, BigCommerce and others publish installation numbers that run into millions.</p>
<p>Here is the dichotomy that should frame your TAM discussions.</p>
<p>E-commerce is long-tail heavy. Yes, there are millions of merchants, but e-commerce revenue is a fat-tail phenomenon — meaning, a disproportionate amount of e-commerce revenue comes from a few tens of thousands of companies.</p>
<p>PipeCandy publishes bottom-up <a href="https://pipecandy.com/RESEARCHer/">TAM estimates </a> with detailed data cuts by technology, logistics and payment system adoptions by firms across revenue tiers across all major markets. One of the common misconceptions we see in how firms misinterpret TAM estimates is that they equate revenue to spend potential.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinbase plans to go public by way of a direct listing, the company <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-announces-proposed-direct-listing-3a52c4298ccc">announced</a> in a blog post today.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency exchange was founded in 2012 and allows users to buy and trade decentralized tokens like bitcoin and ethereum. The company has raised over $540 million in funding as a private company.</p>
<p>Last month, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">shared that it had confidentially filed an S-1 with the SEC</a>, we still haven&#8217;t seen those financials but we now know that they have opted out of the traditional IPO process. Direct listings have been slowly gaining popularity and given some of the most recent first day pops from tech IPOs, it&#8217;s unsurprising to see a company like Coinbase which is likely flush with cash thanks to recent gains in the cryptocurrency market opt for a path to public markets that involves less fuss.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Direct listings allow companies to skip much of the heavy-lifting of the IPO process by stripping the public debut of a release of new shares, instead giving existing shareholders like VCs and employees a path to just liquidate their equity in the company.</p>
<p>This has been one of the friendliest IPO windows for tech stocks ever with investors racing to back technology companies that are primed for what&#8217;s been called the &#8220;digital transformation.&#8221; Coinbase is in a pretty favorable spot with the public markets and cryptocurrency markets aligned in frothiness. Bitcoin is currently trading near $33,000 just weeks after reaching on all-time-high.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-in-talks-to-combine-with-spac-or-raise-money-privately-11611857306">new report</a> in the WSJ, WeWork, the co-working juggernaut that saw its attempt at a public offering blow up in spectacular fashion in the fall of 2019, might become a publicly traded company by merging with a blank-check company.</p>
<p>Specifically, says the WSJ, the New York-based outfit has been &#8220;weighing offers from a SPAC affiliated with Bow Capital Management LLC and at least one other unidentified acquisition vehicle for several weeks&#8221; in a deal that could value WeWork at around $10 billion.</p>
<p>Asked for more information, a spokesperson for the company sent us the same statement that was sent to the Journal: &#8220;Over the past year, WeWork has remained focused on executing our plans for achieving profitability. Our significant progress combined with the increased market demand for flexible space, shows positive signs for our business. We will continue to explore opportunities that help us move closer toward our goals.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is also contemplating inbound interest for more private funding, according to a person close to the company.</p>
<p>According to the WeWork spokesperson, WeWork has more than $3.6 billion of cash and unfunded cash commitments, including more than $875 million in available cash and it believes this is &#8220;more than sufficient liquidity to weather a prolonged COVID environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>WeWork&#8217;s CEO Sandeep Mathrani said last fall that WeWork was on track to turn profitable some time this year and that after it hit &#8220;profitable growth first,&#8221; it would &#8220;revisit the IPO plan.&#8221; Speaking to reporters in India over a Zoom call from New York, he added, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-29/wework-s-new-ceo-is-eyeing-an-ipo-again-after-he-turns-profit">as reported by Bloomberg</a>, that as of October, WeWork was “100% done with rightsizing” after parting ways with 8,000 employees, or roughly one-third of its headcount.</p>
<p>Mathrani stepped into the role of CEO in February of last year, following the ouster of WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann from the company months earlier on the heels of the company&#8217;s pulled IPO.</p>
<p>Mathrani previously spent 1.5 years as the CEO of Brookfield Properties’ retail group and as a vice chairman of Brookfield Properties. Before joining the Chicago-based company, he spent eight years as the CEO of General Growth Properties. It was one of the largest mall operators in the U.S. until Brookfield acquired it for $9.25 billion in cash in 2018.</p>
<p>Mathrani also spent eight years as an executive vice president with the publicly traded real estate company Vornado Realty Trust.</p>
<p>Bow Capital Management is run by Vivek Ranadive, the founder of Tibco Software; in July, it registered plans for a $350 million blank-check company that would focus on acquiring a business in the technology, media and telecommunications industries.</p>
<p>Though there&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EKOV71m-PY">much discussion</a> over the years over whether WeWork is a tech company or much more of a pure real estate play, the company has long insisted it is the former.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">only announced</a> its acquisition of newsletter platform Revue two days ago, but the company has already begun to integrate the product into the Twitter.com website. It appears &#8220;Newsletters&#8221; will soon be the newest addition to Twitter&#8217;s sidebar navigation, alongside Bookmarks, Moments, Twitter Ads and other options. The company is also readying a way to promote the new product to Twitter users, promising them another way to reach their audience while getting paid for their work.</p>
<p>These findings and others were uncovered by noted reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1354564523038924805">Jane Manchun Wong</a>, who dug into the Twitter.com website to see what the company may have in store for its newest acquisition.</p>
<p>According to a pop-up promotional message in development she found, Twitter will soon be pitching a handful of Revue benefits, like the ability to compose and schedule newsletters, embed tweets, import email lists, analyze engagement and earn money from paid followers. The messaging was clearly in early testing (it even had a typo!), but it hints at Twitter&#8217;s larger plans to tie Revue into the Twitter platform and serve as a way for prominent users to essentially monetize their reach.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, the &#8220;Find Out More&#8221; button on pop-up message will redirect Twitter users to the Revue website Wong found.</p>
<p>In addition, Wong noted Twitter was making &#8220;Newsletters&#8221; a new navigation option on the Twitter sidebar menu. Unfortunately, it was not shown on the top-level menu where you today find options like Explore, Notifications, Messages or Bookmarks, but rather on the submenu you access from the three-dot &#8220;More&#8221; link.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twitter is working to include the “<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f4f0.png" alt="📰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Newsletters” item in the menu in the web app, which shows the popup about <a href="https://twitter.com/revue?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@revue</a> above <a href="https://t.co/ATaXDGr0zc">pic.twitter.com/ATaXDGr0zc</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tight integration between Revue and Twitter&#8217;s main platform could potentially give the company an interesting competitive advantage in the newsletters market &#8212; especially as Twitter has already dropped hints that its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">new audio product, Twitter Spaces</a>, will also be used as a way to connect with newsletter subscribers.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/">announcement</a>, Twitter referred to &#8220;new settings for writers to host conversations&#8221; with their readers. That likely means Twitter users would be able to not just publish newsletters with the new Twitter product, but also monetize their existing follower base, find new readers through Twitter&#8217;s built-in features, and then engage their fans on an ongoing basis through audio chats in Spaces. Combined with its lowering of the paid newsletter fee to 5%, many authors are rightly considering the potential Twitter advantages. If anything at all is holding them back, it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/will-this-time-be-any-different-for-twitter/">Twitter&#8217;s less-than-stellar reputation</a> when it comes to successfully capitalizing on some of its acquisitions.</p>
<p>Twitter declined to comment on Wong&#8217;s findings, but we understand these features are currently not live on the website. Wong told us she hasn&#8217;t found any indications of Revue integrations in the Twitter mobile apps just yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I&#8217;m very excited to announce Arlan Hamilton, founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, will be joining us in a fireside chat at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=justice2021&amp;utm_content=arlanhamilton&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=arlanhamiltonpost&amp;display=TRUE">TC Sessions: Justice</a> on March 3.</p>
<p>Backstage Capital has raised more than $12 million to invest in more than 150 companies led by people of color, women and/or LGBTQ founders, including Spora Health, Bitwise, Career Karma, Uncharted Power, Kairos and Zero Grocery. The venture firm is driven by the ethos that these founders represent the biggest opportunities in investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am into things that promote sustainability, that are clever,&#8221;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/8-black-investors-discuss-the-intersection-of-race-tech-and-vc/"> Hamilton said in an Extra Crunch survey in June</a>. &#8220;I like the senior care industry, but also pushing that a little further into senior activity and thriving entrepreneurship, et cetera. And media. I think media has a really interesting, exciting opportunity right now because of the way representation is so important, has always been, but it’s even more now. I’m seeing more and more interesting and unique media options rather than the status quo.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Backstage has gone on to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/backstage-capital-accelerator/">launch an accelerator in four cities to support underrepresented founders</a>, as well as a syndicate, <a href="https://www.backstagecrowd.com/faq">called Backstage Crowd</a>. Within the first three months of its relaunch in 2020, Backstage Crowd raised $1 million, <a href="https://backstagecapital.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Backstage-Capital-5-Year-Impact-Report-Final-1.pdf">according to the firm&#8217;s impact report</a>.</p>
<p>Hamilton is also the author of &#8220;It&#8217;s About Damn Time,&#8221; a book geared toward providing tactical advice for founders and aspiring investors.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=justice2021&amp;utm_content=arlanhamilton&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=arlanhamiltonpost&amp;display=TRUE">TC Sessions: Justice</a>, we&#8217;ll plan to chat with Hamilton about the state of venture capital, investing in underestimated and underfunded founders and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple&#8217;s CEO Tim Cook has urged Europe to step up privacy enforcement in a keynote speech to the <a href="https://www.cpdpconferences.org">CPDP</a> conference today &#8212; echoing many of the points he made in Brussels in person <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/apples-tim-cook-makes-blistering-attack-on-the-data-industrial-complex/">two years ago</a> when he hit out at the &#8216;data industrial complex&#8217; underpinning the adtech industry&#8217;s mass surveillance of Internet users.</p>
<p>Reforming current-gen adtech is now a humanitarian imperative, he argued in a speech that took a bunch of thinly-veiled swipes at Facebook.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I said in Brussels two years ago, it is certainly time, not only for a comprehensive privacy law here in the United States, but also for worldwide laws and new international agreements that enshrine the principles of data minimization, user knowledge, user access and data security across the globe,&#8221; said Cook.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div>&#8220;Together, we must send a universal, humanistic response to those who claim a right to users’ private information about what should not and will not be tolerated,&#8221; he added.</div>
<p>The message comes at a critical time for Apple as it prepares to flip a switch that will, for the first time, require developers to gain opt-in user consent to tracking.</p>
<p>Earlier today Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">confirmed</a> it would be enabling the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature in the next beta release of iOS 14, which it said would roll out in early spring.</p>
<p>The tech giant had intended to debut the feature last year but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/apple-delay-ios-14-privacy-ad-tracking/">delayed</a> to give developers more time to adapt.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RGTW9PadtY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency feature will be enabled by default and arrive in &#8216;early spring&#8217; on iOS</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency feature will be enabled by default and arrive in &#8216;early spring&#8217; on iOS&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/embed/#?secret=RGTW9PadtY" data-secret="RGTW9PadtY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Adtech giant Facebook has also been aggressively briefing against the shift, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/">warning</a> of a major impact on publishers who use its ad network once Apple gives its users the ability to refuse third party tracking.</p>
<p>Reporting its Q4 earnings <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/facebook-q4-earnings-2/">yesterday</a>, Facebook also sounded a warning over “more significant advertising headwinds” impacting its own bottom line this year &#8212; naming Apple&#8217;s ATT as a risk (as well as what it couched as &#8220;the evolving regulatory landscape&#8221;).</p>
<p>In the speech to a data protection and privacy conference which is usually held in Brussels (but has been streamed online because of the pandemic), Cook made an aggressive defence of ATT and Apple&#8217;s pro-privacy stance in general, saying the forthcoming tracking opt-in is about &#8220;returning control to users&#8221; and linking adtech-fuelled surveilled of Internet users to a range of harms, including the spread of conspiracy theories, extremism and real-world violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Users have asked for this feature for a long time,&#8221; he said of ATT. &#8220;We have worked closely with developers to give them the time and resources to implement it and we&#8217;re passionate about it because we think it has great potential to make things better for everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>The move has attracted a competition challenge in France where four online advertising lobbies filed an antitrust complaint last <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-advertisting-france-idUSL1N2HJ237">October</a> &#8212; arguing that Apple requiring developers ask app users for permission to track them is an abuse of market power by Apple. (A similar complaint has been lodged in the UK over Google&#8217;s move to depreciated third party tracking cookies in Chrome &#8212; and there the regulator has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">opened an investigation</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-looks-to-take-its-fight-with-apple-to-court">The Information</a> also reported today that Facebook is preparing to lodge an antitrust lawsuit against Apple &#8212; so the legal stakes are rising. (Though the social media giant is itself being <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization">sued by the FTC</a> which alleges it has maintained a social networking monopoly via years of anti-competitive conduct&#8230; )</p>
<p>In the speech Cook highlighted another recent pro-privacy move made by Apple to require iOS developers to display &#8220;privacy nutrition&#8221; labels within the App Store &#8212; providing users with an overview of their data collection practices. Both the labels and the incoming ATT apply in the case of Apple&#8217;s own apps (not just third parties), as we reported earlier.</p>
<p>Cook said these moves align with Apple&#8217;s overarching philosophy: To make technology that &#8220;serves people and has their well-being in mind&#8221; &#8212; contrasting its approach with a rapacious &#8216;data industrial complex&#8217; that wants to aggregate information about everything people do online to use against them, as a tool of mass manipulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems no piece of information is too private or personal to be surveilled, monetized and aggregated into a 360 degree view of your life,&#8221; Cook warned. &#8220;The end result of all of this is that you are no longer the customer; you are the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;When ATT is in full effect users will have a say over this kind of tracking. Some may well think that sharing this degree of information is worth it for more targeted ads. Many others, I suspect, will not. Just as most appreciated it when we built this similar functionality into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-adds-a-tracker-blocker-to-desktop-safari/">Safari limiting web trackers several years ago</a>,&#8221; he went on, adding that: &#8220;We see developing these kinds of privacy-centric features and innovations as a core responsibility of our work. We always have, we always will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s CEO pointed out that advertising has flourished in the past without the need for privacy-hostile mass surveillance, arguing: &#8220;Technology does not need vast troves of personal data stitched together across dozens of websites and apps in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we&#8217;re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also made some veiled sideswipes at Facebook &#8212; avoiding literally naming the adtech giant but hitting out at the notion of a business that&#8217;s built on &#8220;surveilling users&#8221;, on &#8220;data exploitation&#8221; and on &#8220;choices that are no choices at all&#8221;.</p>
<p>Such an entity &#8220;does not deserve our praise, it deserves reform&#8221;, he went on, having earlier heaped praise on Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for its role in furthering privacy rights &#8212; telling conference delegates that enforcement &#8220;must continue&#8221;. (The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">GDPR&#8217;s weak spot to date has been exactly that</a>; but 2.5 years in there are signs the regime is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/grindr-on-the-hook-for-e10m-over-gdpr-consent-violations/">getting into a groove</a>.)</p>

<p>In further sideswipes at Facebook, Cook attacked the role of data-gobbling, engagement-obsessed adtech in fuelling disinformation and conspiracy theories &#8212; arguing that the consequences of such an approach are simply too high for democratic societies to accept.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should not look away from the bigger picture,&#8221; he argued. &#8220;At a moment of rampant disinformation and conspiracy theories juiced by algorithms we can no longer turn a blind eye to a theory of technology that says all engagement is good engagement, the longer the better. And all with the goal of collecting as much data as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too many are still asking the question how much can we get away with? When they need to be asking what are the consequences? What are the consequences of prioritizing conspiracy theories and violent incitement simply because of the high rates of engagement? What are the consequences of not just tolerating but rewarding content that undermines public trust in lifesaving vaccinations? What are consequences of seeing thousands of users join extremist groups and then perpetuating an algorithm that recommends even more,&#8221; he went on &#8212; sketching a number of scenarios of which Facebook&#8217;s business stands directly accused.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is long past time to stop pretending that this approach doesn&#8217;t come with a cost. Of polarization. Of lost trust. And &#8212; yes &#8212; of violence. A social dilemma cannot be allowed to become a social catastrophe,&#8221; he added, rebranding &#8216;The Social Network&#8217; at a stroke.</p>

<p>Apple has reason to appeal to a European audience of data protection experts to further its fight with adtech objectors to its ATT, as EU regulators have the power to take enforcement decisions that would align with and support its approach. Although they have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/">shy to do so so far</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s lead data protection supervisor in Europe, Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC), has a backlog of investigations into a number of aspects of its business &#8212; including its use of so-called &#8216;forced consent&#8217; (as users are not given any choice over being tracked for ad targeting if they wish to use its services).</p>
<p>That lack of choice stands in stark contrast to the change Apple is driving on its App Store, where all entities will be required to ask users if they want to be tracked. So Apple&#8217;s move aligns with the principles of European data protection law (which, for example, requires that consent for processing people&#8217;s data be freely given in order to be legally valid).</p>
<p>Equally, Facebook&#8217;s continued refusal to give users a choice stands in direct conflict with EU law and risks GDPR enforcement. (The kind Cook was urging in his speech.)</p>
<p>2021 looks like it could be a critical year on that front. A long running DPC investigation into the transparency of data-sharing between WhatsApp and Facebook is headed for enforcement this year &#8212; after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/18/whatsapp-facebook-data-sharing-transparency-under-review-by-eu-dpas-after-ireland-sends-draft-decision/">Ireland sent a draft decision to the other EU data protection agencies</a> at the back end of last year.</p>
<p>Last week <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/whatsapp-privacy-fine-data-protection-europe-50-million/">Politico</a> reported WhatsApp could be on the hook for a fine of between €30M and €50M in that single case. More pertinently for the tech giant &#8212; which paid a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/facebook-settles-with-ftc-5-billion-and-new-privacy-guarantees/">$5BN fine to the FTC in 2019 to settle charges related to privacy failings</a> (but was not required to make any material changes to how it operates its ad business) &#8212; WhatsApp could be ordered to change how it handles user data.</p>
<p>A regulatory order to stop processing certain types of user data &#8212; or mandating it ask users for consent before it can do so &#8212; could clearly have a far greater impact on Facebook&#8217;s business empire.</p>
<p>The tech giant is also facing a final verdict <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">later this year</a> on whether it can continue to legally transfer European users&#8217; data out of the bloc.</p>
<p>If Facebook is ordered to suspend such data flows that would mean massive disruption to a sizeable chunk of its business (in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/25/facebook-q1-2019-user-growth-in-europe-is-bouncing-back-despite-gdpr.html">2019</a> it reported 286M DAUs in the region in Q1).</p>
<p>So &#8212; in short &#8212; the regulatory conditions around Facebook&#8217;s business are certainly &#8216;evolving&#8217;.</p>

<p>The data industrial complex&#8217;s fight back against the looming privacy enforcement at Apple&#8217;s platform level involves ploughing legal resource into trying to claim such moves are anti-competitive. However EU lawmakers seem alive to this self-interested push to appropriate &#8216;antitrust&#8217; as a tool to stymie privacy enforcement.</p>
<p>(And it&#8217;s notable that Cook referred to privacy &#8220;innovation&#8221; in the speech. Including this ask: &#8220;Will the future belong to the innovations that make our lives better, more fulfilled and more human?&#8221; &#8212; which is really the key question in the privacy vs competition regulation &#8216;debate&#8217;.)</p>
<p>Last month Commission EVP and competition chief, Margrethe Vestager told the OECD Global Competition Forum that antitrust enforcers should be “vigilant so that privacy is not used as a shield against competition”. However her remarks had a sting in the tail for the data industrial complex &#8212; as she expressed support for a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling/"> ‘superprofiling’ case against Facebook</a> in Germany.</p>
<p>That case (which is continuing to be litigated by the German FCO) combines privacy and competition in new and interesting ways. If the regulator prevails it could result in a structural separation of Facebook&#8217;s social empire at the data level &#8212; in a sort of regulatory equivalent of moving fast and breaking things.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s notable Vestager dubbed that piece of regulatory innovation “inspiring and interesting”. Which sounds more of a vote of confidence than condemnation from Europe&#8217;s digital policy and competition chief.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityavishwanath/">Aditya Vishwanath</a>, the founder of Inspirit, wants to bring the creativity associated with Minecraft to the day-to-day schoolwork of students around the world.</p>
<p>“These students are coming from TikTok and playing Roblox games [that are] highly interactive and highly engaging,” he said. “Then, they’re coming to the classroom and watching a 20-minute lecture from a person.” As a solution to this staleness, he and his co-founder, Amrutha Vasan, built a solution.</p>
<p>The virtual science platform lets students and teachers create and experience STEM simulations, from<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnALKnRUYTs"> DNA replication</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7odC1tdkUOQ">projectile motion </a>experiments. Similar to how Minecraft empowers users to create their own worlds, Inspirit wants to empower users to low-code their way into personalized science experiments and learning worlds. The core technology is a 3D platform built atop Unity, a game engine used for editing games and creating interactive content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup is starting with complete control over creation to understand how users naturally gravitate toward certain materials. Teachers can currently build lessons on top of pre-made tracks, such as an exploration of the moon or a eukaryotic cell, and add in annotations, quiz questions and voice-overs.</p>
<p>The company is starting off with this microlesson approach, but Vishwanath sees the real potential in building a Minecraft for educational purposes. The underlying belief powering Inspirit is that students across different stages in their lives want a self-directed, engaging way to learn to supplement in-school learning.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/TnALKnRUYTs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=10&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>While the tool is not yet technically using virtual reality technology, the first priority is going hardware-agnostic to find product-market fit and get the biggest base of users. It is experimenting with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3Xr_5LopU">integrations to Oculus Quest</a>, but hasn&#8217;t yet made the option accessible on widespread basis.</p>
<p>After launching a waitlist in September, Inspirit had 50,000 users within the K-12 world sign up for access to the private beta.</p>
<p>A gamified, VR-based approach to learning has long been used in edtech to increase engagement and excitement around learning. The startup, which has not yet launched publicly, has a fair share of competitors. Labster, a well-funded Copenhagen startup, was founded in 2011 to provide lab simulations to replace science class. The startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/labster-lands-new-cash-to-bring-its-virtual-reality-science-lab-software-to-asia/">recently expanded its lab software to Asia,</a> after usage on the platform surged. Vishwanath thinks that Inspirit differentiates from Labster because it urges kids to become creators, instead of users.</p>
<p>Another recent example of edtech merging with virtual reality is Transfr, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/transfr-raises-12m-series-a-to-bring-virtual-reality-to-manufacturing-plant-floors/">raised $12 million</a> to upskill workforces. Transfr is selling to an entirely different market than Inspirit by targeting trade workers, but it similarly has invested in creating a library of modules to help scale its curriculum faster.</p>
<p>The biggest test for Inspirit will be if it can truly recreate the spontaneity and magic of Minecraft. Will students feel inspired to create on the platform? More importantly, will they come back over and over again? The dynamic here to think about is that Inspirit is a supplement to school, which currently relies heavily on curriculum-based learning to teach. If a student wants to use Inspirit for comprehension, the possibilities aren’t exactly endless, but instead are bookended by a mandatory set of rules.</p>
<p>It’s the dividing line between what makes a game and what makes an interactive simulation.</p>
<p>“I have a strong feeling and reason to believe even the early science of engagement; the drivers of Inspirit are not going to be teachers,” Vishwanath said. One 12-year-old student used Inspirit to build a Quantum funnel using pre-made modules, he explained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2101586" style="width: 618px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101586" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2101586" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/inspirit-founders-2.jpg" alt="" width="608" height="811" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101586" class="wp-caption-text">Amrutha Vasan and Aditya Vishwanath, Inspirit co-founders. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Inspirit</p></div></p>
<p>Beyond that, the startup will need to prove outcomes and efficiency before it can ethically sell to end users. It&#8217;s clear that virtual reality has a huge potential to <a href="https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6541&amp;context=etd">help people comprehend complex topics,</a> but bite-sized bits of the technology used once in a while might not.</p>
<p>Long term, Vishwanath thinks that edtech will shift to focus on creation, instead of simply consumption. He’s already convinced a number of investors on that vision. The startup announced today that it has raised seed financing to pursue its lofty goal. The $3.6 million round was led by Sierra Ventures. Other investors include Unshackled Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, January Ventures, Edovate Capital, Redhouse Education and Roble Ventures.</p>
<p>The money will be used to figure out a business model and monetization plans, as well as hire a team. The blending of edtech and gaming, Vishwanath thinks, will be able to save them from becoming “another graveyard education company out there that has hypergrowth and doesn’t know how to make money.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.urban-x.com/">Urban-X</a>, the accelerator launched by the venture capital fund <a href="https://urban.us/about-us/">Urban US</a> and BMW&#8217;s <a href="https://www.miniusa.com/">MINI</a> subsidiary to invest in companies that primarily address sustainable and resilient living in the cities of the future, has launched its latest cohort.</p>
<p>This ninth cohort of companies are coming to market at a time when the world&#8217;s largest investors are embracing the thesis that Urban-X and its parent firm have espoused for years. Put simply: the climate is changing and there will need to be technological solutions that allow people to adapt to the changing environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels good to be a 2014 climatetech investor in 2021,&#8221; says Urban US co-founder Stonly Baptiste Blue. &#8220;You can get the sense that sustainability and climate change startups have never had better tailwinds than right now.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, Urban-X is about more than just climate and resiliency, but increasingly those are the startups that are going to be getting funding in the next few years and generating big returns for investors.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re talking about a multi-hundred trillion dollar wave in the climate markets,&#8221; said Baptiste-Blue. &#8220;There’s a lot of evidence that we’re in the climate decade.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>And as Baptiste Blue thinks about the future, there&#8217;s still a lot of opportunity for enterprising entrepreneurs to build large new businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a<span style="font-weight: 400;"> lot of things that we’re trying to cover that touch on this next wave of climatetech investing from disaster risk to outage intelligence, community building so we have resilience and communication between folks as things get stickier and disasters become more common,&#8221; said Baptiste Blue.  </span></p>
<p>Some of the companies that Urban-X worked with on its latest cohort definitely fit that bill. These are businesses like Domatic, which makes a product to centralize AC/DC conversion for solar power; OneRoof which is building a communications platform for resilient platform, and Dorothy, a machine learning platform improving disaster risk.</p>
<p>To date, the accelerator has an IRR of around 29%, according to documents viewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The full list of the companies in the accelerator&#8217;s current batch are here:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ggvc.com/">GGV Capital</a>, the now 20-year-old venture firm that has long invested primarily in the U.S. and China, just closed on a whopping $2.52 billion in fresh capital commitments across four new funds, it announced this morning.</p>
<p>Much of the money will be invested through the firm&#8217;s eighth flagship fund, which has $1.5 billion to plug into startups across all stages. It also closed on $366 million for an opportunity fund to double down on breakout investments (GGV Capital VIII Plus); $80 million for a fund that invites the founders in its network to invest alongside GGV; and a &#8220;discovery&#8221; fund that closed with $610 million and aims to fund founders around the globe at the earliest stage of their startups&#8217; development.</p>
<p>GGV also recently held a close on its second RMB fund with RMB 3.4 billion, $525 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The capital collectively brings assets under management at the firm to $9.2 billion across 17 funds (and by the way, that RMB fund is likely to get a lot bigger, judging from GGV&#8217;s first RMB fund, which closed in 2018 with the equivalent of <a href="https://technode.com/2018/05/03/venture-capital-firm-ggv-raises-1-5-billion-in-new-rmb-fund/">$1.5 billion</a>).</p>
<p>Given the state of venture investing right now, GGV&#8217;s haul isn&#8217;t a surprise. Money has continued to flood into the asset class fueled partly by low interest rates (institutions are trying to find &#8220;alpha&#8221;) and the overall growth of the private market over the last decade. Because companies have remained private for so long, VCs have enjoyed much of the upside of their growth <em>and</em> benefited from <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/public-market-verdict-the-unicorn-binge-wasnt-crazy-it-was-really-profitable/">huge leaps</a> when many of these same companies have gone public.</p>
<p>Of course, not all funds get a sizable piece of the right companies. GGV appears to be fairly adept at writing meaningful checks into startups that matter.</p>
<p>Though it owned less than 5% of some of its portfolio companies, as evidenced in their S-1 filings (Affirm, Airbnb, Peloton, Slack, Square, Zendesk), it has amassed big positions in others, including Opendoor (5%), Poshmark (7.9%) and Wish (6.2%),</p>
<p>GGV, which also invests in Latin American, India, Southeast Asia and Israel, has bets in many still-private companies that are very highly valued, too. Among these is the infrastructure automation company Hashicorp, which raised money at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/hashicorp-soars-above-5b-valuation-in-new-175m-venture-round/">$5.1 billion</a> valuation last year; the online education company Zuoyeban, which was reportedly valued at <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/3115557/chinese-online-tutor-zuoyebang-raises-more-us16-billion-alibaba">$6.5 billion</a> in a round that closed in December; and in StockX, the online resale marketplace that was assigned a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/stockx-raises-275m-series-e-valuing-the-retailer-at-2-8b/">$2.8 billion valuation</a> in December when it closed its newest round.</p>
<p>Either way, the announcement seems to underscore that, for now at least, there&#8217;s still no end in sight of a years-long trend of big funds growing exponentially bigger.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, the 25-year-old investment firm TCV unveiled a record <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/tcv-closes-record-4b-fund-to-invest-in-e-commerce-fintech-edtech-travel-and-more/">$4 billion</a> fund. Late last year, Andreessen Horowitz closed a pair of funds totaling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/a16z-is-now-managing-16-5-billion-after-announcing-two-new-funds/">$4.5 billion</a>. Insight Partners also closed its biggest fund to date by a lot last year, a <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/insight-partners-closes-9-5b-growth-equity-fund-xi-its-biggest-to-date/">$9.5 billion</a> growth equity vehicle.</p>
<p>One of the few top venture firms to consistently buck the trend has been Benchmark Capital. Last year, it quietly closed on a $425 million fund, which is roughly the same size as most of its previous nine earlier funds.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In light of climate change and escalating global energy demand, more emphasis is being placed on emerging clean technologies — ranging from renewables and energy storage to nuclear power. Although these technologies have tremendous potential, they require lots of innovation, and innovation needs abundant capital.</p>
<p>The issue: early-stage financing for clean tech hasn’t been plentiful, and it’s stifling the growth of new energy companies. Why is this? In general, clean tech companies lack the startup advantages of agility and flexibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moving fast&#8221; works for products such as consumer mobile apps and SaaS solutions. The clean tech sector, on the other hand, tends to involve highly regulated, capital-intensive, mission-critical infrastructure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That has hurt both returns and well-intentioned impact. According to Cambridge Associates, venture-backed companies have returned, on average, -15% internal rate of return (IRR) since 2000. Contrast that to venture-backed companies in healthcare, which returned 24% in IRR over the same time period.</p>
<h2>Why clean tech lacks funding</h2>
<p>While noble in its aims to make the world a better, cleaner, safer, healthier place through technology, clean tech venture capital has suffered simply because clean tech does not fit the traditional venture capital model. Central to the venture capital model is the ability to de-risk new ideas and significantly capitalize the most promising ones, allowing for liquidity via M&amp;A or initial public offering (IPO).</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Early-stage financing for clean tech hasn’t been plentiful, and it’s stifling the growth of new energy companies.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This construct allows for the return of venture capital dollars, plus appreciation that enables VC firms to raise new funds. These capitalization events also allow the venture-backed company to accelerate growth and maximize market impact.</p>
<p>How this construct works is evident when comparing healthcare and clean tech. In healthcare, new innovations are de-risked by VCs. More mature innovations are acquired or reach IPO every year. As a result, the average annual ratio of dollars raised via an exit to VC-invested dollars since 2012 is 1.8. This ratio is only 0.2 for clean tech, an 800-plus percent difference in the wrong direction. This has resulted in poor returns and limited capitalization of clean tech companies.</p>
<h2>Enter (or reenter) the SPAC</h2>
<p>Given the state of the world’s environment and lack of abundant energy in emerging economies, we need to collectively fix this issue. Special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) are significantly improving clean tech’s venture capital construct. According to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spac.asp" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spac.asp&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1611775272414000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQ-ClW8OXDQNSpzE2MAcTHE6YRaQ">Investopedia:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>SPACs are companies with no commercial operations that are formed strictly to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) for the purpose of acquiring an existing company.</p>
<p>Also known as &#8220;blank-check companies,&#8221; SPACs have been around for decades. In recent years, they&#8217;ve become more popular, attracting big-name underwriters and investors and raising a record amount of IPO money in 2019.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2020, more than 110 SPACs completed transactions in the U.S., capitalizing these companies with more than $29 billion.</p>
<p>In 2020, SPACs capitalized clean tech companies with almost $4 billion of capital, including Fisker, Lordstown Motors, QuantumScape, Hyliion, XL Fleet and others. This helped push the ratio of funds raised at exit to venture capital invested in 2020 from the previous 0.2 average to a much healthier 0.6, a 200% improvement.</p>
<p>In 2021, we will likely see even further improvement. Why? Because there are 43 active SPACs looking toward or finalizing merger targets with a clean tech focus, potentially providing $12 billion in growth capital. Even if there are no more new SPACs in 2021 and a historically low average of M&amp;As and IPOs, 2021 promises continued improvement for clean tech investment.</p>
<h2>Don’t let Nikola tarnish the pack</h2>
<p>One of the most high-profile clean tech SPACs was Nikola Corporation. The battery-electric and hydrogen-powered truck maker has attracted much fanfare since going public last June through a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/25/nikolas-steve-girsky-eyes-his-next-transportation-investment/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/09/meet-nikola-the-speculative-electric-vehicle-stock-that-traders-believe-is-as-valuable-as-ford.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1611775272414000&amp;usg=AFQjCNETPmDWUGUhDfPKhES_jxQFG1H21Q">reverse merger with special purpose acquisition company VectoIQ</a>. The company’s market capitalization soared and things seemed to be going well, but things became controversial later in the year when the company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/nikola-disputes-fraud-claims-in-carefully-worded-rebuttal/">accused of making false statements</a> about its technology and other things.</p>
<p>Although examples such as Nikola have the potential to tarnish the emergence of SPACs as a way to spur clean tech investing, they shouldn’t. There are plenty of examples of emerging companies that scream quality and integrity. For example, Stem*, a leader in the energy storage optimization space, is now going public, pending SEC approval, via the Star Peak SPAC.</p>
<p>Public markets are receiving the SPAC with enthusiasm. Assuming the merger happens, Stem will be capitalized with greater than $450 million of cash to accelerate growth and drive impact. It’s an illustration of SPACs as a positive venture capital construct that is needed to make clean tech work and become a thriving sector.</p>
<p>As a long-time clean tech venture capitalist myself, it is interesting that public investment via the SPAC may be the correcting element for the clean tech VC construct. For years, I assumed that corporates would step up their M&amp;A activity at premium valuations to solve this issue, but I’ve spent a long time waiting.</p>
<p>Judging by activity, corporates seem content to continue playing the still very important investor/nurturer role, versus the “owning” role. Regardless, capitalizing promising clean tech companies can only mean one thing: clean-tech-related impact is coming like never before as these companies require and use capital to scale.</p>
<p>New and more diverse approaches to finding and funding new, great clean tech companies are sorely needed. SPACs are going to be the tool needed to bring clean tech up to par with sectors such as healthcare. It’s a development that will benefit all of us.</p>
<p><em>*Stem is a Wind Ventures portfolio company.</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s safe to project a rebound for the industry at large in 2021.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’d be forgiven for being skeptical about the iPhone 12’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/smartphone-sales-slowed-decline-in-q4-with-a-big-assist-from-apple/">stellar performance this past quarter</a>. It’s been a rough couple of years for smartphones — a phenomenon from which not even Apple was immune.</p>
<p>Frankly, after staring down these macro trends over the last couple of years, it seemed like the days of phone-fueled earnings reports were behind the company as its expanding services portfolio started to become its primary financial driver.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			For the final quarter of 2020, Apple earnings surpassed $100 billion — a first.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I capped off my mobile coverage last year with an article titled, “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/not-even-5g-could-rescue-smartphone-sales-in-2020/">Not even 5G could rescue smartphone sales in 2020</a>.” Among the figures cited were two year-over-year drops of 20% for the first two quarters, followed by a global decline of 5.7% for Q3. As we noted at the time, a mere 5.7% drop constituted good news in 2020.</p>
<p>The straightforward premise of the piece was that COVID-19 subverted industry expectations that 5G would finally reverse declining smartphone sales, even if only temporarily. That all came with the important caveat that Apple’s numbers would likely have a big impact the following quarter.</p>
<p>Ahead of yesterday&#8217;s earnings, Morgan Stanley noted, &#8220;In our view, the iPhone 12 has been Apple&#8217;s most successful product launch in the last five years.&#8221; Such a sentiment may have seemed like hyperbole in the lead-up to the news, but in hindsight, it’s hard to argue, with five years having passed since the launch of the first Apple Watch.</p>
<p>The iPhone X was more of a radical departure for the company, but the 12 is proving to be a massive hit. The recent launch of Apple Silicon Macs juiced sales in that product category rising 21% year over year, but ultimately the company’s computer business is a drop in the bucket compared to phone sales.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Reddit wasn&#8217;t happy — and neither are some lawmakers. The incident apparently struck an unusual bipartisan chord, with Texas Republican Ted Cruz throwing his weight behind progressive Democrats who called out the company.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a blog post Thursday morning, <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/keeping-customers-informed-through-market-volatility">Robinhood said that it would restrict some transactions</a> &#8220;in light of recent volatility&#8221; including $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR and $TRVG. Robinhood will still allow anyone invested in those stocks to close their positions, but the move prevents retail investors from throwing their weight behind new stocks en masse.</p>
<p>Rep. Rashida Tlaib called Robinhood&#8217;s decision <a href="https://twitter.com/RashidaTlaib/status/1354807292667981828">&#8220;beyond absurd&#8221;</a> and suggested that the House Financial Services Committee hold a hearing on what she deemed &#8220;market manipulation&#8221; from the personal finance startup.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re blocking the ability to trade to protect Wall St. hedge funds, stealing millions of dollars from their users to protect people who&#8217;ve used the stock market as a casino for decades,&#8221; Tlaib said.</p>
<p>Her colleague Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — a member of that committee — chimed in with support for a hearing on Robinhood, calling the situation an &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; step to prevent retail investors from trading.</p>
<p>Seeing Cruz and Ocasio-Cortez line up on anything right now is unusual, to put it mildly. Earlier this month, Cruz called his enemy in the House a liar for <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1347236707138211845">demanding his resignation </a>after it came to light that the Texas Republican fundraised on false claims that the election was stolen as the attack on the Capitol took place.</p>
<p><em>Update: Ocasio-Cortez <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1354848253729234944">rebuffed</a> the bipartisan gesture from Cruz, but with Democrats in control that likely won&#8217;t have much impact on the likelihood of hearings.</em></p>
<p>Silicon Valley Rep. Ro Khanna also flagged Robinhood&#8217;s decision to stop some trades, slamming the startup for freezing out small investors while powerful hedge funds scramble to get control of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re done letting hedge fund billionaires treat the stock market like their personal playground, then taking their ball home as soon as they lose,&#8221; Khanna said Thursday in a call for more regulation, citing the intensifying wealth disparity in the country.</p>
<p>&#8221; … This entire episode has demonstrated the power of technology to democratize access to American financial institutions, ultimately giving far more people a say in our economic structures,&#8221; Khanna said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The newly resurrected <a href="https://go.gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a> wants to realize its mobile dreams from the early-aughts in an augmented reality world, and they&#8217;ve raised some new funding to make it happen.</p>
<p>The AR startup tells TechCrunch that it has raised $4 million in seed funding co-led by Google&#8217;s venture arm GV and Spark Capital. Other investors include Niantic, Upside Partnership, Otherwise Fund, Capital Factory, Form Capital and a host of angels like April Underwood, Leah Culver, Jason Calacanis, John Lilly, Scott Belsky, Dennis Crowley, and Dave and Brit Morin at Offline Ventures.</p>
<p>Gowalla was originally founded back in 2009 as a Foursquare competitor, it gathered some early traction and excitement from investors, raising just over $10 million, before things petered out a couple years later and the team was acquihired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/12/gowalla-went-for-3m-in-facebook-shares-and-many-investors-were-cool-with-that/">by Facebook for $3 million</a>. Co-founder Josh Williams, who has brought back the app with new co-founder Patrick Piemonte, tells TechCrunch he hopes the new iteration can take inspiration from the social side of TikTok and the platform side of Roblox and allow users to &#8220;unlock&#8221; the world around them in augmented reality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>It&#8217;s still pretty unclear what the end game is thought it becomes a bit clearer as the app pushes out its early batch of beta testers &#8212; which the startup calls its &#8220;Street Team&#8221; &#8212; to find points of interest for the app. Williams contends there are some elements of the app that share similarities with Foursquare&#8217;s early iterations, with users getting credit for data they submit as well as badges for completing certain tasks.</p>

<p>&#8220;The questions that we ask ourselves is as stories is to a timeline, what’s the same equivalent to real world space and how do we create a gamified sharing format that has the same ubiquity,&#8221; Williams tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The Gowalla team doesn&#8217;t have any firm dates lined up but hopes to share more about the eventual launch experience in the coming months and open up for beta in early summer.</p>

<p>Launched in 2017, the company was founded by cyber resilience and intelligence expert, <a href="https://twitter.com/ozalashe?lang=en">Oz Alashe MBE</a>, a former lieutenant colonel in the British army and U.K. special forces who was the first Black officer to serve in the parachute regiment and U.K. special forces. The team includes former U.K. government cybersecurity specialists, behavioral scientists, data scientists and software engineers.</p>

<p>Alashe says the platform helps users develop security skills and habits through “accredited microlearning content, adaptive support material and personalized nudges. The combination of contextualized, just-in-time, and on-demand content ensures people get the help they need. They get it whenever they need it. And they get it in the way that is most likely to help them.” The platform is available in nine different languages.</p>
<p>CybSafe is delivered via a mobile application or within a browser, showing &#8220;bite-sized&#8221; guidance, alerts and notifications.</p>
<p>CybSafe’s competitors include KnowBe4, Wombat Security and Infosec, but Alashe says CybSafe’s strength is that it addresses security awareness for the average person: “Security awareness is dead. It’s ineffective. It’s inefficient. And it’s broken. CybSafe uses behavioral science and data analysis to deliver security behavior interventions that work. It has efficacy rates of over 90% for some behaviors to prove it.”</p>
<p>The team includes Jonathan Webster, CTO who previously worked on Her Majesty’s Government Digital Services; Dr. John Blythe, Head of Behavioural Science, and a Chartered Psychologist with the British Psychological Society.</p>

The past year was, of course, a major blow to an industry already suffering a slide. Hope that the arrival of 5G would right the ship were dashed by Covid-19.</p>
<p>Things are looking up, fueled in large part by a killer quarter for Apple. The company posted its earnings last night, putting much of its success at the feet of the iPhone 12. In spite (or perhaps because) of pandemic-fueled delays, the handset arrived in a perfect storm – the beginnings of a “supercycle” that see customers upgrading devices in a kind of critical mass.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Numbers are still down for the fourth quarter of 2020 – but they’re down by only 2% per the firm. That’s due in no small part to what amounted to the iPhone’s best quarter, as the company introduced four 5G-sporting handsets. Canalys shows a 4% increase for Apple, as the device arrived to a wider 5G rollout just in time for the holiday season.</p>
<p>The company snagged the global number one spot, with Samsung taking number two in spite of a 12% decline. Chinese manufacturers Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo rounded out the top five, all seeing double digit increases, y-o-y.</p>

<p>The category is expected to see a rebound this year, after suffering declines due first to supply chain concerns and then larger economic issues, stemming from the pandemic.</p>
<p>“The introduction of COVID-19 vaccines is also boosting business confidence for 2021, allowing them to plan and invest,” analyst Ben Stanton says of the figures. “Going forwards, there will be obvious economic ripple effects as government stimulus fades, and there are ongoing concerns around new virus strains. Overall though, sentiment in the industry is positive, and 2021 will see the smartphone market rebound after a 7% decline in 2020.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors pledged to be carbon neutral by 2040 &#8212; removing emissions from all of its products and global operations or offsetting those emissions through carbon credits or carbon capture within the next two decades.</p>
<p>The company also committed to have a fully electric fleet of vehicles by 2035.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big step for a company whose products are responsible for a large percentage of the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change and comes on the heels <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/gm-ups-electric-and-autonomous-vehicle-spending-to-27-billion-through-2025/">of a pledge to launch a massive fleet of new electric vehicles and a $27 billion commitment to electrification</a> late last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The auto giant said that it would work with the Environmental Defense Fun on its vision for an all-electric future and will work toward eliminating tailpipe emissions from light-duty vehicles by 2035. Moving its portfolio, which today is dominated by internal combustion engine vehicles, will be a transition, a GM spokesperson told TechCrunch, adding that the main priority is to bring employees along in that shift.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s also getting into the charging business too. The company said it would work with &#8220;governments, partners, and suppliers around the world to build out the necessary charging infrastructure and encourage the use of renewable energy n electric vehicle charging.&#8221;</p>
<p>To power the company&#8217;s operations, GM said it will use only renewable energy power at its U.S. facilities by 2030 and by 2035 all of its operations worldwide will use renewable power.</p>
<p>These commitments are also going to extend to its supply chain over time as the company works with its suppliers to reduce their emissions, increase transparency and source sustainable materials.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;While electric vehicles do not produce tailpipe emissions, it is critical that the impact associated with production and charging is incorporated in our plans. By working with utility companies to provide access to more renewable energy sources, GM hopes to address the entire production cycle of future EVs, with benefits that will extend far beyond our own vehicles and operations,&#8221; the company&#8217;s chief executive Mary Barra said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>This commitment is going to require a massive transformation that encompasses more than GM alone, Barra wrote, because<span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;making the transition to an EV is simply not possible right now – either because the appropriate vehicles do not exist or because access to charging is limited where [people] live and work.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.storetasker.com">Storetasker</a> is an online marketplace focused on connecting Shopify merchants with developers and other experts who can help grow their business.</p>
<p>The product is now owned by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/02/lorem-seed-funding/">the startup previously known as Lorem</a>. Co-founder and COO Charlie Fogarty explained that while Lorem originally had a broader mission of connecting small businesses and developers, &#8220;We realized that Shopify and e-commerce was by far our best customer segment &#8230; so we basically acquired our main competitor, Storetasker, and merged the two business&#8221; under the Storetasker name.</p>
<p>The acquisition (which included the Storetasker product and expert network, but not the team) actually took place last year, and Fogarty said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve spent the last 10 months basically rebuilding the product from the ground up. We&#8217;ve taken years of learning and combined it into a rebrand, a new product and a new end-to-end customer experience.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The core proposition is still the same, however. A Shopify merchant should be able to visit Storetasker, describe their project in simple terms and then within a few hours, Storetasker will match them up with one of the experts in the network, who they can work with directly.</p>
<p>Storetasker has already been used by more than 30,000 brands on Shopify, including Boll &amp; Branch, Chubbies, Aisle, Alpha Industries, Truff Hot Sauce and Branch Furniture. Fogarty said the average project size is just $300 and usually involves adding custom designs and unique features to a Shopify store.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2105489" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2105489" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2105489" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg?w=680" alt="Storetasker screenshot" width="680" height="373" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg 2879w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg?resize=768,421 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg?resize=1536,843 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg?resize=2048,1124 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2105489" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Storetasker</p></div></p>
<p>You could use a general marketplace like Upwork or Fiverr to find a freelance developer, but where Storetasker has conducted more than 5,000 interviews to vet its talent and picks the right expert for each customer, Fogarty said that on other platforms, &#8220;You have to sift through unvetted talent &#8230; The hiring burden is placed on the brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Plus, he noted that brands can use Storetasker for more than development help — they also use it to find experts on conversion and &#8220;all the different aspects of e-commerce.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the new product, Storetasker is also announcing that it raised $3.2 million in Series A funding last year from Flybridge, Founder Collective, and FJ Labs.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Fogarty said he sees plenty of room to grow while remaining focused on the Shopify ecosystem. After all, there are <a href="https://news.shopify.com/now-powering-over-1-million-merchants-shopify-debuts-global-economic-impact-report-271485">more than 1 million stores on the platform</a>, with $200 billion in total sales to date.</p>

<p>The app store intelligence firm also found that Robinhood had its best day ever in terms of single-day downloads on Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2021 when 120,000 new users downloaded the stocks app for the first time across both iOS and Android. Robinhood also broke records for its highest number of daily active users on mobile at 2.6 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, online forum site Reddit broke its download record for its mobile app, with 199,000 single-day downloads on iOS and Android, Apptopia estimates, while also climbing to No. 2 on the Overall Top Charts on the U.S. App Store.</p>

<p>But the frenzy around GameStop and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/">revenge of the retail trader</a> is boosting other, more traditional trading apps, as well. Apps like TD Ameritrade, Webull, Fidelity, and E*TRADE have benefited from the situation, with record-breaking daily users and higher chart rankings.</p>
<p>All four apps on Wednesday achieved their highest-ever chart position to date on the U.S. App Store, with Webull at No. 45 Overall, followed by TD Ameritrade at No. 53, E*TRADE at No. 113, and Fidelity at No. 178. (App Annie sees Webull closing Wednesday even higher &#8212; at No. 30 on iPhone. Before, it hadn&#8217;t even ranked in the top 100 free iPhone apps.)</p>
<p>Webull also recorded its highest number of daily active users yesterday, with 952,000, while TD Ameritrade saw a record 444,000 daily active users and Fidelity had a record of 429,000 Apptopia found.</p>
<p>Combined, the four apps saw 863,000 total downloads on Wednesday (Webull: 39K; TD Ameritrade: 24K; E*TRADE: 11K; and Fidelity: 12.3K).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how long the trading app mayhem will continue, as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/01/28/robinhood-stops-trading-meme-stocks-gamestop-amc-as-reddit-rally-begins-to-unravel/?sh=46dd2b926b75">Robinhood has already halted the trading</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/">&#8220;meme stocks</a>&#8221; like GameStop, AMC Entertainment, BlackBerry, and Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, Koss Corporation, Express, Nokia and Naked Brand.</p>
<p>That hasn&#8217;t sat well with Robinhood users, who are now in the processing of<a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1354803580713111553"> assailing the app</a> with 1-star reviews as a result, and <a href="https://twitter.com/HeelysBoi/status/1354794073333362691">encouraging others</a> to the do the same.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the Square-owned Cash App hadn&#8217;t yet gained from the GameStop insanity this week, Apptopia found. But it does appear to now be struggling as the Robinhood crowd began the search for another stock trading tool. This morning, Cash App&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/CashApp">Twitter account bio</a> reads it&#8217;s looking into an issue with Cash App that&#8217;s &#8220;delaying some orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>App Annie reports some slight movement today on Cash App,as it just jumped from No. 14 overall to No. 12.</p>
