										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk is siding with Epic Games in the App Store monopoly case, with the Tesla CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421152540394143746?s=20">firing off a tweet</a> Friday morning that called Apple&#8217;s Store fees &#8220;a de facto global tax on the Internet,&#8221; also adding that &#8220;Epic is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Epic Games legal battle with Apple is sure to last years and the Fortnite maker has hardly been secretive about its aims to win the battle for popular opinion as well. Musk&#8217;s vote of confidence could hold sway with consumers who have yet to develop a clear opinion on the topic.</p>
<p>Apple has argued publicly that dissatisfied developers can take their products to Android or mobile web on iOS, but Epic Games and others have argued that Apple&#8217;s stranglehold on apps is nothing short of a monopoly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What&#8217;s less clear is why Musk is taking up this issue right now. While Musk is rarely one to pass up offering an outside opinion on a contentious issue that doesn&#8217;t involve him, none of Musk&#8217;s current companies seem to be deeply affected by the fees from the App Store, though there certainly could be action happening behind the scenes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Government Accountability Office said that it was denying both Blue Origin’s protest and a separate challenge filed by Dynetics.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin&#8217;s protest to a U.S. governmental watchdog over NASA’s decision to award SpaceX a multi-billion dollar contract to develop a lunar lander was rejected.</p>
<p>The Government Accountability Office said Friday that it was denying both Blue Origin’s protest and a separate challenge filed by Dynetics, a defense contractor that also submitted a proposal for the contract. GAO concluded that NASA did not violate any laws or regulations when granting the sole award to SpaceX.</p>
<p>“As a result, GAO denied the protest arguments that NASA acted improperly in making a single award to SpaceX,” the agency said <a href="https://www.gao.gov/press-release/statement-blue-origin-dynetics-decision">in a statement</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The formal protest was over NASA’s decision to award the contract for the Human Landing System Program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time since Apollo, solely to SpaceX &#8212; and not to two companies, as was originally intended. SpaceX’s proposal for the Human Landing System Program came in at $2.9 billion, around half of Blue Origin’s $5.99 billion proposal. Earlier this week, Bezos penned an open letter to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson offering to knock $2 billion off that price to solve the “near-term budgetary issues” that caused NASA to select just one company for the contract.</p>

<p>NASA’s decision to give just one company the award did veer from historical standard, but GAO maintained that “the [contract] announcement reserved the right to make multiple awards, a single award, or no award at all.”</p>
<p>Blue Origin maintains that it was not given time to revise its bid after NASA concluded it did not have sufficient funding for two awards. “Blue Origin was plainly prejudiced by the Agency’s failure to communicate this change in requirements,” the company said in the protest. “Blue Origin could have and would have taken several actions to revise its proposed approach, reduce its price to more closely align with funding available to the Agency, and/or propose schedule alternatives.”</p>
<p>Blue Origin and Dynetics submitted their separate protests in April.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> In response to the decision, a Blue Origin spokesperson told TechCrunch:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We stand firm in our belief that there were fundamental issues with NASA’s decision, but the GAO wasn’t able to address them due to their limited jurisdiction. We’ll continue to advocate for two immediate providers as we believe it is the right solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spokesperson noted that the company was encouraged by lawmakers adding a provision to a bill in Senate that would require NASA to select two providers for the HLS program.</p>
<p>Elon Musk, meanwhile, had this to say about the decision&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At Early Stage 2021, design expert Scott Tong walked us through some of the ways founders should think about design, what design means and the steps that come before focusing on the pixels.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the last decade, high-quality design has become a necessity in the software space. Great design is a commodity, not a luxury, and yet, designing beautiful products and finding great designers continues to be a struggle for many entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>At Early Stage 2021, design expert Scott Tong walked us through some of the ways founders should think about design. Tong was involved in product and brand design at some of the biggest brands in tech, including IDEO, IFTTT, Pinterest and more. He&#8217;s now a partner at Design Fund.</p>
<p>Tong explained how to think about brand as more than a logo or a social media presence, what design means and the steps that come before focusing on the pixels, and gave guidance on when entrepreneurs should hire third-party design agencies or bring on full-time talent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>&#8220;The purest treasure mortal times afford is spotless reputation,&#8221; wrote Shakespeare. Though we often think of a brand as a logo or a social media persona, a brand is the equivalent of a person&#8217;s reputation. It signifies what the company and products stand for, and it has an element of being memorable for something, whether it&#8217;s prestige, like for Chanel, or terrible customer service, like for Comcast.</p>
<blockquote><p>The closest word in the English language to brand is actually reputation. The analogy is that brand is to company as reputation is to person. If you can link your brand with your company&#8217;s reputation, I think it&#8217;s a really great place to start when you&#8217;re having conversations about brands. What is the first impression? What are the consistent behaviors that your brand hopes to repeat over and over? What are the memorable moments that stand out and make your brand, your reputation memorable? <em><strong>(Timestamp: 2:40)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Existing versus preferred</h2>
<p>Tong outlined what design is truly about. There are many different schools of thought on design methodology and there are many different types of design. You may be thinking about product design and logo design and brand design all at the same time, and the only way to successfully hire for those tasks and complete them is to understand what design is, at its core.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Robinhood says it went public because it was ready. And our read of the markets is that it's an appealing time for high-growth tech companies with a history of losses to do so. Yet it's underwater.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robinhood priced at $38 per share this week, opened flat and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/robinhoods-stock-drops-8-in-its-first-days-trading/">closed its first day&#8217;s trading yesterday</a> worth $34.82 per share, or a bit more than 8% underwater. The company posted a mixed picture today, falling early before recovering to breakeven in late-morning trading.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t the debut that <a href="https://twitter.com/bgurley/status/1420446592851607552">some expected Robinhood to have</a>.</p>

<p>To close out the week, we&#8217;re not going to noodle on banned Chinese IPOs or do a full-week mega-round discussion. Instead, let&#8217;s parse some notes from a chat The Exchange had with Robinhood&#8217;s CFO about his company&#8217;s IPO and go over a few reasonable guesses as to why we&#8217;re not wondering how much money Robinhood left on the table by pricing its public offering lower than it closed on its first day.</p>

The time for <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1420845815082352644">Twitter jokes</a> was yesterday. We&#8217;ll put our thinking caps on this morning.</p>
<h2>Why Robinhood went public when it did</h2>
<p>Chatting with Robinhood CFO <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/27/robinhood-hires-amazon-veteran-as-cfo-a-key-step-in-its-path-to-ipo.html">Jason Warnick</a> earlier this week, we wanted to know why this was the right time for Robinhood to go public.</p>
<p>Now, no public company CEO or CFO will come out and directly say that they are going public because they think that they can defend &#8212; or extend &#8212; their most recent private valuation thanks to current market conditions.</p>
<p>Instead, execs on IPO day tend to deflect the question, pivoting to a well-oiled bon mot about how their public offering is a mere milestone on their company&#8217;s long-term trajectory. For some reason in our capitalist society, during an arch-capitalist event, by a for-profit company, leaders find it critical to downplay their IPO&#8217;s importance.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>With that in mind, Warnick did not say Robinhood went public because the IPO market has recently rewarded big-brand consumer tech companies like Airbnb and DoorDash with strong debuts. And he didn&#8217;t say that with tech shares near all-time highs and a taste for high-growth concerns, the company was likely set to enter a market that would be willing to price it at a valuation that it found attractive.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>Crafting a Pitch Deck that Can’t Be Ignored:</strong> Investors may be chasing after the hottest deals, but for founders selling their startup’s vision, it’s never been more important to communicate it in the clearest way possible. Pitch deck experts Mercedes Bent (partner, Lightspeed Venture Partners), Mar Hershenson (co-founder &amp; managing partner, Pear VC) and Saba Karim (Techstars’ head of accelerator pipeline) dig into what’s essential, what’s unnecessary and what could just make all the difference in your next deck.</p>
<p><strong>How Do You Select the Right Tech Stack:</strong> From day zero, startups have to make dozens of trade-offs when it comes to the infinite variety of tech stacks available to today’s engineers. Choose the wrong combination or direction, and a startup could be left with years of refactoring to fix the legacy damage. What are the best practices for assessing potential stacks, and how can you minimize the risk of a painful mistake? Preeti Somal (executive vice president of engineering, HashiCorp) and Jill Wetzler (head of engineering, Pilot) will discuss strategies for improving engineering right from the beginning and at every stage of a startup’s journey.</p>
<p>Disrupt’s virtual format provides plenty of opportunity for questions, so come prepared to ask the experts about the issues that keep you up at night.</p>
<p>One post can&#8217;t possibly contain all the events and opportunities of Disrupt. Don’t miss the epic Startup Battlefield competition, hundreds of early-stage startups exhibiting in the Startup Alley expo area, special breakout sessions — like the Pitch Deck Teardown — and so much more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://outvio.com">Outvio</a>, an Estonian startup that provides a white-label SaaS fulfillment solution for medium-sized and large online retailers in Spain and Estonia, has closed a $3 million early-stage financing round led by Change Ventures.</p>
<p>Also participating were TMT Investments (London), Fresco Capital (San Francisco) and Lemonade Stand (Tallinn). Several angels also joined the round, including James Berdigans (Printify) and Kristjan Vilosius (Katana MRP). This is the startup&#8217;s first institutional round of funding after bootstrapping since 2018.</p>
<p>Online retailers usually have to use a number of different tools or hire expensive developers to create in-house shipping solutions. Outvio offers online stores of any size a post-purchase shipping setup, which seeks to replicate an Amazon-style experience where customers can also return packages. Among others, it competes with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shippypro">ShippyPro</a>, which runs out of Italy and has raised $5 million to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We can give any online store all the tools needed to offer a superior post-sale customer experience,&#8221; Juan Borras, co-founder and CEO of Outvio, said. &#8220;We can integrate at different points in their fulfillment process, and for large merchants, save them hundreds of thousands in development costs alone.”</p>
<p>“What happens after the purchase is more important than most shops realize,&#8221; he added. &#8220;More than 88% of consumers say it is very important for them that retailers proactively communicate every fulfillment and delivery stage. Not doing so, especially if there are problems, often results in losing that client. Our mission is to help online stores streamline everything that happens after the sale, fueling repeat business and brand-loyal customers with the help of a fantastic post-purchase experience.”</p>
<p>“While online retailing has a long way to go, the expectations of consumers are increasing when it comes to delivery time and standards,&#8221; Rait Ojasaar, investment partner at lead investor Change Ventures, said. &#8220;The same can be said about the online shop operators who increasingly look for more advanced solutions with consumer-like user experience. The Outvio team has understood exactly what the gap in the market is and has done a tremendous job of finding product-market fit with their modern fulfillment SaaS platform.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NNEDhARQXX0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Fear is back with the deadly combination of pandemic politics and a vicious variant. The good news is that if enough people took the shots we could cut the damage to something manageable. The other good news is progress on the twin issues of Trump and social media. In both cases some semblance of balanced rationality is seeping in to the public discourse.</p>
<p>First is the former president, who has already done about as much damage as he can. Joe Biden is doing a good job of wrestling Congress into some degree of productivity. As the Gang talks about this and the next episode, it appears increasingly likely there will be a bipartisan infrastructure bill. Republicans and particularly Mitch McConnell can still shut the whole thing down, but Democrats hold the budget reconciliation process as a hole card to prompt a semi-partisan bill across the two parties. The Biden strategy is to not only force the right to accommodate some center victory but forestall a significant cave by the centrist Democrat Joe Manchin on the filibuster. This may have some value if Congress puts its foot down on voting rights or the effort to destroy them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Something similar may be playing out on the social side. Facebook and Twitter seem to be circling each other as Congress forces some antitrust positioning. With the courts giving Facebook a little running room on the operational description of what a monopoly is, Twitter reported strong numbers that beat the Street and make Jack Dorsey&#8217;s feint toward bitcoin and the creator economy easier to swallow when the smoke clears. The newsletterization of media is giving social media some street cred as Congress tries to force Facebook to grow up. Block an MGM deal here and a Section 530 carveout there seems possible although more likely just the beginning of negotiations.</p>
<p>The big battle is over the shape of post-COVID work and lifestyle negotiations. Vaccination reluctance is a five-alarm fire, but the 2022 midterms may well be fought over the intersection of climate change and the speed of recovery led by the accelerated digital economy. I don&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s a coincidence that back to work and a manageable ecology are deeply related. Silicon Valley can talk all it wants about inventing the future, but desperate consumers are looking for real answers from tech leaders who understand the future to come in a constantly unstable weather crisis that turns a burning West Coast into a choking rest of the country.</p>
<p>Vaccine mandates are a fierce predictor of what&#8217;s to come. In a country under constant threat of a constitutional crisis over voter fraud by one of the two major parties, the federal response may be constrained but not the rules at the workforce level. These are serious issues of privacy and human rights, but in the short term the moves toward practical mandates will be swift at the state and company level, and supported by healthy polling. Do you think some version of work from anywhere will be tied to double vaccination? As a mandate, it&#8217;s not a done deal; as a choice it seems like a popular way of reducing the crisis from the current 35% to something approaching a too-high but winter-ready time frame of 15% where hospitals and state economies need help, red or blue. And those numbers may become the difference between major crisis and economy-crushing lockdowns if an even more egregious variant emerges.</p>
<p>This is also where social and safety meet at a crossroads. Are we willing to cede a Facebook unimpeded from fueling the misinformation plague, or are we going to look for help from the creator economy to bypass the fallow mainstream media stuck in their controversy-fueled business model rather than a fact-based scientific approach to breaking the back of this turgid political cycle? We can see the outline of newsletter-framed social media courage, coupled with stakeholder-aware ethical values and economic leverage.</p>
<p>Less obvious is the path for Clubhouse and its competitors. The Andreessen-Horowitz-backed mobile app came out of invite-only beta and added an internal instant messaging layer to manage moderators, speakers, listener questions, room onboarding and feedback. But the big problem remains why does this mere feature of a livestreaming podcast app buttress the high valuation of the startup. And this from Michael Markman:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve largely lost interest in Clubhouse. This may not be a significant data point, but I&#8217;m no longer fascinated … The thing is, I sometimes find myself in rooms where I was learning something or getting points of view that hadn&#8217;t occurred to me. But usually I was listening to very frustrating conversations that led nowhere.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that would do it. But the bigger problem is the refusal to allow recording as a feature of the UI. Twitter Spaces won&#8217;t do it, Facebook is really a winner-take-all newsletter subscriber model (Substack) grafted on, and Spotify already has recording enabled on Anchor, its podcasting tool. Building one app is probably where Spotify will go, but then they have the problem that podcasting is considered only an audio product. So then what? Add video multiplatform streaming like ReStream to the hybrid social audio/podcast/recorder/newsletter and we got something. What&#8217;s the holdup?</p>
<p>No recording started as a nod to privacy, a differentiator between the creators and the listeners. The idea was to create a unique quality of serendipity, discovery and credibility. It&#8217;s reminiscent of the theater&#8217;s fourth wall, where characters step out of their circumstances to talk directly to the audience. It&#8217;s exhilarating to experience, a hybrid between writing and improvisation that is largely an illusion. Illusions are no less valuable just because they elegantly transcend their apparent boundaries. Clubhouse spoke directly to our sense that we had lost our way in the insidious virus of both science and truth.</p>
<p>In the decay of the Clubhouse model, we sense that the creator economy is all hat and not enough cowboy. Brent Leary:</p>
<blockquote><p>I see this as just another way to accelerate the few getting most of everything with everybody else getting scraps. You&#8217;re going to hear all these stories about all the folks, all the people that make it big, but they&#8217;re going to be like an infinitesimal fraction of everybody else trying to do the same thing and not being able to do it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just so much attention that you can give. And the people who know how to use this stuff and put a nice process together and find a way to really create a well-oiled-process machine; they have the chance of being in that top echelon of creators that get most of the money. But everybody else is going to be there trying and spinning their wheels because it&#8217;s just a continuation of what we&#8217;ve always had.</p></blockquote>
<p>Recording and a calendar page will make a difference if only to bring a vote to the floor. Is this something to look forward to, a social version of Andrea Mitchell or Nicolle Wallace on MSNBC, a system of record for issues that matter in the anywhere, creator, or thought leader economies. Markman&#8217;s question about Clubhouse viability is a broader hedge against the tendency of social media to add to the problems rather than alleviate them. Recording is really a time-shifting tool for user control, and a driver for leaderboard metadata to annotate a calendar either live or personally maintained. In theory Clubhouse should work, but in practice without recording it could be labeled another do-nothing congress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Luxembourg’s National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) has hit Amazon with a record-breaking €746 million ($887 million) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/20/wtf-is-gdpr/">GDPR</a> fine over the way it uses customer data for targeted advertising purposes.</p>
<p>Amazon disclosed the ruling in an <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001018724/cbae1abf-eddb-4451-9186-6753b02cc4eb.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">SEC filing</a> on Friday in which it slammed the decision as baseless and added that it intended to defend itself &#8220;vigorously in this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maintaining the security of our customers’ information and their trust are top priorities,&#8221; an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. &#8220;There has been no data breach, and no customer data has been exposed to any third party. These facts are undisputed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We strongly disagree with the CNPD’s ruling, and we intend to appeal. The decision relating to how we show customers relevant advertising relies on subjective and untested interpretations of European privacy law, and the proposed fine is entirely out of proportion with even that interpretation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The penalty is the result of a 2018 <a href="https://gafam.laquadrature.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/amazon.pdf">complaint</a> by French privacy rights group La Quadrature du Net, a group that claims to represent the interests of thousands of Europeans to ensure their data isn&#8217;t used by Big Tech companies to manipulate their behavior for political or commercial purposes. The complaint, which also targets Apple, Facebook Google and LinkedIn and was filed on behalf of more than 10,000 customers, alleges that Amazon manipulates customers for commercial means by choosing what advertising and information they receive.</p>
<p>La Quadrature du Net welcomed the fine issued by the CNPD, which &#8220;comes after three years of silence that made us fear the worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The model of economic domination based on the exploitation of our privacy and free will is profoundly illegitimate and contrary to all the values that our democratic societies claim to defend,&#8221; <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/2021/07/30/amende-de-746-millions-deuros-contre-amazon-suite-a-nos-plaintes-collectives/">the group added in a blog post published on Friday</a>.</p>
<p>The CNPD has also ruled that Amazon must commit to changing its business practices. However, the regulator has not publicly committed on its decision, and Amazon didn’t specify what revised business practices it is proposing.</p>

<p>The record penalty, which trumps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/french-data-protection-watchdog-fines-google-57-million-under-the-gdpr/">the €50 million GDPR penalty levied against Google in 2019</a>, comes amid heightened scrutiny of Amazon&#8217;s business in Europe. In November last year, the European Commission announced formal antitrust charges against the company, saying the retailer has misused its position to compete against third-party businesses using its platform. At the same time, the commission began a second investigation into its alleged preferential treatment of its own products on its site and those of its partners.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Xepelin is built on a SaaS model designed to give SMEs a way to organize their financial information in real time.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chilean startup</span> <a href="https://www.xepelin.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xepelin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has created a financial services platform for SMEs in Latin America, has secured $30 million in equity and $200 million in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LatAm venture fund <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/the-latam-funding-boom-continues-as-kaszek-raises-1b-across-a-duo-of-funds/">Kaszek Ventures</a> led the equity portion of the financing, which also included participation from partners of DST Global and a slew of other firms and founders/angel investors. LatAm- and U.S.-based asset managers and hedge funds &#8212; including Chilean pension funds &#8212; provided the credit facilities. In total over its lifetime, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xepelin has raised over $36 million in equity and $250 million in asset-backed facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also participating in the round were Picus Capital; Kayak Ventures; Cathay Innovation; MSA Capital; Amarena; FJ Labs; Gilgamesh and Kavak founder and CEO Carlos Garcia; Jackie Reses, executive chairman of Square Financial Services; Justo founder and CEO Ricardo Weder; Tiger Global Management Partner John Curtius; GGV’s Hans Tung; and Gerry Giacoman, founder and CEO of Clara, among others.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.xepelin.com/sobre-nosotros/">Nicolás de Camino</a> and <a href="https://www.xepelin.com/sobre-nosotros/">Sebastian Kreis</a> founded Xepelin in mid-2019 with the mission of changing the fact that “only 5% of companies in all LatAm countries have access to recurring financial services.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want all SMEs in LatAm to have access to financial services and capital in a fair and efficient way,” the pair said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xepelin is built on a SaaS model designed to give SMEs a way to organize their financial information in real time. Embedded in its software is a way for companies to apply for short-term working capital loans “with just three clicks, and receive the capital in a matter of hours,” the company claimed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has developed an AI-driven underwriting engine, which the execs said gives it the ability to make real-time loan approval decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any company in LatAm can onboard in just a few minutes and immediately access a free software that helps them organize their information in real time, including cash flow, revenue, sales, tax, bureau info &#8212; sort of a free CFO SaaS,” de Camino said. “The circle is virtuous: SMEs use Xepelin to improve their financial habits, obtain more efficient financing, pay their obligations, and collaborate effectively with clients and suppliers, generating relevant impacts in their industries.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Latin American venture capital is breaking records this year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/embed/#?secret=3BwXOuE1XU" data-secret="3BwXOuE1XU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech currently has over 4,000 clients in Chile and Mexico, which currently has a growth rate “four times faster” than when Xepelin started in Chile. Over the past 22 months, it has loaned more than $400 million to SMBs in the two countries. It currently has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a portfolio of active loans for $120 million and an asset-backed facility for more than $250 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the company has been seeing a growth rate of 30% per month, the founders said. It has 110 employees, up from 20 a year ago.</span></p>
<div>Xepelin has more than 60 partnerships (a number that it said is growing each week) with midmarket corporate companies, allowing for their suppliers to onboard to its platform for free and gain access to accounts payable, revenue-based financing. The company also sells its portfolio of non-recourse loans to financial partners, which it says mitigates credit risk exposure and enhances its platform and data play.</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we talk about creating the largest digital bank for SMEs in LatAm, we are not saying that our goal is to create a bank; perhaps we will never ask for the license to have one, and to be honest, everything we do, we do it differently from the banks, something like a non-bank, a concept used today to exemplify focus,&#8221; the founders said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both de Camino and Kreis said they share a passion for making financial services more accessible to SMEs all across Latin America and have backgrounds rooted deep in different areas of finance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to scale a platform that can solve the true pains of all SMEs in LatAm, all in one place that also connects them with their entire ecosystem, and above all, democratized in such a way that everyone can access it,” Kreis said, “regardless of whether you are a company that sells billions of dollars or just a thousand dollars, getting the same service and conditions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the company is nearly exclusively focused on the B2B space, but in the future, it believes several of its services “will be very useful for all SMEs and companies in LatAm.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Xepelin has developed technology and data science engines to deliver financing to SMBs in Latin America in a seamless way,” Nicolas Szekasy, co-founder and managing partner at Kaszek Ventures, said in a statement.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team has deep experience in the sector and has proven a perfect fit of their user-friendly product with the needs of the market.”</span></p>
<p>Chile was home to another large funding earlier this week. <a href="https://notco.com/">NotCo</a>, a food technology company making plant-based milk and meat replacements, closed on a $235 million Series D round that gives it a $1.5 billion valuation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The development is projected to add 12,000 new jobs, 2 million square feet of offices and 3,700 new homes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since U.K. spying headquarters <a href="https://www.gchq.gov.uk/">GCHQ</a> was established in Cheltenham in the 1950s, the city has attracted large firms like IBM, Raytheon, Microsoft and BAE Systems to the region, and startups like Truststamp, Bamboo Technologies, Ripjar, Hub8 and CYNAM have emerged from the city.</p>
<p>All of these firms draw on the talent that naturally gravitates to such a place, especially when you have these kinds of organizations floating around.</p>
<p>Now it appears that Cheltenham is aiming to more closely target entrepreneurs, investors and startups, especially given that the pandemic has seen talent thrown to the four winds, looking for better lifestyles and more access to nature. Smartly, it will be leveraging its association with the cybersecurity-oriented GCHQ.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In 2019, Cheltenham Borough Council spent £37.5 million purchasing 45 hectares of land adjacent to GCHQ, with the goal of capitalizing on the burgeoning cybersecurity and technology community.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OtfPdAZ7y3A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=1&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>After a year-long process, the council selected key partners as &#8220;preferred bidders&#8221; to deliver it – Factory and HBD (formerly Henry Boot Developments). The ambition is to grow the area to 200 hectares, which would make it one of the biggest tech startup campuses in Europe.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.factory.com/">Factory</a>, which developed large-scale tech campuses in Berlin and Lisbon, will partner with U.K. developer <a href="https://hbd.co.uk/">HBD</a> and the council to create the project currently dubbed <a href="https://www.goldenvalleyuk.com/">Golden Valley.</a></p>
<p>The development is projected to add 12,000 new jobs, 2 million square feet of offices and 3,700 new homes, and will be drawn on the Garden City status, building upon the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_city_movement">garden city movement</a> established in the late 19th century by Ebenezer Howard.</p>
<p>“This is a once-in-a-lifetime project &#8212; it’s unprecedented,&#8221; said Jeremy Bamberg, who will be leading the project locally for Factory. &#8220;By embracing tech, nature and innovation we’re working to transform the area into Europe’s most intelligent Garden District &#8212; creating an ideal alternative to chaotic city life.”</p>
<p>The first step of the project will be building Factory Cheltenham. As with Factory’s projects in Berlin and Lisbon, the architecture and design will led by Julian Breinersdorfer, who recently joined Factory to create an in-house offering for similar buildings and districts.</p>
<p>“We were looking for a partner to help the council make our ambitious plans a reality,&#8221; Tim Atkins from Cheltenham Borough Council said. &#8220;HBD and Factory have shown us how they share these goals and, more importantly, how these will be transformed into a living, breathing entity right here in Cheltenham that has a positive impact locally, whilst being a key part of the global cyber sector.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The week brought together both this quarter's earnings cycle and the Q3 IPO rush. So, it was just a little busy!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/c466ab16-5d47-4cc8-b3ee-66ee9f0a4c75?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>We were a smaller team this week, with <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> to sort through a week that brought together both this quarter&#8217;s earnings cycle and the Q3 IPO rush. So, it was just a little busy!</p>
<p>Before we get to topics, however, a note that we are having a lot of fun recording these live on Twitter Spaces. We&#8217;ve found a hacky way to capture local audio and also share the chats live. So, <a href="http://twitter.com/equitypod">hit us up on Twitter</a> so you can hang out with us. It&#8217;s fun &#8212; and we may even bring you up on stage to play guest host.</p>
<p>OK, now, to the Great List of Subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Robinhood went public!</strong> Yep, at long last, it is done. The company priced at $38 per share, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/robinhood-targets-ipo-valuation-up-to-35b-amid-warning-that-crypto-incomes-are-slipping/">the low end of its range</a>, and had a medium-weak day of trading once it started to float. In short, Robinhood seems to have deftly priced its IPO, leaving zero fat on the table. It&#8217;s now public and richer than ever. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/what-robinhoods-warnings-about-crypto-trading-say-about-coinbases-near-term-future/">More here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Earnings! </strong>We took a moment to chat about earnings reports <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/alphabet-crushes-q2-earnings-estimates-as-google-cloud-cuts-losses-grows-54/">from Alphabet</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/microsoft-bests-earnings-estimates-as-azure-posts-51-growth-shares-fall/">Microsoft</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/shopifys-q2-results-beat-estimates-as-e-commerce-shines/">and Shopify</a>. Why? Because we care lots about the cloud and platform companies. So, we took a minute to discuss public cloud results and what Shopify got up to.</li>
<li><strong>Batteries!</strong> Tesla is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/what-teslas-bet-on-iron-based-batteries-means-for-manufacturers/">moving toward iron-based batteries </a>and is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tesla-bhp-ink-supply-deal-for-nickel-ahead-of-demand-surge/">looking to source other materials direct</a>. At the same time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/">battery recycling is raising lots of cash</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/troubled-ev-company-lordstown-motors-gets-400m-lifeline-in-stock-sale-agreement/">Nikola is not dead</a>. We call it two truths and a lie.</li>
<li><strong>Unicorns and soon-to-be&#8217;s</strong>: Contentful <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/contenful-raises-175m-from/">raised $175M at a $3B valuation from Tiger</a> for its content delivery service; Squire, a barbershop tech platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/squire-a-barbershop-tech-platform-triples-its-valuation-again-with-tiger-global/">tripled its valuation (again) with Tiger Global (again);</a> and Class squashed acquisition rumors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/class-a-zoom-only-virtual-classroom-nears-unicorn-status-after-softbank-check/">with SoftBank Vision Fund II funding</a>,</li>
<li><strong>More venture rounds!</strong> To cap off our venture roundup, two neat healthtech investments stood out, namely rounds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/oova-raises-1-2m-to-develop-a-better-at-home-kit-for-detecting-a-womans-best-time-to-conceive/">from Oova</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/2182193/">and Peppy.</a> Both startups agree with the idea that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/">hormonal health is a massive yet nascent opportunity</a>. (We did an entire show about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/the-imbalanced-landscape-of-hormonal-health/?tpcc=ECTW2020">the imbalanced world of hormone startups</a> if you&#8217;re interested).</li>
<li>We ended on a musical note, which, luckily for you all, didn&#8217;t include us singing: Meet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/ascap-lab-highlights-a-quartet-of-early-stage-music-startups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a quartet of early-stage music startups.</span></a></li>

					<description><![CDATA[Any DevOps team can use Porter to manage applications in the cloud, delivering the full flexibility of Kubernetes through a Heroku-like experience.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By the time Porter co-founders Trevor Shim and Justin Rhee decided to build a company around DevOps, the pair were well versed in doing remote development on Kubernetes. And like other users, they were consistently getting burnt by the technology.</p>
<p>They realized that for all of the benefits, the technology was there, but users were having to manage the complexity of hosting solutions as well as incurring the costs associated with a big DevOps team, Rhee told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>They decided to build a solution externally and went through Y Combinator’s Summer 2020 batch, where they found other startup companies trying to do the same.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, Porter announced $1.5 million in seed funding from Venrock, Translink Capital, Soma Capital and several angel investors. Its goal is to build a platform as a service that any team can use to manage applications in its own cloud, essentially delivering the full flexibility of Kubernetes through a Heroku-like experience.</p>
<p>Why Heroku? It is the hosting platform that developers are used to, and not just small companies, but also later-stage companies. When they want to move to Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud or DigitalOcean, Porter will be that bridge, Shim said.</p>
<p>However, while Heroku is still popular, the pair said companies are thinking the platform is getting outdated because it is standing still technology-wise. Each year, companies move on from the platform due to technical limitations and cost, Rhee said.</p>
<p>A big part of the bet Porter is taking is not charging users for hosting, and its cost is a pure SaaS product, he said. They aren’t looking to be resellers, so companies can use their own cloud, but Porter will provide the automation and users can pay with their AWS and GCP credits, which gives them flexibility.</p>
<p>A common pattern is a move into Kubernetes, but “the zinger we talk about” is if Heroku was built in 2021, it would have been built on Kubernetes, Shim added.</p>
<p>“So we see ourselves as a successor’s successor,” he said.</p>
<p>To be that bridge, the company will use the new funding to increase its engineering bandwidth with the goal of “becoming the de facto standard for all startups.” Shim said.</p>
<p>Porter’s platform went live in February, and in six months became the sixth-fastest growing open-source platform download on GitHub, said Ethan Batraski, partner at Venrock. He met the company through YC and was “super impressed with Rhee’s and Shim’s vision.</p>
<p>“Heroku has 100,000 developers, but I believe it has stagnated,” Batraski added. “Porter already has 100 startups on its platform. The growth they’ve seen — four or five times — is what you want to see at this stage.”</p>
<p>His firm has long focused on data infrastructure and is seeing the stack get more complex, saying “at the same time, more developers are wanting to build out an app over a week, and scale it to millions of users, but that takes people resources. With Kubernetes it can turn everyone into an expert developer without them knowing it.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Gopuff said it plans to use the funding to continue expanding in North America, the U.K. and Europe, among other things.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://gopuff.com/">Gopuff</a>, the startup that&#8217;s helped kickstart a new category of food delivery in the U.S. &#8212; &#8220;instant&#8221; delivery of essential groceries and other home goods for a flat fee of $1.95, 24 hours a day &#8212; has closed a huge tranche of funding to help it scale its service further across the country and globe. It&#8217;s raised $1 billion in a Series H round that values the Philadelphia-based company at $15 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">New backers include Blackstone’s Horizons platform, Guggenheim Investments, Hedosophia and Adage Capital. Previous backers Fidelity Management and Research Company, Softbank Vision Fund 1, Atreides Management and Eldridge also participated in the round.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This news confirms our scoop of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/filing-instant-grocery-startup-gopuff-is-raising-750m-more-at-a-13-5b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week</a>, when we reported on this Series H as it was still being closed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Gopuff said it plans to use the funding to continue expanding in North America, the U.K. (where it has already <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210506006037/en/Gopuff-Jumpstarts-International-Expansion-with-Acquisition-of-UK-Based-Fancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> one company, Fancy, and, sources tell us, is acquiring another, Dija) and Europe; on more hiring; and to continue building out the tech platform that bridges an ecosystem that includes customers, drivers, suppliers and distribution centers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It currently operates 450 sites across North America and the U.K., which includes more than 285 dark stores (or &#8220;micro-fulfillment centers,&#8221; in Gopuff&#8217;s words), plus more than 185 retailers by way of its acquisition of BevMo earlier this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the reasons that Gopuff has raised such a large sum is that building out a food-based, logistics-fueled transportation business along all of those parameters is capital-intensive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But also, that effort to grow is coming amid a strong surge of competition. Getir, out of Turkey, backed by Sequoia and others and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recently valued at $7.5 billion</a>, is also aggressively expanding. And just looking at Europe, there is a wave of others &#8212; such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flink</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorillas</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glovo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/zapp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zapp</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/cajoo-promises-grocery-deliveries-in-15-minutes/">Cajoo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weezy</a> &#8212; also bulking up their bank accounts to throw their delivery bags into the ring. (In the U.S., established delivery giants like DoorDash will also be moving deeper into Gopuff&#8217;s territory.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gopuff believes it can give all of these and others a run for their money. Founded back in 2013 by Rafael Ilishayev and Yakir Gola &#8212; now co-CEOs &#8212; while they were still in university to fill a gap they saw in the market for students like themselves, Gopuff has expanded well beyond that by catering to anyone looking for a quick and relatively low-cost way of getting essential goods without physically going out to get those items themselves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a stretch of time when many of us were either being ordered by our municipal governments or acting on our own decisions to stay in place to curtail the spread of COVID-19, Gopuff&#8217;s star rose quickly as an easy way of complying without compromising our consumerist tendencies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But companies like Turkey&#8217;s Getir &#8212; which has been around for years and is also building out a model of &#8220;instant&#8221; delivery of essential goods &#8212; have demonstrated that there is staying power to the concept, and that is what Gopuff is betting on, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<span class="il">Gopuff</span> has quietly built a very strong business and solidified itself as the leading player, continuing to define this evolving category,” Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer of Guggenheim Investments, said in a statement. “Rafael and Yakir are focused on maintaining fiscal responsibility while having the ability to successfully execute on strategic growth opportunities. This measured approach along with <span class="il">Gopuff</span>’s impressive offering has only just scratched the surface. We are thrilled to support this incredibly strong company and look forward to being part of <span class="il">Gopuff</span>’s journey and continued expansion.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Part of Gopuff&#8217;s strategy has been to augment the basic instant delivery of essentials with more efficient distribution along with a wider vision of what constitutes &#8220;essentials.&#8221;</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">So in addition to building out more localized “dark” stores to more easily distribute goods to customers who buy them, that has included starting “Gopuff kitchens” to make and deliver ready-made food; buying alcohol retailer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/gopuff-acquires-bevmo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BevMo for $350 million</a> in November 2020; and acquiring more logistics technology in the form of buying <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/delivery-service-gopuff-acquires-rideos-for-115-million-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rideOS for $115 million</a>.</p>
<p>Gopuff has been on a fundraising tear to finance all of this. It was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/gopuff-new-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only in March</a> that it raised $1.15 billion at an $8.9 billion valuation, which came just months after a $380 million round at a $3.8 billion valuation. Together, the three most recent rounds total around $2.5 billion in funding in the space of 10 months, and the idea here seems to be that there may be more of where that came from.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As <span class="il">Gopuff</span> continues to define the Instant Needs economy, we are thrilled to have new leading global partners onboard, along with the support of our longtime investors,&#8221; Ilishayev said in a statement. &#8220;This funding round is further validation of the success of our model and will enable us to continue to do what we do best: deliver an unmatched customer experience.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We have truly doubled down on our key business priorities, accelerating our geographic expansion by entering new markets in the U.S. and abroad, innovating for our customers, and continuing to invest heavily in our technology, our people, and our partners,&#8221; Gola added. &#8220;We look forward to continuing to enhance the customer experience and to bring the magic of <span class="il">Gopuff</span> to new customers around the world.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Catch is working to make sure that every gig worker has the health and retirement benefits they need.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.catch.co/">Catch</a> is working to make sure that every gig worker has the health and retirement benefits they need.</p>
<p>The company, which is in the midst of moving its headquarters to New York, sells health insurance, retirement savings plans and tax withholding directly to freelancers, contractors or anyone uncovered.</p>
<p>It is now armed with a fresh round of $12 million in Series A funding, led by Crosslink, with participation from earlier investors Khosla Ventures, NYCA Partners, Kindred Ventures and Urban Innovation Fund, to support more distribution partnerships and its relocation from Boston.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Co-founders Kristen Anderson and Andrew Ambrosino started Catch in 2019 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/21/catch-benefits/">raised $6.1 million</a> previously, giving it a total of $18.1 million in funding.</p>
<p>It took the Catch team of 15 nearly two years to get approvals to sell its platform in 38 states on the federal marketplace. Anderson boasts that only eight companies have been able to do this, and three of them — Catch included — are approved to sell benefits to consumers.</p>
<p>“More companies are not offering healthcare, while more people are joining the creator and gig economies, which means more people are not following an employer-led model,” Anderson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The age of an average Catch customer is 32, and in addition to current offerings, they were asking the company to help them set up income sources, like setting aside money for taxes, retirement and medical leave without having to actively save.</p>
<p>When the global pandemic hit, many of Catch’s customers saw their income collapse 40% overall across industries, as workers like hairstylists and cooks had income go down to zero in some cases.</p>
<p>It was then that Anderson and Ambrosino began looking at partnership distribution and developed a network of platforms, business facilitation tools, gig marketplaces and payroll companies that were interested in offering Catch. The company intends to use some of the funding to increase its headcount to service those partnerships and go after more, Anderson said.</p>
<p>Catch is one startup providing insurance products, and many of its competitors do a single offering and do it well, like Starship does with health savings accounts, Anderson said. Catch is taking a different approach by offering a platform experience, but going deep on the process, she added. She likens it to Gusto, which provides cloud-based payroll, benefits and human resource management for businesses, in that Catch is an end-to-end experience, but with a focus on an individual person.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the company’s user base tripled, driven by people taking on second jobs and through a partnership with DoorDash. Platform users are also holding onto five times their usual balances, a result of setting more goals and needing to save more, Anderson said. Retirement investments and health insurance have grown similarly.</p>
<p>Going forward, Anderson is already thinking about a Series B, but that won’t come for another couple of years, she said. The company is looking into its own HSA product as well as disability insurance and other products to further differentiate it from other startups, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/insurtech-startup-spot-brings-in-17-5m-equity-debt-to-fill-insurance-gaps-for-accidental-injuries/">Spot</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/meet-super-mx-the-mexico-city-based-insurtech-that-raised-7-2m-from-vcs-and-unicorn-ceos/">Super.mx</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/khosla-ventures-leads-evens-5m-seed-to-give-india-the-kind-of-healthcare-their-insurance-doesnt/">Even,</a> all of which raised venture capital this month to provide benefits.</p>
<p>Catch would also like to serve a broader audience than just those on the federal marketplace. The co-founders are working on how to do this — Anderson mentioned there are some “nefarious companies out there” offering medical benefits at rates that can seem too good to be true, but when the customer reads the fine print, they discover that certain medical conditions are not covered.</p>
<p>“We are looking at how to put the right thing in there because it does get confusing,” Anderson added. “Young people have cheaper options, which means they need to make sure they know what they are getting.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the African telecoms operator said it has secured another investment for its mobile money arm. The investor?

The Middle Eastern corporation is set to invest $200 million into AMC BV through a secondary </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of shares from Airtel Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMC BV is an Airtel Africa subsidiary and the holding company for several of Airtel Africa’s mobile money operations across 14 African countries, including Kenya, Uganda and Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

The remaining $50 million will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be invested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the second close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airtel Africa claims QIA will hold a minority stake while it continues to hold the majority stake. This transaction still values Airtel Africa at $2.65 billion on a cash and debt-free basis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, what&#8217;s different this time is that QIA </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is entitled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to appoint a director to AMC BV&#8217;s board and &#8220;to certain customary information and minority protection rights</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airtel Africa&#8217;s most recent report for Q1 2021 shows signs of growth. The telecoms operator saw year-on-year revenue growth of 53.7%, pushed by 24.6% growth in customer base to 23.1 million. Transaction value went up 64.4% to $14.7 billion ($59 billion annualized), and EBITDA stood at $60 million ($240 million annualized) at a margin of 48.8%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also generated $124 million in revenue ($496 million annualized), while its profits before tax for Q1 2021 stood at $185 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mansoor bin Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud, CEO of QIA, said the sovereign wealth fund&#8217;s investment in Airtel Africa would help promote financial inclusion in sub-Saharan Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Airtel Money plays a critical role in facilitating economic activity, including for customers without access to traditional financial services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">firmly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> believe in its mission to expand these efforts over the coming years,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, Airtel Africa first made it known that it wanted to sell a minority stake in AMC BV to raise cash and sell off some assets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> month, it sold telecommunication towers in Madagascar and Malawi to Helios Towers for $119 million and raised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $500 million from outside investors.</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">On Tuesday, the Open Cap Table Coalition announced its launch <a href="https://medium.com/@opencaptable/announcing-the-open-cap-table-coalition-6c2764396e71">through an inaugural Medium post</a>. The goal of this project is to standardize startup capitalization table data as well as make it far more accessible, transparent and portable.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with a cap table, it’s a list of who owns your company’s securities, which includes your company shares, options and more. A clear and simple cap table should quickly indicate who owns what and how much of it they own. For a variety of reasons (sometimes inexperience or bad advice) too many equity holders often find companies&#8217; capitalization information to be opaque and not easily accessible.</p>
<p>This is particularly important for the small percentage of startups that survive in the long term, as growth makes for far more complicated cap tables.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A critical part of good startup hygiene is to always have a clean and updated cap table. Since there is no set format and cap tables are generally not out in the open, they are often siloed rather than collaborative.</p>
<p>Cap tables are near and dear to me as someone who has advised hundreds of startups over the past two decades as the founder of an accelerator, a venture partner and a senior adviser at a government-funded startup launchpad. I have been on the shareholder side of the equation as well and can assure you that pretty much nothing destroys trust between shareholders and startups quicker than poor communication, especially around issues such as the current status of the cap table.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			A critical part of good startup hygiene is to always have a clean and updated cap table. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I really like the idea of a cap table being an open corporate record, because the value proposition to the companies is clear. From the time a startup creates a cap table, it’s prone to inaccuracy, friction and mistakes. What this means in practice is that startups may spend money on cap-table-related issues that they should be spending on other things. From a legal process perspective, the law firm that is brought in to help with these issues has to deal with tedious back-end work, so the legal time isn&#8217;t high value for either the startup or the law firm.</p>
<p>The value proposition for equity holders is equally clear. All equity holders have a general and legal interest in a company’s capitalization information. They have the right to this information, which they may need for a variety of reasons (including, if things ever get really bad, an aggrieved shareholder action). So making this information clear and easily accessible is a service to equity holders and can also encourage more investment, especially from less experienced investors.</p>
<p>When I imagine what this project could become in the next couple of years, I think back to late 2013, when Y Combinator announced the SAFE (simple agreement for future equity). I think the SAFE is a good analogy here, as no one knew what it was and people wondered if this was a nice-to-have rather than a must-have for startups. But the end result was a dramatic improvement in the early-stage capital-raising process.</p>
<p>While the coalition’s founders include Morgan Stanley’s Shareworks, LTSE Software and Carta, it’s also heavy on Big Law, with Cooley, Goodwin Procter, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, Orrick, Gunderson Dettmer, Latham &amp; Watkins, and Fenwick &amp; West rounding out the group of 10 founding members.</p>
<p>So what’s the real motivation of seven law firms, which together saw revenue of over $10 billion in 2020 to collaborate on an open cap table product for startups? Deal flow.</p>
<p>Big Law has been trying for a couple of decades to build relationships with startups at the stage where it makes no sense for a startup to be dealing with a massive and expensive law firm. Their efforts to build startup programs have often fallen short and received mixed reviews. They have also been far too heavy on the self-serve and too light on the &#8220;we’re going to give you our regular Big Law level of services at a small fraction of the costs just in case you make it big and can one day pay our regular fees.&#8221; So these firms are trying to separate themselves from the rest of the Big Law pack by building this entrepreneur-friendly tech.</p>
<p>The coalition has already produced its initial version of the open cap table. The real question is whether this is going to be a big deal, as the SAFE was, or whether it’s going to be a vanity solution in search of a real problem. My best guess is that if this coalition gets all the relationships right, doesn’t get greedy and understands that there is a social good component at play here, this could be, reasonably quickly, as impactful as the SAFE was.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 29, 2021. Between the IPO cycle and earnings it has been <em>quite</em> the day. And Nikola’s founder was indicted on three counts of fraud. It’s busy! Let’s get into it! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3 (OK, four, but it’s about Scarlett Johansson)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/nikola-founder-trevor-milton-indicted-on-three-counts-of-fraud/">Nikola founder indicted on fraud charges:</a> </strong>From the <em>you saw this coming</em> files, former Nikola CEO and walking bottle of Mountain Dew Trevor Milton was indicted on three counts of fraud. Per the federal indictment unsealed by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan on Thursday, the former exec “engaged in a fraudulent scheme to deceive retail investors.” Not a great day for SPACs, frankly.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/microsoft-in-talks-to-back-india-oyo/"><strong>Microsoft may invest in hotel unicorn OYO:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Here’s an odd one. Microsoft, the U.S. software giant, may invest in OYO, the India-based hotels startup that raised capital from SoftBank’s first Vision Fund. Why? Per our reporting, there may be some sort of cloud deal in the mix. Both parties are staying mum for now.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/">The Latin American startup market is hitting its stride:</a> </strong>On the back of an epic boom in venture investment, founders in Latin America are finally getting their due, investors told TechCrunch. Between locally sourced capital, external funds and economies in the region that are increasingly digitally enabled, it’s a bullish time to build in the region.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/scarlett-johansson-files-suit-over-disney-black-widow-release/">Scarlett Johansson files suit over Disney+ ‘Black Widow’ release:</a></strong> The actress alleges Disney breached its agreement with her when it released the Marvel flick on streaming service Disney+ at the same time it landed in theaters. Johansson’s attorneys say Disney is “hiding behind COVID-19,” but with the delta variant being very much a problem, we must say we’d prefer to observe our Avengers films from our couches for the time being.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/tenderly-raises-15-3m-to-help-ethereum-developers-ship-decentralized-apps-faster/"><strong>Tenderly wants more dApps:</strong></a> Decentralized apps, or dApps, are a big category in the larger blockchain economy. And Tenderly, a startup that just raised $15.3 million, wants folks to build more of them. The company has built a “a developer platform for Ethereum devs to monitor and test the smart contracts that power their decentralized apps.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/colombias-merqueo-bags-50m-to-expand-its-online-grocery-delivery-service-across-latin-america/"><strong>Online grocery continues to attract capital:</strong></a> This time it’s Merqueo, which operates an on-demand service in Latin America. Between grocery delivery and so-called “instant” grocery startups, lots of capital is finding its way into the business of bringing food to folks’ houses. Merqueo just raised a $50 million Series C for its efforts.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/colombias-la-haus-secures-100m-in-debt-equity/">La Haus raises $100M for its online real estate marketplace:</a> </strong>La Haus is a Colombian startup, as is Merqueo. See, we told you that Latin America was busy! In this case, La Haus raised $50 million in equity capital and $50 million in debt. Per our reporting, the company saw “transactions conducted on its Mexico portal climb by nearly 10x in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the 2020 second quarter.” Not bad!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/talkiatry-lands-20m-series-a-to-go-all-in-on-in-network-psychiatric-care/"><strong>More money for mental health:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Talkiatry announced earlier today that it has raised a $20 million Series A led by Left Lane Capital. The startup wants to make psychiatry services available through insurance providers and has partnered with a host of them. Anything to make mental health care easier and cheaper for consumers is good by us.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/hello-divorce-raises-2m-so-that-couples-can-say-good-bye-easier/"><strong>Hello Divorce raises $2M so your divorce won’t cost $2M:</strong></a> Getting divorced is about as much fun as putting broken glass in your shoe while taking a hike. At least that’s what our friends have told us. Hello Divorce wants to make the whole process better. Given that divorce is something that happens rather often to lots of folks, it certainly won’t lack for TAM.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/student-labor-marketplace-pangea-closes-2m-seed-round/"><strong>Pangea raises $2M for its student labor marketplace:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Hailing from Providence, Rhode Island, Pangea announced a seed round today. The company’s service connects digitally savvy college students with businesses looking for freelance talent. GMV is rising at the company, and now it has more capital in its accounts than ever. Let’s see how it grows the rest of the year.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/summit-invests-215m-into-odoo-an-open-source-business-management-software-developer-at-a-2-3b-valuation/"><strong>Odoo sells $215M of its stock:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Now worth over €2 billion, Odoo, an open-source business management software play, is the first unicorn out of Wallonia, a region in Belgium. The round was purely secondary, notably. The company provides most of its software for free, while charging for certain features.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/employee-engagement-platform-culture-amp-raises-100m-at-a-1-5b-valuation/"><strong>Employee-success startup CultureAmp raises $100M:</strong></a> The startup, which was founded to let companies poll their workers, is now worth $150 million. You can think of it as management analytics, providing “turnover prediction and team goal tracking,” per our own reporting.</li>
<li>In case you were looking for something entirely different, we present a <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/nothing-ear-1-review/">review of Nothing’s new earpods</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Livestream e-commerce: Why companies and brands need to tune in</h2>
<p>This year, livestream viewers in China are projected to spend more than $60 billion on digital shopping experiences where they can interact with influencers in real time.</p>
<p>Promoting everything from cosmetics to food, social media stars use Taobao, TikTok and other platforms to tout products and answer live questions.</p>
<p>On Taobao&#8217;s Single’s Day Global Shopping Festival in 2020, livestreams racked up $6 billion in sales, twice as much revenue as the year prior.</p>
<p>Sensing a trend, Western startups are getting in on the action, with companies like Whatnot and PopShop.Live raising rounds to build out their infrastructure. Looking forward, Alanna Gregory, senior global director at Afterpay, says she foresees four major trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Networks.</li>
<li>SaaS streaming tools.</li>
<li>Host discovery and outreach tools.</li>
<li>Host marketplaces and agencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;For brands, SaaS streaming tools will be the most impactful way to take advantage of livestream commerce trends,&#8221; Gregory writes in an Extra Crunch guest post. &#8220;All of this will be incredibly transformative.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>We went a bit long on the startup side of things, so let’s be brief when it comes to Big Tech.</p>
<ul>
<li>First up, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/amazons-fire-tv-cube-now-supports-zoom-calls-on-your-tv/">Amazon’s FireTV Cube now supports Zoom</a>. Everything should support Zoom. Zoom is good. So, it’s both unsurprising and welcome that Amazon is building out greater integration with the video chat provider.</li>
<li>Next, Facebook’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/facebooks-next-product-will-be-its-long-awaited-ray-ban-smart-glasses/">next product</a> will be a collab with Ray-Ban to build smart glasses. How you feel about this bit of news will depend on what you think about Facebook, but as a former Google Glass fan I suppose I am willing to wait to make judgment.</li>
<li>PayPal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/paypals-new-super-app-is-ready-to-launch-will-also-include-messaging/">has a super app in the wings</a>, a service that will include messaging. Do we want this? I don’t know, but super apps &#8212; mobile applications that encompass a wide range of services in a single package &#8212; are big around the world, so why not here in U.S. as well?</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last quarter, Chromebooks saw 275% year-over-year growth up to 12 million units. The figure isn’t quite as unwieldy for Q2, but a 75% year-over-year growth is still extremely respectable, with the category hitting 11.9 million shipments, <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/worldwide-pc-market-q2-2021?ctid=2161-0aed8a9c8d78ede020d78051fa8ee9b4">per the latest</a> figures from research firm, Canalys.</p>
<p>Chromebooks joined the rest of the PC market in getting an overall bump from the pandemic. Standard tablets and PCs saw healthy increases as consumers scrambled to create work from home setups, while Google’s OS got an even larger rise as schools implemented remote learning.</p>
<p>As schools in a number of locations have reopened more than a year into the pandemic, however, Chromebook sales are still hot. Google is certainly looking to capitalize on that success by once again attempting to extend the operating system’s reach beyond its educational foothold.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is clearly eyeing the enterprise segment, which may be welcoming of systems that are both easy to deploy and lock down.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183922" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183922" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2183922" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-29-at-5.59.17-PM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="535" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-29-at-5.59.17-PM.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-29-at-5.59.17-PM.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-29-at-5.59.17-PM.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-29-at-5.59.17-PM.jpg?resize=768,401 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-29-at-5.59.17-PM.jpg?resize=680,355 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-29-at-5.59.17-PM.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183922" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canalys</p></div></p>
<p>“With Chrome’s hold over the education space relatively secure, Google is set to bet big on the commercial segment this year,” Canalys’ Brian Lynch said in a statement. We expect to see a strong focus on attracting small businesses with updated services, such as the new ‘Individual’ subscription tier for Google Workspace and promotions on CloudReady licenses to repurpose old PCs for deployment alongside existing Chromebook fleets.”</p>
<p>After the launch of multiple M1-based systems, Apple, too, is making a big play for business. The company recently launched a new<a href="https://www.apple.com/business/it/"> Apple at Work site</a>.</p>
<p>“Whether your organization has 10 devices or 10,000, Apple fits easily into your existing infrastructure,” the company writes of its new IT efforts. “Zero-touch deployment allows IT to configure and manage remotely, and IT can tailor the setup process to any team. So every Mac, iPad, iPhone and Apple TV is ready to go from the start.”</p>
<p>With Windows 11 arriving later this year, Microsoft will no doubt be making its own case to maintain dominance over the office — remote and otherwise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Varda Space Industries has raised a $42 million Series A to bring to manufacturing a key capability that can only be found off-world: microgravity.</p>
<p>The eight-month-old startup is looking to establish its first manufacturing facility in space as early as 2023, and by doing so, bring back to Earth advanced products that can only be made under sustained periods of zero gravity.</p>
<p>The round was led by Khosla Ventures and Caffeinated Capital, with participation from existing investors Lux Capital, General Catalyst and Founders Fund. It pushes the company’s total raise thus far to over $50 million, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/space-manufacturing-startup-varda-incubated-at-founders-fund-emerges-with-9-million-in-funding/">$9 million seed round</a> last December.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://varda.com/">Varda’s</a> idea is different than that of Jeff Bezos, who said after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">his own trip</a> to space earlier this month that he wants to “move all heavy industry and all polluting industry off Earth.” The company’s co-founders, SpaceX veteran Will Bruey and Founders Fund principal Delian Asparouhov, aren’t imagining cement mixers and steel plants in orbit. Instead, they want to open up manufacturing processes that aren’t possible on Earth, in order to make bioprinted organs, fiber-optic cables or pharmaceuticals — products that require fundamentally different conditions than what’s available on-planet.</p>
<h2>Building the space factory of the future</h2>
<p>The value of microgravity manufacturing, Bruey and Asparouhov say, can be found with the International Space Station, essentially a scientific outpost. A steady stream of research has emerged from the ISS over the last few decades showing that novel materials and products are possible in space. But until now, getting, staying in and returning from orbit has been too costly to consider scaling these findings.</p>
<p>“In a way, a lot of our R&amp;D has already been done for us in the public sector, and we&#8217;re essentially a ramp toward commercialization for that research that’s already been proven out,” Bruey told TechCrunch.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Space manufacturing startup Varda, incubated at Founders Fund, emerges with $9 million in funding&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/space-manufacturing-startup-varda-incubated-at-founders-fund-emerges-with-9-million-in-funding/embed/#?secret=e0fybT6CE5" data-secret="e0fybT6CE5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Right now, the company is building a three-module spacecraft comprised of an off-the-shelf satellite platform, a center platform where the microgravity manufacturing will take place, and a reentry vehicle to bring the materials back to Earth. For the first 10 or so launches, Bruey said Varda would build the products itself. Once the company has established that its process is reliable and cheap, he added that in the long term the goal is to become a contract manufacturing platform for other companies wanting to build products in space.</p>
<p>Asparouhov likened it to the iPhone and the App Store: “The iPhone didn’t come out with the App Store. Apple developed the first 10 or 11 apps to share the value of that. So we&#8217;re developing those first few apps ourselves to show the value in this commercial capability that we&#8217;re bringing to market, but over time, we will start to release an app store.”</p>
<p>One key part of Varda’s plan is to make all of the manufacturing automated. By keeping humans out of the picture (at least for now), the company is able to reduce critical overhead by skipping human-rated spacecraft development (and the associated safety concerns with crewed launches).</p>

<p>“I think that what investors, NASA and the [Department of Defense], really see as exciting about our approach is that in comparison to everyone else that&#8217;s ever discussed ‘space manufacturing,’ we&#8217;re by far the most near-term, pragmatic, commercially viable approach, launching and producing materials less than 18 months from now, as opposed to plans that are typically five years, 10 years, decades away from being viable,” Asparouhov said.</p>
<p>He added that one way to think about space manufacturing is that there is a certain dollar per unit-mass that Varda will need to spend to get things up to microgravity, and a dollar per unit-mass of value from manufacturing in microgravity. The key to profitability is finding the products that maximizes the difference between these two equations. Novel pharmaceuticals, for example, could yield massive profits if the innovation gains from zero gravity are correspondingly high.</p>
<p>The company is imagining “multiple missions” in 2023, Bruey said, and then moving to once per quarter and even imagining multiple reentry capsules returning with products per day. The Varda co-founders are convinced that the scale of demand for novel space-made products is potentially high enough to meet this kind of launch and reentry schedule.</p>
<p>Compared to a burgeoning industry like space tourism, Bruey said the space manufacturing has the potential to positively affect a much higher portion of humanity.</p>
<p>“It will touch many different parts of humanity&#8217;s experience out here on Earth, with significant improvements in quality of life,” he said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Startups and SMBs are usually the first to adopt many SaaS products. But as these customers grow in size and complexity — and as you rope in larger organizations — scaling your infrastructure for the enterprise becomes critical for success.</p>
<p>Below are four tips on how to advance your company’s infrastructure to support and grow with your largest customers.</p>
<h2>Address your customers’ security and reliability needs</h2>
<p>If you’re building SaaS, odds are you’re holding very important customer data. Regardless of what you build, that makes you a threat vector for attacks on your customers. While security is important for all customers, the stakes certainly get higher the larger they grow.</p>
<p>Given the stakes, it’s paramount to build infrastructure, products and processes that address your customers’ growing security and reliability needs. That includes the ethical and moral obligation you have to make sure your systems and practices meet and exceed any claim you make about security and reliability to your customers.</p>
<p>Here are security and reliability requirements large customers typically ask for:</p>
<p><strong>Formal SLAs around uptime:</strong> If you’re building SaaS, customers expect it to be available all the time. Large customers using your software for mission-critical applications will expect to see formal SLAs in contracts committing to 99.9% uptime or higher. As you build infrastructure and product layers, you need to be confident in your uptime and be able to measure uptime on a per customer basis so you know if you’re meeting your contractual obligations.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			While it’s hard to prioritize asks from your largest customers, you’ll find that their collective feedback will pull your product roadmap in a specific direction.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><strong>Real-time status of your platform:</strong> Most larger customers will expect to see your platform’s historical uptime and have real-time visibility into events and incidents as they happen. As you mature and specialize, creating this visibility for customers also drives more collaboration between your customer operations and infrastructure teams. This collaboration is valuable to invest in, as it provides insights into how customers are experiencing a particular degradation in your service and allows for you to communicate back what you found so far and what your ETA is.</p>
<p><strong>Backups:</strong> As your customers grow, be prepared for expectations around backups — not just in terms of how long it takes to recover the whole application, but also around backup periodicity, location of your backups and data retention (e.g., are you holding on to the data too long?). If you’re building your backup strategy, thinking about future flexibility around backup management will help you stay ahead of these asks.</p>
