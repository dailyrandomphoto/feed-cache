										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has launched SN10 – the tenth iteration of its current prototype series of Starship, the heavy-lift reusable spacecraft it&#8217;s developing. Starship SN10 took off from Boca Chica, Texas, where SpaceX is developing the vehicle. It flew to a height of roughly 10 km or 32,000 feet, before performing a maneuver to re-orient itself for a friction-assisted landing descent.</p>
<p>Unlike the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/spacexs-starship-prototype-once-again-flies-to-great-heights-and-again-explodes-on-landing/"> last two Starship prototypes to fly this high</a>, however, the roughly 6 minute flight did not end in a fireball <em>[<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Well, not immediately. The rocket did blow up while stationary on the landing pad a few minutes after landing, potentially due to a leak]</em>. Instead, it completed its landing flip maneuver as intended and slowed itself for a soft touchdown, with the rocket remaining vertical and intact afterwards.</p>
<p>This was a fantastic outcome, and a nominal one in all regards according to SpaceX&#8217;s live stream. But why the prior explosions to get to this point? That&#8217;s partly down to the way in which it&#8217;s being doing its development of this vehicle. All rocket development includes unexpected events and sub-optimal outcomes, but SpaceX has a couple of things at work that mean is efforts are subject to unusual scrutiny vs. your average spaceship manufacturer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NOZ14MYxh5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/spacexs-starship-prototype-once-again-flies-to-great-heights-and-again-explodes-on-landing/">SpaceX&#8217;s Starship prototype once again flies to great heights, and again explodes on landing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SpaceX&#8217;s Starship prototype once again flies to great heights, and again explodes on landing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/spacexs-starship-prototype-once-again-flies-to-great-heights-and-again-explodes-on-landing/embed/#?secret=NOZ14MYxh5" data-secret="NOZ14MYxh5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>First, it&#8217;s doing this out in the open – the Boca Chica facility is basically just a couple small buildings, some concrete pads, some storage tanks and some scaffolding. It&#8217;s extremely close to a public roadway (which is closed during testing, while the surrounding area is evacuated), and people can and do just drive up and set up cameras to film what&#8217;s going on. That&#8217;s not at all how legacy rocket makers have typically done things.</p>
<p>Second, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has been adamant that SpaceX pursue a development strategy of rapid iteration and prototyping with Starship&#8217;s development. That has meant it&#8217;s manufacturing and assembling Starship prototypes simultaneously, making small changes as it goes, rather than stepping back after each test and doing a prolonged, multi-month analysis before proceeding with building and flying another version.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/starship-sn-10-takeoff.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2120737" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/starship-sn-10-takeoff.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="556" /></a></p>
<p>A launch attempt earlier in the day was cut short after a brief engine fire, when instrument readings from the rocket showed a slightly high thrust value that violated what Musk termed &#8220;conservative.&#8221; The fix that SpaceX instituted was actually adjusting the limit higher in order to avoid the abort initiation.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="I6bKk589Wu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/spacex-flies-its-starship-rocket-to-40000-feet-just-misses-the-landing-in-explosive-finale/">SpaceX flies its Starship rocket to 40,000 feet, just misses the landing in explosive finale</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SpaceX flies its Starship rocket to 40,000 feet, just misses the landing in explosive finale&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/spacex-flies-its-starship-rocket-to-40000-feet-just-misses-the-landing-in-explosive-finale/embed/#?secret=I6bKk589Wu" data-secret="I6bKk589Wu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Pending an investigation into the cause of the explosion that followed the successful flight and landing maneuver, next up for Starship is likely increasing the height of these test flights. Eventually, the goal is to reach orbit of course, but SpaceX is likely to try a few launches that remain atmospheric but far exceed this one before it attempts making that trip.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Aston Martin DBX is the brand&#8217;s first SUV &#8212; and the stakes for the iconic British luxury car maker couldn&#8217;t be higher.</p>
<p>Like Astons before it, the DBX is objectively handsome. Its sculptural form stretches out to unapologetic ample proportions, and stands out in the crowd of SUVs that frequent the private-school pickup lane. It&#8217;s an opulent design that scores high on aesthetics, performance and character. It&#8217;s also a vehicle that arrives late to the ultra premium SUV segment, and lacks the in-car technology and fuel economy of others of its ilk. Sales of the DBX, which starts at $176,900, began overseas last summer and entered the U.S. market in late 2020. (The version Aston Martin provided to TechCrunch for a test drive had the option-loaded retail price of $205,186 DBX, including delivery fees.)</p>
<p>Call it a tale of two vehicles in a time of dueling principles vying for luxury auto buyer budgets. Demand for SUVs continues to skyrocket, just as the mobility sector inclines sharply toward electrification. Aston Martin set a goal of selling 14,000 vehicles by 2023, a steep hike for a small, boutique brand. However, under new leadership, the company has dialed back those projections to 10,000 as part of its reorganization dubbed &#8220;Project Horizon.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After an underwhelming year due to the pandemic, a new major owner and a new CEO are in place. It&#8217;s unclear which narrative will determine the DBX&#8217;s fate. The future of the company rests on its success.</p>
<p>Aston Martin said the DBX met sales expectations in 2020, with 1,516 units sold. The company anticipates that the DBX will make up 40% to 60% of global volume in 2021 — its first year of full production.</p>
<h2>A tale of two vehicles</h2>
<p>How to achieve best-in-class tech in both engineering and in-car experience is a quagmire for low-volume supercar makers who aren&#8217;t owned by a larger automaker that can lend that expertise. Aston took steps to solve this problem through an agreement reached with Mercedes-Benz AG to develop engines and electric architecture back in 2013. Tobias Moers, who headed up Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s AMG division until last summer, is Aston&#8217;s new CEO, a clue on how vital Aston still sees Daimler&#8217;s technical performance to its future.</p>
<p>Aston Martin has recently reentered Formula One racing, and true to the brand&#8217;s motorsports history, the DBX has sports car-like power, sprinting from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 4.3 seconds, using Mercedes-Benz AMG engines.</p>
<p>On the interior, the DBX scores high as a total sensory experience to drive (and floss in), affording its passengers panache and comfort, all swathed in Bridge of Weir leather. There are nifty options such as a snow pack, complete with a ski boot warmer.</p>

<p>The other half of this product&#8217;s interior story raises more pragmatic questions about the role of in-car tech in the super luxury segment, and gets at the crux of Aston&#8217;s dilemma. Aston will always be at least one generation behind the latest Mercedes advancements. For a vehicle with a starting price of $180,000, cars that cost half the price have more advanced in-car features.</p>
<h2>User experience</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aston Martin DBX is equipped with COMAND, an infotainment system that Mercedes introduced in 1998, refreshed in 2014 and updated again in 2016. When it comes to tech, a few years feels like a lifetime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge is that it&#8217;s not as simple as replacing a head-unit, Nathan Hoyt, a spokesperson for Aston Martin, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The car would need to be revised to work a whole new electrical architecture&#8221; he said. &#8220;That said, the closer alignment we previously announced between Mercedes and Aston Martin means we will continue using MB technology for the foreseeable future.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Aston Martin is saddled with an older system, Mercedes-Benz has since moved on to MBUX, a new more technologically advanced infotainment system that was introduced in 2018 and has already been updated. No word on when MBUX will find its way to Aston Martin products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In practical terms, that means a 2021 luxury vehicle that&#8217;s missing a touchscreen. What&#8217;s in its place is far too much clunky plastic to be called classic analog, which perhaps would make more sense. Think Mac keyboard, circa 2014. Apple CarPlay is standard on the DBX, but it lacks Android Auto.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of slick knobs, there are plastic buttons that seem out of step with the rest of the vehicle&#8217;s swanky naturally sourced woods. Plastic is also present on the air vents and gear selector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fairness, the everything-but-the-kitchen sink isn&#8217;t the best solution to in-car technology. Many carmakers have far too much frustrating and tactile tech on the dash that isn&#8217;t intuitive.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120563" style="width: 6010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aston-martin-dbx-hyper-red-a1-aml-213-jpg..jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120563" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2120563 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aston-martin-dbx-hyper-red-a1-aml-213-jpg..jpg" alt="aston-martin-dbx-hyper-red-a1-aml-213-jpg." width="6000" height="4003" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aston-martin-dbx-hyper-red-a1-aml-213-jpg..jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aston-martin-dbx-hyper-red-a1-aml-213-jpg..jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aston-martin-dbx-hyper-red-a1-aml-213-jpg..jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aston-martin-dbx-hyper-red-a1-aml-213-jpg..jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aston-martin-dbx-hyper-red-a1-aml-213-jpg..jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aston-martin-dbx-hyper-red-a1-aml-213-jpg..jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aston-martin-dbx-hyper-red-a1-aml-213-jpg..jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aston-martin-dbx-hyper-red-a1-aml-213-jpg..jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2120563" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aston Martin</p></div></p>
<h2>The tech that stood out</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aston&#8217;s done what it can to make DBX&#8217;s inner working distinct from the traditional Mercedes system. Creative thinking shows up in the 10.2-inch display&#8217;s slick graphics made for DBX on the center stack. A DB5, James Bond&#8217;s vehicle of choice, is used as an icon to indicate adaptive cruise control activation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aston manages to use the tech that it does have to its advantage &#8212; and it&#8217;s a whole mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ambient lighting offers 64 different colors in two zones and a sound system that feels of the moment. The custom sound system boasts 790 watts over 13 speakers and a sealed subwoofer, and noise compensation tech that drowns out road noise. The combination of that cushy cabin and the boom of those speakers makes it feel as if one is driving around in a high-end theater, back when we all went to the movies, or if you&#8217;re an Aston owner, escaped into your personal home theater.</span></p>
<h2>ADAS: form and function</h2>
<p>Aston compensates for lack of computational power by making adaptive cruise control, front and rear parking sensors, lane-departure warning, lane-keeping assist and blind-spot monitoring all standard safety features.</p>
<p>Each function is housed in one of the aforementioned plastic buttons. Adaptive cruise control is on the left of the steering wheel, and can be adjusted to monitor distance and speed. The lane-keeping assist button is on the right of the center console.</p>
<p>The controls on the center console require the driver to glance down for a brief moment, causing the eyes to flit off the road. When lane-keeping assist is engaged, a light on the dash and a gentle twitch of the wheel alert the driver. Other switches control driver performance and Aston&#8217;s air suspension settings.</p>
<h2>Character study</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stateside, Aston might be limited to James Bond, but for the British car culture enthusiasts, the brand is steeped in emotion, gravitas and significance. I attended the Aston centenary in 2010 in England, where I saw an outpouring of love across the U.K. for the brand&#8217;s heritage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under former CEO Andy Palmer, Aston was in pursuit of its future. A more modern factory in Wales was built to make DBX. But part of Aston&#8217;s intrinsic appeal is that some components are still hand built to suit the low-volume connoisseur of a few thousand-of-a-kind vehicle. As cars become more complex computerized systems, hand built becomes more of a liability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DBX&#8217;s path comes down to what the prospective driver wants and needs this vehicle to be in place of proper high-six figure dream machine such as the Rolls-Royce Cullinan owned by the BMW group, or Bentley Bentayga, Lamborghini Urus and Porsche Cayenne, which fall under the collective VW umbrella. Or Tesla, which is Tesla.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As slick technological features become more important, Aston Martin may need to rethink how it solves for lagging behind. That may mean doubling down on what it means to be unapologetic and classic. Or using future powertrain variants to push the 21st century automaker messaging. The latter seems most likely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 agreement with Mercedes that builds off of an existing partnership will give Aston Martin access to a wide range of technology, including electric, mild and full hybrid powertrain architectures through 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aston Martin indicated in its latest earnings call that offering a hybrid SUV will be important for the company. Tobias Moers, Aston Martin&#8217;s new CEO and the former head of Mercedes-Benz AMG, said a plug-in hybrid DBX will be offered before 2024. All-electric vehicles are part of the company&#8217;s plans as well, and have been targeted for middle of the decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question is whether Aston Martin will give the infotainment system the needed upgrade to match the hybrid and EV tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to high-six figure SUVs, the air is thin at the top.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google says it&#8217;s focusing on privacy-friendly approaches to ad targeting, Okta acquires Auth0 and a flying taxi startup raises $241 million. This is your Daily Crunch for March 3, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Google swears off ad-tracking</strong></p>
<p>While Google had already announced it would be phasing out support for third-party cookies in Chrome, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/google-renounces-ad-tracking/">it went further today</a> by declaring that &#8220;once third-party cookies are phased out, we will not build alternate identifiers to track individuals as they browse across the web, nor will we use them in our products.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, Google&#8217;s David Temkin argued in a blog post that attempts to build alternative approaches to ad-tracking will not &#8220;meet rising consumer expectations for privacy, nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions, and therefore aren’t a sustainable long term investment.&#8221; Instead, he pointed to Google technologies like its interest-based Federated Learning of Cohorts.</p>

<p><strong>Startups, funding and venture capital</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Activist investors will only sit still for so long, and when they take action, it usually involves one of two approaches: Replace the leadership team or induce a sale.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://box.com">Box</a> could be facing troubled times if <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-box-starboard-exclusive-idINKBN2AN1MX">a Reuters story from last week</a> is accurate. Activist investor Starboard Value <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starboard-value-takes-7-5-stake-in-box/">took a 7.9% stake in the storage company</a> in September 2019, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/activist-investor-starboard-value-taking-three-box-board-seats-as-involvement-deepens/">a year ago took three board seats</a> as its involvement in the cloud company deepened. It seemed only a matter of time before another shoe dropped.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Activist investor Starboard Value is reportedly after three additional board seats.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That thunk you just heard could be said shoe as Starboard is reportedly after three additional board seats. Those include current CEO Aaron Levie&#8217;s and two independent board members, all of whom have their seats coming up for election in June. If the firm were to obtain three additional seats, it would control six of nine votes and could have its way with Box.</p>
<p>What could the future hold for the company given this development (assuming it&#8217;s true)? It seems changes are coming for Box.</p>
<p>Below, we&#8217;ll explore how Box got to this point. And if an acquisition is in Box&#8217;s future, just who might be in the market for a cloud-native content management company built to scale in the enterprise? There would very likely be multiple suitors.</p>
<h2>Box&#8217;s fickle financial fate</h2>
<p>Starboard may have reason to be frustrated by Box&#8217;s performance. The cloud company&#8217;s stock price and market cap remain stubbornly low. Its share price is mired around $18 a share, not much higher than the price <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/22/box-prices-ipo/">it went public at in 2015</a> when it was valued at $14 per share. Its market cap today is $3 billion, which is lacking in comparison to fellow cloud stalwarts like Dropbox at $9 billion, Slack at $23 billion or Okta at $34 billion.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Activist investor Starboard Value taking three Box board seats as involvement deepens&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/activist-investor-starboard-value-taking-three-box-board-seats-as-involvement-deepens/embed/#?secret=3LHYXqz0n8" data-secret="3LHYXqz0n8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Remember back in March 2014 when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/box-files-for-250m-ipo-on-full-year-revenue-of-124m-net-loss-of-168m/">Box announced it was going public</a>? It then did something highly unusual, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/23/why-is-box-taking-so-long-to-pull-ipo-trigger/">delaying the deed 10 months</a> until January 2015. One thing or another kept the company from pulling the trigger and just doing it. Perhaps it was a sign.</p>
<p>Instead, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/07/box-picks-up-150m-more-as-it-waits-for-favorable-ipo-winds/">Box raised $150 million more</a> after its S-1 filing received <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/02/with-ipo-hopes-fading-square-and-box-face-reality-of-commodity-products/">a lackluster response from the market</a>. Looking back, you could argue that the SaaS model was simply less well known in 2014 than it is today. Certainly public investors are more sympathetic to software companies that run deficits in the name of growth than they were back then.</p>
<p>But when Box did file again, finally pricing at $14 per share in 2015, it received a strong welcome. The company had priced above its $11 to $13 per-share IPO range <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/22/box-prices-ipo/">as TechCrunch reported at the time</a> and instantly shot higher. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/23/as-box-ipo-surges-startup-community-reacts/">We wrote on its IPO day</a> that the cloud company quickly “surged to over $20 a share and [was then] trading at $23.67.”</p>
<p>A year later, our continuing coverage had flipped with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/26/a-year-after-ipo-depressed-stock-price-not-bringing-box-ceo-down/">the share price stuck at $10</a> in January 2016.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tens of millions of people each year purchase a second-hand smartphone in India, the world&#8217;s second largest market. Phone makers and giant online sellers such as Amazon and Flipkart are aware of it, but it’s too much of a hassle for them to inspect, repair, and resell used phones. But these firms also know that customers are more likely to buy a smartphone if they are offered the ability to trade-in their existing handsets.</p>
<p>A startup that is helping these firms tackle this challenge said on Thursday it has raised $15 million in a new financing round. New York-based Olympus Capital Asia made the investment through Asia Environmental Partners, a fund dedicated to the environmental sector. The five-year-old startup, which counts Blume Ventures  among its early investors, has raised $42 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cashify.in">Cashify</a> operates an eponymous platform &#8212; both online and physical stores and kiosks &#8212; for users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/cashify-raises-12m/">sell and buy used smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, laptops, desktops</a>, and gaming consoles. 90% of its business today surrounds the smartphone category, explained Mandeep Manocha, founder and chief executive of Cashify, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“For consumers, our proposition is that we make it easy for you to sell your devices. You come to our site or app, answer questions to objectively evaluate the condition of your device, and we give you an estimate of how much your gadget is worth,” he said. “If you like the price, we pick it up from your doorstep and give you instant cash.”</p>
<p>A few years ago, I wrote about <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/13/returned-goods-are-a-problem-for-retailers-resellers-are-cashing-in.html">the struggle e-commerce firms face</a> globally in handling returned items. There are many liability challenges &#8212; such as having to ensure that the innards in a returned smartphone haven&#8217;t been tempered with &#8212; as well as overhead costs in reversing an order.</p>
<p>Manocha said that phone makers and e-commerce firms have found better ways to handle returned items in recent years, but they still lose a significant amount of money on them. These challenges have created a big opportunity for startups such as Cashify.</p>
<p>In fact, Cashify says it’s the market leader in its category in India. The startup has partnerships with “nearly every OEM” including Apple, Samsung, OnePlus, Oppo, Xiaomi, Vivo, and HP. “If you walk into an Apple store today, they use our platform.” For consumers in India, if they opted for the trade-in program, Apple.com also uses Cashify’s trading platform, he said.</p>
<p>The startup also works with top e-commerce firms in India &#8212; Amazon, Flipkart, and Paytm Mall. The firms use Cashify’s trading and exchange software, and also rely on the startup for liquidation of devices. The startup then repairs these gadgets and sells the refurbished units to customers.</p>
<p>“Essentially, whether you come directly to us, or go to popular e-commerce firms or phone OEMs, we are handling the majority of the trading,” he said. Even if a customer trades in the device to OEMs, or e-commerce firms, these companies sell the device to players like Cashify, which serves over 2 million customers in more than 1,500 cities.</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy part of the fresh capital to expand its presence in the offline market. Manocha said Cashify currently has dozens of offline stores and kiosks at shopping malls across the country and it has already proven immensely effective in brand awareness among customers.</p>
<p>The startup also plans to expand outside of India, hire more talent, and invest more in getting the word out about its offerings. Manocha said the team is also working on expanding its expertise to more hardware categories such as cameras.</p>
<p>“The management team at Cashify has an excellent track record in building a strong consumer-facing franchise and building relationships with OEMs, e-commerce companies and electronic product retailers to be present across all touch points for the consumer,” said Pankaj Ghai, Managing Director of Asia Environmental Partners, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As consumer VR begins to have a moment following years of heavy investment from Facebook and other tech giants, corporate America is similarly beginning to find more utility in the technology, as well.</p>
<p>Bank of America announced today that they&#8217;ll be working with Bay Area-based VR startup <a href="https://www.strivr.com/">Strivr</a> to bring more of their workplace training into virtual reality. The financial institution has already used the startup&#8217;s tech in a pilot effort with about 400 employees, but a wide-scale rollout means scaling the VR learning platform to more of the company&#8217;s 45,000 employees and bringing thousands of VR headsets to its bank branches.</p>
<p>Bank of America exec John Jordan <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has plenty of ideas of where it will be able to implement the technology most effectively, but is open to experimenting early-on, noting that they&#8217;ve developed VR lessons for everything from notary services to fraud detection. Jordan also says that they&#8217;re working on more ambitious tasks like helping employees practice empathy with customers dealing with sensitive matters like the death of a relative.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jordan says the scope of the company&#8217;s corporate learning program &#8220;The Academy&#8221; is largely unmatched among other major companies in the U.S., except perhaps by the employee instruction programs at Walmart, he notes. Walmart has been Strivr&#8217;s largest customer since the startup signed the retail behemoth back in 2017 to bring VR instruction to their 200 &#8220;Walmart Academy&#8221; instruction centers and all Walmart stores.</p>
<p>Virtual reality is a technology that lends itself to capturing undivided attention, something that is undoubtedly positive for increasing learning retention, which Jordan says was one of the central appeals for adopting the tech. For Bank of America, VR offers a platform change to reexamine some of the pitfalls of conventional corporate learning. At the same time, they acknowledge that the tech isn&#8217;t a silver bullet and that are plenty of best practices for VR that are still unknowns.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We’re just taking it slow to be honest,&#8221; Jordan says. &#8220;We already feel pretty great about how we’ve made investments, but we view this as a way to get better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Enterprise VR startups have seen varying levels of success over the years as they&#8217;ve aimed to find paying customers that can tolerate the limitations of the technology while buying in on the broader vision. Strivr has raised over $51 million, including a $30 million Series B last year, as it has aimed to become a leader in the workplace training space. CEO Derek Belch tells TechCrunch that the company has big plans as it looks towards raising more funding and works to build out its software toolsets to help simplify VR content creation for its partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter confirmed it&#8217;s testing a new way to display tweets that link out to e-commerce product pages &#8212; like products on a Shopify store, for example. With a new Twitter card format, the company is experimenting with tweets that include a big &#8220;Shop&#8221; button and integrate product details directly into the tweet itself, including the product name, shop name, and product pricing.</p>
<p>The experiment was spotted by social media consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1366723485557473283">Matt Navarra</a> who tweeted out screenshots of the new experience. The original poster, based in Qatar, had seen the experiment on an Android device, he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&mdash; Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1366723485557473283?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 2, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>While these tweets would work well as ads, Twitter confirmed to us the tweet is an example of a new treatment for &#8220;organic&#8221; tweets focused on e-commerce.</p>
<p>This format could potentially come into play as part of Twitter&#8217;s larger push to become a creator platform, with its recently announced plans for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">a &#8220;Super Follow&#8221; subscription</a>. The new product will allow Twitter users to follow a particular account for subscriber-only perks like newsletters, exclusive content, a supporter badge, and other deals and discounts. A more &#8220;shoppable&#8221; tweet format could allow these creators to direct their fans to products and merchandise, perhaps.</p>
<p>Twitter also briefly touched on its plans for future investments in e-commerce during its Investor Day last week, but not in great detail.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re&#8230;starting to explore ways to better support commerce on Twitter,&#8221; said Twitter Revenue Lead, Bruce Falck, during the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know people come to Twitter to interact with brands and discuss their favorite products. In fact, you may have even noticed some businesses already developing creative ways to enable sales on our platform,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;This demand gives us confidence in the power of combining real-time conversation with an engaged and intentional audience. Imagine easily discovering, and quickly purchasing a new skincare product or trendy sneaker from a brand you follow with only a few clicks,&#8221; Falck added.</p>
<p>But he cautioned investors that while Twitter was &#8220;excited about the potential of commerce,&#8221; it was still something that&#8217;s in &#8220;very early exploration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea that Twitter could become more of discovery network for e-commerce products is an interesting one &#8212; especially given the growth in the social commerce sector in recent months. This includes increased investment from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/facebook-shops/">Facebook into shopping features</a> across Facebook, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/instagram-expands-shopping-to-more-businesses-including-creators-selling-their-merch/">Instagram</a> and WhatsApp, as well as the growing attention being paid to video-based shopping.</p>
<p>The latter has been particularly popular, in terms of both live streamed product demos and pre-recorded short-form videos, like those on TikTok.</p>
<p>Shopify, for instance, partnered with TikTok on social commerce last fall. And Walmart &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/tiktok-deal/">suitor</a> for TikTok&#8217;s potential U.S. spin-out (which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tiktoks-forced-sale-to-oracle-is-put-on-hold/">now on hold)</a> &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">ran its own live-streamed shopping event</a> on the video app over the holidays. A number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/talkshoplive-seed-funding/">video</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/dote-shopping-party/">shopping</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/dote-shopping-party/">startups</a> have been taking on funding in recent months, too.</p>
<p>Twitter, meanwhile, may have dialed down its video ambitions over the years with the closure of Vine and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/periscope-will-shut-down-by-march-twitter-confirms/">now, Periscope</a>, but it&#8217;s not without tools to make shopping more interesting on its platform, if it chose to do so. It still has integrated tools for posting photos, videos and even live video content. Combined with a Twitter Card that includes pricing and a big &#8220;Shop&#8221; button, people&#8217;s tweets could drive sales.</p>
<p>Or, in other words, a Twitter Card that points you directly to a product page could be just the start of what&#8217;s to come.</p>
<p>In fact, Twitter itself says it has a number of plans for social commerce.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first of many experiments in the commerce space and we will enrich the experience as we learn more,&#8221; a spokesperson said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As <a href="http://okta.com">Okta</a> announced earnings today after the bell, it revealed that it&#8217;s buying cloud identity startup Auth0 for a hefty $6.5 billion. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/identity-platform-auth0-raises-120m-series-f-round-at-1-92b-valuation/">had a valuation of $1.92 billion</a> when it raised $120 million led by Salesforce Ventures last July.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a>, Okta gets a cloud identity company that helps developers embed identity management into applications, adding an entirely new dimension to its identity platform. Okta co-founder and CEO Todd McKinnon says the acquisition gives his company broad coverage in the identity space and the acquisition has the power to lift identity to a first-class cloud category along with infrastructure, enterprise software like collaboration and CRM and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a few other [primary cloud categories], but one of those has to be identity. And for identity to rise to that status, it has to cover all the use cases. It&#8217;s got to be both workforce and customer. So workforce [has been] our [primary] business traditionally, and customer is newer,&#8221; McKinnon told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The customer piece involves having your customers use Okta/Auth0 on the back end to sign onto your platform, rather using it as just your corporate credentials. Having coverage across both areas is what has McKinnon so excited.</p>
<p>Eugenio Pace, co-founder and CEO Auth0 sees his company together with Okta as powerful combination in the identity management space, and he&#8217;s not just hyping the deal when he says that. &#8220;Together, we can offer our customers workforce and customer identity solutions with exceptional speed, simplicity, security, reliability and scalability. By joining forces, we will accelerate our customers’ innovation and ability to meet the needs and demands of consumers, businesses and employees everywhere,&#8221; Pace said in a statement.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why identity startup Auth0&#8217;s founder still codes: It makes him a better boss&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/auth0-founder-code-boss/embed/#?secret=M5Oh5QePlV" data-secret="M5Oh5QePlV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Pace and co-founder Matias Woloski came from Microsoft where they worked until launching their startup in 2013. As McKinnon points out this is a substantial company with 800 employees. It is expected to reach $200 million in revenue this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;So they have this mindset of building a service that is flexible and API-driven and great tools for developers and all the extensibility or customizability, that developers would need. And you can&#8217;t, you can&#8217;t do that later, you have to start from the beginning</p>
<p>McKinnon says while they share some common customers, there will be net new ones as well and the nature of the two companies coverage areas means that they can sell Auth0 into traditional Okta customers and vice versa. The combined entities could fill in a soup-to-nuts kind of identity offering.</p>
<p>As Pace told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/auth0-founder-code-boss/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Zack Whittaker in 2019</a>, it has always been focused on developers:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re not profitable because we’ve chosen to reinvest and continue to sustain the high scale of growth,” he said. “But we are more efficient every day — in the way we acquire customers, the way we service customers, in the way we ship new design capabilities.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The question is how much this will change under the Okta, but Auth0 users can breathe a sigh of relief in that McKinnon says that the company will operate as an independent unit inside of Okta as they look for paths to integration in the coming months. What&#8217;s more, McKinnon says he has a relationship with the two founders going back years and it sounds like there is an element of trust there.</p>
<p>Okta had a pretty good quarter too while it was at it, announcing $234.7 million in revenue up 40% year over year, but Wall Street appears to be unhappy with the deal with the stock price down 6.9% in after hours trading.</p>
<p>Auth0 was founded in 2013 and raised over $300 million along the way. In addition to Salesforce Ventures, other investors included Sapphire Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners and Meritech Capital Partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toro this week announced its<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210302005210/en/The-Toro-Company-Acquires-Left-Hand-Robotics-Inc."> intentions to acquire Left Hand Robotics</a>. The Colorado-based startup (not to be confused with Righthand Robotics) is a natural fit for the lawn mowing giant, as the producer of the RT-1000, an autonomous system capable of mowing large lawns and clearing snow from sidewalks.</p>
<p>Toro is best known for its personal and professional mowers and various other landscaping machines. The company also has some experience in the robotic category, beating various competitors to the punch by a decade or two with its iMow, but those efforts don’t appear to have made a major dent in its overall offerings.</p>
<p>Left Hand’s primary offering targets professionals. It’s already a category for its new parent company, though it’s easy to see how it might scale down as personal mowers gain in popularity. The RT-1000 is a fully autonomous system designed for a variety of weather conditions that could make a more compact version an appealing option for users &#8212; assuming the companies are able to shrink the cost accordingly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The acquisition comes as companies like John Deere are strategizing their own approach toward robotics, while devoted companies like iRobot have begun to explore the space. Although iRobot’s own mower was delayed due to COVID-19, the Roomba maker believes it has cracked what’s proven to be a difficult market for many.</p>
<p>Left Hand has raised $8.9 million to date. Details of the transaction have not been disclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is rolling out a new experience for its Fire TV platform that puts more focus on subscription-free streaming and other live content. The company today announced several new services are being integrated into its suite of Live features, including Xumo and its own IMDb TV and Amazon news app. The company also soon plans to add Plex, it notes.</p>
<p>All four of the services are available for free with ads and don&#8217;t require a subscription, Amazon says. These channels and their content will appear in Fire TV&#8217;s Live tab in the &#8220;On Now&#8221; rows, as well as in the Universal Channel Guide on the Fire TV app.</p>
<p>With the additions, Amazon says there are now over 400 live streaming channels from across 20 providers that can be accessed from Fire TV&#8217;s live channel guide &#8212; including services like YouTube TV, Sling TV, Tubi, Pluto TV, Philo, Prime Video Channels, Prime Video Live Events (like Thursday Night Football) and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon also notes that more than 200 of those channels are available for free with ads and don&#8217;t need a subscription to watch.</p>
<p>Free, live streaming content is becoming a battleground for both Amazon and Roku, the top two streaming media platforms in the U.S. But they&#8217;re taking different approaches to the format.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s section showcasing free, live content has become more of a part of its overall Fire TV interface, instead of a separate channel you have to launch. This speaks to Amazon&#8217;s design philosophy with Fire TV, whose interface largely resembles that of a streaming service.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve always taken a content-forward approach when designing Fire TV. When you turn on your TV, you’re going to see shows, movies and sports — not just rows of apps,&#8221; said VP and GM of Amazon Fire TV Sandeep Gupta. &#8220;This philosophy extends to our approach to live content. We’re continuing to invest heavily in Live TV and so are our content partners. We’re expanding that today with the addition of new integrations, Alexa capabilities and enhanced content discovery mechanisms,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Roku offers its own hub with always-on free movies and TV shows, called The Roku Channel, which helps to serve as a starting point for cord cutters who are looking for something to watch after they&#8217;ve ditched traditional pay TV. But unlike Fire TV, Roku&#8217;s design is, in fact, &#8220;rows of apps.&#8221; This makes its interface simple to use and less cluttered &#8212; something many people seem to prefer. Here, The Roku Channel is just another app to launch, not a part of the Roku interface.</p>
<p>Roku also makes The Roku Channel available online and as a standalone mobile app, just like other free streaming services. This week, it <a href="https://blog.roku.com/easier-web-access-to-free-content-on-the-roku-channel">integrated</a> most of The Roku Channel&#8217;s free content with its main Roku.com website, in order to reach more consumers.</p>
<p>Separately, Fire TV offers its own app, but limits itself to live content, not on-demand, ad-supported shows and movies.</p>
<p>In addition to today&#8217;s newly announced live TV integrations, Amazon also says its live TV programs are now Alexa-enabled.</p>
<p>That means you can say things like &#8220;Alexa, play &#8216;Good Morning America'&#8221; or &#8220;Alexa, play the Seahawks game,&#8221; to launch a specific live TV program by name. This will work with the Alexa Voice Remote on the Fire TV Cube and with Fire TVs paired with an Echo device.</p>
<p>Live TV programs will also appear in the &#8220;App Peak&#8221; (hover) feature on the newly updated Fire TV interface. This feature will show you what&#8217;s on a given channel when you hover over it in the main navigation and works on Fire TV Stick (third generation) and Fire TV Stick Lite, for the time being.</p>
<p>As a result of its expansions and live TV integrations &#8212; not to mention the pandemic that&#8217;s kept people at home for entertainment &#8212; Amazon says that engagement with livestreaming apps on Fire TV has more than doubled in the last 12 months, up by over 130%.</p>
<p>Amazon says the new features are rolling out today to Fire TV devices.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Our startup is planning on registering an international student employee in this year’s H-1B lottery. This will be our first H-1B. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can you help demystify the H-1B process and provide any tips? We also want to hire an Australian and transfer their E-3. How quickly can this be done?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Plucky in Pleasanton</strong></p>
<p>Dear Plucky:</p>
<p>Thanks for your timely questions! There’s some great news for Australian citizens currently in the U.S. and looking for job transfers, amendments and extensions. Premium processing is now available for the E-3 working visa category! This means that transfers, changes of status, and extensions of status for Australians in the U.S. seeking an E-3 can now obtain adjudications from USCIS in as little as 15 days, making it much easier to hire an Australian who is currently in the U.S. for a new role. Go for it!</p>
<p>On the topic of H-1Bs, the registration period for this year’s H-1B lottery will open at 9 a.m. PST on March 9 and will close at 9 a.m. on March 25. Startups need to make sure they’re registering anybody they want to sponsor during this window. Take a listen to my recent podcast on H-1B Lottery Planning, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/055-h-1b-lottery-planning-part-1/">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/060-h-1b-lottery-planning-part-2/">Part 2</a>, for a general explanation of how this year’s process will work and how best to prepare.</p>
<p>Planning is key for implementing a successful immigration strategy. As always, I suggest you consult with an experienced immigration attorney ASAP to help get organized for registering your H-1B candidate for the March lottery and doing as much prep work as possible so that you can put together a strong H-1B petition in the event your candidate is selected in the lottery.</p>
<p>An attorney will also be up to date on all the recent changes to immigration policy, such as USCIS rescinding a Trump-era policy that went into effect in 2017 that effectively made <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/h-1b/computer-programming/">computer programming positions ineligible for an H-1B visa</a>. You will also want to discuss backup options for the international student employee if they are not selected in this year’s lottery.</p>

<h2>Registration and lottery process</h2>
<p>Recently, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced it will delay until next year the plan to shift from a random H-1B lottery to a wage-based one that would have selected registrants who would be paid the highest wage for their position and location. In January, the previous administration had finalized the rule implementing the wage-based lottery. The latest announcement ended weeks of speculation whether USCIS under the Biden administration would retain a wage-based H-1B allocation process, which falls in line with President Biden’s presidential campaign platform.</p>
<p>The random H-1B lottery in March means that H-1B candidates with the same education level who will be paid more will have no greater advantage than those being paid less. However, next year that may not be the case.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether there’s a random or wage-based lottery, individuals with a master’s or higher degree from a U.S. university will continue to have the best chance of being selected in the H-1B lottery. The annual cap on H-1Bs remains at 85,000 and of those, 20,000 H-1Bs are reserved for individuals with a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. university. USCIS randomly selects enough registered candidates from the entire pool of registrants to reach the 65,000 regular H-1B cap first. Then it randomly selects another 20,000 registered candidates holding a U.S. master’s degree or higher, in what is called the advanced-degree cap exemption. Therefore, individuals with a U.S. advanced degree have two chances to be selected. To be eligible, your international student employee must have earned their advanced degree from an eligible and accredited U.S. institution by the time the H-1B petition is filed.</p>
<p>After the online registration period closes on March 25, USCIS will conduct a random computerized selection of registrations and will notify those selected by March 31. A completed H-1B petition must be filed within 90 days of being notified that the H-1B candidate was selected in the lottery, which means the filing deadline will be June 30.</p>
<p>In order to <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations-and-fashion-models/h-1b-electronic-registration-process">register</a> your candidate for the H-1B lottery, your company will need to set up an <a href="https://myaccount.uscis.gov/users/sign_up">online USCIS account</a> if it does not already have one. This can be done at any time between now and the end of the registration period. Your attorney can help you with this and the online registration process.</p>
<p>For the online registration process, your company will have to provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full legal name of the candidate.</li>
<li>Gender.</li>
<li>Date of birth.</li>
<li>Country of birth.</li>
<li>Country of citizenship.</li>
<li>Passport number.</li>
<li>If the candidate is eligible for inclusion in the U.S. advanced-degree cap.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, your company will have to pay the $10 registration fee, which can be submitted by entering a credit card, debit card, checking or savings account directly into the H-1B registration portal.</p>
<h2>Tips for preparing</h2>
<p>Generally, your startup and your H-1B candidate should start assembling documents you will need to submit. Your startup will need to get its tax identification number verified by the U.S. Department of Labor to prove that your startup is capable of sponsoring an individual for an H-1B. This needs to be done before your company can submit a Labor Condition Application (LCA), which is also sent to the Labor Department. An approved LCA must be submitted with your H-1B petition to USCIS. In addition to your startup’s tax ID, it will need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your startup formed recently, articles of incorporation, pitch deck, business plan, term sheet, cap tables.</li>
<li>Documentation showing your company can pay the prevailing wage for the H-1B candidate’s position and location: bank statements, tax returns, other financial documents.</li>
<li>Documents to prove your company is operating within the normal course of business, including marketing materials, company reports, screenshots of the company website.</li>
<li>Job offer letter to the H-1B candidate, including job title, detailed duties, benefits, salary and start date.</li>
<li>Minimum requirements for the position.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your H-1B candidate will need:</h2>
<ul>
<li>An up-to-date resume.</li>
<li>Originals of diplomas, certificates, and transcripts (also scanned copies).</li>
<li>Past immigration documents, such as Form I-20 (certificate of eligibility for F-1 student status) or Form DS-2019 (certificate of eligibility for J-1 status.</li>
<li>Translations of any documents not in English along with a certified translation document.</li>
</ul>
<p>For tips for filing the H-1B petition, listen to my podcast episodes on “<a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-11-your-startups-first-h-1b/">Your Startup’s First H-1B</a>” and “<a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-09-what-makes-a-strong-h-1b-petition/">What Makes a Strong H-1B Petition</a>.” Your attorney will be able to make the case that your H-1B candidate and the position your startup is offering meet the requirements of the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/">H-1B specialty occupation visa</a>.</p>
<p>As of now, premium processing for H-1B petitions remains available. Currently, USCIS is severely backlogged in all case types, so I often suggest using it, depending on the H-1B candidate’s start date and current geographic location. With premium processing, which is an optional service for a $2,500 fee, USCIS guarantees it will make a decision on a case within 15 days. If USCIS approves your H-1B petition, the earliest the international student employee can begin working under the H-1B visa is Oct. 1, 2022, which is the first day of the federal government’s new fiscal year.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed for you in this year’s H-1B lottery</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Sophie</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As a devoted coffee drinker I was enthused by the idea of <a href="https://www.bottomless.com/">Bottomless</a>. The <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/11944">Y Combinator-backed</a> startup sends its users coffee as they run low so that they never run out of the Magic Juice of Life. What could be better?</p>
<p>Because life is somewhat funny, after signing up for its service the company reached out to share that it had raised a Series A. So I got on the phone with <a href="https://twitter.com/lianakherrera">Liana Herrera</a>, the company&#8217;s co-founder, to chat about the startup, which is part coffee-sourcing engine, part subscription/e-commerce play and part hardware effort.</p>
<p>So before we talk about its Series A, let&#8217;s work better to understand what Bottomless is building, and how it works.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>What&#8217;s Bottomless?</h2>
<p>Born from its founders&#8217; issues ordering the right amount of Soylent when they actually needed it, and wondering why there wasn&#8217;t a better way to subscribe to goods consumed on a regular basis, Herrera uncovered the idea for Bottomless.</p>
<p>Today the product works by letting users pick the type of coffee they are interested in, be it caffeine level, price and the like. The company then provides customers with a small digital scale that they connect to their home internet. And then as users consume coffee that Bottomless sends them, placing the bag on the hardware in between uses, the scale notes how much is left and orders more before they run out.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120480" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120480" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2120480 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg 896w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bottomless-scale.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120480" class="wp-caption-text">A Bottomless scale, via the company as my kitchen lighting is bad.</p></div></p>
<p>You can set the sensitivity of the scale, asking it to either be ambitious in keeping you from running out of beans or ground coffee, or more relaxed. As I write to you today, I think that my third bag of decaf has arrived. It&#8217;s a neat system.</p>
<p>And from a business perspective, the Bottomless model has plusses. I honestly do not recall the price range of coffee that I picked, and do not know how much I am actually paying Bottomless at the moment. But I do know that having different types of coffee arrive at the house as I run low is pretty damn cool.</p>
<p>To make that happen, however, is not easy. The startup&#8217;s business is a little complex. Before and even after Bottomless went through Y Combinator back in 2019, the company hand-built its coffee-weighing scales. Herrera told TechCrunch that the old Silicon Valley saw that hardware is hard is in fact an understatement. After all the soldering she described during an interview, I believe her.</p>
<p>Still, after finishing the accelerator program the company managed to grow in 2019 by what Herrera said was around 10x. That customer expansion allowed the company to order bulk hardware from China in early 2020. After its first production run finished &#8212; a few thousand units &#8212; COVID-19 shut down that country&#8217;s supply chain. Happily for the startup, by the time COVID-19 had taken over America, the Chinese economy opened up and production could begin again.</p>
<p>Per the company, Bottomless scaled another 5-7x in 2020. An <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/23/business/bottomless-coffee-subscription-boom/index.html">October 2020 CNN piece</a> notes that the company had around 750 customers in late 2019, and some 6,000 by the time of publication. Herrera wants to massively expand that number, telling TechCrunch that she&#8217;d like to grow by 10x again this year, and that 5x expansion was the lower-end of her expectations.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;This unique vacuum-extraction coffee maker is Colombia&#8217;s own&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/11/this-unique-vacuum-extraction-coffee-maker-is-colombias-own/embed/#?secret=2vinAtVNCs" data-secret="2vinAtVNCs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Powering that growth are a host of coffee companies that Bottomless works with. Those companies handle roasting the beans and sending them to different Bottomless customers. So that no one reaches a zero-coffee state. And dies. Or whatever happens when one actually runs out of coffee.</p>
<p>The startup told TechCrunch that there are some 500 roasters on their wait list, implying that it will have the capacity to take on more customers this year.</p>
<p>Despite all the growth, the company still has some edges to refine. Setting up Wi-Fi on my scale wasn&#8217;t super-simple, for example. Herrera did note that her firm has a new scale coming out in the next three months. That could lower the difficulty barrier for new customers. Still, with 6,000 customers last October ordering three to four bags of coffee monthly, per Herrera&#8217;s estimate, the company had reached a comfortable seven-figure GMV run-rate before 2021 began.</p>
<p>For coffee roasters who may have seen their customer base slow during the pandemic, and consumers increasingly willing to dive into e-commerce, the company&#8217;s model could have long-term legs. Which brings us to the investors making that bet.</p>
<h2>The round</h2>
<p>Bottomless raised a $4.5 million Series A in January of 2021. It&#8217;s a smaller A than we tend to see in recent years, but Herrera said that her company has always been scrappy, which we take to mean that it has a history of being frugal. <a href="https://twitter.com/patrick_oshag">Patrick OShaughnessy</a> led the round.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked if the $4.5 million was a lot of money for the startup, as we didn&#8217;t have a clear picture at the time of its fundraising history. Herrera said that Bottomless has gotten to where it is today on just $2 million. So, the Series A is more than double all the money that the company as raised to date. It&#8217;s a lot of money, in other words.</p>
<p>Besides the new scale design, when asked about what the company intends to do with its funds, Herrera detailed the type of person she&#8217;s looking to hire &#8212; namely intellectually flexible folks who are informal, scrappy and very hack-y. More staff, in other words.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how far Bottomless can get with its new check. Apparently I will be helping its KPIs for the foreseeable future as a customer.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">You have just 170 seconds. Weeks or even months of working on your pitch deck could come down to the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-seed-squeeze-new-docsend-data-shows-early-stage-founders-face-heightened-investor-scrutiny-institutional-barriers-301127028.html">170 seconds (on average)</a> that investors spend looking at it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investors see a lot of pitches,” VC and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman <a href="https://www.reidhoffman.org/linkedin-pitch-to-greylock/">noted</a>. “In a single year, the classic general partner in a venture firm is exposed to around 5,000 pitches … and ends up doing between zero and two deals.”</p>
<p>With all that pressure to make an impact quickly, founders spend an incredible amount of time on the design of their slides. Less consideration, however, is usually spent on the <i>words </i>on the slide. That’s a mistake, especially when you only have 170 seconds.</p>

		<blockquote>
			Founders spend an incredible amount of time on the design of their slides. Less consideration, however, is usually spent on the words on the slide. That’s a mistake.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>When not used intentionally, the words in your deck can be distracting or downright off-putting. We used what we know about language and healthy communication from the millions of documents we’ve processed at <a href="http://writer.com">Writer</a> to come up with 11 words and phrases to remove from your VC pitch deck.</p>
<h2>Negative associations</h2>
<h3>1. “r<b>unway”</b></h3>
<p>Pitching VCs is a balancing act: You want to position your idea in the best light, but also show that you’ve thought things through. However, volunteering certain types of information can have the opposite effect. Don’t write: <i>I’m seeking $X in funding to provide Y months of runway</i>. You certainly need to show how you’re going to use the funding you’re asking for, but you don’t want to frame things in terms of <i>runway</i> in a pitch deck. The word is associated with a looming cash-out date, which can put an investor in a negative state of mind.</p>
<p><i>This </i><a href="https://www.happysignals.com/leading-experience-management-platform-for-it-happysignals"><i>HappySignal</i></a><i> slide is a solid example of keeping your messaging positive and using uplifting language.</i></p>
<h3>2. “e<b>xit strategy”</b></h3>
<p>Don’t write: <i>Our exit strategy is … . </i>Yes, thinking through your business means knowing how you’ll handle worst-case and best-case scenarios. But putting <i>exit strategy</i> in your deck can only get investors thinking about the inherent risks. You want them focused on the opportunity. You need to know what to say when the topic comes up — just don’t volunteer the information on a slide.</p>
<h2>Clichés</h2>
<h3>3. “j<b>ust X percent”</b></h3>
<p>A pitch deck is a tool to show VCs why your idea merits investment. Using clichés can work against that goal. Don’t write: <i>If we could capture X percent of the market … .</i> It’s not only a cliché, it’s wishful thinking — not a plan. Keep the text on your slides grounded in relevant facts and figures. Other clichés to cut include: <i>the Amazon of X</i>, <i>imagine a future</i> and <i>moving Y to blockchain</i>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At <a href="https://events.flutter.dev/">an online event</a>, Google today announced <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter 2</a>, the newest version of its open-source UI toolkit for building portable apps. While Flutter started out with a focus on mobile when it first launched two years ago, it spread its wings in recent years and with version 2, Flutter now supports web and desktop apps out of the box. With that, Flutter users can now use the same codebase to build apps for iOS, Android, Windows, MacOS, Linux and the web.</p>
<p>&#8220;The big thing that justifies the major version number shift is, of course, the availability of web and desktop support,&#8221; Flutter product lead Tim Sneath told me. &#8220;And that&#8217;s just a fairly profound pivot. It&#8217;s rare for products that you suddenly have all these additional endpoints.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120462" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120462" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2120462" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="506" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png 1615w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png?resize=768,379 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png?resize=680,336 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png?resize=1536,759 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter2_surfaces-2.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2120462" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He noted that because of Flutter&#8217;s open-source nature, web and desktop support had been &#8220;cooking in the open&#8221; for a while, so the addition of these endpoints isn&#8217;t a surprise. A lot of that work in getting these new platforms ready for the 2.0 release involved getting the performance up to par on these new platforms.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, though, that Flutter desktop support is still behind an early-release flag in Flutter&#8217;s stable release channel and Google says developers should think of it as a &#8220;beta snapshot.&#8221; Web support, however, has transitioned from beta to stable and has become just another target for building apps with Flutter.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120443" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120443" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2120443" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter.png" alt="" width="1024" height="572" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter.png 1374w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter.png?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter.png?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flutter.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2120443" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>On the web platform, specifically, Sneath noted that the team deliberately started out with a very standard, DOM-centric approach. But while that worked fine, it also meant performance was held back by that, especially for more advanced features. Over the course of the last year or so, the team started working on what it calls Canvas Kit. This WebAssembly-based project takes the same <a href="https://skia.org/user/modules/canvaskit">Skia graphics engine</a> that powers Android and Chrome itself and makes it available <a href="https://flutterplasma.dev/">to web apps</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;What that&#8217;s meant is that we can now essentially bypass the core HTML &#8212; sort of the document-centric parts of the web platform &#8212; and really use the app-centric parts of the web platform without leaving [behind] things like auto-complete of text or passwords and all the things that keep the web feeling very unique,&#8221; Sneath said.</p>

<p>On the desktop, Google is announcing that Canonical is going all-in on Flutter and making it the default choice of all its future desktop and mobile apps.</p>
<p>Microsoft, too, is expanding its support for Flutter and working with Google on Windows support for Flutter. Given Microsoft&#8217;s interest in Android, that&#8217;s maybe no huge surprise, and indeed, Microsoft today is <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/surface-duo/flutter-dual-screen-foldable/">releasing contributions to the Flutter engine</a> to help support foldable Android devices.</p>
<p>In total, Google notes, there are now over 15,000 packages for Flutter and Dart from companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe, Huawei, Alibaba, eBay and Square.</p>
<p>As always, there are dozen of other smaller updates to Flutter in this update, too.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Sneath noted that the Flutter team plans to spend more time on Flutter as a framework for embedded devices and other somewhat nontraditional platforms. He also noted that the team is interested in how Flutter can help power ambient computing experiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we think about the ambient computing worlds where there are these core premises behind the ambient computing aspects &#8212; things like: Can it be searched easily? Can people make money off of the apps that they build and do it in a responsible way? We&#8217;re building support for those kinds of services. Better analytics, better ads frameworks, connectivity into things like Firebase and Google Cloud, so that people can not just take advantage of Flutter but the broader ecosystem services that Google provides,&#8221; Sneath explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.postscript.io">Postscript</a> helps Shopify stores stay in touch with customers via SMS, with a focus on keeping everything opt-in, legally compliant, and spam free. The company raised $4.5M back at the end of 2019; this morning it&#8217;s announcing it has raised a $35M Series B.</p>
<p>The company has grown pretty rapidly over the last year. When we last checked in with them<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/postscript-raises-4-5m-to-help-shopify-shops-stay-connected-with-customers-over-sms/"> in December of 2019</a>, they had 14 employees and around 530 customers; today, they&#8217;re at 61 employees with over 3,500 customers.</p>
<p>Their vision for the product has grown a bit over the last year as well. Initially envisioned as more of a one-way broadcasting for Shopify stores to market to existing customers (&#8220;Look! We&#8217;ve got new shoes in stock!&#8221;), they&#8217;re now working on expanding into more two-way interactions, enabling customers to do things like re-orders, subscription management, and reviews through SMS.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As before, Postscript is compatible exclusively with Shopify stores. Behind the scenes they&#8217;ve been building out an API to allow deeper integrations into other Shopify plugins — but still, they&#8217;re all about Shopify merchants for now.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still focused exclusively there,&#8221; Postscript co-founder Alex Beller tells me. &#8220;We think it&#8217;s kind of our secret sauce, honestly, because we go so deep with the data and the ecosystem. There&#8217;s just a lot of tiny accumulating advantages there. It&#8217;s also the platform that&#8217;s growing the fastest in e-commerce, so it&#8217;s been a good place to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the company&#8217;s December 2019 funding was a seed round, co-founder Adam Turner tells me that between the size of the round and the revenue the company is seeing, they&#8217;ve skipped the A round and have structured this one as a Series B.</p>
<p>The round was led by Greylock, and backed by YC, 1984vc, Ali Capital, Elephant VC, and Larry Fitzgerald. As part of the deal, Greylock partners Sarah Guo and Mike Duboe will be joining Postscript&#8217;s board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Output copied to clipboard! --></p>
<p>GSV Ventures, co-founded by Deborah Quazzo and Michael Cohn, has raised $180 million in its second fund, exclusively focused on backing edtech startups across the globe. The startup now manages $277 million in cumulative assets, inclusive of its debut fund that was closed in 2016.</p>
<p>The new fund will let GSV invest in 13 core holdings, with an average check size of $15 million. The firm reserves up to $20 million per position for follow-on capital. It will invest in seed, Series A and late growth-stage opportunities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While edtech was certainly spotlighted by the pandemic’s impact on the adoption of remote education, GSV Ventures is a case study in what happens when you invest in a category before it has generalist eyes on it. The first fund had three of its largest positions in Coursera, which <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coursera-considers-going-public-2021-161155214.html">is planning to go public</a> this year; Course Hero, which was valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/course-hero-a-profitable-edtech-unicorn-raises-rare-cash/">$1.1 billion last year</a>; and ClassDojo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/classdojos-second-act-comes-with-first-profits/">which finally hit profitability</a> after spending eight years focusing on customer growth instead of monetization.</p>
<p>The firm was also an early believer in Nearpod, which exited for $650 million in an all-cash deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/miami-edtech-startup-nearpod-acquired-by-renaissance/">in February 2021. </a>Quazzo, who contributed her angel portfolio into the fund, says that this gives the firm 10 exits under its belt to date.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Edtech valuations aren&#8217;t skyrocketing, but investors see more exit opportunities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/edtech-valuations-arent-skyrocketing-but-investors-see-more-exit-opportunities/embed/#?secret=vkDQFmWqZf" data-secret="vkDQFmWqZf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>GSV Ventures began around the same time as other exclusively-edtech funds launched, such as Reach Capital, Learn Capital and Owl Ventures. These funds have all closed new capital in the wake of the coronavirus, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/reach-capital-fund-3/">$165 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/union-square-ventures-and-learn-capital-file-paperwork-indicating-new-funds/">$132 million</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/owl-ventures-new-pair-of-funds-gives-edtech-a-585-million-boost/">$585 million</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>The biggest change between GSV Ventures’ debut fund and Fund II is the opportunity that Quazzo seeds internationally. Fund 1 only had one investment outside the United States, and Fund II already has holdings in Capetown, Croatia, Jordan, as well as, Quazzo confirms, six incoming investments split between Indonesia and India.</p>
<p>“There are very important businesses being built in these markets with missions to democratize and improve the delivery of learning at scale to all people,” Quazzo tells TechCrunch. To date, GSV Ventures’ portfolio has 37% female founders and 43% people of color.</p>
<p>While there was a four-year gap between Fund I and Fund II, GSV’s ability to back edtech startups with an ambitious trajectory hasn’t gone unnoticed. Its third fund, already mid-raise, will have its first close in the next few months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A little over thirteen years ago, Shai Agassi, a promising software executive who was in line to succeed the chief executive at SAP, then one of the world&#8217;s mightiest software companies, left the company he&#8217;d devoted the bulk of his professional career to and started a business called Better Place.</p>
<p>That startup promised to revolutionize the nascent electric vehicle market and make range anxiety a thing of the past. The company&#8217;s pitch? A network of automated battery swapping stations that would replace spent batteries with freshly charged ones.</p>
<p>Agassi&#8217;s company would go on to raise nearly $1 billion (back when that was considered a large sum of money) from some of the world&#8217;s top venture capital and growth equity firms. By 2013 it would be bankrupt and one of the many casualties of the first wave of cleantech investing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now serial entrepreneurs John de Souza and Khaled Hassounah are reviving the battery swapping business model with a startup called<a href="https://ample.com/"> Ample</a> and an approach that they say solves some of the problems that Better Place could never address at a time when the adoption of electric vehicles is creating a far larger addressable market.</p>
<p>In 2013, there were 220,000 vehicles on roads, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/270603/worldwide-number-of-hybrid-and-electric-vehicles-since-2009/">according to data from Statista</a>, a number which has grown to 4.8 million by 2019.</p>
<p>Ample has actually raised approximately $70 million from investors including Shell Ventures, the Spanish energy company Repsol, and the Moore Strategic Ventures, a venture firm which is the private held investment firm of Louis M. Bacon, founder of the multi-billion hedge fund, Moore Capital Management. That includes a $34 million investment <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/ample-a-better-better-place">first reported back in 2018</a>, and a later round from investors including Japan&#8217;s energy and metals company, Eneos Holdings that closed recently.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a lot of people that either said, I somehow was involved in that and was suffering from PTSD,&#8221; said de Souza, of the similarities between his business and Better Place. &#8220;The people who weren&#8217;t involved read up about it and then ran away.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Ample, the difference is in the modularization of the battery pack and how that changes the relationship with the automakers that would use the technology.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The approach we’ve taken… is to modularize the battery and then we have an adapter plate that is the structural element of the battery that has the same shape of the battery, same bolt pattern and same software interface. Even though we provide the same battery system.. .it’s same as replacing the tire,&#8221; said Hassounah, Ample&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive. &#8220;Effectively we’re giving them the plate. We don’t modify the car whatsoever. You either put a fixed battery system or an Ample battery plate. We’re able to work with the OEMS where you can make the battery swappable for the use cases where this makes a lot of sense. Without really changing the same vehicle.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hcCbg1Nf-c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Ample&#8217;s currently working with five different OEMs and has validated its approach to battery swapping with nine different car models. One of those OEMs also brings back memories of Better Place.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that the company has a deal with Nissan for the Leaf thanks to the other partnership that Ample has announced with Uber. Ample&#8217;s founders declined to comment on any OEM relationships.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that Ample is working with Nissan because Nissan is the company that<a href="https://www.uber.com/en-GB/newsroom/nissan-and-uber-advance-zero-emission-mobility/"> inked a deal with Uber earlier this year</a> on zero-emission mobility. And Uber is the first company to use Ample&#8217;s robotic charging stations at a few locations in the Bay Area, the company said. This work with Nissan echoes Better Place&#8217;s one partnership with Renault, another arm of the automaker, which proved to be the biggest deal for the older, doomed, battery swapping startup.</p>
<p>Ample says it only takes weeks to set up one of its charging pods at a facility and that the company&#8217;s charging drivers on energy delivered per mile. &#8220;We achieve economics that are 10% to 20% cheaper than gas. We are profitable on day one,&#8221; said Hassounah.</p>
<p>Uber is the first step. Ample is focused on fleets first and is in talks with multiple, undisclosed municipalities to get their cars added to the system. So far, Ample has done thousands of swaps, according to Hassounah with just Uber drivers alone.</p>
<p>The cars can also be charged at traditional charging facilities, Hassounah said, and the company&#8217;s billing system knows the split between the amount of energy it delivers versus another charging outlet, Hassounah said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So far, in the use cases that we have, for ride sharing it&#8217;s individual drivers who pay,&#8221; said de Souza. With the five fleets that Ample expects to deploy with later this year the company expects to have the fleet managers and owners pay for. charging.</p>
<p>Some of the inspiration for Ample came from Hassounah&#8217;s earlier experience working at One laptop per child, where he was forced to rethink assumptions about how the laptops would be used, the founder said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Initially i worked on the keyboard display and then quickly realized the challenge was in the field and developed a framework for creating infrastructure,&#8221; Hassounah said.</span></p>
<p>The problem was the initial design of the system did not take into account lack of access to power for laptops at children&#8217;s homes. So the initiative developed a charging unit for swapping batteries. Children would use their laptops over the course of the day and take them home, and when they needed a fresh charge, they would swap out the batteries.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are fleets that need this exact solution,&#8221; said de Souza. But there are advantages for individual car owners as well, he said. &#8220;T<span style="font-weight: 400;">he experience for the owner of a vehicle is after time the battery degrades. With ours as we put new batteries in the car can go further and further over time.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Right now, OEMs are sending cars without batteries and Ample is just installing their charging system, said Hassounah, but as the number of vehicles using the system rises above 1,000, the company expects to send their plates to manufacturers, who can then have Ample install their own packs.</p>
<p>Currently, Ample only supports level one and level two charging, but won&#8217;t offer fast charging options for the car makers it works with &#8212; likely because that option would cannibalize the company&#8217;s business and potentially obviate the need for its swapping technology.</p>
<p>At issue is the time it takes to charge a car. Fast chargers still take between 20 and 30 minutes to charge up, but advances in technologies should drive that figure down. Even if fast charging ultimately becomes a better option, Ample&#8217;s founders say they view their business as an additive step to faster electric vehicle adoption.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re moving 1 billion cars, you need everything&#8230; We have so many cars we need to put on the road,&#8221; Hassounah said. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We think we need all solutions to solve the problem. As you think of fleet applications you need a solution that can match gas in charge and not speed. Fast charging is not available in mass. The challenge will not be can the battery be charged in 5 minutes. The cost of building  charges that can deliver that amount of power is prohibitive.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Looking beyond charging, Ample sees opportunities in the grid power market as well, the two founders said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Time shift is built into our economics… that’s another way we can help,&#8221; said de Souza. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use that as grid storage… we can do demand charge and now that the federal mandate is there to feed into the grid we can help stabilize the grid by feeding back energy.. We don’t have a lot of stations to make a significant impact. As we scale up this year we will.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p>Currently the company is operating at a storage capacity of tens of megawatts per hour, according to Hassounah.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We can use the side storage to accelerate the development of swapping stations,&#8221; de Souza said. &#8220;You don’t have to invest an insane amount of money to put them in. We can finance the batteries in multiple ways as well as utilize other sources of financing.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The sub-category of soft robotics has transformed the way many think about the field. Oft-influenced by natural phenomenon, the technology offers a dramatically different approach than the sort of rigid structures we traditionally think of when we discuss robots.</p>
<p>Soft designs offer a number of benefits, including compliance, which has already seen a number of real-world applications in manufacturing and fulfillment. But like their more rigid cousins, soft robots have their limitations. As such, designers generally choose between one or the other for a given job &#8212; or, best-case scenario, design swappable parts.</p>

<p>A team at MIT’s CSAIL lab <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/helping-soft-robots-turn-rigid-demand">is exploring a technology</a> that could make choosing less of a trade-off. The project has been in the works since 2017, though it’s still in the somewhat early stages &#8212; still largely the realm of computer simulation, though the details have been outlined in a new paper.</p>
<p>“This is the first step in trying to see if we can get the best of both worlds,” CSAIL post-doc James Bern said in a release.</p>
<p>In the project (or the simulated version, at least), the robot is controlled by a series of cables. Pulling on them in the right combination turns the soft structure into a hard one. The team uses the analogy of a series of muscles controlling the human arm &#8212; if the right ones are flexed, you can effectively lock a position in place.</p>
<p>The team will present their findings at a conference next month. For the time being, they’re currently working on a prototype to showcase how it operates in a real-world setting. Combining the two fields could go a ways toward building safer collaborative robots for interacting with human workers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla, Rivian, Lordstown Motors and Lucid Motors &#8212; potential rivals in the burgeoning EV market &#8212; are working together to pass laws that would allow direct sales in at least eight states with another batch of proposed legislation likely being introduced this year.</p>
<p>Passage of such legislation would clear the way for EV giants like Tesla, along with newcomers Lucid and Rivian, which have yet to bring a vehicle to market, to sell directly to consumers. However, Tesla&#8217;s cooperation could also cost the company its monopoly on direct sales in some states.</p>
<p>Tesla and a growing number of new EV companies have a different business model than legacy automakers like GM, Ford and Stellantis. Tesla sells vehicles through their own branded stores &#8212; similar to how Apple sells its products &#8212; and do not have franchised dealerships. The direct sales model has attracted the ire of auto dealers, who benefit from long-established rules in all 50 states that prevent manufacturers<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> with existing franchisees from opening their own dealerships to compete with them. Tesla and other allies argue that because they don&#8217;t have franchise dealers, they should be allowed to sell directly to consumers.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We support our other EV-only manufacturers and their desires to sell direct-to-consumers, to invest, to create jobs and to do that unfettered as we are allowed,&#8221; Thad Kurowski, senior policy manager at Tesla, said while testifying in the state of Washington during the House&#8217;s Consumer Protection and Business Committee. Washington is one of many states where such legislation is being considered. Tesla has six retail locations in the state.</p>
<p>Similar legislation is being considered in Connecticut, Nebraska, Georgia, New York, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Nevada. Some of these states ban all EV manufacturers from directly selling to customers; some only permit Tesla, at the exclusion of other companies, but cap the number of retail stores it can open.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a rare moment of cooperation for EV manufacturers, companies that must contend not only with each other but with legacy automakers for market share. Relations between the companies have not always been so copacetic: Tesla last July <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tesla-takes-aim-at-rivian-in-lawsuit-alleging-trade-secret-theft-poaching-talent/">filed a lawsuit against Rivian</a> alleging theft of trade secrets and talent poaching. Rivian responded that two of the three claims in the case were nothing more than an attempt to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/rivian-fires-back-at-tesla-in-lawsuit/">smear its reputation</a>.</p>

<p>Tesla is a veteran of battles with state legislatures over direct sales. At least a dozen states, including Arizona, Colorado and Utah have reversed bans that prevented Tesla from selling directly to consumers either through new legislation or via the courts.</p>
<p>Michigan, home to major automakers GM and Ford, has been a longtime battleground.</p>
<p>Former Gov. Rick Snyder signed a bill in 2014 that was initiated and backed by the Michigan Automobile Dealers Association, banning Tesla from selling directly to consumers in the state. Two years later, Tesla sued the state of Michigan when it denied Tesla a dealership license. The Michigan Legislature last December considered a bill that would have banned all direct sales except for Tesla, an arrangement that allowed the automaker to deliver cars to customers, so long as the vehicle sale and title transfer didn&#8217;t occur in the state. That special exception for Tesla was removed from the proposed legislation, a move that would have threatened what little progress it had in the state. At the end, though, the legislation died, leaving Tesla&#8217;s arrangement intact.</p>
<p>Lucid is leading the charge in some states where direct sales legislation is being considered, according to Daniel Witt, who worked at Tesla before joining the new EV entrant as a public policy lead. Witt emphasized the bills are the result of efforts from the coalition of EV companies, grassroots lobbying from EV owners and EV enthusiasts and consumer groups. The legislation has also found support from environmental and clean energy groups, which argue that consumer choice and ease of access are key to helping people transition away from internal combustion engine cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any situation where the door got closed behind Tesla was not a matter of trying to gain a market advantage so much as it was just a product of the negotiations in a given legislature,&#8221; Witt said. &#8220;By and large, whether it&#8217;s New York, or Washington or Connecticut, we&#8217;re all rowing in the same direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, the Washington State Auto Dealers Association said franchised dealers support the transition toward zero-emission vehicles and want to sell them at their locations. But it said the direct sale bill is a &#8220;battle of Main Street vs. Wall Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Electric vehicle manufacturers perpetuate [the] myth of the middleman when the reality is that they would bear the same costs if they built their own stores, but would ship their revenue to their billionaire investors out of state after the sale is made instead of reinvesting in the community,&#8221; the group said.</p>
<p>The organization pointed out that Rivian has garnered $500 million in funding from Ford.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would stop Ford from abandoning its dealer network, and shifting the profits dealers generate for the company out of Ford and into greater ownership of Rivian? Or GM from spinning off an EV subsidiary?&#8221; the group said in its statement.</p>
<p>EV manufacturers have a long legislative road ahead of them. Bills generally must clear legislative committees and receive majority votes from both the House and Senate before being sent to the governor&#8217;s desk to be signed into law.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late last year, Netflix began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/netflixs-latest-experiment-is-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">experimenting</a> with a new TikTok-like feed of funny videos inside its mobile app, which it called &#8220;Fast Laughs.&#8221; Today, the company <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/fast-laughs-is-here">announced</a> the new feature is now rolling out on iOS, allowing users to watch, react, or share the short clips as well as add the show or movie to a Netflix watchlist. You can also push the &#8220;Play&#8221; button to start watching the program immediately.</p>
<p>At launch, the feature will include short clips from Netflix&#8217;s comedy catalog, including films like &#8220;Murder Mystery,&#8221; series like &#8220;Big Mouth,&#8221; sitcoms like &#8220;The Crew,&#8221; as well as snippets from stand-up comedians like Kevin Hart and Ali Wong.</p>
<p>Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch the feature will tap into its full catalog, not just its own original programs. However, the company couldn&#8217;t says how many total shows or movies would be featured in the new experience at any given time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The feature, notably, has been given prominent placement in the Netflix app, where it&#8217;s accessible from the bottom navigation menu on its own tab, next to &#8220;Coming Soon.&#8221; This is no small experiment, then &#8212; but rather an indication of how successful the early tests of the &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; feature must have been in terms of engaging users and connecting them to Netflix content.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; is not the first time Netflix has borrowed concepts from social media to help users discover new shows or movies to watch in its app. A few years ago, Netflix <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/19/17255966/netflix-30-second-video-previews-mobile">introduced</a> its own short-form video &#8220;Stories&#8221; feature, called Previews, for example. But times have changed. Now users are drawn to short-form vertical video feeds, like those popularized by TikTok.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120438" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120438" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2120438" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Kevin-hart-pink.jpg?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Kevin-hart-pink.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Kevin-hart-pink.jpg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Kevin-hart-pink.jpg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Kevin-hart-pink.jpg?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Kevin-hart-pink.jpg?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Kevin-hart-pink.jpg?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Kevin-hart-pink.jpg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120438" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; heavily borrows from the TikTok format, as its feed also features full-screen videos that you can swipe through vertically, and places the engagement buttons on the right side of the screen. These buttons let you react to the clip with an &#8220;LOL&#8221; (crying/laughing) emoji or share it via iMessage or other social media apps, like WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat or Twitter. You can also start watching the show immediately or save it for later viewing by adding it to &#8220;My List.&#8221;</p>
<p>During tests, &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; clips ranged in length anywhere from 15 to 45 seconds. Today, Netflix says there&#8217;s no exact clip length for these video snippets.</p>
<p>Because the clips&#8217; content may not be appropriate for children, the &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; tab won&#8217;t appear on Netflix kids&#8217; profiles. In addition, members will be able to filter the content based on their own settings for maturity rating levels.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120393" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120393" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2120393" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Share-pink.jpg?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Share-pink.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Share-pink.jpg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Share-pink.jpg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Share-pink.jpg?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Share-pink.jpg?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Share-pink.jpg?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FAST_LAUGHS_ANIMATIONS_v11_for-stills-Share-pink.jpg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120393" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>The company is positioning the feature as a discovery tool.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to give members a fun, fast, and intuitive way to discover our catalog by letting these comedic moments across genres speak for themselves in a mobile-native, full screen experience,&#8221; said Netflix Product Designer <a href="https://www.kimho.design/fastlaughs">Kim Ho</a>, who previously worked on product design at Facebook, Instacart, and Coin. &#8220;We worked hard to cut to just what was necessary in an intentional and minimalist UI design, from the transparent tab bar to ways to react in the moment (&#8216;LOL&#8217;) and plan their next laugh by adding to their list,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>But though &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; is focused on finding new things to watch, the feature could, in fact, help Netflix compete with TikTok in terms of time spent on mobile devices, as it caters to the growing demand for shorter, more &#8220;snackable&#8221; video content.</p>
<p>Netflix says the feature is rolling out now to iOS and will begin testing on Android in the months to come.</p>
