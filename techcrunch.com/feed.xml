										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has launched 60 more of its Starlink internet broadband satellites — on &#8216;Star Wars Day,&#8217; no less, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/spacex-launches-60-more-starlink-satellites/">only five days after it launched the last batch</a>. The company has now delivered 420 Starlink satellites since the beginning of March, a sum that SpaceX CEO and founder must not be aware of because he definitely would&#8217;ve tweeted about it by now if he was.</p>
<p>This launch took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 3:01 PM ET (12:01 PM PT), and used a re-used Falcon 9 booster that had flown 8 times previously. That booster also landed back on SpaceX&#8217;s floating drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean, tying the record for SpaceX&#8217;s reusable flight program in terms of flying resumed boosters, which it just set in March. This is the company&#8217;s 115th Falcon 9 launch so far.</p>
<p>SpaceX also shared updated figures around its Starlink consumer hardware, which is used to transmit and receive signal from the constellation for broadband service. The company has received &#8220;over half a million&#8221; pre-order reservations for its service so far, which includes advance deposits on the hardware.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That strong demand helps explain why there appears to be such a significant backlog in terms of fulfilling orders for Starlink. Customers looking to user the service can sign up via SpaceX&#8217;s website, and place a pre-order for the kit, which induces the Starlink receiver, a router, power supplies and mounting hardware for your home.</p>
<p>The service is available to beta customers in six countries thus far, including Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and the U.S. and Canada, but the goal is to continue to expand coverage to achieve near-global reach by the end of 2021 in terms of service availability, with a number of additional launches planned throughout the rest of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">unceremoniously confiscated</a> Trump’s biggest social media megaphone months ago, but the former president might be poised to snatch it back.</p>
<p>Facebook’s Oversight Board, an external Supreme Court-like policy decision making group, will either restore Trump’s Facebook privileges or banish him forever on Wednesday. Whatever happens, it’s a huge moment for Facebook’s nascent experiment in outsourcing hard content moderation calls to an elite group of global thinkers, academics and political figures and allowing them to set precedents that could shape the world&#8217;s biggest social networks for years to come.</p>
<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Trump’s suspension from Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-stormthecapitol-hashtag-dangerous-organizations-policy/">in the immediate aftermath of the Capitol attack</a>. It was initially a temporary suspension, but two weeks later Facebook said that the decision would be sent to the Oversight Board. &#8220;We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great,&#8221; Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in January.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s VP of Global Affairs Nick Clegg, a former British politician, expressed hope that the board would back the company&#8217;s own conclusions, calling Trump&#8217;s suspension an &#8220;unprecedented set of events which called for unprecedented action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump inflamed tensions and incited violence on January 6, but that incident wasn&#8217;t without precedent. In the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man killed by Minneapolis police, President Trump ominously declared on social media “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” a threat of imminent violence <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/facebook-employees-stage-virtual-walkout-in-protest-of-companys-stance-on-trump-posts/">with racist roots that Facebook declined to take action against</a>, prompting internal protests at the company.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook employees stage virtual walkout in protest of company&#8217;s stance on Trump posts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/facebook-employees-stage-virtual-walkout-in-protest-of-companys-stance-on-trump-posts/embed/#?secret=tNEdRK5fSU" data-secret="tNEdRK5fSU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The former president skirted or crossed the line with Facebook any number of times over his four years in office, but the platform stood steadfastly behind a maxim that all speech was good speech, even as other social networks grew more squeamish.</p>
<p>In a dramatic address in late 2019, Zuckerberg evoked Martin Luther King Jr. as he defended Facebook&#8217;s anything goes approach. “In times of social turmoil, our impulse is often to pull back on free expression,&#8221; Zuckerberg said. &#8220;We want the progress that comes from free expression, but not the tension.&#8221; <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/before-showdown-with-congress-mark-zuckerberg-frames-the-conversations-facebook-would-rather-have">King&#8217;s daughter strenuously objected. </a></p>
<p>A little over a year later, with all of Facebook’s peers doing the same and Trump leaving office, Zuckerberg would shrink back from his grand free speech declarations.</p>
<p>In 2019 and well into 2020, Facebook was still a roiling hotbed of misinformation, conspiracies and extremism. The social network hosted thousands of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gretchen-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-facebook-groups-militias-fbi/">armed militias organizing for violence</a> and a sea of content amplifying QAnon, which moved from a fringe belief on the margins to a mainstream political phenomenon through Facebook.</p>
<p>Those same forces <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-stormthecapitol-hashtag-dangerous-organizations-policy/">would converge at the U.S. Capitol on January 6</a> for a day of violence that Facebook executives characterized as spontaneous, even though it had been festering openly on the platform for months.</p>

<h3>How the Oversight Board works</h3>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s Oversight Board <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-oversight-board-controversy/">began reviewing its first cases last October</a>. Facebook can refer cases to the board, like it did with Trump, but users can also appeal to the board to overturn policy decisions that affect them after they exhaust the normal Facebook or Instagram appeals process. A five member subset of <a href="https://oversightboard.com/meet-the-board/">its 20 total members</a> evaluate whether content should be allowed to remain on the platform and then reach a decision, which the full board must approve by a majority vote. Initially, the Oversight Board was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/facebooks-oversight-board-already-a-bit-frustrated-and-it-hasnt-made-a-call-on-trump-ban-yet/">only empowered to reinstate content</a> removed on Facebook and Instagram, but in mid-April began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/facebook-instagram-users-can-now-ask-oversight-panel-to-review-decisions-not-to-remove-content/">accepting requests to review controversial content that stayed up</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, the Oversight Board <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/20/facebook-oversight-doubts-trump-ban-483469">replaced departing member Pamela Karlan</a>, a Stanford professor and voting rights scholar critical of Trump, who left to join the Biden administration. Karlan’s replacement, PEN America CEO Susan Nossel, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-01-27/facebook-donald-trump-oversight-board">wrote an op-ed in the LA Times in late January</a> arguing that extending a permanent ban on Trump “may feel good” but that decision would ultimately set a dangerous precedent. Nossel joined the board too late to participate in the Trump decision.</p>
<p>The Oversight Board’s earliest batch of decisions leaned in the direction of restoring content that’s been taken down — not upholding its removal. While the board’s other decisions are likely to touch on the full spectrum of frustration people have with Facebook’s content moderation preferences, they come with far less baggage than the Trump decision. In one instance, the Oversight Board voted to restore an image of a woman’s nipples used in the context of a breast cancer post. In another, the board decided that a quote from a famous Nazi didn’t merit removal because it wasn’t an endorsement of Nazi ideology. In all cases, the Oversight Board can issue policy recommendations, but Facebook isn’t obligated to implement them — just the decisions.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KBABdai9mQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/facebook-instagram-users-can-now-ask-oversight-panel-to-review-decisions-not-to-remove-content/">Facebook, Instagram users can now ask &#8216;oversight&#8217; panel to review decisions not to remove content</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook, Instagram users can now ask &#8216;oversight&#8217; panel to review decisions not to remove content&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/facebook-instagram-users-can-now-ask-oversight-panel-to-review-decisions-not-to-remove-content/embed/#?secret=KBABdai9mQ" data-secret="KBABdai9mQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Befitting its DNA of global activists, political figures and academics, the Oversight Board&#8217;s might have ambitions well beyond one social network. Earlier this year, Oversight Board co-chair and former Prime Minister of Denmark Helle Thorning-Schmidt declared that other social media companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/facebook-oversight-board-other-social-networks-beyond-facebook/">would be &#8220;welcome to join&#8221; the project</a>, which is branded in a conspicuously Facebook-less way. (The group calls itself the “Oversight Board” though everyone calls it the &#8220;Facebook Oversight Board.&#8221;)</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first time in history, we actually have content moderation being done outside one of the big social media platforms,&#8221; Thorning-Schmidt declared, grandly. &#8220;That in itself… I don’t hesitate to call it historic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook’s decision to outsource some major policy decisions is indeed an experimental one, but that experiment is just getting started. The Trump case will give Facebook’s miniaturized Supreme Court an opportunity to send a message, though whether the takeaway is that it’s powerful enough to keep a world leader muzzled or independent enough to strike out from its parent and reverse the biggest social media policy decision ever made remains to be seen.</p>
<p>If Trump comes back, the company can shrug its shoulders and shirk another PR firestorm, content that its experiment in external content moderation is legitimized. If the board doubles down on banishing Trump, Facebook will rest easy knowing that someone else can take the blowback this round in its most controversial content call to date. For Facebook, for once, it’s a win-win situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube today <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-main-stream-highlights-10th-annual-brandcast-delivered">gave advertisers a sneak peek</a> at its plans to make its video platform more shoppable. The company will soon be introducing a new interactive feature aimed at advertisers called brand extensions, which will allow YouTube viewers to learn more about a product they see on the screen with a click of a button.</p>
<p>The new ad format will allow the advertiser to highlight their website link or another call-to-action in their connected TV video ad. The viewer can then click the option &#8220;send to phone,&#8221; which then sends that promotion or URL directly to their mobile device, without interrupting their viewing experience.</p>
<p>From the mobile device, the consumer could then shop the website as they would normally &#8212; browsing products, adding items to the cart, and completing the transaction. But they can do it when they&#8217;re ready to engage with that product information, instead of having to stop their video to do so.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The advertisers will also be able to smartly target the ads to the correct audience, based on the video content. For example, a fitness video may feature a brand extension ad that shows a new pair of running shoes.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/dvcZcDjYgAI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Advertisers will be able to measure the conversions generated by these brand extensions directly in Google Ads, YouTube says.</p>
<p>In a related e-commerce ad effort, brands can now also add browsable product images to their <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads/new-ways-to-drive-action/">direct response video ads</a>, in order to encourage interested shoppers to click to visit their website or app.</p>
<p>These are only a few of the efforts YouTube has been working on with the goal of expand further into e-commerce.</p>
<p>Consumers, and particularly younger Gen Z users, today like to watch videos and engage while they shop, leading to the emergence of numerous video shopping services &#8212; like <a href="https://popshoplive.com/">Popshop Live</a>, <a href="https://thentwrk.com/">NTWRK</a>, <a href="https://shopshops.live/">ShopShops</a>, <a href="https://talkshop.live/">TalkShopLive</a>, <a href="https://bambuser.com/">Bambuser</a>, and others. Facebook has also invested in live shopping and video-based shopping across both Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, TikTok has become a home to video-based e-commerce, with Walmart (which also tried to acquire a stake in the app when Trump was trying to force a sale) hosting multiple shopping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">livestreams</a> in recent months. TikTok also found success with e-commerce as it has rolled out more tools to direct video viewers to websites through <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/tiktok-lays-out-plans-for-new-ecommerce-integrations-as-it-eyes-the-next-st/594717/">integrated</a> links and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">integrations with Shopify,</a> for example.</p>
<p>But YouTube still has a sizable potential audience for video shopping, as it represents 40% of watch time of all ad-supported streaming services, per Comscore data. And of the top five streaming services in the U.S. that account for 80% of the connected TV market, only two are ad-supported, YouTube noted.</p>
<p>Ads are only one way YouTube will drive e-commerce traffic. Creators will also play a role.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-09/google-tries-to-turn-youtube-into-a-major-shopping-destination?sref=gni836kR">report from Bloomberg</a> this past fall said YouTube was asking creators to tag and track the products they were featuring in their clips. <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/neal-innovation-series/">YouTube later revealed more about this effort in February</a>, saying it was beta testing a shopping experience that lets viewers shop from their favorite creators, and that this would roll out more broadly in 2021.</p>
<p>Brand extensions are separate from that effort, however, as they&#8217;re focused on giving the advertiser their own means to drive a shopping experience from a video.</p>
<p>YouTube says the new brand extensions ads are only the first of more interactive features the company has in store. The feature will roll out globally later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An issue every developer faces is dealing with problems on a live application without messing it up. In fact, in many companies such access is restricted. <a href="https://cased.com/">Cased</a>, an early stage startup, has come up with a solution to provide a way to work safely with the live application.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $2.25 million seed round led by Founders Fund along with a group of prestigious technology angel investors. The company also announced that the product is generally available to all developers today for the first time. It&#8217;s worth noting that the funding actually closed last April, and they are just announcing it today.</p>
<p>Bryan Byrne, CEO and co-founder at Cased says he and his fellow co-founders, all of whom cut their teeth at GitHub, experienced this problem of working in live production environments firsthand. He says that the typical response by larger companies is to build a tool in-house, but this isn&#8217;t an option for many smaller companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We saw firsthand at GitHub how the developer experience gets more difficult over time, and it becomes more difficult for developers to get production work done. So we wanted to provide a developer friendly way to get production work done,&#8221; Byrne explained.</p>
<p>He said without proper tooling, it forces CTOs to restrict access to the production code, which in turn makes it difficult to fix problems as they arise in production environments. &#8220;Companies are forced to restrict access to production and restrict access to tools that developers need to work in production. A lot of the biggest tech companies invest in millions to deliver great developer experiences, but obviously smaller companies don&#8217;t have those resources. So we want to give all companies the building blocks they need to deliver a great developer experience out of the box,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This involves providing development teams with open access to production command line tools by adding logging and approval workflows to sensitive operations. That enables executives to open up access with specific rules and the ability to audit who has been accessing the production environment.</p>

<p>The company launched at the beginning of last year and the founders have been working with design partners and early customers prior to officially opening the site to the general public today.</p>
<p>They currently have five people including the four founders, but Byrne says that they have had a good initial reaction to the product and are in the process of hiring additional employees. He says that as they do, diversity and inclusion is a big priority for the founders, even as a very early stage company.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very prominent in our company handbook, so that we make sure we prioritize an inclusive culture from the very beginning because [ … ] we know firsthand that if you don&#8217;t invest in that early, it can really hold you back as a company and as a culture. Culture starts from day one, for sure,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As part of that, the company intends to be remote first even post-pandemic, a move he believes will make it easier to build a diverse company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will definitely be remote first. We believe that also helps with diversity and inclusion as you allow people to work from anywhere, and we have a lot of experience in leading remote-first culture from our time at GitHub, so we began as a remote culture and we will continue to do that,&#8221; he said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Domm Holland, co-founder and CEO of e-commerce startup<a href="https://www.fast.co/"> Fast</a>, appears to be living a founder’s dream.</p>
<p>His big idea came from a small moment in his real life. Holland watched as his wife’s grandmother tried to order groceries, but she had forgotten her password and wasn’t able to complete the transaction.</p>
<p>“I just remember thinking it was preposterous,” Holland said. “It defied belief that some arbitrary string of text was a blocker to commerce.”</p>
<p>So he built a prototype of a passwordless authentication system where users would fill out their information once and would never need to do so again. Within 24 hours, tens of thousands of people had used it.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Nothing beats building human networks. That&#8217;s the way that you&#8217;re going to get this done in terms of fundraising.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Shoppers weren’t the only ones on board with this idea. In less than two years, Holland has raised $124 million in three rounds of fundraising, bringing on partners like<a href="https://www.indexventures.com/"> Index Ventures</a> and<a href="https://stripe.com/"> Stripe</a>.</p>
<p>Although the success of Fast’s one-click checkout product has been speedy, it hasn’t been effortless.</p>
<p>For one thing, Holland is Australian, which means he started out as a Silicon Valley outsider. When he arrived in the U.S. in the summer of 2019, he had exactly one Bay Area contact in his phone. He built his network from the ground up, a strategic process he credits to one thing: hard work.</p>
<p>On<a href="https://blog.foundersuite.com/how-to-raise-strategic-capital-e-g-from-stripe-domm-hollands-series-b-for-fast-co/"> an episode of the “How I Raised It” podcast</a>, Holland talks about how he built his network, why it’s important — not just for fundraising but for building the entire business — and how to avoid the mistakes he sees new founders make.</p>
<h2><strong>Reach out with relevance</strong></h2>
<p>Holland’s primary strategy in building networks sounds like an obvious one — reach out to relevant people.</p>
<p>“When I first got to the States, I wanted to build networks,” Holland said, “but I didn&#8217;t really know anyone here in the Bay Area. So I spent a lot of time reaching out to relevant people — people working in payments, people working in technology, people working in identity authentication — just really relevant people in the space working in Big Tech who were building large-scale networks.”</p>
<p>One of the people Holland connected with was <a href="https://twitter.com/abarrallen">Allison Barr Allen</a>, then the head of global product operations at Uber. Barr Allen managed her own angel investment fund, but Holland wasn’t actually looking for money when he reached out to her. He was much more interested in her perspective as the leader of an enormous financial services operation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Among the many, many tasks required of grade school teachers is that of gauging each student&#8217;s reading level, usually by a time-consuming and high-pressure one-on-one examination. Microsoft&#8217;s new <a href="https://education.microsoft.com/en-us/resource/50b18238">Reading Progress</a> application takes some of the load off the teacher&#8217;s shoulders, allowing kids to do their reading at home and using natural language understanding to help highlight obstacles and progress.</p>
<p>The last year threw most educational plans into disarray, and reading levels did not advance the way they would have if kids were in school. Companies like Amira are emerging to fill the gap with AI-monitored reading, and Microsoft aims to provide teachers with more tools on their side.</p>
<p>Reading Progress is an add-on for Microsoft Teams that helps teachers administer reading tests in a more flexible way, taking pressure off students who might stumble in a command performance, and identifying and tracking important reading events like skipped words and self-corrections.</p>
<p>Teachers pick reading assignments for each student (or the whole class) to read, and the kids do so on their own time, more like doing homework than taking a test. They record a video directly in the app, the audio of which is analyzed by algorithms watching for the usual stumbles.</p>
<p>As you can see in this video testimony by 4th grader Brielle, this may be preferable to many kids:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/z9g0-rzT8lE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>If a bright and confident kid like Brielle feels better doing it this way (and is now reading two years ahead of her grade, nice work Brielle!), what about the kids who are having trouble reading due to dyslexia, or are worried about their accent, or are simply shy? Being able to just talk to their own camera, by themselves in their own home, could make for much better reading — and therefore a more accurate assessment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not meant to replace the teacher altogether, of course — it&#8217;s a tool that allows overloaded educators to prioritize and focus better and track things more objectively. It&#8217;s similar to how Amira is not meant to replace in-person reading groups — impossible during the pandemic — but provides a similarly helpful process of quickly correcting common mistakes and encouraging the reader.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four years ago, Argo AI made its first acquisition as a young, newly backed self-driving vehicle startup. Now, Argo says its acquisition of lidar company Princeton Lightwave is paying off and is poised to help it deliver autonomous vehicles that can operate commercially on highways and in dense urban areas starting next year.</p>
<p>Argo AI unveiled Tuesday details on a long-range lidar sensor that it claims has the ability to see 400 meters away with high-resolution photorealistic quality and the ability to detect dark and distant objects with low reflectivity. The first batch of these lidar sensors are already on some of Argo&#8217;s test vehicles, which today is comprised of Ford Fusion Hybrid sedans and Ford Escape Hybrid SUVs. By the end of the year, Argo&#8217;s test fleet will transition to about 150 Ford Escape Hybrid vehicles, all of which will be equipped with the in-house lidar sensor. Ford, an investor in and customer of Argo, plans to deploy autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing and delivery in 2022. Argo&#8217;s other investor and customer, Volkswagen, said it will launch commercial operations in 2025.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just the technical capabilities of the lidar sensor that matter, Argo CEO and co-founder Bryan Salesky told TechCrunch in a recent interview. The lidar sensor was developed to be cost-effective and manufactured at scale, two factors that matter for any company trying to commercialize autonomous vehicle technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When we first started, I knew that the market did not have an adequate long-range lidar,&#8221; Salesky said, who noted that while Waymo had developed its own lidar sensors with long-range capabilities it was not available for other developers to buy. &#8220;We decided to make an acquisition focused on plugging the hole for that long-range need. It has really been a game-changer for our self-driving system and has enabled us to be able to move really fast, to the point now where we&#8217;re starting to equip cars with the sensor, and it&#8217;s opening up testing in urban and highway environments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lidar, the light detection and ranging radar that measures distance using laser light to generate a highly accurate 3D map of the world, is considered by most in the industry a critical sensor required to safely deploy autonomous vehicles at a commercial scale. More than 70 companies, some of which have recently gone public via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies, are developing lidar — all claiming technical breakthroughs and cost benefits. And then there are the AV developers such as Cruise and Aurora, which just like Argo have acquired lidar companies in hopes of developing an in-house solution that will give them an edge over the competition and free them from working with an outside supplier like Velodyne.</p>
<p>Ford, which invested $1 billion into Argo, had also backed lidar maker Velodyne, the dominant supplier in the market. But progress within Argo has changed Ford&#8217;s stance. Veoneer, which announced in 2019 that it was leveraging Velodyne&#8217;s technology for a contract to supply the sensor to an unnamed AV customer, reported in February that it had lost its contract. It wasn&#8217;t clear exactly who the customer was, although many speculated it was Ford or Argo. That same month, Ford reported in a regulatory filing that it had dissolved its 7.6% stake in Velodyne, cementing its bet on Argo&#8217;s in-house lidar.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Assuming the sensor lives up to the claims, it should provide a substantial performance advantage over Velodyne and give them the flexibility to operate more safely at highway speeds,&#8221; said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst with researcher Guidehouse Insights. Abuelsamid points to a few factors, including its wavelength and sensitivity, that could give Argo an edge.</p>
<h2>Low-speed urban areas to high-speed boulevards</h2>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Lidar sensors send out millions of beams or pulses every second to detect surrounding objects and then measure the return to create a point cloud or 3D image. That point cloud shows the objects and calculates their range.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Argo sensor is based on what it describes as Geiger-mode time of flight lidar, which it says uses beam detectors that can detect the smallest particle of light. Argo says its single-photon sensors are able to build up images of low-reflectivity objects like a black-painted car at a much greater distance than can a traditional linear time of flight lidar. Argo also said its lidar sensor operates at a wavelength above 1400 nanometers, which theoretically enables more power to help the range.</p>
<p>Abuelsamid noted that more common 905 nm lidars are largely limited to vehicles traveling about 40 mph to 45 mph, which suggests that Argo&#8217;s sensor could be used at highway speeds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Argo lidar’s use of the Geiger-mode photodiode and binning of pixels also contributes to the increased sensitivity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The ability to detect a single photon and then using the software to do statistical analysis to aggregate them and reject noise seems like it should help as well. Being able to pick up low reflectivity objects like truck tire treads or very black vehicles is important.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also noted that the Argo sensor is a mechanical spinning lidar, which is a common design based on the original Velodyne HDL-64. However, Argo&#8217;s lidar rotates the outer surface, a design decision to help throw off water from the sensor to help keep it clean.</p>
<p>Combining all of this will allow Argo to develop a self-driving system for a variety of use cases such as low-speed dense urban sectors, higher-speed boulevards that have a mix of pedestrian, cyclists and cars to contend with as well as highways.</p>
<p>Argo has spent much of its time testing in urban environments, specifically in Austin, Detroit, Miami, Palo Alto, Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C. But Volkswagen, the company&#8217;s newest backer and customer, is also interested in autonomous driving on highways. Argo plans to begin testing in additional cities this year, including Munich.</p>
<h2>Manufacturing partner and future applications</h2>
<p>Argo has been working for more than a year with a contract manufacturer that has experience in assembling optoelectronics. Hundreds of sensors will be manufactured by the end of the year and ramp up from there. Argo declined to name the contract manufacturer.</p>
<p>Argo&#8217;s self-driving system is designed to be agnostic, meaning it could be used in multiple business models. Argo&#8217;s customers Ford and VW will of course dictate what those business applications will be, and for now it is robotaxis and middle-mile delivery. However, Salesky noted that the sensors could be applied to trucking.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As autonomy stalls, lidar companies learn to adapt&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/as-autonomy-stalls-lidar-companies-learn-to-adapt/embed/#?secret=fNwfPBV5mP" data-secret="fNwfPBV5mP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re kind of focused on goods movement and people movement, but I think trucking is something that we&#8217;re taking a hard look at,&#8221; Salesky said. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t something that we&#8217;ve prioritized yet, but we&#8217;re definitely keeping trucking open and I think it&#8217;s absolutely an interesting place for our technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Argo also has aspirations beyond manufacturing a long-range lidar for its own needs. Salesky told TechCrunch that the underlying technology can be packaged in other ways to create different types of sensors. &#8220;It is a really interesting potential license opportunity,&#8221; he said, cautioning that the priority is on autonomous vehicle applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a little too soon to start selling within the automotive realm, but it&#8217;s an opportunity that&#8217;s there,&#8221; Salesky said. &#8220;I do think that this underlying technology can be packaged in a bunch of ways to service other industries such as mining, agriculture, oil and gas.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Of the many frustrations of having a severe motor impairment, the difficulty of communicating must surely be among the worst. The tech world has not offered much succor to those affected by things like locked-in syndrome, ALS, and severe strokes, but startup <a href="https://www.cognixion.com/">Cognixion</a> aims to with a novel form of brain monitoring that, combined with a modern interface, could make speaking and interaction far simpler and faster.</p>
<p><a href="https://one.cognixion.com/">The company&#8217;s One headset</a> tracks brain activity closely in such a way that the wearer can direct a cursor — reflected on a visor like a heads-up display — in multiple directions or select from various menus and options. No physical movement is needed, and with the help of modern voice interfaces like Alexa, the user can not only communicate efficiently but freely access all kinds of information and content most people take for granted.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not a miracle machine, and it isn&#8217;t a silver bullet. Here&#8217;s where how it got started.</p>
<h2>Overhauling decades-old brain tech</h2>
<p>Everyone with a motor impairment has different needs and capabilities, and there are a variety of assistive technologies that cater to many of these needs. But many of these techs and interfaces are years or decades old — medical equipment that hasn&#8217;t been updated for an era of smartphones and high-speed mobile connections.</p>
<p>Some of the most dated interfaces, unfortunately, are those used by people with the most serious limitations: those whose movements are limited to their heads, faces, eyes — or even a single eyelid, like Jean-Dominique Bauby, the famous author of &#8220;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the tools in the toolbox is the electroencephalogram, or EEG, which involves detecting activity in the brain via patches on the scalp that record electrical signals. But while they&#8217;re useful in medicine and research in many ways, EEGs are noisy and imprecise — more for finding which areas of the brain are active than, say, which sub-region of the sensory cortex or the like. And of course you have to wear a shower cap wired with electrodes (often greasy with conductive gel) — it&#8217;s not the kind of thing anyone wants to do for more than an hour, let alone all day every day.</p>
<p>Yet even among those with the most profound physical disabilities, cognition is often unimpaired — as indeed EEG studies have helped demonstrate. It made Andreas Forsland, co-founder and CEO of Cognixion, curious about further possibilities for the venerable technology: &#8220;Could a brain-computer interface using EEG be a viable communication system?&#8221;</p>
<p>He first used EEG for assistive purposes in a research study some five years ago. They were looking into alternative methods of letting a person control an on-screen cursor, among them an accelerometer for detecting head movements, and tried integrating EEG readings as another signal. But it was far from a breakthrough.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144512" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144512" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2144512" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2144512" class="wp-caption-text">A modern lab with an EEG cap wired to a receiver and laptop &#8211; this is an example of how EEG is commonly used.</p></div></p>
<p>He ran down the difficulties: &#8220;With a read-only system, the way EEG is used today is no good; other headsets have slow sample rates and they&#8217;re not accurate enough for a real-time interface. The best BCIs are in a lab, connected to wet electrodes — it&#8217;s messy, it&#8217;s really a non-starter. So how do we replicate that with dry, passive electrodes? We&#8217;re trying to solve some very hard engineering problems here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The limitations, Forsland and his colleagues found, were not so much with the EEG itself as with the way it was carried out. This type of brain monitoring is meant for diagnosis and study, not real-time feedback. It would be like taking a tractor to a drag race. Not only do EEGs often work with a slow, thorough check of multiple regions of the brain that may last several seconds, but the signal it produces is analyzed by dated statistical methods. So Cognixion started by questioning both practices.</p>
<p>Improving the speed of the scan is more complicated than overclocking the sensors or something. Activity in the brain must be inferred by collecting a certain amount of data. But that data is collected passively, so Forsland tried bringing an active element into it: a rhythmic electric stimulation that is in a way reflected by the brain region, but changed slightly depending on its state — almost like echolocation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144494" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144494" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2144494" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg?resize=2048,1153 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2144494" class="wp-caption-text">The Cognixion One headset with its dry EEG terminals visible.</p></div></p>
<p>They detect these signals with a custom set of six EEG channels in the visual cortex area (up and around the back of your head), and use a machine learning model to interpret the incoming data. Running a convolutional neural network locally on an iPhone — something that wasn&#8217;t really possible a couple years ago — the system can not only tease out a signal in short order but make accurate predictions, making for faster and smoother interactions.</p>
<p>The result is sub-second latency with 95-100 percent accuracy in a wireless headset powered by a mobile phone. &#8220;The speed, accuracy and reliability are getting to commercial levels —  we can match the best in class of the current paradigm of EEGs,&#8221; said Forsland.</p>
<p>Dr. William Goldie, a clinical neurologist who has used and studied EEGs and other brain monitoring techniques for decades (and who has been voluntarily helping Cognixion develop and test the headset), offered a positive evaluation of the technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s absolutely evidence that brainwave activity responds to thinking patterns in predictable ways,&#8221; he noted. This type of stimulation and response was studied years ago. &#8220;It was fascinating, but back then it was sort of in the mystery magic world. Now it&#8217;s resurfacing with these special techniques and the computerization we have these days. To me it&#8217;s an area that&#8217;s opening up in a manner that I think clinically could be dramatically effective.&#8221;</p>
<h2>BCI, meet UI</h2>
<p>The first thing Forsland told me was &#8220;We&#8217;re a UI company.&#8221; And indeed even such a step forward in neural interfaces as he later described means little if it can&#8217;t be applied to the problem at hand: helping people with severe motor impairment to express themselves quickly and easily.</p>
<p>Sad to say, it&#8217;s not hard to imagine improving on the &#8220;competition,&#8221; things like puff-and-blow tubes and switches that let users laboriously move a cursor right, right a little more, up, up a little more, then click: a letter! Gaze detection is of course a big improvement over this, but it&#8217;s not always an option (eyes don&#8217;t always work as well as one would like) and the best eye-tracking solutions (like a Tobii Dynavox tablet) aren&#8217;t portable.</p>
<p>Why shouldn&#8217;t these interfaces be as modern and fluid as any other? The team set about making a UI with this and the capabilities of their next-generation EEG in mind.</p>

<p>Their solution takes bits from the old paradigm and combines them with modern virtual assistants and a radial design that prioritizes quick responses and common needs. It all runs in an app on an iPhone, the display of which is reflected in a visor, acting as a HUD and outward-facing display.</p>
<p>In easy reach of, not to say a single thought but at least a moment&#8217;s concentration or a tilt of the head, are everyday questions and responses — yes, no, thank you, etc. Then there are slots to put prepared speech into — names, menu orders, and so on. And then there&#8217;s a keyboard with word- and sentence-level prediction that allows common words to be popped in without spelling them out.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve tested the system with people who rely on switches, who might take 30 minutes to make 2 selections. We put the headset on a person with cerebral palsy, and she typed our her name and hit play in 2 minutes,&#8221; Forsland said. &#8220;It was ridiculous, everyone was crying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goldie noted that there&#8217;s something of a learning curve. &#8220;When I put it on, I found that it would recognize patterns and follow through on them, but it also sort of taught patterns to me. You&#8217;re training the system, and it&#8217;s training you — it&#8217;s a feedback loop.&#8221;</p>
<h2>&#8220;I can be the loudest person in the room&#8221;</h2>

<p>One person who has found it extremely useful is <a href="http://djofability.com/">Chris Benedict, a DJ, public speaker, and disability advocate</a> who himself has Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy. It limits his movements and ability to speak, but doesn&#8217;t stop him from spinning (digital) records at various engagements, however, or from explaining his experience with Cognixion&#8217;s One headset over email. (And you can see him demonstrating it in person in the video above.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145827" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145827" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2145827" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg" alt="DJ Chris Benedict wears the Cognixion Headset in a bright room." width="450" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg 1954w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg?resize=117,150 117w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg?resize=234,300 234w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg?resize=768,983 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg?resize=531,680 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg?resize=1201,1536 1201w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg?resize=1601,2048 1601w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg?resize=39,50 39w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2145827" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cognixion</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Even though it’s not a tool that I’d need all the time it’s definitely helpful in aiding my communication,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;Especially when I need to respond quickly or am somewhere that is noisy, which happens often when you are a DJ. If I wear it with a Bluetooth speaker I can be the loudest person in the room.&#8221; (He always has a speaker on hand, since &#8220;you never know when you might need some music.&#8221;)</p>
<p>The benefits offered by the headset give some idea of what is lacking from existing assistive technology (and what many people take for granted).</p>
<p>&#8220;I can use it to communicate, but at the same time I can make eye contact with the person I’m talking to, because of the visor. I don’t have to stare at a screen between me and someone else. This really helps me connect with people,&#8221; Benedict explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s a headset I don&#8217;t have to worry about getting in and out of places, there is no extra bulk added to my chair that I have to worry about getting damaged in a doorway. The headset is balanced too, so it doesn’t make my head lean back or forward or weigh my neck down,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;When I set it up to use the first time it had me calibrate, and it measured my personal range of motion so the keyboard and choices fit on the screen specifically for me. It can also be recalibrated at any time, which is important because not every day is my range of motion the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alexa, which has been extremely helpful to people with a variety of disabilities due to its low cost and wide range of compatible devices, is also part of the Cognixion interface, something Benedict appreciates, having himself adopted the system for smart home and other purposes. &#8220;With other systems this isn’t something you can do, or if it is an option, it’s really complicated,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>As Benedict demonstrates, there are people for whom a device like Cognixion&#8217;s makes a lot of sense, and the hope is it will be embraced as part of the necessarily diverse ecosystem of assistive technology.</p>
<p>Forsland said that the company is working closely with the community, from users to clinical advisors like Goldie and other specialists, like speech therapists, to make the One headset as good as it can be. But the hurdle, as with so many devices in this class, is how to actually put it on people&#8217;s heads — financially and logistically speaking.</p>
<p>Cognixion is applying for FDA clearance to get the cost of the headset — which, being powered by a phone, is not as high as it would be with an integrated screen and processor — covered by insurance. But in the meantime the company is working with clinical and corporate labs that are doing neurological and psychological research. Places where you might find an ordinary, cumbersome EEG setup, in other words.</p>
<p>The company has raised funding and is looking for more (hardware development and medical pursuits don&#8217;t come cheap), and has also collected a number of grants.</p>
<p>The One headset may still be some years away from wider use (the FDA is never in a hurry), but that allows the company time to refine the device and include new advances. Unlike many other assistive devices, for example a switch or joystick, this one is largely software-limited, meaning better algorithms and UI work will significantly improve it. While many wait for companies like Neuralink to create a brain-computer interface for the modern era, Cognixion has already done so for a group of people who have much more to gain from it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["I think every founder I know thinks that their decks are shared a lot more. I don’t feel like that, but I know that comes from experience."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There’s a stark contrast between Oura’s deck and the others we pored through on Extra Crunch Live. The slides CEO Harpreet Rai brought to the event were the clear output of a more mature and confident company seeking out its Series B. It’s a company with a focus, aware of where it wants the product to go and do (and it went there, announcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/fitness-ring-maker-oura-raises-100m/">a massive followup round</a> on Tuesday).</p>
<p>Then there’s that giant image of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, with the company’s smart ring adorning Harry’s right hand. From there, it’s a parade of celebrity faces: Will Smith, Lance Armstrong, Bill Gates, Arianna Huffington and Seth Rogen, to name a few.</p>
<p>It’s clearly been a wild half-dozen years since the company was founded. Rai joined up in 2018, not long before the company embarked on its $28 million Series B. Forerunner General Partner Eurie Kim got on board during the round.</p>
<p>“[I] enthusiastically took the meeting and Harpreet shared his story and the story of Oura. The deck is what we talked through,” says Kim. “Because I was a consumer, it was just a no-brainer that I knew what he was trying to build. So we were very excited to lead the round.”</p>
<p>Kim and Rai joined us on Extra Crunch Live to discuss the process of taking Oura to the next level &#8212; and beyond &#8212; as the product found a second (or third) life during the pandemic through partnerships with sports leagues like the NBA. And as we’re wont to do, we asked the pair to take a look and a handful of user-submitted pitch decks. If you&#8217;d like your deck to be reviewed by experienced founders and investors on a future episode, you can submit it <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">here</a>.</p>
<h2>On the hardness of hardware</h2>
<p>By the time Oura sought out its Series B, the startup had already progressed pretty far. Kim compares the first-generation product (circa 2016 &#8212; predating both Rai and Kim’s time with the company ) to a “Power Rangers ring.” You’ve got to start somewhere, of course &#8212; and if nothing else, the admittedly bulky original edition of the product served as a powerful proof of concept.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Crypto startups couldn&#8217;t be hotter as currencies push past all-time-highs and investor appetite reaches mania for new projects. Crypto investment firms that have been investing in blockchain startups for years are not only beginning to see major movement from their portfolio, but are gaining renewed appetite from LPs after a lengthy crypto winter to make bigger, more audacious bets.</p>
<p>Austin-based <a href="https://multicoin.capital/">Multicoin Capital</a> has been around since 2017 investing in blockchain startups, cryptocurrencies and tokens with a venture fund and separate hedge fund. Today, the firm announced its raise of its second venture fund as it aims to further capitalize on rampant excitement in the crypto world. The new $100 million fund will help the company back new entrants in the space including companies tackling DeFi, digital collectibles, Web3 and crypto-enabled infrastructure.</p>
<p>Multicoin&#8217;s team says that it has already been investing out of this fund for several months and it seems the timing is more aligned with the promotion of three of the firm&#8217;s employees &#8212; <a title="https://twitter.com/mattshap1" href="https://twitter.com/mattshap1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Shapiro</a>, <a title="https://twitter.com/Mable_Jiang" href="https://twitter.com/Mable_Jiang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mable Jiang</a>, and <a title="https://twitter.com/johnrobertreed" href="https://twitter.com/johnrobertreed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Robert Reed</a> &#8212; to Partner status. The team is just 12, but is looking to expand as they build out their remote presence in other geographies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The firm&#8217;s previous bets include The Graph, Solana, Torus, StarkWare and Arweave, among others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a wild couple of years for Oura. Last year, in particular, proved to be a major driver for the wearable fitness manufacturer. With the pandemic bringing professional sports to a screeching halt in 2020, a number of major leagues have adopted the ring, including the NBA, WNBA, UFC and NASCAR.</p>
<p>The company has also been making a major push into health research courtesy of UCSF, which has published peer-review studies around the ring’s temperature monitor. That feature in particular has made it a big draw for the aforementioned leagues, as temperature spikes could point to larger issues, including the early stages of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Today the company is announcing a $100 million Series C. The round, led by The Chernin Group and Elysian Park (the Dodgers’ investment arm), brings the wearable company’s total funding up to $148.3 million. New investors include Temasek, JAZZ Venture Partners and Eisai, joining existing investors Forerunner Ventures, Square, MSD Capital, Marc Benioff, Lifeline Ventures, Metaplanet Holdings and Next Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company initially set itself apart with its form factor, joining a crowded field that largely revolved around the wrist. Clearly, however, it’s come into its own over the last few years. To date, it&#8217;s sold more than 500,000 rings.</p>
<p>“The wearables industry is transitioning from activity trackers to health platforms that can improve people&#8217;s lives,” CEO Harpreet Singh Rai said in a press release tied to the news. &#8220;Oura focused first on sleep because it’s a daily habit, and lack of sleep has been linked to worsening health conditions including diabetes, cardiac disease, Alzheimer’s, cancer, poor mental health, and more.”</p>
<p>The company says the round will go toward R&amp;D (both hardware and software development) and hiring, including additional marketing and customer experience. The round also sees the hiring of a number of key roles, including head of Science, Shyamal Patel; site leader Tommi Heinonen and Daniel Welch, who has been promoted to CFO.</p>
<p>“This year has shined a spotlight on gaps in our healthcare industry, and the increasing need for each of us to take control over our own health,” Forerunner Managing Director Eurie Kim said in the release. “Oura is emerging as the trusted leader and community in the space by empowering people with personalized data that provides actionable insights for health improvement.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In March 2020, <a href="http://www.tame.events">Tame</a> had a digital event suite for offline corporate events. But with the pandemic hitting, it did a hard pivot into providing a highly customizable virtual events platform, primarily used by companies for their sales events. The result is that it has now raised a seed round of $5.5m, a large round for its native Denmark, led by <a href="http://www.vfventure.com/">VF Venture</a> (The Danish Growth Fund), along with <a href="https://www.byfounders.vc/">byFounders</a> and  and three leading angels: Mikkel Lomholt (CTO &amp; Co-founder, Planday); Sune Alstrup (Ex-CEO &amp; Co-founder, The Eye Tribe); and Ulrik Lehrskov Schmidt.</p>
<p>The investment will be used to scale from 20 to 60 new employees across Copenhagen, London, and Krakow; expand to the UK, and grow revenues.</p>
<p>Founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasenkohadzic/?originalSubdomain=dk">Jasenko Hadzic</a>, CEO and Co-founder said the pivot to virtual grew revenues &#8220;by 700% organically last year. No sales. No marketing. Organically. Therefore, Tame sees a huge opportunity and is going all-in on expanding aggressively to position itself as a market leader.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jacob Bratting Pedersen, Partner, VF Venture, said: “At VF Venture, we want to help develop and drive innovation. The corona crisis has brought digital momentum with it, and here Danish IT entrepreneurs have the opportunity to seize that agenda and bring Danish technology and expertise to the global market. Tame is a really good example of that. Tame has great potential to create a strong, global business for the benefit of growth and jobs in Denmark.”</p>
<p>Hadzic himself is already a success story &#8211; he eventually made it into the tech industry after arriving in Denmark as a child refugee from war-torn Bosnia during the Yugoslavian civil war.</p>
<p>But don’t mistake Tame for a Hopin. Hadzic told me: &#8220;We&#8217;re not interested in getting TechCrunch Disrupt as a customer or, or the big trade fairs. We just want to focus on those enterprise companies which we sell to a marketing department or an HR department.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NurseFly, the healthcare jobs marketplace owned by <a href="https://www.iac.com/">IAC</a>, has rebranded to <a href="https://www.vivian.com/">Vivian Health </a>as it expands its range of services. Originally launched for traveling nurses (or nurses willing to travel for short-term positions), Vivian Health now includes listings for permanent positions, per diem shifts and local openings. It also added employer reviews and a <a href="https://www.vivian.com/salary/">pay database</a> that uses information gathered from the 1.7 million jobs that have come through its system.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017, NurseFly was acquired by IAC in August 2019. It is used by providers like AMN Healthcare, Cross Country Healthcare, Host Healthcare, Trinity Health, SSM Health and Honor Health. During the pandemic, Vivian Health quadrupled its employee headcount in order to meet demand, founder and chief executive officer Parth Bhakta told TechCrunch in an email.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9C8nd14RU0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/iac-acquires-nursefly/">IAC acquires nursing marketplace NurseFly for $15M</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IAC acquires nursing marketplace NurseFly for $15M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/iac-acquires-nursefly/embed/#?secret=9C8nd14RU0" data-secret="9C8nd14RU0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Over the past year, we’ve grown to fill nearly 10% of all travel nursing positions across the United States, oftentimes helping fill a crisis position in a matter of hours rather than weeks,” Bhakta said. During that time, the platform heard from major health systems “that their challenges around hiring for permanent roles were oftentimes even more dire than filling their travel positions,” he added. “Permanent roles at health systems were taking months to fill, costing tens of thousands of dollars to hire, and leading to short-staffed facilities in the meantime.”</p>
<p>As a result of these conversations, Vivian Health’s team spent three months rebuilding the platform to serve a wider range of healthcare providers and employers. Its rebranding and expansion comes at a time when many healthcare professionals are reporting burnout as a result of the pandemic.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.vivian.com/community/announcements/one-year-in-whats-next-for-americas-healthcare-workers/">study of 1,300 respondents published earlier this month</a>, Vivian Health found that 83% said their mental health had been affected by working in healthcare over the past year. About 43% said they had considered quitting the profession.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for burnout is working overtime, with 86% of their respondents reporting that their facilities are short-staffed, even as demand for healthcare professionals accelerates. According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/home.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</a>, about 17.3 million people were employed in the heatlhcare sector in 2018, and that number is expected to increase 15% to 19.9 million by 2028, making it one of the fastest growing sectors.</p>
<p>“Crisis-level staffing shortages” are compounded by the amount of time, sometimes up to 120 days, it can take to hire a permanent employee. Shortening the amount of time it takes to fill positions has a ripple effect because clinicians need to work less overtime. Meanwhile, recruiters can focus on the right leads. Bhakta said employers have been able to use Vivian Health to fill permanent positions in as little as one week, and are typically able to do so within 30 days.</p>
<p>Vivian Heath built a proprietary dataset of healthcare industry information through the 1.7 million jobs that have come through its systems and asks all of its staffing agency partners to include pay rates in their listings. As a result, job seekers are able to see how a position’s compensation compares against the market, while employers can quickly adjust their rates to be more competitive.</p>
<p>Bhakta said Vivian Health added pay information because “our business is built on transparency, which we believe is a crucial element in solving the healthcare hiring crisis.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So much can happen in 72 hours, and it’s easy to get distracted — especially when you’re building a startup in the fast lane that is mobility tech.

<p>Don’t let “busy” distract you. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=3daysebcountdown&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=eb3days&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your pass to Mobility 2021</a> before the price increase goes into effect on <strong>Thursday, May 6 at 11:59 pm (PT).</strong></p>
<p>Why should you attend TC Sessions: Mobility 2021? It’s where you can tap into the latest trends, regulatory concerns and technical and ethical challenges surrounding the technologies that will forever change how we move people and material goods across towns, cities, states, countries — and space.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Or, as Jens Lehmann, technical lead and product manager at SAP, told us:</p>
<p>“TC Sessions Mobility is definitely worth your time, especially if you’re an early-stage founder. You get to connect to people in your field and learn from founders who are literally a year into your same journey. Plus, you can meet and talk to the movers and shakers — the people who are making it happen.”</p>
<p>Take a gander at just some of the fascinating people and topics waiting for you, and see the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=3daysebcountdown&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=eb3days&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">event agenda here</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supercharging Self-Driving Super Vision:</strong> Few startups were as prescient as Scale AI when it came to anticipating the need for massive sets of tagged data for use in AI. Co-founder and CEO Alex Wang also made a great bet on addressing the needs of lidar sensing companies early on, which has made the company instrumental in deploying AV networks. We’ll hear about what it takes to make sense of sensor data in driverless cars and look at where the industry is headed.</li>
<li><strong>EV Founders in Focus:</strong> We sit down with the founders poised to take advantage of the rise in electric vehicle sales. We’ll chat with Ben Schippers, co-founder and CEO of TezLab, an app that operates like a Fitbit for Tesla vehicles (and soon other EVs) and allows drivers to go deep into their driving data. The app also breaks down the exact types and percentages of fossil fuels and renewable energy coming from charging locations.</li>
<li><strong>The Future of Flight:</strong> Joby Aviation founder JoeBen Bevirt spent more than a decade quietly developing an all-electric, vertical take-off and landing passenger aircraft. Now he is preparing for a new phase of growth as Joby Aviation merges with the special purpose acquisition company formed by famed investor and Linked co-founder Reid Hoffman. Bevirt and Hoffman will come to our virtual stage to talk about how to build a startup (and keep it secret while raising funds), the future of flight and, of course, SPACs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Between the livestream and video on demand, you can keep your work schedule on track without missing out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Stride.VC">Stride VC</a>, a London-based seed investment fund, has raised its second fund, which will be £100 million ($138.6 million) &#8212; identical to its first fund. The fund will invest primarily in London startups but also look at select European opportunities.</p>
<p>The breakup of the LPs in the fund is 10% fund of funds, 60% other institutional, 28% family offices and 10% individuals. Stride said some 80% of this new fund came from returning LPs, and 20% from two new unnamed institutional investors. Stride does not have any public or government investment.</p>
<p>Investors include the founders of Cazoo, King, PillPack and Dott, and institutional investors such as Delin Ventures, Draper Esprit, Mubadala and CNP (Groupe Frere).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stride founder Fred Destin told me that while the fundraising was planned for June, the two new unnamed institutional investors &#8220;reached out in January, and confirmed their intention to invest around mid-February after a quick diligence process. We weren&#8217;t planning to raise until June. We secured all allocations March 12 and closed 31 March. Breakneck speed for a fund,” he said.</p>
<p>Stride has also gone through some personnel additions. The successful podcaster about VC, Harry Stebbings, who co-founded Stride with Destin, <a href="https://twitter.com/fdestin/status/1358507176843743233?s=20">departed amicably</a> in early February to set up his own fund. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cleo-sham-9294313/">Cleo Sham</a> is the new partner joining full-time in June, as announced <a href="https://twitter.com/fdestin/status/1368482488738316292?s=20">on Twitter</a>. In August last year it lost its Paris-based partner, Pia d&#8217;Iribarne, who has set up <a href="http://Newwave.vc">Newwave.vc</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RBminSVxcH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/new-wave/">New Wave is a new European seed fund headed up by ex-Accel VC Pia d&#8217;Iribarne</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Destin also told me he will be looking for a new third partner for the fund, and two more team members: “I’m mainly looking for exceptional talent. If they don&#8217;t fit some kind of mold, or don’t have an MBA and speak like MBA people, even better. What I mean is I don&#8217;t want people who just look for your references.&#8221; But, he added, &#8220;don&#8217;t @ me on Twitter about it!&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shane-burgess-550891/">Shane Burgess</a> has joined to head up talent; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pietro-invernizzi/">Pietro Invernizzi</a>, formerly of The Family, runs the &#8220;First Check Programme&#8221;.</p>
<p>Destin says Stride remains &#8220;firmly committed to seed”, usually leading or co-leading a funding round. But that it will also expand from pre-seed funding with £250,000 checks to sometimes larger investments in companies like Huboo, where it invested £4.5 million. Its core investment program ranges from £750,000 to £4 million (usually £2 million) and lower rounds from £250,000.</p>
<p>Destin describes the fund as &#8220;artisan venture capital” where it invests in &#8220;small batches”. He said: &#8220;We understand startups are chaotic and we embrace the chaos. We value trust over everything else. We are not about control; we&#8217;re about impact. We&#8217;d rather do the work than talk about it, hence the minimal website.”</p>
<p>Over a call, he added: “We don&#8217;t take board seats, we prefer to provide something to the founders that&#8217;s meaningful to them. So we&#8217;ll do ad hoc things, such as a strategy session, help them recruit someone, pointed interventions. The founders seem to really like it.”</p>
<p>Stride’s Fund I has backed 29 companies so far. Perhaps the best known is Cazoo. Although much of its portfolio is undisclosed and defies &#8220;themes&#8221; it’s known to have invested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>API Infrastructure: STRAPI, Impala, WeGift</li>
<li>E-commerce: Cazoo, Front of the Pack</li>
<li>SaaS: SEDNA, Cord, Unibuddy</li>
</ul>
<p>Destin told me: “We don&#8217;t necessarily think it&#8217;s helpful for companies to be announcing what they do and what they&#8217;ve raised. And for ourselves, we don&#8217;t need it to flatter our ego. A lot of our companies are happily operating below the radar.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Let’s discuss IPOs this morning to fully understand where we stand today in the realm of unicorn liquidity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The public markets give, and the public markets take away. Earlier this morning, enterprise cloud storage and productivity company Box got into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/starboard-value-puts-box-on-notice-that-its-looking-to-take-over-board/">a more public spat</a> with some of its shareholders upset with its performance and management decisions. But while Box endures the more difficult chapters of being a public company, other companies are racing to join the ranks of the listed concerns of the world.</p>
<p>If it feels like IPO news slowed for a few weeks at the start of the second quarter, your gut is correct. Investors previously told The Exchange that the first, third and fourth quarters of 2021 would be hot periods for public debuts, but that Q2 would be slower. Their argument revolved around reporting cadences and how long it takes for certain periods of accounting work to be completed.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>So we weren’t surprised when the second quarter’s IPO cycle began to feel a bit soft compared to the rapid-fire first quarter. And, as we’ve all heard in recent days, the great SPAC rush is slowing.</p>
<p>But that hasn’t stopped a number of firms from defying expectations and going public all the same. Online hosting and website builder Squarespace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/squarespace-files-for-a-direct-listing-on-the-nyse/">has not only filed</a> but filled in its public filing with notes on its anticipated direct listing. We have to talk about its choice to list directly in light of new financial information we have concerning its recent performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>But there’s more: Expensify <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005265/en">filed to go public</a> yesterday, albeit privately. And the SmartRent SPAC combination, though now slightly dated, is also worth a moment of our time.</p>
<p>The final element in the current IPO landscape is the recent Darktrace IPO in the United Kingdom, which, after that market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/what-to-make-of-deliveroos-rough-ipo-debut/">had a rough start to its tech IPO calendar</a>, is now <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/darktrace-ipo-dark-stock-skyrockets-43percent-in-london-debut.html">seeing better results</a>. So, let’s discuss IPOs to fully understand where we stand today in the realm of unicorn liquidity.</p>
<h2>Squarespace’s direct listing</h2>
<p>When The Exchange first dug into Squarespace’s IPO filing, we did our best to parse its full-year results because we lacked its quarterly details. This leaves us with two things to chew on: Why is Squarespace pursuing a direct listing over another listing technique, and what can its current and more granular operating results tell us about the choice?</p>
<p>On the first count, if Squarespace is direct listing, we can presume that it doesn’t need more cash to operate. So, how much cash does the company have on hand? A good chunk of change: $183.3 million.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We tend to think of venture capital in tens or hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars, so it&#8217;s refreshing to find <a href="https://www.evening.fund/">Evening Fund</a>, a new $2 million micro fund that focuses on small investments between $50,000 and $100,000 as it seeks to help young startups with early funding.</p>
<p>The new fund was launched by Kat Orekhova and Rapha Danilo. Orekhova, who started her career as a math professor, is a former Facebook data scientist who has been dabbling in angel investing and working with young startups for awhile now. They call it Evening Fund because they work as founders by day and investors by night.</p>
<p>She says that she wanted to create something more formal to help early-stage startups get off the ground and has help from limited partners that include Sarah Smith at Bain Capital, Lee Linden, general partner at Quiet Capital and a long list of tech industry luminaries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Orekhova says she and her partner invest small sums of money in B2B SaaS companies, which are pre-seed, seed and occasionally A rounds. They will invest in consumer here and there as well. She says one of their key value propositions is that they can help with more than just the money. &#8220;One way in which I think Rapha and I can really help our founders is that we give very specific, practical advice, not just kind of super high level,&#8221; she told me.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;US seed-stage investing flourished during pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/us-seed-stage-investing-flourished-during-pandemic/embed/#?secret=D3FFRaNoYb" data-secret="D3FFRaNoYb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That could be something like how to hire your first designer where the founders may not even know what a designer does. &#8220;You&#8217;re figuring out &#8216;how do I hire my first designer?&#8217; and &#8216;what does the designer even do?&#8217; because most founders have never hired a designer before. So we give them extremely practical hands-on stuff like &#8216;here are the competencies&#8217; or &#8216;what&#8217;s the difference between a graphic designer, a visual designer, a UX designer and a researcher,&#8217; &#8221; she said. They go so far as to give them a list of candidates to help them get going.</p>
<p>She says that she realized while she was at Facebook that she wanted to eventually start a company, so she began volunteering her time to work with companies going through Y Combinator. &#8220;I think a lot of people don&#8217;t know where to start, but in my case I looked at the YC list, found a company that I thought I could be helpful to. I reached out cold and said &#8216;Hey, I don&#8217;t want money. I don&#8217;t want equity. I just want to try to be helpful to you and see where that goes,&#8217; &#8221; she said.</p>
<p>That lead to scouting for startups for some larger venture capital firms and eventually dabbling in financing some of these startups that she was helping. Today&#8217;s announcement is the culmination of these years of work and the groundwork she laid to make herself familiar with how the startup ecosystem works.</p>
<p>The new firm already has its first investment under its belt, <a href="https://www.dala.ai/">Dala</a>, an AI-powered internal search tool that helps connect users to workplace knowledge that&#8217;s often locked in applications like Google Suite, Slack and Notion.</p>
<p>As though Evening isn&#8217;t enough to keep her and Danilo busy, they are also each working on their own startups. Orekhova wasn&#8217;t ready to share much on that just yet as her company remains in stealth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What if you could Zoom with your favorite creator and ask them questions? That&#8217;s the promise of <a href="https://brightlive.com/">Bright</a>, the new live video platform launching today from co-founders Guy Oseary and early YouTube product manager Michael Powers. The service, built on top of Zoom, allows fans to engage in live, face-to-face video sessions with creators, ask questions and even join creators on a virtual stage for a more personal and direct learning experience.</p>
<p>Though the startup has some similarities to voice chat apps like Clubhouse, as it also democratizes access to big-name talent at times, the co-founders explain that Bright&#8217;s focus will be very different. Besides being a video-on experience, Bright is solely focused on educational content &#8212; that is, learning from people who are sharing their expertise with the community. In addition, the sessions hosted on Bright are ticketed events, where the creator decides how many tickets they want to sell and how much they&#8217;re charging.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146975" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146975" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2146975" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bright-Homepage-ft.-Ugo-Mozie.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="420" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bright-Homepage-ft.-Ugo-Mozie.jpg 2900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bright-Homepage-ft.-Ugo-Mozie.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bright-Homepage-ft.-Ugo-Mozie.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bright-Homepage-ft.-Ugo-Mozie.jpg?resize=768,475 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bright-Homepage-ft.-Ugo-Mozie.jpg?resize=680,420 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bright-Homepage-ft.-Ugo-Mozie.jpg?resize=1536,950 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bright-Homepage-ft.-Ugo-Mozie.jpg?resize=2048,1266 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bright-Homepage-ft.-Ugo-Mozie.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146975" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bright</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Twenty percent of the content on YouTube was learning. It was the second-biggest area next to music. And that was true the first year of YouTube and it&#8217;s true now at scale,&#8221; explains Bright CEO Michael Powers, as to why Bright has chosen to focus on learning. Powers knows the creator industry firsthand, having launched the YouTube Channels feature while at YouTube, and later managed YouTube&#8217;s first revenue-generating opportunities for creators. More recently, he served as SVP and GM at CBS Interactive.</p>
<p>Powers says he saw how powerful educational and learning content could be, but also how difficult it was for creators earning a rev share off an ad network, like YouTube&#8217;s, to become self-sustainable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I watched that over the past five years, especially, as the different platforms have scaled up,&#8221; Powers says, and became inspired to launch a better way for creators to monetize their expertise. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to empower [creators] so they can go beyond just being a personal brand or social brand, and be an actual business,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Oseary, meanwhile, was tooling around with a similar concept, having also had direct experience with creators in the music industry and through his investments. The founder of Maverick music management company, Oseary <a href="https://variety.com/2020/music/news/guy-oseary-madonna-u2-manager-maverick-1234618275/">continues to manage</a> Madonna and U2, but these days has his hands in numerous startups as the co-founder of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/ashton-kutchers-sound-ventures-targets-150m-for-third-fund/">Sound Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/a-grade-investments">A-Grade Investments</a> with actor Ashton Kutcher.</p>
<p>Though Oseary and Powers have yet to meet in person, they connected over the web &#8212; much like Bright&#8217;s creators will now do &#8212; to get the new startup off the ground during a pandemic.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>With today&#8217;s launch, <a href="https://brightlive.com/">Bright</a> is promising a lineup of more than 200 prominent creators, many from the arts, including Madonna, Ashton Kutcher, Naomi Campbell, Shawn Mendes, Amy Schumer, D-Nice, the D’Amelio Sisters, Laura Dern, Judd Apatow, Deepak Chopra, Diplo, Kenny Smith, Kane Brown, Drew and Jonathan Scott (Property Brothers), Lindsey Vonn, Rachel Zoe, Diego Boneta, Tal Fishman, Ryan Prunty, Demi Skipper, Charlotte McKinney, Jason Bolden, Yris Palmer, Cat &amp; Nat, Ronnie2K, Chef Ludo Lefebvre and Jonathan Mannion, among others.</p>
<p>And it has another 1,500 creators on a waitlist, ready to begin hosting their own sessions when Bright opens up further.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146982" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146982" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2146982" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?w=381" alt="" width="381" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg 909w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=168,300 168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=768,1371 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=381,680 381w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=860,1536 860w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146982" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bright session example</p></div></p>
<p>Although Bright&#8217;s lineup implies it&#8217;s aiming at a high-profile creator crowd, Oseary insists Bright will be for anyone with an audience of their own &#8212; not just famous names.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not elitist&#8230;If you&#8217;ve got an audience and you have something to offer your audience, we would like you on the platform,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Today, creators can go to other social networks, like Facebook Live or Instagram Live, if they want to just chat with fans more casually. But people will come to Bright to be educated, Oseary notes. And short of getting a creator to FaceTime you directly, he believes this will be the next best way to reach them &#8212; and one people are familiar with using, thanks to the Zoom adoption that grew out of the pandemic&#8217;s impact to business culture and remote work.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best way to connect is to use a platform that we&#8217;ve all learned how to use this last year,&#8221; Oseary says, referring to Bright&#8217;s Zoom connection. &#8220;We all already have the app. We already know how to navigate through it. We&#8217;ve added a bunch of features to make it more interesting,&#8221; he adds.</p>

<p>At launch, fans will be able to <a href="http://www.brightlive.com/">visit Bright&#8217;s website</a>, view the array of upcoming events and purchase tickets. Some of the first sessions include Laura Dern leading a &#8220;Tell Your Story&#8221; session about personal growth; Kenny Smith will interview favorite athletes and discuss their mindsets at turning points in their careers; Property Brothers Jonathan &amp; Drew Scott will host &#8220;Room by Room,&#8221; focused on home improvement; recording artist Kane Brown will host &#8220;Record This: Nashville Edition&#8221; about the country music industry; and Ronnie2K will host a series about building a career in gaming.</p>
<p>Bright&#8217;s model will see it taking a 20% commission on creator revenue, which is lower than the traditional marketplace split of 30/70 (platform/creator), but higher than the commission-free payments on Clubhouse (at least for the time being!). Further down the road, Bright envisions building out more tools to help creators with other aspects of their business &#8212; like the sale of physical or digital goods, for example.</p>
<p>Though there are numerous creator platforms to choose from these days, Bright aims to give creators direct access to their own analytics about their biggest fans, their content and fans&#8217; contact information, like names and emails (if fans opt in). This allows them to continue their relationship with their community beyond Bright into other areas of their business &#8212; whether that&#8217;s email newsletters or Shopify stores.</p>
<p>To make all this work, LA-based <a href="https://brightlive.com/">Bright</a> has recruited a team with deep expertise in both the creator economy and tech.</p>
<p>This includes Bright&#8217;s VP of Talent &amp; Partnership, Kaitlyn Powell, former head of Talent at Caffeine; Bright&#8217;s lead Creator &amp; Product Strategy, Sadia Harper, formerly a UX Strategist at Instagram; Bright&#8217;s director of Creative Programming, Jeben Berg, previously of YouTube &amp; Maker Studios; Design lead Heather Grates, previously of Pinterest; and Bright&#8217;s finance lead Jarad Backlund, previously in roles at Apple and Facebook.</p>
<p>The startup has raised an undisclosed amount funding from Oseary&#8217;s own Sound Ventures, as well as RIT Capital, Norwest, Globo and other investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is making its video Stories and Reels more accessible with the launch of a new &#8220;captions sticker&#8221; that will allow users to watch without having the sound on. The addition will not only make it easier for users who are hard of hearing or deaf to engage with video content, it also offers a way for users to watch videos when they&#8217;re somewhere they don&#8217;t want to have their sound on &#8212; and either don&#8217;t want to wear or don&#8217;t have access to headphones or earbuds.</p>
<p>To use the feature, creators will first record a new video using the Stories or Reels Camera in the Instagram app, or select a video to upload from their phone&#8217;s gallery. Then, you&#8217;ll open the sticker tray and look for the new &#8220;Captions&#8221; sticker, which will convert your speech to text. You also can edit the style, position of the caption and the text and color so it matches your content. When you post, the captions will appear alongside your video for everyone to see.</p>
<p>At launch, the feature is only available in English and in English-speaking countries, but Instagram plans to roll it out to other countries and languages soon, it says. It&#8217;s also rolling out the captions sticker first to Stories and will then begin testing it in Reels, with a broader launch to follow.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The captions sticker had been <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1303070629386690562">spotted</a> last year while in development, alongside other potential new additions, like <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1322287223232991234">a Collab sticker</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1384220655239897097">Link sticker,</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1380624546135478275">Reshare sticker</a> and others. Instagram parent Facebook also appears to have<a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1380307322262667266"> a captions sticker of its own</a> in development. The sticker then <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1369351891445030918">began testing earlier this spring</a> with some number of Instagram users.</p>
<p>The addition comes only weeks after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/tiktok-adds-auto-captions-to-make-videos-accessible-to-hard-of-hearing-and-deaf/">TikTok announced its own captions feature</a>, which it calls auto captions. The two products are somewhat different, however. Auto captions automatically translate the speech from a TikTok video in either American English and Japanese, to start, but the text itself isn&#8217;t customizable and can be turned on or off by the viewer from the app&#8217;s share panel. It also hasn&#8217;t yet been broadly adopted and many TikTok creators tend to still use captions they create themselves or via third-party apps.</p>
<p>Instagram notes it had previously launched support for captions across Threads and IGTV, but its expansion to Stories and Reels will make more of an impact, given that Instagram Stories alone is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/instagram-stories-500-million/">used by more than 500 million people</a> every day.</p>
