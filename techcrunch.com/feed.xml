<p>Skeptics of the flourishing web3 industry attack it for a number of reasons. One critique that resonates in Washington is that digital currency could undermine the country’s current monetary system, even the U.S. dollar itself.</p>
<p>But while digital assets have undeniably disrupted traditional financial services, they are far from being an enemy of the dollar. In fact, a type of digital asset, the stablecoin, has the potential to cement USD dominance worldwide. But if the U.S. is to capitalize on stablecoins&#8217; potential, policymakers and regulators must take a measured approach to regulation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250019" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stablecoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stablecoins</a> are a class of digital asset designed to maintain a stable price over time. They differ from other digital assets in that their price is often pegged to fiat currencies, usually USD. They have also evolved substantially since Facebook’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/key-takeaways-from-crypto-stablecoin-hearing-before-house-panelhttps:/www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/key-takeaways-from-crypto-stablecoin-hearing-before-house-panel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attempt </a>to launch its own “Libra” stablecoin two years ago (a project so unpopular Facebook subsequently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/libra-association-rebrands-as-diem/">rebranded</a> it to “Diem”).</p>
<p>Facebook initially designed Libra as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/facebook-backed-association-revamps-libra-following-regulatory-concerns/">new currency</a>, pegging it to a basket of fiat currencies and securities rather than just one. Policymakers globally <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/18/how-the-wheels-came-off-facebook-libra-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panned</a> Libra and cited its potential to threaten global financial stability, abuse data privacy and undermine monetary policy. Former president Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/19/heres-why-regulators-are-so-worried-about-facebooks-digital-currency.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Libra would have “little standing or dependability” and that the “only one real currency” in the U.S. is the dollar.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today and stablecoins’ special connection to the dollar gives them the potential to expand dollar dominance rather than threaten it. However, that potential will only be realized if enough U.S. policymakers understand the promise of stablecoins and pass reasonable regulations that encourage, rather than hinder, innovation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Stablecoins’ exponential growth</h2>
<p>Mainstream use of stablecoins is picking up, with the market growing from <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1255835/stablecoin-market-capitalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$5 billion</a> in December 2019 to more than <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/view/stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$158 billion</a> in December 2021.</p>
<p>One reason for this growth is stablecoins’ inherent advantages over current financial technologies. For instance, stablecoins can be transferred instantaneously to anyone around the world with little to no transaction cost.</p>
<p>For a tangible example of the impact of stablecoins, consider their use by migrant workers. Typically, workers send their money home through traditional financial institutions. The process can take weeks and costs, on average, <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/06/1040581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7% of a worker’s earnings</a> in transfer and conversion fees. Stablecoins, on the other hand, allow migrant workers to send their wages home instantaneously for almost no cost.</p>
<h2>Stablecoins increase demand for USD</h2>
<p>Since all major stablecoins are <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/view/stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denominated in USD</a>, their exponential adoption around the world gives the U.S. a critical opportunity to expand dollar dominance. Meanwhile leading stablecoin issuers like <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circle</a> hold their <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/coinbase-circle-to-move-all-usdc-reserves-into-cash-treasuries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reserves in USD and short-term U.S. Treasuries</a>. This both increases demand for USD and makes dollars more accessible to buyers across the globe. These developments make the U.S. better positioned than any other country to take advantage of consumer interest in this new technology.</p>
<p>The stablecoin market will likely sustain outsized demand for USD given the network effects reinforcing the existing popularity of USD-backed stablecoins. This is particularly true in countries with <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/22/why-argentines-are-turning-from-dollars-to-stablecoins-like-dai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unmet demand for USD</a>, like Argentina, where the government <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/argentina-central-bank-use-full-force-tame-fx-markets-source-says-2021-07-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limits its citizens’ access</a> to hard currencies.</p>
<h2>What could go wrong for the U.S.?</h2>
<p>Despite its potential, poorly crafted regulations could kill the stablecoin sector in the U.S. while the industry thrives abroad. A lack of regulatory clarity for blockchain companies has already pushed U.S. founders to move their operations to jurisdictions with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/23/us/politics/crypto-billionaires.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clearer and/or more permissive regulations</a>, like Singapore, Portugal and the Cayman Islands. Fidelity Investments, one of America’s best-known investment advisers, notably <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-117-ba00-wstate-brooksb-20211208.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> its Bitcoin ETF in Canada as regulators have not yet authorized a similar offering in the U.S.</p>
<p>Further, the recently passed infrastructure bill contains <a href="https://theblockchainassociation.org/provision-in-infrastructure-bill-threatens-crypto-innovation-says-blockchain-association/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unworkable</a> digital asset tax reporting requirements that, if left unchanged, would deepen a growing trend of blockchain companies moving offshore. Policymakers have responded to this threat by trying to amend these requirements, including through the bipartisan <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-keep-innovation-in-america-act-could-fix-new-crypto-tax-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keep Innovation In America Act</a>, but they may not be successful in time.</p>
<p>On stablecoins specifically, policymakers are split. The recent <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/stablecoins-how-do-they-work-how-are-they-used-and-what-are-their-risks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate Banking Committee</a> hearing on stablecoins struck a harsh tone. Senators cited many of the same concerns they had with Libra, demonstrating a lack of understanding or interest in the different types of stablecoins. Meanwhile a bipartisan congressional committee surprised observers with its enthusiasm for stablecoins at a key <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/events/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=408705" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hearing</a> earlier this month. Equally surprising were Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s <a href="https://twitter.com/BloombergTV/status/1471215636655259653?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comments </a>this month that “stablecoins can be a useful, efficient, consumer-serving part of the financial system if they are properly regulated.”</p>
<p>To keep stablecoin innovation in the U.S., policymakers and regulators need to provide the industry with clear guardrails that don’t stifle innovation. Regulations should ensure stability and transparency, without limiting the industry’s potential to grow through innovations like decentralized reserves.</p>
<p>Policymakers should also account for negative externalities that stablecoins can have for countries that can’t compete with the U.S. While stablecoins <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/12/14/myanmar-shadow-government-approves-crypto-as-official-currency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help citizens disempower</a> autocratic and corrupt governments they may equally undermine the monetary controls of friendly nations with weak currencies.</p>
<p>If the U.S. — purposely or inadvertently — pushes stablecoin issuers away, offshore industry and foreign governments will happily take their market share.</p>
<p>Foreign issuers have already launched stablecoins in other currencies, including in Euro and the Canadian dollar. Demand will continue for USD-denominated stablecoin, but if unreasonable U.S. regulation pushes the industry offshore, the U.S. will have less leverage to set requirements around <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USD reserves and transparency</a>.</p>
<p>China, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden and others are taking a more active approach to stablecoin development and promotion than the U.S. by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/10/opinion/cash-crypto-trust-money.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">piloting stablecoins backed by their respective central banks</a>, known as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). While it remains to be seen whether CBDCs become popular among consumers, particularly given privacy concerns, they could erode the stablecoin dominance the U.S. currently enjoys.</p>
<p>Global currency competition is here and scaling quickly. Nations that don’t embrace it will be left behind. The U.S. is no exception.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The reality-bending powers of AI have been kept increasingly busy over the past decade. We&#8217;ve had computer vision-powered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/19/seene-uses-computer-vision-to-create-unique-and-eerie-3d-images-on-iphone/">3D dioramas</a>; trend-setting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/24/prisma-uses-ai-to-turn-your-photos-into-graphic-novel-fodder-double-quick/">style-transfer</a>; viral <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/08/faceapp-uses-neural-networks-for-photorealistic-selfie-tweaks/">photorealistic selfie-tuning</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/facetune-maker-lightricks-brings-its-popular-selfie-retouching-features-to-video/">selfie-retouching</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/reface-now-lets-users-face-swap-into-pics-they-upload/"> face-swaps </a>and &#8212; ofc &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/deep-fake-video-app-avatarify-which-process-on-phone-plans-digital-watermark-for-videos/">deepfakes</a>; and plenty of frivolous (and <a href="https://twitter.com/MikaelThalen/status/1359209202292428800">hilarious</a>) fun with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/10/snapchat-debuts-a-library-of-selfie-filters/">selfie filters</a> (ohhai <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/everyone-you-know-is-a-disney-princess-which-means-ar-is-queen/">&#8216;Disneyfying&#8217; cartoon lens</a>!) in between.</p>
<p>AI-powered visual remixing has shown, again and again, it can grab attention. Although keeping &#8216;eyes on&#8217; once the novelty of an AI-generated effect wears off can be harder. (Selfie retouching apps don&#8217;t have that problem, mind; there&#8217;s perpetual demand for machine learning as a reality <em>enhancer</em>.)</p>
<p>What&#8217;s most notable about developments in AI-enabled synthetic media over this period is how much speed these visual effects have picked up, helped by ever more powerful mobile processing hardware.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250975" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Wait times for a finished result can now be essentially instant &#8212; a game changer for productizing (and potentially monetizing) the creativity and power of neural networks and GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). Aka, the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">machine learning frameworks doing the retouching, reframing or indeed generative modelling, jumping off of a human prompt for their inspiration. </span></p>
<p>And while most of the app-based visual remixing of the past decade has focused on retouching/restyling/augmenting vs pure-play AI-powered image generation, that too is changing.</p>
<p>Wombo, a Canadian startup which grabbed earlier eyeballs for its eponymous AI-enabled lipsyncing video app, recently launched another app, called <a href="https://www.wombo.art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dream</a> (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/wombo-dream/id1586366816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.womboai.wombodream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>), which uses AI to create original &#8220;artworks&#8221; &#8212; based on a text prompt.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s super, <em>super</em> simple: You simply describe what you want it to paint &#8212; say &#8216;A terrifying tree&#8217; or &#8216;The worst sandwich in history&#8217; &#8212; pick a style from the selection offered (Mystical, Baroque, Fantasy Art, Steampunk etc), or opt for &#8220;no style&#8221;; and hit create.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Then, in literally a few seconds &#8212; I counted &lt;20 &#8212; the app displays your finished &#8216;artwork&#8217;.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t even get bored during these few seconds of creation because you get to see a glimpse of the AI at work: The app shows the modelling&#8217;s rapid-fire evolution &#8212; from starter marks, through a few inhumanly fast additions fleshing out the canvas, to arrive, practically breathless, at another finished composition.</p>
<p>Some of these generated artworks look kinda impressive. Some&#8230; not so much.</p>
<p>But of course no two prompts generate the same image. So you can keep asking for a new image from the same prompt until you like the look of what you see.</p>
<p>In short, Christmas card artists and pulp fiction illustrators can probably retire now.</p>
<p>Everyone is an &#8216;artist&#8217; now.</p>
<p>That said, actual artists <em>should</em> have less to worry about. Not least because art made by a human brain and body is only going to increase in value once the world is awash with &#8216;machine art&#8217;. (Just as every NFT minted dilutes the meaning of the phrase &#8220;digital art&#8221;&#8230; )</p>
<p>The quality of the Dream app&#8217;s &#8216;art&#8217; is definitely variable. Longer, more complex prompts seem to confound it. So the quality of the output can depend on what you ask it to draw.</p>
<p>While its &#8216;style&#8217;, if it can be thought of having a single overarching style in the midst of so much pastiche, tends more to the abstract and distorted vs the specific and precise. So portrait requests won&#8217;t be rendered photorealistic. And it&#8217;s typically more comfortable depicting the fantastical than the actual. (A &#8216;Madonna and child&#8217; prompt served a work closer to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrZ3bytd2J0">infamous Spanish church restoration fail</a> than a crypto-Botticelli, for example.)</p>
<p>But the sheer speed of production is impressive. Slash terrifying.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2251005,2251009,2251017,2251008,2251006,2251007"]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As soon as a fresh artwork appears, the app wastes no time in trying to sell it &#8212; popping up an option to &#8220;buy print&#8221;, which links to its web shop and looks like a neat way to turn a visual trick into actual revenue. (It&#8217;s offering &#8220;Custom Wombo Dream Print[s]&#8221; that start at $20 for a matte poster or $45 for a framed print.)</p>
<p>If the startup can turn ~20 seconds of processing into $20+ of revenue that could make for a nice little money pipeline.</p>
<p>By the end of last month <a href="https://twitter.com/WOMBO/status/1465708826875760641">10M+ images</a> had already been generated by users. (While the Google Play app has had over 1M downloads already, <a href="https://twitter.com/WOMBO/status/1459244166081396751">a month or so</a> after launch.)</p>

<p>Here’s ‘Giant Yellow Egg’ in the Synthwave style <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f308.png" alt="🌈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/7JqB8DuXgL">pic.twitter.com/7JqB8DuXgL</a></p>
<p>&mdash; WOMBO.eth (@WOMBO) <a href="https://twitter.com/WOMBO/status/1459244166081396751?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Albeit, most people have finite wall space on which to hang any kind of art, let alone imagery generated by, er, a mindless machine &#8212; so most of these random creations will stay firmly virtual. (&#8216;AI art&#8217; could be perfect NFT fodder, though&#8230;)</p>
<p>Where &#8216;AI art&#8217; will fall in the fashion/cultural value stakes is certainly an interesting question to ponder.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s superior to clip art or stock photos, sure. And the Dream app&#8217;s output can also be more interesting than the average &#8216;art&#8217; print you could buy in IKEA. But results can also be rather queasy &#8212; or derivative &#8212; or naff &#8212; or just plain odd.</p>
<p>And, well, is it art? Or is it just a visual output of a mathematical process? An abstraction of human creative skill that can&#8217;t translate real emotion or a sense of identity or soul because code doesn&#8217;t have any of those things? It&#8217;s just doing what it&#8217;s told.</p>
<p>And do you really want to hang a coded abstraction on your walls?</p>
<p>I mean, maybe? If it&#8217;s <em>especially</em> aesthetic. But, well, is that art or just wallpaper? Maybe Wombo should be selling rolls of Dream AI wallpaper or printed mouse mats and t-shirts (merch), rather than &#8216;art&#8217; prints&#8230;</p>
<p>Lots to ponder.</p>
<p>A few things are clear: AI-generated art is incredibly fun to play with. It&#8217;s a sort of visual catnip. A toy for the imagination.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also, undoubtedly, here to stay. And AI models will keep getting &#8216;better&#8217; &#8212; depending on what we mean by &#8216;better&#8217; around such a subjective subject as art. (Maybe generative art models will serve more successful results by bringing the user more fully into the creative process &#8212; giving them tools to customize and manipulate machine outputs so they can be (fine)tuned until they&#8217;re closer to whatever the person was imagining, or else <em>feel</em> more personally unique and meaningful. Or, in other words, a more hybrid creation process may make for more powerful and moving art-ish outputs.)</p>
<p>There will also be scores of these arty AIs, each producing different &#8216;flavors&#8217; and &#8216;characters&#8217; of visual output &#8212; derived from their training data. Or even &#8212; if you like &#8212; art AIs with different &#8216;styles&#8217;. (But perhaps &#8216;specialisms&#8217; is closer to the coded mark.)</p>
<p>There are a number of other GAN-based image generation AI tools out there &#8212; and I confess to being <a href="https://twitter.com/riptari/status/1466722997453135872">a big fan</a> of <a href="https://pixray.gob.io/">Pixray</a>&#8216;s system (the pixel art outputs are especially cute) although its processing speeds are much, much slower &#8212; but Wombo appears to have been quickest to the punch to appify and monetize this tech.</p>
<p>The next decade of reality-bending machine learning will be quite the trip.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So-called ‘Deep Tech’ venture capital has been experiencing a wave of interest in the couple last years with several new funds launching. Many are focused on the European market, which has a deep bench (no pun intended) of talent and innovation, thanks in part to its many excellent universities.</p>
<p>The latest is <a href="http://outsized.vc">Outsized Ventures</a>, a new European deep tech focused fund, which has now has hit the first close of its inaugural fund of €60 million.</p>
<p>The new fund will focus at “Seed+”, be that shortly before a Seed round or just before a Series A round for a startup. The fund aims to invest in roughly 25 companies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251035" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Outsized was founded in March 2021 by Rodrigo Mallo, Isabel Fox and Lomax Ward (formerly of Luminous Ventures and SOSV). The aim is to “back founders pushing the boundaries of science and technology to solve the world’s greatest challenges around the future of health, planet and society.”</p>
<p>“We’ve believed for some time that the next wave of great companies will be at the intersection of scientific disciplines and that Europe is well placed to lead that charge”, commented  Isabel Fox, General Partner at Outsized Ventures.  </p>
<p>Limited Partners in the fund include family offices, angel investors, European founders, global investors and experienced tech startup operators.</p>
<p>Rodrigo Mallo, General Partner at Outsized Ventures, added: “We’ve built an incredible community of Limited Partners as passionate as us and the founders we back, that we can turn big ideas into massive companies to make the world safer, cleaner, healthier and fairer for us all.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Saul Klein, Co-Founder of LocalGlobe and one of the LPs in the new Outsized fund said: “There is still much to be done to encourage more women to be founders or investors in science and innovation. Consequently, we’re delighted to support Izzy on this journey and will be working together on key initiatives supporting greater diversity in deep tech and frontier technology. Together we can help make innovation and science more open to diversity and inclusion, whilst generating significant returns.”</p>
<p>Klein has invested via the LP fund he shares with his father, Robin, dubbed Basecamp’ which supports seed-stage and micro-funds. This is not to be confused the famous startup of the same name, however.</p>
<p>Another LP, Robert Paull, Co-Founder &amp; Venture Partner at Lux Capital, healthcare entrepreneur and Outsized Senior Advisor &amp; LP said: “Outsized Ventures is poised to be one of the next great venture firms in Europe. I’m delighted to help them build the firm and assist their portfolio companies, especially expanding into the U.S. market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founders are often faced with the decision of who to bring onto the cap table, especially at the early stage. VCs often promise the earth in order to get onto this all important cap table. So Outsized has come up with what it calls an “Equity Back Guarantee”. This means that if Outsized Ventures turns out to be something other than what was promised, for a three month period the founder can return the cash and keep their equity. <br />
Lomax ward, General Partner at Outsized Ventures, commented: “When you are mis-sold something, you can get a refund.  This applies to goods, meals, holidays &#8211; why not venture capitalists? Simply put, the most valuable thing a founder has is equity and if we take a piece of that by overselling ourselves, then the founder can take the equity back. It’s as fair as it can be.” </p>
<p>It’s certainly an interesting innovation, and might turn the heads of a few founders, assuming Outsized can get that message out there loud enough.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Brazilian construction tech startup Ambar announced it has raised a large Series C round of R$204 million, approximately $36 million, to boost the digitization arm of its business.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brazilian construction tech startup <a href="https://ambar.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambar</a> announced it has raised a large Series C round: R$204 million, approximately $36 million at today&#8217;s mid-market rate. The round was co-led by Brazil-based Echo Capital and <a href="https://www.oriacapital.technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oria Capital</a>, with participation from <a href="https://www.tpg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TPG Capital</a>, <a href="https://www.argonauticventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Argonautic Ventures</a>, and others.</p>
<p>Ambar was created in 2013 with the ambition to leverage technology to make the civil construction process more efficient. According to the company, it has raised R$360 million in equity funding to date. That&#8217;s some $100 million, CEO Bruno Balbinot estimated.</p>
<p>This $100 million figure is higher than the current equivalent of R$360 million in dollars, but the exchange rate has varied quite a bit over the years, so figuring out that number isn&#8217;t straightforward. And on the other hand, it doesn&#8217;t account for the fact that the company also <a href="https://forbes.com.br/forbes-money/2021/06/aposta-no-venture-debt-ganha-forca-entre-startups-brasileiras/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised venture debt</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250987" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Regardless of the exact tally, the gist is that Ambar now has a significant amount of capital to execute its plans. Talking to TechCrunch, Balbinot explained that the startup plans to use the proceeds to boost the digitization arm of its business, for which it sees a strong need across Latin America.</p>
<p>While Spanish-speaking Latin America is driving some of its revenue, it is Brazil where Ambar is most present, Balbinot said. The startup&#8217;s home country presents two advantages: It is the region&#8217;s largest market, and Brazilian Portuguese acts as a moat against competitors.</p>
<p>According to Ambar&#8217;s site, it has 467 active clients. Three of these are located in the U.S., but its presence there is more of a learning experiment, Balbinot told me. In contrast, it is currently present on 1,500 building sites across Brazil.</p>
<p>Ambar has two sides to its business: digitization, which it is now planning to boost further, and industrialization, which some media outlets have <a href="https://forbes.com.br/colunas/2020/02/ambar-mira-consumidor-final-com-plataforma-de-construcao-civil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likened</a> to Lego for the construction sector.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ambar is not a general contractor, though. &#8220;Our angle is to partner with those who construct, and we will never construct,&#8221; Balbinot said in Portuguese. Rather than simply claiming that Ambar is a tech company, he backs it up with its unit economics, which are &#8220;much higher than in the construction sector.&#8221;</p>
<p>Balbinot and his co-founder Ian Fadel have an unexpected source of inspiration: the automotive industry. Having both worked in connection with Volkswagen, they hope to bring the same kind of process-driven approach to the construction sector.</p>
<p>Transforming the construction business to make it more efficient also happens to make it more sustainable. By optimizing human and material resources, Ambar is reducing waste, which is a huge byproduct of traditional construction.</p>
<p>This is an issue its latest investors are committed to. Oria Capital is a <a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/find-a-b-corp/company/oria-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B corporation</a>, and the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) <a href="https://www.oriacapital.technology/esg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">section</a> of its site explains that &#8220;Oria&#8217;s portfolio aims to contribute with the main Sustainable Development Objectives proposed by the UN.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, the Series C round was co-led by Echo Capital, the newly formed growth fund of Ambar board member <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guilhermeweege/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guilherme Weege</a>, who has ties to the United Nations Global Compact initiative. The CEO of fashion group Grupo Malwee is one of the business leaders who signed the initiative&#8217;s <a href="https://www.unglobalcompact.org/take-action/events/climate-action-summit-2019/business-ambition/business-leaders-taking-action">Business Ambition for 1.5°C</a> commitment.</p>
<p>Both funds also have portfolio success stories that Ambar would like to emulate. Weege&#8217;s family office backed <a href="https://www.infracommerce.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infracommerce</a>, a Brazilian company that recently <a href="https://www.clearygottlieb.com/news-and-insights/news-listing/infracommerce-in-r-870-million-ipo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPO&#8217;d</a> on the Novo Mercado segment of São Paulo&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/as-its-startup-market-accelerates-brazil-could-be-in-for-an-ipo-bonanza/">B3 stock exchange</a>. As for Oria, its <a href="https://lavca.org/2021/04/18/oria-capital-reaches-brl500m-final-close-for-oria-tech-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third fund of $100 million</a> financed a follow-on investment into <a href="https://www.zenvia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenvia</a>, which <a href="https://api.mziq.com/mzfilemanager/v2/d/0f31763b-487c-410f-8095-8796d134f4ef/a75d3018-cccb-6d3e-fcbd-a3a3a505ee19?origin=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went public on the Nasdaq</a> last July.</p>
<p>Ambar is also part of the companies backed by Oria&#8217;s third fund, and has big growth plans for next year: &#8220;We are going to double the number of simultaneous construction works with applied Ambar products and win 970 new clients in 2022,&#8221; Balbinot said.</p>
<p>Having recently <a href="https://exame.com/negocios/empresa-se-inspirou-volkswagen-para-fazer-predios-mais-baratos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought</a> software company <a href="https://site.autodoc.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autodoc</a>, Balbinot and his team plan to make the IT side of their business a priority. The startup wants to remove fragmentation and let its clients &#8220;access everything on just one platform,&#8221; Balbinot said. &#8220;If there were ten applications and many people to control all this, now we will offer everything unified, with the same login.&#8221;</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The acquisition, which is SK Hynix’s largest acquisition deal, will help SK Hynix to expand its NAND SSD business and narrow the gap with market leader Samsung Electronics. Meanwhile, Intel will continue to retain optane business to invest in more advanced technology, Intel said last year. The U.S. company plans to divest the NAND unit and double down on developing technology, including 5G network infrastructure, artificial intelligence and edge computing. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SK Hynix will make the first payment of $7 billion by the end of this year and the remaining $2 billion by March 2025, a spokesperson at SK Hynix confirmed.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There has been concern that SK Hynix will not receive China’s permission for the deal amid the tensions between the U.S. and China.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based language learning service <a href="https://www.babbel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Babbel</a> was supposed to IPO on the Frankfurt stock exchange in late September. But only a few days before the initial listing the company <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/babbel-ipo/language-learning-app-babbel-postpones-its-frankfurt-ipo-idUSKBN2GH23Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulled the plug</a> with an eye on the developing Evergrande debt crisis that made the global stock markets very nervous. It has yet to announce a new date, but as Babbel CEO Arne Schepker told me, the company continues to monitor the markets.</p>
<p>Scrapping the IPO was clearly unexpected for everybody, though. &#8220;It was disappointing for the team that worked on it &#8212; worked hard and long &#8212; and we were doing really well,&#8221; Schepker said. &#8220;We had our books covered, we were on the right trajectory, met more than 100 super-interesting investors, got fantastic feedback &#8212; and then the Evergrande situation unraveled, which pulled the plug on most of the IPO markets. We were faced with a very conscious decision of do we launch ourselves into that market, yes or no?&#8221;</p>
<p>Schepker is confident that the company made the right decision, something the team was able to do because Babbel is well-funded and has plenty of cash in the bank, as well as other financing options to continue to invest in its products and make acquisitions as opportunities arise.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250856" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>One of the company&#8217;s fastest-growing businesses is its live classes, which augment the service&#8217;s app-based language learning tools. Launched earlier this year, <a href="https://www.babbel.com/live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Babbel Live</a> saw a 300% increase in subscriptions and a 400% increase in revenue in the second half of 2021 compared to the first half. With tens of thousands of learners, Babbel Live now hosts 15,000 classes each month and Schepker tells me that for about 25% of these learners, the live platform is the first touchpoint for these users, while 75% get started with the app.</p>
<p>Babbel Live and the company&#8217;s B2B Babbel for Business services now account for 9% of the company&#8217;s revenue. And business overall is looking good, too, with billable sales in November surpassing $20 million, up 30% from 2020.</p>
<p>It helps, Schepker noted, that the company is able to recruit some of the best teachers, thanks to its reputation for a high-quality product. &#8220;We push the frontiers of innovation and we always tried to make the best of the human intelligence and the artificial intelligence. So we&#8217;re neither fully human nor fully tech and I think that&#8217;s what makes us very attractive for live tutoring classroom teachers,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2250858" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MyClasses_ENGDEU.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250858" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2250858" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MyClasses_ENGDEU.png" alt="" width="1024" height="728" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MyClasses_ENGDEU.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MyClasses_ENGDEU.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MyClasses_ENGDEU.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MyClasses_ENGDEU.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MyClasses_ENGDEU.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MyClasses_ENGDEU.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2250858" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Babbel</p></div></p>
<p>As for the company&#8217;s B2B side, Babbel signed up 5,000 new corporate learners in November and the company now works with more than 1,000 companies. It took Babbel a while to build up this business, which was only available in Germany for a long time and only recently expanded to Italy. The plan is to soon expand it to other European markets and then the U.S., too. Schepker noted that corporate language learning is about a third of the overall language learning market, so this represents quite a growth opportunity for the company.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the Babbel team is specifically looking at how it can create more integrations between its different platforms, so that a teacher on Babbel Live can see what a student has learned in the app between classes, for example. Add to that Babbel&#8217;s podcasts, in-app games and other touchpoints and Babbel already offers quite a rich ecosystem of language learning tools. The question now is how it can bring all of those into a more cohesive platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Users tend to stitch together their own ecosystem of learning methods, but I call that creative chaos because we never really learned how to do that &#8212; and it&#8217;s not integrated,&#8221; Schepker said. &#8220;So the different learning methods don&#8217;t get the benefit of knowing what Arne has just done on his app as Arne walks into a classroom. That&#8217;s the added value that we see in the ecosystem, both for the learner as well as for the teachers and for us as a language learning company: to make sure that we can actually get you further in your learning journey because we stitch together your ecosystem for you.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA["It's not just pushing a button while enjoying a hot chocolate, so for anyone who wants to launch an app in the middle of the holiday season, be prepared to mobilize the entire team."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is breaking with holiday tradition: The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/apple-says-app-store-wont-close-to-developers-over-holidays-as-in-previous-years/">announced early last month</a> that its App Store will continue to review developer submissions over the holidays, welcome news for app developers facing their busiest season.</p>
<p>Previously, an app that needed to release a bug fix or a critical update on Black Friday or during the final hours of Christmas shopping couldn&#8217;t push a fix for days. This year, from December 23 to 27, App Store Connect service staff will work a reduced schedule, which means updates will take place, but reviews “may take longer to complete,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>On the surface, this looks like a complete win for app developers and their customers, but one experts we spoke to warned that some developers may run into unintended consequences if they don&#8217;t adapt to the recent changes.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best software consultants for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>For clarity, we interviewed two people whose agencies help companies with their mobile apps: <a href="https://www.wolfpack-digital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wolfpack Digital</a> CEO Georgina Lupu Florian and <a href="https://appetiser.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Appetiser</a>&#8216;s Jamie Shostak, whom we recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/appetisers-co-founders-discuss-building-client-relationships-and-getting-to-mvp/">interviewed</a> following our <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey to identify the best software consultants for startups</a>. For balance, we also spoke to Yasser Bashir, co-founder of software development company <a href="https://arbisoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arbisoft</a>.</p>
<p>Florian and Shostak both said they mostly see the change as positive, they told TechCrunch. &#8220;This is amazing news for our clients,&#8221; said Shostak. But Lupu Florian added a note of caution: &#8220;We believe for some companies and developers this can also create difficulties if it&#8217;s not understood and managed properly.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The end of a headache</h2>
<p>According to Shostak, Apple&#8217;s policy &#8220;was definitely a challenge&#8221; for their clients to manage around in previous years. Knowing that App Store Connect wouldn&#8217;t accept updates or new launches always affected end-of-year planning, he said. &#8220;Generally, teams would need to sprint to finish sooner, or plan for smaller updates.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of trying to force as many features as possible before the holidays,&#8221; said Lupu Florian, &#8220;we focused on the most important ones and aimed to finish them first, allocating more time for quality assurance and testing. By doing that, we had more time to solve potential problems before they even got to production.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for December 22, 2021! Greg here again. I&#8217;ll be handling the newsletter for <a href="https://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> for this final stretch of the year while he takes a very much deserved break.</p>
<p>Tech news tends to get a little quieter during these last weeks of the year because … well, holidays. But if anything big happens, we&#8217;ll make sure you know about it! —<a href="http://twitter.com/grg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250820" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/after-essentials-failure-osom-plans-a-new-privacy-first-handset/">Essential&#8217;s spiritual successor:</a></strong> Over the years, the smartphone arena has sort of boiled down to iPhone versus whatever Android phone is cool right now. Is there room for another contender? A bunch of former employees of Essential — a company that shipped one phone before shutting down and selling the brand to OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei — think so and are working on a privacy-centric Android phone under the brand OSOM (pronounced &#8220;awesome&#8221; because why not.)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/ellume-bug-covid-results/">Bluetooth COVID-19 test has bugs:</a></strong> An at-home COVID-19 test that uses a Bluetooth-enabled analyzer to provide certified results? Sounds handy. Unfortunately, researcher Ken Gannon found that this one can seemingly be manipulated.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/22/chatter-phone-bluetooth-bug/">Fisher-Price&#8217;s Chatter phone has bugs, too:</a></strong> Speaking of Bluetooth bugs, it looks like this nostalgia-tastic novelty speaker might have some issues of its own. If you have one, it sounds like you might want to make sure it&#8217;s properly hung up when not in use.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/next-day-package-delivery-veho-series-a/">Veho gets valued at $1B:</a></strong> Veho, a New York-based startup trying to simplify next-day package delivery, just raised $125 million in a round valuing the company at $1 billion. Its thing, writes Christine Hall, is &#8220;providing transparency into deliveries that starts with the option of when, where and how customers want their packages delivered.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/22/dealroom-raises-e6m-series-a-for-its-startup-data-market-intelligence-service/">Dealroom raises €6 million:</a></strong> A European competitor to products like PitchBook/CB Insights/Crunchbase has raised €6 million in a Series A. Alex Wilhelm has the breakdown of what the company is focusing on, what it’s doing differently and where it goes from here.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/22/tiktok-rival-triller-to-go-public-via-merger-with-seachange-international/">Triller to go public via merger:</a></strong> It might not have the same name recognition, but TikTok rival Triller is still making moves. Triller announced this week that it&#8217;ll go public by way of a reverse merger with Massachusetts-based video tech company SeaChange, with the new combo company calling itself &#8220;TrillerVerz Corp.&#8221;</li>

<p>Before spending six figures to develop a brand ethos, early-stage startup teams must first create a solid foundation that reflects their collective vision.</p>
<p>In the first of a series of articles on startup branding, Fuel Capital CMO Jamie Viggiano <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/start-building-your-brand-book-with-a-visioning-workshop/">walks readers through the process</a> of setting up a workshop where your founding team can &#8220;dig deep into your collective motivations, inspirations and ambition.&#8221;</p>
<p>This exercise is a critical investment: If you hire a branding agency or a consultant, they will do this work without you and the result will be inevitably less authentic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Skipping ethos work is a costly mistake that produces a disjointed and rudderless brand, directly and negatively impacting the growth potential of the company,&#8221; writes Viggiano.</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/22/zillow-adds-facetime-shareplay-to-browse-homes-with-friends/">Zillow makes house hunting a co-op game:</a></strong> The pandemic got people used to doing more stuff together remotely — working, watching movies, playing games, etc. It also spiked the popularity of poking around Zillow as a pastime. Zillow is mashing those two trends together, tapping Apple&#8217;s SharePlay to allow users to hunt for homes together from afar.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s beginning to look a bit like MWC. Of course, things have thus far played out a bit differently than Mobile World Congress’s planned show in Barcelona back in 2020. There are clear reasons for this &#8212; back then, the pandemic was a virtual unknown. Nearly two years later, we have, at least, a better grasp &#8212; and more effective tools &#8212; even if not everyone has chosen to adhere to such methods.</p>
<p>CES 2020 made it in just under the wire, in terms of global shutdowns. For the 2021 show, its organizers at the CTA (very smartly) opted not to risk it and went entirely virtual. CES 2022 had been on track for a return &#8212; albeit a muted one that would play out as a kind of hybrid event for many involved.</p>
<p>Thus far, the dominoes that have begun to fall haven’t been quite as foundational as what we saw in Barcelona, but the rapid rise of the omicron variant is a pretty massive looming threat for organizers. Add to that a very likely holiday travel-related spike (whose numerical impact we won’t really see take hold until after CES) and the general unpredictability of Vegas (as a friend recently noted, you can’t get anywhere on the Strip without walking through a casino), and it’s understandable why many have recently gotten cold feet. Travel restrictions <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-bets-travel-restrictions-will-buy-it-time-to-fight-omicron-11640100113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from countries like Israel</a> have also added to difficulties.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250663" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a statement, the CTA is holding firm on going forward as planned. The organizing body tells TechCrunch that exhibitor cancelations thus far amount to 7% of floor space, while the show continues to add names, in spite of the latest variant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">CES 2022 will be in person on January 5-8 in Las Vegas with strong safety measures in place, and our digital access is also available for people that don’t wish to, or can’t travel to Las Vegas. Our mission remains to convene the industry and give those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While we recently received 42 exhibitor cancellations (less than 7% of our exhibit floor), since last Friday we&#8217;ve added 60 new exhibitors for our in person event. Registrations for both our digital access and our Las Vegas event are continuing to show strong momentum, with thousands more registrations in the last few days.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">CES 2022 will go forward as important innovation for world health and safety, mobility and solving problems will be exhibited. Furthermore, thousands of smaller and medium sized companies rely on CES for their business. We have increased our official count to over 2200 exhibitors and as <a href="https://www.ces.tech/News/Press-Releases/CES-Press-Release.aspx?NodeID=5c6782e3-7c62-4028-8e2a-827a1c58cba6" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ces.tech/News/Press-Releases/CES-Press-Release.aspx?NodeID%3D5c6782e3-7c62-4028-8e2a-827a1c58cba6&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1640294555235000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pduBGZu4fLa2GnraiAIDf">announced yesterday</a> many of our top elected officials from both political parties will be at CES.</p>
<p>Given CES’ comprehensive health measures &#8212; vaccination requirement, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests &#8212; coupled with lower attendance and social distancing measures, we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, as well as a rewarding experience on our digital access<em>.</em></p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m sorry we’ll miss seeing everyone at CES this year, but we are prioritizing the safety of our team and other attendees.</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/business/t-mobile-announcement-about-ces-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T-Mobile became the first major sponsor</a> to drop its in-person presence at the show. The carrier will continue to serve as a financial sponsor (likely nothing of contractual voiding proportions has occurred yet), but has opted not to send a majority of its team, while CEO Mike Sievert won’t be keynoting either in-person or virtually. Weirdly, Weezer will, apparently, still be there with T-Mobile’s blessing,<a href="https://www.fox5vegas.com/more/weezer-to-perform-free-concert-on-las-vegas-strip-on-opening-night-of-ces/article_aa1cfcec-6286-11ec-a73a-a72ce188fb02.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> performing a free concert on the Strip</a>.</p>
<p>“We’re really excited to head back to Las Vegas, a city we love to play, and be part of this year’s epic Drone Racing League’s Vegas Championship Race with T-Mobile,” per a press quote from Rivers Cuomo. iHeartRadio, meanwhile, canceled a planned Swedish House Mafia show tied to the event.</p>
<p>Meta, Twitter, Amazon and Pinterest have since backed out. Though, while all big names in their own right, none have traditionally had a major presence at the show.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, we announced that we won’t be sending a team to the show, as have The Verge, CNET, Engadget, PCMag, Gizmodo, Tom’s Guide and TechRadar. It wasn’t an easy decision to make on our part. While it’s true that the past two years have likely marked the beginning of a sea change toward an even more online conferencing world, there’s still value for us in shows like CES.</p>
<p>In particular, there’s something to be gained in the opportunity to wander around Eureka Park and check out brand new startups in-person that have otherwise not been able to shout above the din of our cacophonous inboxes. I’ve discovered a lot of companies on the floor of the Venetian (née Sands) Expo Hall, and I was very much looking forward to doing so again after a year off.</p>
<p>CES 2021 was a major test of whether the world (and perhaps more specifically, the CTA) is ready for an all-online hardware show. I certainly came away from the experience thinking things were premature. The virtual CES experience wasn’t a particularly good one, especially with regards to discovery &#8212; the most difficult and important element to all of these shows.</p>
<p>Regardless of how much of the 2022 show plays out in-person, it needs an effective online presence. We know a lot of teams are already planning to cover the show remotely. Many are likely also questioning how the show will be covered, going forward, assuming, knock on wood, this pandemic ever actual ends.</p>
<p>The CTA has, thus far, been steadfast in all of this. The organization has repeatedly reconfirmed that the show will go on, as planned, introducing new health protocols along the way. In addition to requiring proof of vaccination and masks, the organization is also giving out free rapid testing kits to attendees, who must also show a recent negative test prior to entering the venue.</p>
<p>The CES social media account has otherwise been devoted to images of the interior of the Las Vegas Convention Center and new speaker announcements, which currently include Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and Paris Hilton, who is set to talk about blockchain in a panel called “NFT, WTF?!?!” (punctuation theirs).</p>
<p>Companies like Google, HTC, John Deere, TCL and BMW tell TechCrunch that they are &#8220;continuing to monitor the situation&#8221; in so many words. Other companies, including Nvidia, have opted for an over abundance of caution from the outset, with a virtual press conference and no exhibitor space.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">The FDA has <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-oral-antiviral-treatment-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">issued an emergency authorization</a> for Pfizer&#8217;s antiviral pill Paxlovid, making it the first oral method for treating mild to moderate cases of COVID-19. The treatment is meant for high-risk people 12 and older who could progress to a more serious COVID infection. The best part? The FDA says it could be available to use within a few days, making it another tool as we face the Omicron variant wave.</p>
<p>Paxlovid is available by prescription only, and it&#8217;s meant to be taken within five days of first noticing COVID symptoms. According to Pfizer&#8217;s tests, it can prevent hospitalization or death by 88 percent in high-risk patients. The treatment, which can be prescribed to both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, consists of 30 pills taken over five days. It includes the protein inhibitor nirmatrelvir and rotinavir, which keeps that inhibitor from breaking down in your body. Side effects include an impaired sense of taste, high blood pressure, diarrhea and muscle aches.</p>
<div id="outstreamPlayer-inArticle" class="basePlayer expandedPlayer playerCollapsed">
<div id="outstream-adText"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“This authorization provides a new tool to combat COVID-19 at a crucial time in the pandemic as new variants emerge and promises to make antiviral treatment more accessible to patients who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19,&#8221; Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.</span></div>
</div>
<p>So far, the US has ordered enough pills to treat 10 million people, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/pfizer-covid-pill-fda-paxlovid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>New York Times reports</em></a>. The company plans to deliver enough pills to cover 65,000 Americans within a week. And after that, production is expect to ramp up, with 150,000 courses delivered in January and 150,000 in February. It also won&#8217;t be the only antiviral pill around: Merck&#8217;s competing treatment is expected to be approved soon, and it&#8217;ll likely be more readily available than Pfizer&#8217;s. Merck&#8217;s option is far less effective, though—tests show it can only prevent hospitalization or death by 30 percent. (Still, that&#8217;s better than having no treatment.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250844" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning, dozens of warehouse workers at two Amazon facilities near Chicago staged a pre-Christmas walkout during the busiest time of the year to demand better treatment and higher wages.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been passed over for raises. We are being overworked, even when there is sufficient people to work here,&#8221; a worker at the DLN2 facility in Cicero said <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AUChicagoland/videos/1630137974005948" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a livestream</a> posted by the <a href="http://amazoniansunited.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazonians United</a>&#8216;s Chicago chapter, which is not affiliated with Amazon. &#8220;We have not received the bonuses we were promised. There are people here who were hired as permanent workers, and then they took their badges away and made them temporary workers. They are staffing this place unsafely, making people work too fast, even though we don&#8217;t have to.&#8221;</p>
<p>These workers, who work between 1:20 AM and 11:50 AM, are also demanding a $5 per hour raise. Amazon told TechCrunch that the current starting pay is $15.80 per hour at the two facilities that staged walkouts, DLN2 in Cicero and DIL3 in Gage Park. The Amazonians United speaker also said that the facility used to have 20-minute breaks as a pandemic precaution, but these have been reduced to 15 minutes. However, the pandemic is not over, especially as the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/20/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">omicron variant spreads</a> &#8212; three workers tested positive for COVID yesterday at the Cicero facility, according to the speaker.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250756" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before walking out, the workers presented management with a petition listing their demands, but they said they didn&#8217;t receive a response, thus prompting the walkout.</p>
<p>The speaker also claimed that workers were told by management that whoever participates in the walkout &#8220;might as well leave their badges,&#8221; meaning that they wouldn&#8217;t be coming back. It&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/strikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal</a> to take action against the employees of private companies for staging a walkout. But employees <a href="https://www.fox32chicago.com/video/1015534" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> returned after the strikes to find that their schedules were blank and they had been clocked out for the day, sparking concern about retaliation among walkout participants.</p>
<p>“We respect the rights of employees to protest and recognize their legal right to do so. We are proud to offer employees leading pay, competitive benefits, and the opportunity to grow with our company,&#8221; an Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement.</p>
<p>The Amazon representative added that no workers are being fired or suspended due to their participation in the walkout. The company said that workers were repeatedly reassured that no retaliation would occur if they protested.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But across the country, Amazon workers have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/fired-interrogated-disciplined-amazon-warehouse-organizers-allege-year-retaliation-n1262367" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused the company</a> of trying to quash labor organizing. Last year, Amazonians United co-founder Jonathan Bailey <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/fired-interrogated-disciplined-amazon-warehouse-organizers-allege-year-retaliation-n1262367" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a complaint</a> with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), stating that the company violated labor laws by retaliating against him for organizing. He said he was detained and interrogated by a manager for 90 minutes after organizing a walkout. The NLRB found merit to these allegations and filed a federal complaint against Amazon. The company settled, and as part of the settlement agreement, was required to remind employees via emails and on physical bulletin boards that they have the right to organize.</p>
<p>Bailey&#8217;s complaint to the NLRB was one of 37 against Amazon between February 2020 and March 2021, according to NBC News. But just months after this settlement, Amazon was found to have <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvz3kv/amazon-unlawfully-confiscated-union-literature-nlrb-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlawfully prevented</a> a Staten Island employee from distributing pro-union literature in the break room.</p>

<p>Even corporate employees have filed complaints against Amazon with the NLRB. In September, the company <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-settles-with-two-seattle-workers-who-say-they-were-wrongfully-fired-for-their-advocacy/">settled a complaint</a> from two former Seattle office employees, Maren Costa and Emily Cunningham, who were terminated after advocating for warehouse workers at the onset of the pandemic. The settlement requires Amazon to compensate Costa and Cunningham for lost wages, and once again, notify employees of their right to speak out about issues at Amazon.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But in recent weeks, tensions have escalated further. On December 10 in Edwardsville, Illinois, six Amazon employees <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/20/amazon-warehouse-in-illinois-hit-by-tornado-killing-6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were killed</a> when a tornado destroyed the DLI4 facility. For years, Amazon workers <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-12/deadly-collapse-at-amazon-warehouse-puts-spotlight-on-phone-ban?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weren&#8217;t allowed to carry cell phones</a> on warehouse floors, but the company relaxed this policy during the pandemic. Recently though, Amazon began reinstating the policy. So, when the National Weather Service issued an emergency alert urging people to take shelter, some Amazon employees had no way of knowing that a lethal storm was on its way. </span></p>
<p>As Amazon workers in facilities across the country seek better compensation and conditions, the e-commerce giant is in the midst of its busiest time of the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will work hard to make sure that everyone gets their Christmas gifts, everyone gets their packages,&#8221; a Chicago warehouse worker <a href="https://www.fox32chicago.com/video/1015534">told</a> FOX 32 Chicago. &#8220;But, you know, we just want to be treated fairly. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in 2012, a Brooklyn-based mobile apps development startup was hired to do a job by the 83-year-old trading card company Topps. For that Brooklyn outfit&#8217;s president, Erich Wood, a UCLA graduate who&#8217;d studied economics and loved trading cards, the opportunity not only sounded fun but would change his trajectory.</p>
<p>At the time, Topps had a licensing agreement with Major League Baseball, the National Football League and Star Wars, and Wood&#8217;s tiny outfit &#8212; discovered by Topps&#8217;s then head of digital &#8212; was brought in to create the first digital trading card platforms for all three.</p>
<p>The cards took off immediately. In fact, things went so well, according to Wood, that he and that digital chief, Michael Bramlage, decided in 2016 to partner on their own digital collectibles company, <a href="https://market.onquidd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quidd</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250668" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Fast-forward to today and Bramlage is still CEO of Quidd, which was acquired in 2019 by Animoca Brands and now operates as a standalone subsidiary. Meanwhile, Wood has quietly been building a new, 13-person business called <a href="https://tibles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tibles</a> that just raised $3 million in seed funding led by <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211108005310/en/Cadenza-Ventures-Raises-50M-Crypto-Venture-Fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cadenza Ventures</a>, with participation from earlier backer Dapper Labs (whose &#8220;NBA Top Shot&#8221; took the world by storm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/what-the-nft-vc-david-pakman-dumbs-down-the-digital-collectibles-frenzy-and-why-its-taking-off-now/">earlier this year</a>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, Tibles seems not so unlike Quidd, though Quidd still stores its collectibles &#8220;off chain,&#8221; meaning on centralized servers, whereas Tibles is creating an NFT marketplace that runs exclusively on Flow, the blockchain developed by Dapper. (Quidd says on its homepage that it is &#8220;coming soon to the blockchain.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Tibles is also focusing exclusively on pop culture and entertainment brands, whereas Quidd also sells sports collectibles.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important of all, suggests Wood, unlike Quidd and another digital collectibles marketplaces, Tibles isn&#8217;t simply digitizing existing images and turning them into NFTs. The plan instead is to work with brands to create an ecosystem with original licensed art, a trading experience and community. Its ultimate aim is to make the digital collecting experience as authentic as a physical one, says the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whether it works out as planned remains to be seen, but as a starting point, Tibles just took the wraps off a partnership between itself, Dr. Seuss Enterprises and Dapper Labs to create &#8220;<a href="https://seussibles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seussibles</a>,&#8221; which invites fans of Theodor Geisel to own NFTs of his characters &#8212; including the Lorax, the Grinch and Horton the Elephant &#8212; and to interact with other fans.</p>
<p>As Wood explains it, the NFTs come in blind five-packs that are reminiscent of Pokémon cards; these cards or &#8220;stickers&#8221; can then be viewed in a &#8220;sticker book&#8221; where other users can see each others&#8217; collections.</p>
<p>There is also a clubhouse area where fans can socialize, and a trading area where they can swap holdings.</p>
<p>Right now, all the packs are priced the same; none are &#8220;limited edition&#8221; NFTs, though you can imagine that Tibles will be looking at what people are trading to learn which characters might be more valuable to fans than others.</p>
<p>As for the startup&#8217;s road map, hiring is a priority, unsurprisingly. Tibles will also be working closely with Dapper to obtain more licensing agreements so that it can generate more content. (Asked for more specifics, Wood notes the the &#8220;licensing roadmap can be a long one&#8221; and &#8220;filled with secrecy.&#8221;)</p>
<p>On the development side, Wood says the plan is fairly straightforward. Tibles is just &#8220;very focused on delivering the user experience [so that] anybody can buy stuff as easily as they might any other Apple in-app purchase.&#8221; He also wants to make it dead simple for users to participate in the community and share things and organize them and trade them. &#8220;We&#8217;re focused on making this fun, then reproducing that [success] for a few different publishers and licenses and different experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly, Wood knows by now from his years in the digital collectibles market that different fan groups tend to appreciate very different things. Dapper&#8217;s deal with Dr. Seuss Enterprises is centered around card-like stickers, but future projects for other clients could have &#8220;video or animation; they could have interactions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unifying thread it that all will be web objects that are collectible. The rest depends on the property. &#8220;We spend a lot of time understanding the IP and the brand and their fans and what they like,&#8221; says Wood. &#8220;And it&#8217;s almost never one thing that works.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tibles&#8217;s newest round follows an earlier, $1.19 million seed round of funding that closed <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timcasey/2021/05/20/dapper-labs-leads-114-million-seed-round-investment-in-digital-collectibles-company/?sh=46439926aba6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to Dapper Labs, which led that earlier round, CoinFund and Warburg Serres have also participated in both tranches.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If human societies do nothing, in just a few decades, the planet could warm to levels it hasn’t reached in at least <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-hasnt-warmed-this-fast-in-tens-of-millions-of-years/">34 million years</a>, leading to more melting glaciers and floods than ever before — as well as the dire effect of urban heat waves.</p>
<p>In 2021, in the U.S. alone, there were already 18 extreme climate-related disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion each,<a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>.</p>
<p>When looking at the world’s natural calamities on a consequence and frequency scale, floods and earthquakes have a more devastating effect on people and property, but they occur less frequently than heat waves, which generally take the form of urban heat islands (UHIs). These are also known as heat pockets, which are found across cities’ downtown areas, where temperatures are higher than the peripheries.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250383" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With urbanized areas warming up fast, many <a href="https://www.calgary.ca/content/dam/www/uep/esm/documents/esm-documents/climate-change-adaptation-research-technical-report.pdf">more populations globally</a> are bound to face the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/climate-change-is-turning-cities-into-ovens/">deadly consequences</a> of the heat-island effect, highlighting urban public health disparities. Between 2000 and 2016, according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/heatwaves#tab=tab_1">World Health Organization</a>, the number of people exposed to heat waves jumped by 125 million, claiming more than 166,000 lives between 1998 and 2017.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/reduce-urban-heat-island-effect">City officials in the U.S. now worry</a> that intense heat could lower comfort levels and conditions for residents, especially the most vulnerable populations — but cities are not equipped with the right data to mitigate effects.</p>
<p>Working at a design-led data science company, I know that building sustainable solutions for organizations or solving complex business, societal and socioeconomic problems can be solved using advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and interactive data visualizations.</p>
<p>Despite this, these emerging technologies can only be rolled out through collaborations among public health professionals, enterprises, local governments, communities, nonprofits and technology partners. This cross-sector intervention is the only way to democratize technology and rectify the urban heat-island devastation. So, how are these players working together to reduce urban heat islands?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Understanding which countries make significant contributions</h2>
<p>A handful of companies, governments and NGOs across the world are working to solve the problem with heat waves.</p>
<p>However, since Canada warmed by <a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/hc-sc/documents/services/health/publications/healthy-living/reducing-urban-heat-islands-protect-health-canada/Reducing-Urban-Heat-EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an average of 1.6°C</a> between 1948 and 2012, roughly double the global average rate of warming, it’s way ahead of the game when using AI to predict heat waves. By nature, Canadian cities are technology-driven and tech-savvy, so cities across the world can look to the country for in-depth analysis and innovative ideas. For example,<a href="https://myheat.ca/"> MyHeat</a> tracks the solar potential of buildings, taking the heat wave and using it to create sustainable energy.</p>
<p>European cities, including Helsinki and Amsterdam, are also trying to tackle this challenge.<a href="https://ai4cities.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> AI4Cities</a> is an EU-funded project bringing together leading European cities looking for AI solutions to accelerate carbon neutrality. The total funding amount of 4.6 million euros will be divided among selected suppliers.</p>
<p>Despite these projects leveraging AI to solve climate change issues, they are still concentrating on other niches, such as reducing carbon footprint. They focus on the mitigation of the cause of climate change instead of the effect.</p>
<p>Therefore, the impact of heat waves remains a largely unsolved problem. This is also because other natural disasters, such as floods that cause huge immediate effects, get more attention. Heat waves are silent killers with their undercurrents of thermal discomfort, more energy usage and power outages. And perhaps the biggest challenge is that the kind of technology to face heat waves is not openly available to municipalities or nonprofits.</p>
<h2>Leveraging AI-powered solutions</h2>
<p>Through working with <a href="https://www.evergreen.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evergreen</a>, a nonprofit building resilient cities and mitigating climate risks, we were introduced to a network of cities in Canada. And after research and surveys, we realized that there’s a lot of digital infrastructure and data-driven decision-making for floods and earthquakes, but none or very few solutions for heat waves.</p>
<p>Heat waves remain largely an unsolved problem, and there’s a huge opportunity for AI, as a scalable tool, to inform cities to make evidence-based decisions.</p>
<p>Evergreen uses geospatial analytics, AI and big data, alongside a data visualization tool created through the Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth?rtc=1">AI for Earth grant</a>, to integrate and analyze different datasets that examine urban heat islands across cities. This helps municipalities pinpoint problem areas with low vegetation or impermeable surfaces and mitigate the effects of heat islands by installing cool roofs, water fountains and green roofs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.evergreen.ca/about/news-releases/evergreen-unveils-ai-solution-that-enables-municipalities-to-better-evaluat/">AI-powered analysis</a> and visualization tool, built on the Microsoft Azure Stack, offers several capabilities. A map, or a topographic view, allows climate teams in municipalities to get the land surface temperature of every 30-meter block on the ground. Additionally, there&#8217;s a Scenario Modeling View that enables them to generate scenarios of the future urban sprawl of cities by modifying features like building counts and height, <a href="https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Albedo">albedo levels</a> and other urban sprawl parameters.</p>
<p>This multipurpose tool is already impacting climate resilience in municipalities across Canada by tracking greenhouse gases. It could also positively impact policy shifts around greenhouse and carbon dioxide emissions worldwide in years to come.</p>
<p>Sustainable Environment and Ecological Development Society (SEEDS), with Microsoft India, also announced its <a href="https://yourstory.com/2021/07/microsoft-seeds-ai-heatwave-risk-india/amp">second phase of an AI</a> model for predicting heat wave risks in India and offering cost-effective interventions. If a heat wave occurs, governments can work out which areas of the city need help and attention. SEEDS uses ground-truth data, and the AI model generates results that are validated on the ground with thermal sensors, among other devices.</p>
<p>City officials should welcome AI as an economical way to face heat wave problems as it is scalable and quickly applicable worldwide — it is agnostic to locality or ground presence. AI can also be packaged into a tool to extract data sources, which makes the knowledge easily shareable across departments and key stakeholders, and digestible for decision-makers.</p>
<p>With Evergreen, the idea is to create a public-facing app, which informs communities about the kind of impact AI has, offering real-life solutions and bringing them alive in a <em>storytelling mode</em>. For example, the app could show how temperatures decreased due to a green roof installation. It would allow users to see data insights as easily consumable stories and help them understand the <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/how_to_tell_stories_about_complex_issues#">different complexities</a> that shape the issue they are tackling.</p>
<h2>Democratizing and scaling AI at the speed of trust</h2>
<p>Working with multiple data sources for AI or machine learning (ML) projects calls for cross-sector solutions. The involvement of nonprofits and community builders is crucial — they act as conduits between technology players, enterprises, other nonprofits, governments, communities, city planners, real estate developers and mayors’ offices.</p>
<p>Technology partners cannot just arrive in a city with an AI solution and expect officials to subscribe to it. You have to make a business case and enable all players to be part of the conversation; it is a multisectoral endeavor.</p>
<p>Equally, the stakeholders who would use this innovative technology won’t just automatically adopt this tool if they are told: “You have a heat pocket. I can install a green roof to help you.”</p>
<p>Let’s take a <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/apac/features/defeating-dengue-fever-ai-boosts-the-global-fight-against-mosquito-borne-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geospatial example</a>, developed in partnership with Microsoft AI for Earth’s initiative. The entire population of a city was mapped — with release points within blocks of 100 square meters in a 40-meter grid — to release genetically modified mosquitoes to kill dangerous, disease-carrying mosquitoes.</p>
<p>This scalable solution with AI can <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/apac/features/defeating-dengue-fever-ai-boosts-the-global-fight-against-mosquito-borne-diseases/">bring resolutions to communities suffering</a> from dengue and yellow fever. But if someone came to your house and said that you would be inundated with genetically modified mosquitoes, you would most likely say no, mainly due to the idea of being overrun with mosquitoes, but also because of the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/protecting-privacy-in-an-ai-driven-world/">global resistance</a> against AI as it evolves. There are worries around it magnifying the ability to use personal information that intrudes on privacy interests.</p>
<p>This is why the projects that succeed are often executed by educating communities. Community partnerships are key to spreading positive messaging about bringing down temperatures, using less energy and adopting climate-friendly AI technology.</p>
<p>In Canada, for example, every city has its own climate team, weather model and sensors in crucial places across urban zones. It is challenging for large data or technology companies to get hold of this weather data; cities must be willing to share. It is the same with high-resolution, high-quality satellite imagery working out cloud coverage; you need data providers to inform you about population data and socioeconomic considerations.</p>
<p>Therefore, projects have to be done at the speed of trust. Cities will be more inclined to share data points with technology companies that can offer real, scalable solutions when they have established credibility. Without this, these companies will have to rely on publicly available and open source data from NASA and Copernicus.</p>
<p>So, what does this all mean for enterprise players and their CEOs? AI solutions for cities are targeted toward climate teams and communities in municipalities. But what about oil and gas companies? They are under huge pressure to report their carbon footprints as they contribute to many of the emissions in cities.</p>
<p>An AI solution for them would involve a tracking command center to follow on a real-time basis how much carbon emissions their refineries or freight is leaving in their wake. CEOs have a mandate to decrease their per-product, per-employee carbon footprint. Adopting an AI solution would hold them accountable for environmental effects while showing that they are also aware of being part of the problem with heat waves.</p>
<p>COVID-19 brought attention to heat waves as more people were living at home than working in offices. This means populations experienced higher temperatures and discomfort in more pronounced ways, removed from the general facilities and comforts of offices.</p>
<p>Leaders across the social change community can reverse these dire effects of climate change and heat waves through facilitating collaborations among enterprises, NGOs, governments, technology partners and community leaders. This will mean the potential solutions that have arisen from AI and ML can be rolled out sooner rather than simply too late.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the third time this month, AWS today suffered an outage in one of its data centers. This morning, a power outage in its US-EAST-1 region affected services like Slack, Asana, Epic Games and others.</p>
<p>The issues started around 7:30 a.m. ET and the knock-on effect of these issues continues to plague the service as of 1 p.m. ET, as AWS continues to report issues with a number of services in this region, specifically its EC2 compute service and related networking functions. Most recently, the single sign-on service in this region also started seeing increased error rates.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can confirm a loss of power within a single data center within a single Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) in the US-EAST-1 Region,&#8221; the company explained in an <a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/?ascsubtag=[]vg[p]22613821[t]w[d]D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> at 8 a.m. ET. &#8220;This is affecting availability and connectivity to EC2 instances that are part of the affected data center within the affected Availability Zone. We are also experiencing elevated RunInstance API error rates for launches within the affected Availability Zone. Connectivity and power to other data centers within the affected Availability Zone, or other Availability Zones within the US-EAST-1 Region are not affected by this issue, but we would recommend failing away from the affected Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) if you are able to do so.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250723" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If this had been the only AWS outage in recent weeks, it would have barely been noteworthy. Given the complexity of the modern hyper clouds, outages are bound to happen every now and then. But outages are currently a weekly occurrence for AWS. On December 7, the same US-EAST-1 region went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/amazon-web-services-went-down-and-took-a-bunch-of-the-internet-with-it/">down for hours</a> due to a networking issue. Then, on December 17, an outage that affected connectivity between two of its West Coast regions took down services from the likes of Netflix, Slack and Amazon&#8217;s own Ring. To add insult to injury, all of these outages happened shortly after AWS touted the resilience of its cloud at its re:Invent conference earlier this month.</p>
<p>Ideally, of course, none of these outages would ever happen and there are some ways that AWS users can protect themselves from them by architecting their systems to fail over to a geographically separate region &#8212; but that can add significant cost, so some decide that the trade-off between downtime and cost isn&#8217;t worth it. At the end of the day, it&#8217;s on AWS to provide a stable platform. And while it&#8217;s hard to say if the company is just having a string of bad luck or if there are any systematic issues that have led to these problems, if I were hosting a service in the US-EAST-1 region right now, I would probably at least consider moving it elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Great news! After a long COVID delay, my fiancée finally arrived in the U.S. on her K visa. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We’re thinking about eloping to Las Vegas for a quick wedding so we can get started on her green card application. (In Silicon Valley, we’d have to wait a few months to get a marriage license.) </strong></p>
<p><strong>After we file, we want to have a big wedding in the spring with her family and friends in her hometown and then go on a honeymoon. Is that allowed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Happy in Hayward</strong></p>
<p>Dear Happy,</p>
<p>Congratulations on being reunited with your fiancée through the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/k-1-visa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K-1 visa</a> and your upcoming wedding! My law partner, Anita Koumriqian, has been immersed in her own wedding planning these past few months. So, in addition to being an expert in family immigration law, she’s super knowledgeable about all things related to getting married, including local Silicon Valley jurisdictions that have residency requirements for a marriage license and generally how long it takes to get a marriage certificate. On our <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/102-home-for-the-holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a>, we chatted about wedding planning, marriage licenses, applying for a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/marriage-based-green-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">green card for a spouse</a> once you’re married, and the dos and don’ts of proving to immigration that your marriage is legit.</p>
<p>Always consult with an immigration attorney first and never just rely on Googling your way through the green card process. For more details, check out our prior podcast, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/058-engaged-now-what/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engaged, Now What?</a></p>

<h2>Vegas is still possible</h2>
<p>Once you have your marriage certificate, you can file for a green card for your wife. Locally, while <a href="https://clerkrecorder.sccgov.org/services-we-provide/vital-services-birth-death-marriage/apply-marriage-license" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santa Clara</a> and <a href="https://sfgov.org/countyclerk/marriage-license-and-civilcommitment-ceremony-online-reservations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Francisco</a> counties are still backlogged in issuing marriage licenses due to COVID, nearby <a href="https://www.sccoclerk.us/CountyClerkHome/MarriageLicenses.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santa Cruz County</a> is quicker and allows you to get married in California.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As nostalgia goes, the Fisher-Price Chatter phone doesn&#8217;t disappoint. The classic retro kids toy was given a modern revamp for the holiday season with the new release for adults which, unlike the original toy designed for kids, can make and receive calls over Bluetooth using a nearby smartphone.</p>
<p>The Chatter — despite a working rotary dial and its trademark wobbly eyes that bob up and down when the wheels turn — is less a phone and more like a novelty Bluetooth speaker with a microphone, which activates when the handset is lifted.</p>
<p>The Chatter didn&#8217;t spend long on sale; the phone sold out quickly as the waitlists piled up. But security researchers in the U.K. immediately spotted a potential problem. With just the online instruction manual to go on, the researchers feared that a design flaw could allow someone to use the Chatter to eavesdrop.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250695" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ken Munro, founder of the cybersecurity company Pen Test Partners, told TechCrunch that chief among the concerns are that the Chatter does not have a secure pairing process to stop unauthorized phones in Bluetooth range from connecting to it.</p>
<p>Munro outlined <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/audio-bugging-with-the-fisher-price-chatter-bluetooth-telephone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of tests</a> that would confirm or allay his concerns. Since the Chatter is only available in the U.S. and was persistently sold out, TechCrunch set a page monitor to tell us when it was back in stock, bought one, and started testing.</p>
<p>First, we switched on the Chatter phone, which activates its Bluetooth connection, paired a phone over Bluetooth, then switched off Bluetooth to simulate someone walking the phone out of range. We then paired another phone with the Chatter without hindrance, allowing us to remotely control the Chatter&#8217;s audio.</p>
<p>Mattel, which makes the Chatter phone, said the phone &#8220;will time out if no connection is made or once the pairing occurs — it is only discoverable within a narrow window of time and requires physical access to the device.&#8221; We left the Chatter on and found the Bluetooth pairing process did not time out after more than an hour.</p>
<p>Then, Munro asked what would happen if we called the phone connected to the Chatter. Sure enough, the Chatter rang — loudly — as expected. Then we called the Chatter again, this time without properly replacing its receiver. With the handset off the hook, the Chatter automatically answered the call, immediately activating the handset&#8217;s microphone and allowing us to hear ambient background audio.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Pen Test Partners found a similar Bluetooth vulnerability in a child&#8217;s toy doll called My Friend Cayla, which the researchers found <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/making-childrens-toys-swear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be paired</a> with another person&#8217;s phone if the parent&#8217;s phone goes out of range. The toy was eventually pulled from shelves after it was found the doll, when <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/12/20/506208146/this-doll-may-be-recording-what-children-say-privacy-groups-charge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connected to its app</a>, was recording what children were saying.</p>
<p>The Chatter doesn&#8217;t have an app, and Mattel said the Chatter phone was released as &#8220;a limited promotional item and a playful spin on a classic toy for adults.&#8221; But Munro said he&#8217;s concerned the Chatter&#8217;s lack of secure pairing could be exploited by a nearby neighbor or a determined attacker, or that the Chatter could be handed down to kids, who could then unknowingly trigger the bug.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t need kids to interact with it in order for it to become an audio bug. Just leaving the handset off is enough,&#8221; said Munro.</p>
<p>When reached about the findings, Mattel spokesperson Kelly Powers said the company is &#8220;committed to security and we will be investigating these claims.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past year, AngelList has grown from a platform that connects angel investors with startups to an end-to-end suite of tools, working on everything from fund operations to founder cap table management.</p>
<p>Throughout this growth, the company has quietly amassed millions of data points that show appetite, both from investors and regular employees, for burgeoning startups. And, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1900605/000190060521000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per SEC filings</a>, AngelList isn’t letting those fresh insights go to waste.</p>
<p><a href="https://angel.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AngelList</a> has quietly landed $25 million for the AngelList Early Stage Quant Fund, a new investment vehicle that plans $250,000 checks into over 100 companies. The largest limited partner in the fund is WorldQuant Ventures, an early-stage investment firm founded by Igor Tulchinsky, who is also the founder of WorldQuant, a quantitative asset management firm. Other investors in Quant Fund include Two Sigma Ventures, KAMCO Ventures, Plexo Capital, Tom Tunguz of Redpoint and AngelList founder Naval Ravikant.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250682" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The operation, part of AngelList Venture, will be led by a four-person data team from within the company. In an interview with TechCrunch, <a href="https://angel.co/p/abraham-othman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abraham Othman</a>, head of the investment committee and of data science at AngelList Venture, explained that Quant Fund’s mission is to use more quantitative factors to decide which startups to invest in.</p>
<p>&#8220;If<span style="font-weight: 400;"> you think about quant investing in venture, there’s a lot of understanding around the metrics that drive SaaS startup success, particularly B2B startup SaaS,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is vastly different for other sectors.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>His team tracks the velocity of hiring demand for a startup, looking at how many job applications a single company gets within a specific period of time. The signal strips out factors like investor bias, the founder’s networks and even buzzy valuations.</p>
<p>“I do think, in general, one of the aims of AngelList as it moves forward is to manage more institutional capital,” Othman said. “We are taking advantage of some of the data” the platform already has. Other than <a href="https://www.angellist.com/access-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AngelList’s access fund</a>, a smaller investment vehicle, this is the company’s first, more traditional-looking venture fund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>About 2 million users use AngelList Talent to apply to startups each quarter. Currently, AngelList is primarily going to be investing in startups in the United States and India, because that’s where the majority of applicants on its platform are coming from.</p>
<p>AngelList talent sees about 35,000 companies a quarter get active interest, but only half of those companies are investable early-stage businesses (the rest being Series B+ companies, consulting companies, venture capital firms, etc). Of those 17,000 companies per quarter, AngelList’s data team reaches out to the 20 companies getting the most hiring demand as potential investments.</p>
<p>Othman thinks they win deals because of the cut-and-dry approach, which he thinks is “less adversarial” than other investors who may be more focused on risk factors, or traditional pitches, before writing a check.</p>
<p>“Our approach? This is our data set, let’s see if we can put money into them,” he said.</p>
<p>Othman says that the data-driven approach has led to greater diversity of the startups, both in mission and founder, compared to traditional generalist funds. He estimates that about 50% of founders within the fund’s portfolio identify as women.</p>
<p>There are some challenges with leaning on one, somewhat broad, signal to make investments. As history often reminds us, due diligence matters &#8212; and vetting an investment beyond its ability to attract talent can save firms from headaches or legal woes. Additionally, a startup could get a ton of applicants due to pay, location or even recent coverage in a Well Known Tech Blog &#8212; which can bode for success, but could also just be a result of great marketing. To Othman, the fact that hiring demand can be impacted by so many different dynamics makes it a positive signal to look at, not a manipulated one.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A future of data-driven investments comes with a key tension: The bias of the “art” of an investment may be what has left out historically overlooked individuals, but it also adds some layer of humanity to decision-makers before they get millions to execute on a vision.</span></p>
<p>Algorithm-based investing is getting more attention, with Rocketship VC flexing<a href="https://www.rocketship.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a data-driven investment strategy</a>, ClearCo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/clearco-gets-the-softbank-stamp-of-approval-in-new-215m-round/">writing checks based on startup spend</a> and Hum Capital using artificial intelligence <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/hum-capital-thinks-the-future-of-funding-is-a-return-to-old-school-wall-street/">to connect businesses to the available funders on the platform. </a></p>
<p>AngelList has already made several investments with this strategy, putting money into startups such as <a href="https://www.pinata.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Piñata</a>, a reward and credit building platform for renters, and <a href="https://hiemile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emile</a>, an on-demand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/emile-learning-seed-kleiner-perkins/">educational service for high schoolers. </a>The fund also plans to put money into roll-up vehicles, which allow founders to raise capital from up to 250 accredited investors with a single line on the cap table, but that will be a minority of investments.</p>
<p>It seems that AngelList has been rethinking its recruitment penetration for quite a while now. In the early innings of the pandemic, April 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/angellist-lays-off-a-number-of-staff-and-cuts-executive-salaries/">the startup had layoffs</a> that sources say largely impacted the company’s talent arm, which connects job-seekers with startups looking to hire. Then the layoffs came as a response to hiring freezes from tech startups waiting out the economic downturn.</p>
<p>If there’s a repeat of that freeze, Othman thinks that hiring can still work as a “pretty robust signal across economic conditions.” He explained that his team got a glimpse of which companies were recruiting talent in April and May 2020, and said that “companies at the top of the list have since 6’xd their valuation.”</p>
<p>In the past, AngelList CEO Avlok Kohli said that the AngelList will not return to its fundraising marketplace roots. “Our view is that the market is quite efficient, and we can’t offer an experience that is much better than what is happening today,”<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/angellist-stack-founder/"> he said in September. </a></p>
<p>Today, Kohli’s sentiment seems to be changing, as his company begins to directly invest in the founders on the platform. In an e-mailed statement, Kohli said that “the new fund is a small yet important step to connect institutional capital with startups in a quantitative fashion…we’re the only platform with the dataset and reach to execute an initiative like this.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Short video app Triller is set to go public via a reverse merger with video-tech company SeaChange International, the two companies <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/12/22/2356795/0/en/Triller-to-the-ILLR-Triller-Hold-Co-LLC-expected-to-become-publicly-traded-on-Nasdaq-through-a-reverse-merger-with-publicly-traded-company-SeaChange-International-Inc-NASDAQ-SEAC.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Wednesday. The combined entity will be valued at approximately $5 billion. The boards of both companies have approved the proposed merger and the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals.</p>
<p>Similar to TikTok, Triller allows users to create and share short-form videos set to music. The Los Angeles-based company initially launched in 2015 and the app has been downloaded more than 250 million times. Triller has attracted many notable users, like Justin Bieber, Marshmello, The Weeknd, Alicia Keys, Cardi B, Eminem, Post Malone and Kevin Hart. The app has also inked deals with popular TikTok users, such as Charli D&#8217;Amelio and Noah Beck. Former U.S. President Donald Trump also used the app, although he hasn&#8217;t posted a new video on the platform since January.</p>
<p>Following the completion of the merger, SeaChange will change its name to TrillerVerz Corp. The Acton, Massachusetts-based company describes itself as a supplier of video delivery software solutions that power cloud and on-premise video delivery platforms. The combined company will be led by Mahi de Silva, the CEO of Triller&#8217;s parent company. Peter Aquino, the president and CEO of SeaChange, will join the TrillerVerz team.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250666" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe TrillerVerz is becoming the voice of youth culture, a brand that sits at the nexus of content, creator, commerce, and culture in the digital world,&#8221; said de Silva, in a statement. &#8220;Our strategy is to continue to build the world&#8217;s largest stage for creators to distribute and monetize viral and engaging content with experiences that elevate culture. We believe that combining with SeaChange accelerates our advertising and marketing capabilities by extending our reach to cable, satellite, and OTT media.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two companies say TrillerVerz is positioned to become a leading AI-powered social media platform for content, creators and commerce. TrillerVerz plans to expand its revenue streams by increasing its global footprint and investment in new growth opportunities across the creator economy and emerging technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The business combination with TrillerVerz represents a tremendous opportunity to invest in the future of creativity,&#8221; SeaChange CEO Peter Aquino said in a statement. &#8220;We believe that TrillerVerz&#8217;s unmatched social media reach, Gen Z engagement, and the opportunity to meaningfully expand its global multi-platform presence across content, commerce, creators, and being at the forefront of e-commerce, adtech, and NFTs, including the metaverse, is a compelling investment with the potential to create significant value.”</p>
<p>News of the merger comes as Triller and its parent company have been expanding the social video platform over the past year. Last month, Triller <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/triller-acquires-thuzio-leader-in-b2b-premium-influencer-events-and-experiences-strategic-acquisition-is-latest-step-in-trillers-rapid-growth-in-live-event-programming-301430578.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> Thuzio, a company focused on business-to-business premium influencer events and experiences.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In April, Triller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/triller-owner-gets-a-new-ceo-with-acquisition-of-amplify-ai-also-acquires-live-streaming-service-fite-tv/">acquired</a> AI-based customer engagement platform Amplify.AI, which works with brands in CPG, financial services, automotive, telecom, politics and digital media, among others. In the same month, Triller also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/triller-owner-gets-a-new-ceo-with-acquisition-of-amplify-ai-also-acquires-live-streaming-service-fite-tv/">acquired</a> FITE TV, a live event and pay-per-view combat sports streaming platform. In March, Triller acquired live music streaming platform Verzuz, which was founded by Swizz Beats and Timbaland.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">It’s human nature to reflexively categorize and sort the information we encounter in our daily lives. To influence the way prospective customers understand your brand, you must present it in a way that helps them decide how to think about your brand.</p>
<p>This process is called positioning, and it’s the single most important (and least understood) component of your brand book. Positioning is the message that’s received, not the one that’s delivered. It’s not simply what you say, it’s how that information is arranged in a customer’s mind. Essentially, where does it land? What space does it ultimately wind up occupying?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Positioning is about, well, taking a position. It’s a stake you plant in the minds of your prospective customers about what your brand can uniquely claim and defend. A positioning statement is a crisp, comprehensive way to guide someone on how to think about your company.</p>
<p>It defines and frames your brand, making it the central organizing structure of your brand’s messaging and strategy. To construct your positioning statement, you first have to do some work in surfacing its component parts.</p>
<p>Here’s how:</p>
<p>Since positioning is about the space you occupy in the mind of your customer, you can’t figure out how to position your brand until you know exactly who that customer is. There’s an order of operations in developing your brand, and developing your target personas comes before positioning. It’s also useful to have your brand’s ethos fully developed before attempting to determine your positioning. Understanding who you are and who you’re serving are vital first inputs.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Your positioning statement serves as the foundation for developing your key messaging, value propositions, tag lines, and voice and tone.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>After the target customer is established, it’s time to figure out your frame of reference — the context in which consumers view your brand. By providing consumers with a frame of reference, you’re equipping them with the information they require to categorize, contextualize and then compare your brand with what’s already familiar to them.</p>
<p>This is important, because potential customers need to consider points of parity (that is, what your brand is like) before they can consider points of differentiation (what makes your brand unique). Competitive frames of reference tend to be specific to reduce the number of brands competing for that prospect’s attention.</p>
<p>The specificity of a frame of reference signals to the customer where to place it in their minds, and the smaller the category, the better your chances of owning it (or at least, standing out).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Write down the top five brands in your category. If you’re not No. 1 in that category, brainstorm other categories your brand is first or best in.</p>
<p><em>Some inspiration:</em></p>
<p>Panera Bread is not the No.1 fast-food chain, but it is the No. 1 fast-casual bakery cafe. Their frame of reference doesn’t try to compete with entrenched giants like McDonald’s or Starbucks. Instead, it puts Panera in a more specific, more ownable category.</p>
<p>White Claw isn’t the top canned alcoholic beverage, but it IS the No. 1 seltzer that gets you drunk. That makes “hard seltzer” an effective frame of reference for a brand that would rather lead a category than compete with beer, malt beverages and wine coolers.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
