<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BetterUp announced its acquisitions after a busy stint, which included passing $100 million in annual recurring revenue, expanding to Europe, and hitting 1 million individual coaching sessions on its platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll be honest. It’s par for the course to see a growth-stage startup use milestones to inorganically expand through acquisitions. How else do you grow into your valuation? BetterUp’s duo of deals still stood out to me because they signal a somewhat unconventional direction for where the coaching industry is going. Stay with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BetterUp claims that it pioneered the category of coaching by focusing on employees, not just C-suite executives. With these acquisitions, it’s shifting how that coaching looks and lives. Motive, for example, will help BetterUp clients understand the emotional context behind data that they already aggregate, through engagement surveys or polls. It’s a plug-and-play approach that helps employers more immediately act on employee sentiment, instead of waiting for the long-game of coaching to play out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other end of the funnel, Impraise uses technology to help managers better support their direct reports, through real-time performance reviews and more seamless feedback channels. Like Motive, Impraise is a step outside of the traditional boundaries of what coaching looks like. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The direct-report relationship is where change happens in people&#8217;s lives,” BetterUp CEO and co-founder Alexi Robichaux said. “It doesn&#8217;t actually happen in coaching sessions; change happens after.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some ways, these acquisitions are BetterUp admitting that coaching for all employees has to be an end-to-end solution that requires everyone in the company &#8211; from HR to managers &#8211; to be involved. It can’t be a weekly calendar invite. This sort of investment could cause employers to shy away from even offering services to their staff to begin with, but pressure to retain may force them to try anyways. For other coaching and up-skilling platforms, the bar continues to be raised. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Coaching can be a point solution, but that&#8217;s not enough and we know that better than anyone because we invented the point solution,” Robichaux said. “If you don’t have the data platform, if you don’t have the outcomes. If you don’t have the AI to personalize this, you can go coach 50 managers at your company,” but not every employee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the rest of this newsletter, I’ll walk us through Atlanta’s big bootstrapped moment, Casper’s nightmare and Apple’s day. As always, you can find me on Twitter </span><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_"><span style="font-weight: 400;">@nmasc_ </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and listen to my podcast, </span><a href="https://t.co/XN3y0gbB6b?amp=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity.</span></a></p>
<h2>Atlanta’s big bootstrapped moment</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step aside Austin and Miami, Atlanta is in town. All eyes were on the city this week after </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/intuit-confirms-12b-deal-to-buy-mailchimp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intuit bought local business Mailchimp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a staggering $12 billion. The Atlanta-based email marketing company never took any outside funding, which meant the deal was one of the biggest ever for a bootstrapped company. And while some saw </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/intuits-12b-mailchimp-acquisition-is-about-expanding-its-small-business-focus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mailchimp’s massive exit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a win for the Atlanta startup and venture ecosystem, others felt differently. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><b>Here’s what to know:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Part of Mailchimp’s strategy as an untraditional tech company included not giving Mailchimp employees equity, and prioritizing profit-sharing as well as higher salaries. It sounds good, until your startup exits for $12 billion and you realize you don’t have any equity in the business that you helped build. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/a-knock-against-bootstrapping/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a knock against bootstrapping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as we discussed during Equity. Employees spoke to Business Insider </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mailchimp-insiders-react-to-employees-getting-no-equity-2021-9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about their first reactions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, answering if the deal does indeed empower the local ecosystem.  </span></p>

<h2>Casper’s nightmare</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1802467" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1802467" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1802467 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="361" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png 2259w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?resize=680,361 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?resize=1536,816 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?resize=2048,1088 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1802467" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My scoop this week uncovered that Casper, the direct-to-consumer mattress company, had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/casper-cuts-its-cmo-cto-and-coo-amid-further-layoffs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another round of layoffs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that impacted two dozen employees, as well as its CMO, CTO and COO. The round of layoffs and executive shuffle comes a little over a year since Casper cut 21% of its workforce and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/casper-winds-down-european-operations-and-lays-off-78-people/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shut down its European operations. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The easy take here is that Casper is struggling with management and direction and has been on its back foot </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/3-unicorn-takeaways-from-the-casper-one-medical-ipos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">since its public debut last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, I’d argue that there’s more nuance here.</span></p>
<p><b>Here’s what to know: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One founder in the direct-to-consumer space, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to her lack of direct knowledge with the company said that Casper’s layoffs could also be a response to Apple’s iOS 14.5 update, which will crack down on apps that track users’ data without permission. The setting restricts the advertising data that companies can access, making it harder to justify budget and understand the efficacy of their sales strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For DTC companies, the uncertainty of in-person retail activity plus difficulty of advertising attribution is a challenging hurdle to surpass.</span></p>

The TechCrunch team, of course, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/live-from-apples-virtual-2021-iphone-event/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">couldn’t resist a chance to live blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><b>Here’s what to know: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was all about the new iPhone 13. Brian Heater explained the context around the launch </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/this-is-the-iphone-13/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and what’s actually new about the smartphone. </span></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year’s iPhone 12 was a massive seller, bucking the trend of stagnating smartphone sales, in part due to a bottleneck in sales from the unplanned delay, but also because it finally brought 5G connectivity to Apple’s mobile line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucky number iPhone 13 (no skipping for superstition’s sake, mind) features a familiar design. The front notch has finally been shrunken — now 20% smaller than its predecessor — while the rear-facing camera system has also gotten a redesign. The screen is now 28% brighter, Super Retina XDR display on both the iPhone 13 and 13 mini at 1200 nits.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Last week, we talked about some sunglasses from a company that many people do not like very much. This week, we&#8217;re talking about Apple and the company 1,600 times smaller than it that&#8217;s facing similar product problems.</p>

<h2>the big thing</h2>
<p>When you get deep enough into the tech industry, it&#8217;s harder to look at things with a consumer&#8217;s set of eyes. I&#8217;ve felt that way more and more after six years watching Apple events as a TechCrunch reporter, but sometimes <a href="https://twitter.com/UptownDC_Rich/status/1438841983842328580?s=20">memes</a> from random Twitter accounts help me find the consumer truth I&#8217;m looking for.</p>
<p>As that dumb little tweet indicates, Apple is charging toward a future where it&#8217;s becoming a little harder to distinguish new from old. The off-year &#8220;S&#8221; period of old is no more for the iPhone, which has seen tweaks and new size variations since 2017&#8217;s radical iPhone X redesign. Apple is stretching the periods between major upgrades for its entire product line and it&#8217;s also taking longer to roll out those changes.</p>
<p>Apple debuted the current bezel-lite iPad Pro design back in late 2018 and it&#8217;s taken three years for the design to work its way down to the iPad mini while the entry-level iPad is still lying in wait. The shift from M1 Macs will likely take years as the company has already detailed. Most of Apple&#8217;s substantial updates rely on upgrades to the chipsets that they build, something that increasingly makes them look and feel like a consumer chipset company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a new trend, or even a new take, it&#8217;s been written lots of times, but it&#8217;s particularly interesting as the company bulks up the number of employees dedicated to future efforts like augmented reality, which will one day soon likely replace the iPhone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an evolution that&#8217;s pushing them into a similar design territory as action camera darling GoPro, which has struggled again and again with getting their core loyalists to upgrade their hardware frequently. These are on laughably different scales, with Apple now worth some $2.41 trillion and GoPro still fighting for a $1.5 billion market cap. The situations are obviously different, and yet they are both facing similar end-of-life innovation questions for categories that they both have mastered.</p>
<p>This week GoPro debuted its HERO10 Black camera, which brings higher frame rates and a better performing processor as it looks to push more of its user audience to subscription services. Sound familiar? This week, Apple debuted its new flagship, the iPhone 13 Pro, with a faster processor and better frame rates (for the display not the camera here, though). They also spent a healthy amount of time pushing users to embrace new services ecosystems.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s devices are getting so good that they&#8217;re starting to reach a critical feature plateau. The company has still managed to churn out device after device and expand their audience to billions while greatly expanding their average revenue per user. Things are clearly going pretty well for the most valuable company on earth, but while the stock has nearly quadrupled since the iPhone X launch, the consumer iPhone experience feels pretty consistent. That&#8217;s clearly not a bad thing, but it is &#8212; for lack of a better term &#8212; boring.</p>
<p>The clear difference, among 2.4 trillion others, is that GoPro doesn&#8217;t seem to have a clear escape route from its action camera vertical.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But Apple has been pushing thousands of employees toward an escape route in augmented reality, even if the technology is clearly not ready for consumers and they&#8217;re forced to lead with what has been rumored to be a several-thousand-dollar AR/VR headset with plenty of limitations. One of the questions I&#8217;m most interested in is what the iPhone device category looks likes once its unwieldy successor has reared its head. Most likely is that the AR-centric devices will be shipped as wildly expensive iPhone accessories and a way to piggy back off the accessibility of the mobile category while providing access to new &#8212; and more exciting &#8212; experiences. In short, AR is the future of the iPhone until AR doesn&#8217;t need the iPhone anymore. </span></p>

<h2>other things</h2>
<p><em>Here are the TechCrunch news stories that especially caught my eye this week:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-event-this-morning/"><b>Everything Apple announced this week</b></a><br />
Was it the most exciting event Apple has ever had? Nah. Are you still going to click that link to read about their new stuff? Yah.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/gopro-debuts-the-hero10-black-action-camera/"><b>GoPro launches the HERO10 Black</b></a><br />
I have a very soft spot in my heart for GoPro, which has taken a niche corner of hardware and made a device and ecosystem that&#8217;s really quite good. As I mentioned above, the company has some issues making significant updates every year, but they made a fairly sizable upgrade this year with the second-generation of their customer processor and some performance bumps across the board.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/tesla-will-open-controversial-fsd-beta-software-to-owners-with-a-good-driving-record/">Tesla will open FSD beta to drivers with good driving record</a><br />
</b>Elon Musk is pressing ahead with expanding its &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; software to more Tesla drivers, saying that users who paid for the FSD system can apply to use the beta and will be analyzed by the company&#8217;s insurance calculator bot. After 7 days of good driving behavior, Musk says users will be approved.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/opensea-admits-incident-as-top-exec-is-accused-of-trading-nfts-on-insider-information/"><b>OpenSea exec resigns after &#8216;insider trading&#8217; scandal</b></a><br />
NFTs are a curious business; there&#8217;s an intense amount of money pulsating through these markets &#8212; and little oversight. This week OpenSea, the so-called &#8220;eBay of NFTs,&#8221; detailed that its own VP of Product had been trading on insider information. He was later pushed to resign.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/apple-and-google-bow-to-pressure-in-russia-to-remove-kremlin-critics-tactical-voting-app/"><b>Apple and Google bow to the Kremlin</b></a><br />
Apple and Google are trying to keep happy the governments of most every market in which they operate. That leads to some uncomfortable situations in markets like Russia, where both tech giants were forced by the Kremlin to remove a political app from the country&#8217;s major opposition party.</p>

<h2>extra things</h2>
<p><em>Some of my favorite reads from our Extra Crunch subscription service this week:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/what-could-stop-the-startup-boom/"><strong>What could stop the startup boom?</strong></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;We’ve seen record results from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bostons-startup-market-is-more-than-setting-records-in-scorching-start-to-year/">cities</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">countries</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/the-european-vc-market-is-so-hot-it-may-skip-its-summer-holiday/">regions</a>. There’s so much money sloshing around the venture capital and startup worlds that it’s hard to recall what they were like in leaner times. We’ve been in a bull market for tech upstarts for so long that it feels like the only possible state of affairs. It’s not&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/the-value-of-software-revenue-may-have-finally-stopped-rising/"><b>The value of software revenue may have finally stopped rising</b></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;I’ve held back from covering the value of software (SaaS, largely) revenues for a few months after spending a bit too much time on it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/what-the-hell-saas-valuations/">in preceding quarters</a> — when VCs begin to point out that you could just swap out numbers quarter to quarter and write the same post, it’s time for a break. But the value of software revenues posted a simply incredible run, and I can’t say “no” to a chart&#8230;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/inside-gitlabs-ipo-filing/"><b>Inside GitLab&#8217;s IPO filing</b></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;The company’s IPO has therefore been long expected. In its last primary transaction, GitLab <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/gitlab-hauls-in-268m-series-e-on-2-768b-valuation/">raised $286 million</a> at a post-money valuation of $2.75 billion, per <a href="http://pitchbook.com/">PitchbBook data</a>. The same information source also notes that GitLab <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/gitlab-oversaw-a-195-million-secondary-sale-that-values-the-company-at-6-billion/">executed a secondary transaction</a> earlier this year worth $195 million, which gave the company a $6 billion valuation&#8230;&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place, with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h3>Apple Event wrap-up</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s official, new iPhones are here. But everyone is talking about the iPad mini instead.</p>

<p>Apple this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-fall-event-2021/">introduced</a> its updated iPhone 13 lineup, which includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/this-is-the-iphone-13/">iPhone 13 in pretty new shades</a>, an iPhone mini, and the more powerful <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/the-iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-features-120hz-display-better-cameras/">iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max</a>. Consumers may care most about the battery life improvements &#8212; 1.5 hours longer on iPhone 13 mini and iPhone 13 Pro; 2.5 hours more on iPhone 13 and Pro Max, compared with their respective iPhone 12 models. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apple-brings-macro-low-light-and-cinema-focused-updates-to-the-iphone-13-pro-camera/">Cameras got a decent upgrade</a>, powered by the A15 Bionic, which enables additions like &#8220;Cinematic Mode&#8221; (a mode that allows you to change focus between subjects). Plus, Pro models can do macro photography and now include support for ProRes video recording at 1080p 30 fps with the 128GB storage option and up to 4K 30 fps with 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage options. (Yes, there&#8217;s a 1TB iPhone now, and no more 64GB models. Hooray!)</p>

<p>The bigger news in terms of hardware, however, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apple-refreshes-ipad-mini-with-a-new-design-5g-and-an-8-3-inch-display/">was the iPad mini</a> ($499+), aka the BIG iPhone, which got a significant update. The new device has an 8.3-inch display, front and rear-facing 12-megapixel cameras, 80% faster performance with the A15 Bionic, 40% faster CPU, support for 5G, and it adds a USB-C port and a relocated Touch ID that&#8217;s now on the top button. It also now supports Center Stage and Apple Pencil (2nd generation.) It&#8217;s also available in new finishes: space gray, pink, purple and starlight.</p>
<p>Apple noted there are more than 1 million apps designed specifically for iPad devices. The full App Store has 2.22 million or more, according to various <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/">estimates</a>. A popular and affordable iPad mini could encourage more development beyond the iPhone.</p>
<p>Other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-event-this-morning/">announcements</a> included a new standard iPad with spec bumps, a new Apple Watch Series 7 with a slightly bigger screen and fall detection for cyclists, an updated Fitness+ with Pilates and meditation, and a nifty MagSafe Wallet that will track the location where it was separated from your iPhone.</p>

<p>Frustrated iOS developer Kosta Eleftheriou, who is already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">engaging in a legal battle</a> with Apple over money lost to App Store scams and other matters, <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1437845736951992321">couldn&#8217;t hold back his frustration</a> when he saw Apple announce its new Apple Watch Series 7 would now sport a familiar-looking keyboard. Eleftheriou&#8217;s own <a href="https://www.flicktype.com/">FlickType</a> keyboard app for Apple Watch was repeatedly rejected from the App Store for months on end, causing a lengthy delay in getting his app to market. The developer also claims to have had conversations with Apple execs about his keyboard app, which he says was once even considered an acquisition target.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s position on the matter is that it had to remove Eleftheriou&#8217;s app due to guidelines it had at the time prohibiting keyboard extensions, which the company had on the books due to what it believed would offer a poor consumer experience on earlier versions of Apple Watch, which had a smaller screen. These guidelines were later dropped once Apple learned of the app’s accessibility functions, which allowed the app to be published.</p>
<p>One question &#8212; which would have to either be worked out through the discovery process in court or through some sort of congressional investigation &#8212; is how long Apple had a Watch keyboard design on its product roadmap? Was Apple rejecting a third-party Watch keyboard app (and others like it, to be clear) over this purported &#8220;poor experience&#8221; at a time when Apple was actively designing its own keyboard UI? And how could there be a corporate firewall in place between App Store review activity and the company&#8217;s own plans, if Apple was considering an acquisition of FlickType at the time, as the lawsuit alleges?</p>
<p>Eleftheriou has a difficult path ahead of him going up against Apple&#8217;s legal team, but he&#8217;s more motivated than ever now. &#8220;See you in court, @Apple&#8221; he tweeted after the Watch reveal.</p>

<h3>App Annie charged with securities fraud</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-176"> charged App Annie</a>, as well as its co-founder and former CEO and Chairman Bertrand Schmitt, with securities fraud. App Annie and Schmitt have agreed to pay over $10 million to settle the fraud charges which are related to “deceptive practices and making material misrepresentations about how App Annie’s alternative data was derived,” the SEC said. The charges have to do with how App Annie used non-aggregated and non-anonymized data to alter its model-generated estimates to be more accurate, while telling trading firms that protections were in place against the misuse of confidential data. (More details and the full complaint can be read <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/">here on TechCrunch</a>.)</p>
<p>In response to the bombshell news, one competitor has spoken up. Apptopia co-founder and CEO Jonathan Kay <a href="https://blog.apptopia.com/statement-on-data-integrity-and-recent-industry-news">wrote about how</a> his firm took the time to build the company and data estimates &#8220;the right way,&#8221; which is why some of its estimates in the past hadn&#8217;t been accurate. (It wasn&#8217;t cheating the system.) This proved to be the better strategy. &#8220;We did not take shortcuts to spur breakneck scale; oftentimes founders feel the pressure to do so to meet unrealistic Board, VC or Market expectations. We haven’t and we don’t,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Appfigures shared a similar sentiment, adding they were disappointed to hear the news and hoped the actions didn&#8217;t erode trust in the industry. &#8220;Strict privacy has been one of our founding principles and has served our users and us well for 12 years. We believe the trust of our users is our most valuable asset,&#8221; t<a href="https://appfigures.com/resources/press/privacy-isnt-a-luxury">heir statement read.</a></p>

<li><strong>The Epic Games/Apple lawsuit will drag on.</strong> After last week&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">ruling</a>, which will now allow developers to add to iOS apps links to their website and other ways to pay, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Epic said it would appeal</a>. The Fortnite maker wanted Apple to be dubbed a monopolist, which would force iOS to be opened up to alternative app stores, like its own, or at least allow side-loading. But the judge said Apple&#8217;s success was &#8220;not illegal.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Developers were <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/">invited to submit</a> their iOS 15, iPadOS 15, tvOS 15 and watchOS 8 apps to the App Store</strong>, ahead of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/">public launch</a> on Monday.</li>
<li><strong>Apple introduced new marketing<a href="https://tools.applemediaservices.com/apple-app-store-promote"> tools</a> for app developers.</strong> Developers can now create custom marketing assets, including banners and images, to promote apps across social media and elsewhere. To get started, you select an app and a template, then customize the design and add present messages. The assets will be immediately available in the right sizes and can be shared with short links or codes that direct users to the App Store product page.</li>

<p>In any event, the new app allows users to connect their current profile, then search, filter, discover and save favorite NFTs, as well as view collections and item stats. The app will also link to blog posts about OpenSea developments and the NFT ecosystem as a whole. And it will link to exclusive releases.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If ever there was a time when working at the Securities and Exchange Commission was a dull affair, that&#8217;s no longer true. The federal agency that&#8217;s responsible for protecting investors and maintaining fair and orderly functioning of our securities markets is busier than ever, thanks to the rise of SPACs, cryptocurrencies and <a href="https://www.protocol.com/sec-startups-crowdfunding">new rules</a> around how startups raise money. And that&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>In just a few of its many cases, it this week charged App Annie, the mobile data and analytics firm, as well as its co-founder and former CEO and Chairman Bertrand Schmitt, with securities fraud.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gcMM2fyfZJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/">App Annie and co-founder charged with securities fraud, will pay $10M+ settlement</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;App Annie and co-founder charged with securities fraud, will pay $10M+ settlement&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/embed/#?secret=gcMM2fyfZJ" data-secret="gcMM2fyfZJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The charges come hot on the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/the-sec-and-the-doj-just-charged-this-startup-ceo-with-fraud-saying-he-lied-to-tiger-and-others/">another case</a> that the SEC announced late last month against Manish Lachwani, the former CEO of Silicon Valley startup HeadSpin, who has been accused of defrauding investors out of $80 million by falsely claiming HeadSpin had achieved stronger and more consistent growth on the customer and revenue front than was the case.</p>
<p>It also still has an active case against former Theranos president &#8220;Sunny&#8221; Balwani, who, unlike Theranos and its founder Elizabeth Holmes, has refused to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-theranos-sec/theranos-and-its-founder-settle-u-s-fraud-charges-sec-idUSKCN1GQ2HC">settle with the agency</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, in the midst of its active fieldwork, it&#8217;s getting used to grappling &#8212; publicly &#8212; with powerful tech CEOs. It famously became a target of Elon Musk several years ago when it filed securities fraud charges against him tied to his social media activities. (It <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-failed-to-oversee-elon-musk-s-tweets-sec-argued-in-letters-11622582765?mod=djemalertNEWS">continues to try</a> reining in the tweets of Musk, who has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-tweet-appears-to-mock-the-securities-and-exchange-commission-1538685320?mod=article_inline">openly mocked</a> the agency.)</p>
<p>More recently, it found itself the target of a <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1435439291715358721?lang=en">Twitter tirade</a> by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1JexKPRV0M"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/canva-ceo-melanie-perkins-will-tell-us-about-the-journey-to-a-15b-valuation-at-disrupt/">Canva CEO Melanie Perkins will tell us about the journey to a $15B valuation at Disrupt</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Canva CEO Melanie Perkins will tell us about the journey to a $15B valuation at Disrupt&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/canva-ceo-melanie-perkins-will-tell-us-about-the-journey-to-a-15b-valuation-at-disrupt/embed/#?secret=1JexKPRV0M" data-secret="1JexKPRV0M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Leading the charge in each of these cases and many more is Erin Schneider, who attended UC Berkeley as an undergraduate and law student and who, after a brief stint as a staff accountant at PWC and as a lawyer with a global law office, headed to the SEC as a staff attorney. She has steadily worked her way up since, and in May 2019 was appointed as the head of its San Francisco office, which leads enforcement and examinations in not only Northern California but also the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Because she and her colleagues have their hands particularly full, you can imagine how excited we are that Schneider is coming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Disrupt (September 21-23)</a> to discuss some of the agency&#8217;s many current challenges &#8212; as well as its victories.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in learning more about the SEC’s ever-evolving approach to Silicon Valley startups, and why you shouldn’t expect its interest to dissipate any time soon, you really won’t want to miss this conversation.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Disrupt</a> is coming up fast. Don&#8217;t miss our conversation with Schneider or with Brian Armstrong himself, or actor-entrepreneur <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ryan-reynolds-is-coming-to-disrupt/">Ryan Reynolds</a>, or investor Chamath Palihapitiya, or the many other powerful speakers who will be gracing our virtual stage this year. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Get your ticket now</a> for less than $100 &#8212; and we’ll see you soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Thank you for clicking on this email. With a subject line like <em>that</em> you are legend for being here.</p>
<p>Of course, we’re talking buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) companies today, a particular part of the larger fintech world that is more than interesting.</p>
<p>Thanks to recent mega-buys of players in the BNPL space <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/">from Square</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/paypal-acquires-japans-paidy-for-2-7b-to-crack-the-buy-now-pay-later-market-in-asia/">and PayPal</a>, we’ve been getting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/heres-what-your-bnpl-startup-could-be-worth/">closer to understanding</a> just what the value of the companies in the space may really be &#8212; and for the myriad BNPL startups in the market, it’s big news.</p>
<p>But while I was on vacation (<a href="https://twitter.com/selviano/status/1438907529564602368">Michael’s fault, it turns out</a>), Goldman Sachs decided to buy GreenSky, a public BNPL company. Which means that we can quickly run some numbers on the deal and add this latest arrow to our How To Value A BNPL Company quiver.</p>
<p>My friend and colleague &#8212; and former deskmate, back in the day &#8212; Ryan Lawler <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/goldman-greensky-bnpl/">has an interview with Goldman that is worth reading</a>. The transaction is worth $2.24 billion, per Goldman, driving the value of GreekSky dramatically higher in its aftermath, as investors digested the implied deal premium to the company’s previous share price.</p>
<p>What sort of volume was GreenSky’s home-improvement-focused BNPL doing? Here’s the company’s <a href="https://investors.greensky.com/news-releases/news-release-details/greensky-inc-reports-record-net-income-and-adjusted-ebitda">latest earnings report</a>:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Transaction Volume: Second quarter transaction volume was $1.5 billion, an increase of 14% when compared to the second quarter of 2020. Approved credit lines for the quarter were the highest in Company history and are a positive leading indicator of momentum as home improvement supply chain and labor market shortages ease.</p></blockquote>
<p>So a $6 billion run-rate at a price of $2.24 billion. That works out to about $0.37 in corporate value for each dollar in GMV that GreenSky handles. Which is the <em>lowest</em> number we’ve seen to date.</p>
<p>As a reminder, here’s what we’ve found more recently, with both of us keeping in mind that not every figure below is perfectly apples:apples; these are directional figures more than absolutes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Affirm: </strong>$2.94 in value per dollar of serviced GMV</li>
<li><strong>AfterPay: </strong>$1.84 per dollar of serviced GMV (at Square price)</li>
<li><strong>Paidy: </strong>$1.80 per dollar of serviced GMV (at PayPal price)</li>
<li><strong>Klarna:</strong> $0.57 per dollar of serviced GMV</li>
</ul>
<p>GreenSky sits at the bottom of the list. Perhaps growth is the reason? A 14% GMV growth rate doesn’t give the company much leeway to grow, even if it manages a higher take rate. It’s hard to burnish a growth rate that starts with a <em>one</em>, especially if the leading line atop your investor relations page is “GREENSKY, INC. IS A GROWTH COMPANY.”</p>
<p>Akin to how we’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/the-value-of-software-revenue-may-have-finally-stopped-rising/">seen diverging SaaS revenue multiples</a>, striated along the axes of revenue growth and revenue quality, there’s likely something similar afoot here. Loss ratios, take rates, and GMV growth are vectors by which BNPL companies will be valued differently.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UhC5JLsZFt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/the-value-of-software-revenue-may-have-finally-stopped-rising/">The value of software revenue may have finally stopped rising</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The value of software revenue may have finally stopped rising&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/the-value-of-software-revenue-may-have-finally-stopped-rising/embed/#?secret=UhC5JLsZFt" data-secret="UhC5JLsZFt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>BNPL <em>startups</em> can find their most accurate comp in growth and loan quality terms, and then work backwards to their present-day market worth. It’s good to have data.</p>
<h2>Mammoths?</h2>
<p>I was going to spend the bulk of this newsletter discussing Mammoth Biosciences, and its plan to Jurassic Park the world, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/breakout-crispr-platform-company-mammoth-biosciences-is-officially-a-unicorn/">but TechCrunch beat me to it</a>. I spoke to one of its investors &#8212; Thomas Tull &#8212; about the deal, but will hold onto those notes for a bit. I suspect we’ll need them in time.</p>
<h2>One neat funding round to close us out</h2>
<p>Disrupt is next week, and with an IPO cycle upon us I’ve fallen behind my usual funding round cadence. (And comms, sorry!) So, here’s a makeup entry for our shared enjoyment: <a href="https://postal.io/">Postal</a>.</p>
<p>The company works in the marketing tech space, operating what its website claims is the “largest” business-to-business “gifting marketplace.” More simply, it helps companies send personalized <em>physical</em> goods to customers. Which it claims has a very high ROI.</p>
<p>In a somewhat ironic twist, I actually have to do some disclosures at this juncture. It turns out the company’s leading investors are Mayfield and OMERS. Those two firms led my <a href="http://crunchbase.com">former employer’s</a> Series B and C rounds, respectively. But if I didn’t write about companies to which my Crunchbase connection didn’t cause some sort of awkward frisson, I’d have to cut out too large a swath of the market. I’ll just keep bringing up the matter when we have to.</p>
<p>Postal works in a somewhat similar space to Sendoso, though, to my understanding, the latter company deals a bit more with employee gifting over customer-focused efforts. In time they’ll compete directly if they both keep growing. Sendoso <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/sendoso-nabs-100m-as-its-corporate-gifting-platform-passes-20000-customers/">raised $100 million earlier this week</a>, because of course it did.</p>
<p>Other players in the space include Reachdesk and Alyce (which raised $30 million earlier this year), among others. The business of building tech to deliver personalized physical goods is pretty big, it turns out. (You can make an NFT joke here, if you’d like.)</p>
<p>PitchBook pegs Sendoso’s new valuation at $640 million (post-money) and Alyce at $135 million (post-money). Present-day valuations for Reachdesk and Postal.io were not available.</p>
<p>Okay that is enough for now. Have a delightful weekend, and I’ll see you at Disrupt! You may see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true&amp;promo=Wilhelm20">a <em>lot</em> of me</a> on the Extra Crunch stage. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank has been on a tear in Latin America. The Japanese investment conglomerate just announced it has launched its second Latin America-focused fund with a $3 billion capital commitment from the company that may grow as the fund explores &#8220;options to raise additional capital,&#8221; according to SoftBank. The vehicle follows hot on the heels of SoftBank&#8217;s debut Latin America-focused fund, announced in March 2019 with an initial $2 billion in committed capital.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to see what all the fuss is about. Led by Marcelo Claure, CEO of SoftBank Group International and COO of SoftBank Group Corp., the outfit&#8217;s roughly four dozen employees &#8212; who operate out of Miami, São Paulo and Mexico City &#8212; have helped SoftBank identify and fund 48 startups into which it has plugged $3.5 billion and, according to the firm, which feature a combined (on paper, notably) net IRR of 85%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/">TechCrunch’s China roundup</a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>This week, China gets serious about breaking down the walled gardens that its internet giants have formed for decades. Two major funding rounds were announced, from the newly established autonomous driving unicorn Deeproute.ai and fast-growing, cross-border financial service provider XTransfer.</p>
<h2>Tear down the walls</h2>
<p>The Chinese internet is infamously siloed, with a handful of &#8220;super apps&#8221; each occupying a cushy, protective territory that tries to lock users in and keep rivals out. On Tencent&#8217;s WeChat messenger, for instance, links to Alibaba&#8217;s Taobao marketplace and ByteDance&#8217;s Douyin short video service can&#8217;t be viewed or even redirected. That&#8217;s unlike WhatsApp, Telegram or Signal that offer friendly URL previews within chats.</p>
<p>E-commerce platforms fend off competition in different ways. Taobao uses Alibaba&#8217;s affiliate Alipay as a default payments option, omitting its arch rival WeChat Pay. Tencent-backed JD.com, a rival to Alibaba, encourages its users to pay through its own payments system or WeChat Pay.</p>
<p>But changes are underway. &#8220;Ensuring normal access to legal URLs is the basic requirement for developing the internet,&#8221; a senior official from China&#8217;s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology <a href="http://news.china.com.cn/2021-09/13/content_77749682.htm">said</a> at a press conference this week. He added that unjustified blockages of web links &#8220;affect users&#8217; experience, undermine users&#8217; rights, and disrupt market orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is some merit in filtering third-party links when it comes to keeping out the likes of pornography, misinformation and violent content. Content distributors in China also strictly abide by censorship rules, silencing politically sensitive discussions. These principles will stay in place, and MIIT&#8217;s new order is really to crack anticompetitive practices and wane the power of the bloated internet giants.</p>
<p>The call to end digital walled gardens is part of MIIT&#8217;s campaign, started <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2021-07/26/c_1127695852.htm">in July</a>, to restore &#8220;orders&#8221; to the Chinese internet. While crackdowns on internet firms are routine, the spate of new policies announced in recent months &#8212; from new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/china-roundup-data-security-clampdown/">data security rules</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/11/china-roundup-tencent-takes-on-sites-trying-to-circumvent-its-age-limits/">heightened gaming restrictions</a> &#8212; signify Beijing&#8217;s resolution to curb the influence of Chinese internet firms of all kinds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The deadline for online platforms to unblock URLs is September 17, the MIIT <a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2021-09-13/doc-iktzqtyt5796838.shtml">said</a> earlier. Virtually all the major internet companies have swiftly issued statements saying they will firmly carry out MIIT&#8217;s requirements and help promote the healthy development of the Chinese internet.</p>
<p>Internet users are bound to benefit from the dismantling of the walled gardens. They will be able to browse third-party content smoothly on WeChat without having to switch between apps. They can share product links from Taobao right within the messenger instead of having their friends copy-paste a string of cryptic codes that Taobao automatically generates for WeChat sharing.</p>
<h2>Robotaxi dream</h2>
<p>Autonomous driving startup Deeproute.ai said this week it has closed a $300 million Series B round from investors including Alibaba, Jeneration Capital, and Chinese automaker Geely. The valuation of this round was undisclosed.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen a lot of publicity from Pony.ai, WeRide, Momenta and AutoX but not so much Deeproute.ai. That in part is because the company is relatively young, founded only in 2019 by Zhou Guang after he was &#8220;fired&#8221; by his co-founders at the once-promising <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/roadstar-ai/company_financials">Roadstar.ai</a> amid company infighting.</p>
<p>Investors in Roadstar.ai <a href="https://medium.com/syncedreview/roadstar-ai-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-self-driving-startup-2b45f1ddcbcf">reportedly</a> saw the dismissal of Zhou as detrimental to the startup, which had raised at least $140 million up to that point, and subsequently sought to dissolve the business. It appears that Zhou, formerly the chief scientist at Roadstar, still commands the trust of some investors to support his reborn autonomous driving venture.</p>
<p>Like Pony.ai and WeRide, Deeproute is trying to operate its own robotaxi fleets. While the business model gives it control over reams of driving data, it&#8217;s research- and cash-intensive. As such, major Chinese robotaxi startups are all looking at faster commercial deployments, like self-driving buses and trucks, to ease their financial stress.</p>
<h2>Cross-border trade boom</h2>
<p>The other major funding news this week comes from Shanghai-based XTransfer, which helps small-and-medium Chinese exporters collect payments from overseas. The Series C round, led by D1 Partners, pulled in $138 million and catapulted Xtransfer&#8217;s valuation to over $1 billion. The proceeds will go towards product development, hiring and global expansion.</p>
<p>Founded by former executives from Ant Group, XTransfer tries to solve a pain point faced by small and medium exporters: opening and maintaining bank accounts in different countries can be difficult and costly. As such, XTransfer works as a payments gateway between its SME customer, the party that pays it, and their respective banks.</p>
<p>As of July, XTransfer&#8217;s customers had surpassed 150,000, most of which are in mainland China. The company of over 1,000 employees is also expanding into Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>While business-to-business export is booming in China, more and more products are also being directly sold from Chinese brands to consumers around the world. Some of the most successful examples, like Shein and Anker, use a different set of payments processors for their direct-to-consumer sales, which tend to be in bigger volume but smaller in average ticket value.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The venture capital industry as we know it is broken. At least for women, that is.</p>
<p>In terms of funding to women founders, 2020 was among the worst years on record. On a global level, only 9% of all funds deployed to technology startups went to founding teams that included at least one woman. Solo woman founders and all-women teams raised just 2% of all VC dollars, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-to-female-founders/">Crunchbase data showed</a>.</p>
<p>Shockingly, this number is actually<em> less</em> than it was when we first started counting a decade ago, well before many high-profile diversity initiatives launched with the goal of fixing this very problem.</p>
<p>This funding gap isn’t just a moral crisis &#8212; it’s an economic one. The lack of investment into women-founded startups is a <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/the-trillion-dollar-opportunity-in-supporting-female-entrepreneurs">missed opportunity</a> worth trillions of dollars. That’s because of <a href="https://www.allraise.org/assets/pitchbook_all_raise_2019_all_in_women_in_the_vc_ecosystem.pdf">overwhelming evidence</a> that startups founded by women outperform startups founded by men: They generate more revenue, earn higher profits and exit faster at higher valuations. And they do all this while raising <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ruthumoh/2020/08/19/female-founders-face-funding-hurdles-and-report-less-runway-amid-pandemic/">way less money</a>.</p>
<p>What we’re doing isn’t working. Through research for my next book on women founders and funders, I kept asking myself the same question: When it comes to fixing the funding gap for women founders, what’s the one thing we can do that will make everything else easier or unnecessary?</p>
<p>I now believe that our best bet for long-term change is to focus our efforts on increasing the number of women investing partners who can write large seed checks. Here’s why.</p>
<h2>Women investors are up to 3x more likely to fund women founders</h2>
<p>Recently, one of the top VCs in the world told me how challenging it is to diversify his senior team. He expressed it as an accepted fact and a widespread belief. This is a common trope in Silicon Valley: Everyone <em>wants</em> gender diversity, but it’s so hard to find all the senior women!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the venture capital industry, who you hire at the senior level is who you hang out with. And who you hire at the senior level determines who your fund will back.</p>
<p>Since studies now show that women investors are up to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/committeeof200/2020/09/22/diversity-as-uperpower-the-well-known-data-against-homogeneous-teams-in-venture-capital/?sh=61de50322019">three times more likely</a> to invest in women founders, it is clear that the fastest way to fund more women is to hire more women investing partners with check-writing ability. The effect to venture firms? Returns.</p>
<p>“When U.S. VC firms increased the proportion of female partners, they benefited with 9.7% more profitable exits and a 1.5% spike in overall fund returns annually,” explained <a href="https://www.wrg.vc/news-posts/2020/12/8/diversity-as-uperpower-the-well-known-data-against-homogeneous-teams-in-venture-capital">Lisa Stone</a> of WestRiver Group.</p>
<p><a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/2019-pitchbook-all-raise-all-in-women-in-the-vc-ecosystem">Data from All Raise and PitchBook</a> reinforce the “correlation between hiring female decision-makers at the investment level and outperformance at the fund level,” adding that “69.2% of U.S. VCs that scored a top-quartile fund between 2009 and 2018 had women in decision-making roles.”</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be surprising that women investors are more likely to invest in women founders. That’s because humans have a propensity toward <a href="https://twitter.com/Claire/status/1435990441330155520">homophily</a><strong> &#8212;</strong> the tendency for like to attract like and for similarity to breed connection.</p>
<p>Homophily is why a vegan VC is more likely to invest in a vegan food tech, a gamer is more likely to hang out with gaming founders, or a parent is more likely to invest in a parent marketplace. People gravitate toward <a href="https://clairediazortiz.com/why-women-invest-in-women-homophily/">what they know</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/deenashakir">Deena Shakir</a>, who happens to be a woman and a mother, recently led Lux Capital’s investment into women’s health unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/mavens-comprehensive-approach-to-womens-health-earns-it-unicorn-status/">Maven</a>. Shakir had multiple high-risk pregnancies with multiple complications, emergency C-sections, NICU stays and breastfeeding challenges.</p>
<p>“It is no coincidence that I am joined on Maven’s board of directors by four other mothers … and a brand-new father … whose personal journeys have also informed their professional conviction,” Shakir wrote in a <a href="https://medium.com/lux-capital/our-investment-in-maven-clinic-a-milestone-for-maternal-and-family-health-224b1bea5d60">Medium post</a>.</p>
<h2>Why seed checks have the greatest impact on the ecosystem</h2>
<p>I believe that to fix the funding gap for women founders and jump-start the virtuous cycle of venture capital investing into women, we should focus on getting more seed checks into the hands of women founders. That’s because <a href="https://hbr.org/podcast/2021/05/understanding-the-venture-capital-gender-gap">seed investing is a leading indicator</a> of whether we are headed in the right direction in terms of closing the funding gap for women, according to <a href="https://freestyle.vc/team-jenny-lefcourt/">Jenny Lefcourt</a>, a partner at Freestyle and co-founder of <a href="https://www.allraise.org/">All Raise</a>, the leading nonprofit focused on diversifying the VC industry.</p>
<p>This doesn’t discount the importance of investments made into women founders at later stages. When a women founder lands Series D capital, it boosts this year’s numbers into women founders and likely brings that particular founder closer to a liquidity event that will lead her (and her executives) to invest in more women.</p>
<p>That said, the greatest impact on the future ecosystem will come from widening the top of the funnel and giving more women at the seed stage the shot to one day reach a momentous Series D funding like Maven. After all, who we fund now becomes who we fund later.</p>
<h2>Why large seed checks matter most</h2>
<p>Finally, the size of the check is also important when thinking about how to have the biggest impact on the ecosystem.</p>
<p>I know first-hand that <a href="https://twitter.com/Claire/status/1397954144644780032">microchecks are critical</a> to building an inclusive ecosystem. When women invest at the seed level — in any amount — they jumpstart a virtuous cycle of women funding women. That’s why when <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vc-claire-diaz-ortiz-parental-leave-silicon-valley-pregnant-founders-2021-6">I stepped in to lend a hand at my portfolio company</a> when the solo woman founder took a parental leave, one of my key projects was to develop Jefa House, a way for Jefa’s own executives to easily invest in other women-founded startups.</p>
<p>That said, large party rounds made up entirely of small angel checks are few and far between. Similar challenges face small checks from emerging fund managers. Although the sheer number of emerging managers has <a href="https://www.kauffmanfellows.org/journal_posts/a-new-platform-for-emerging-managers">increased 9x in seven years</a>, the reality is that most emerging managers simply don’t have much money.</p>
<p>Are women venture capitalists who run their own microfunds more likely to invest in amazing women founders than Tier 1 funds with few or no women investing partners? Yes. Will it take them a long time to compete with those Tier 1 funds in terms of check size? Yes.</p>
<p>This is why it matters so much when leading funds hire or promote women to the partner level. Not only does it give women founders a better shot at funding from high-signal shops, but the moves that top funds make are key signals to others in the ecosystem: In venture capital, women investors don’t have to sit at the kids’ table.</p>
<h2>Why we must hire women investing partners</h2>
<p>We all know that great returns in early-stage venture capital come from making big bets on great ideas that others aren’t betting on. That is why <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2021/06/18/contrarian-investment-techniques-in-venture-capital-part-1/?sh=5b6d4b1d5d2c">VC investing is contrarian by definition</a>. Thanks to our increasingly globalized world and clear data showing the importance of diverse teams to make good decisions to get those returns, no one in 2021 truly believes that single white dudes in Palo Alto have a monopoly on billion-dollar ideas.</p>
<p>However, due to the nature of homophily, venture capital remains a highly homogenous industry, and the social and economic interactions and decisions of human beings remain deeply swayed by these principles. No matter how much work we do, birds of a feather really do flock — and fund — together.</p>
<p>This all leads to one place: The clearest path to funding different kinds of founders with different kinds of ideas is to put different kinds of investors on the investing side of the table. To get more funding to women founders, we need more women who can write checks. That’s why prioritizing the hiring of women investing partners who can write large seed checks is key to fixing the funding crisis for women founders and increasing VC returns worldwide.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has abused the dominant position of Android in India to illegally hurt competitors in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/10/india-to-reportedly-investigate-google-over-alleged-android-abuse/">two-year antitrust probe by the nation&#8217;s watchdog</a> has found.</p>
<p>The Android-maker reduced device manufacturing firms&#8217; ability and incentive to develop &#8212; and sell &#8212; devices running alternative versions of Android (more popularly known as forks), the probe found, according to two people have have been briefed on the findings.</p>
<p>Additionally, the report found Google&#8217;s requirement to make it mandatory for device manufacturers to pre-install its apps to be in violation of India&#8217;s competition law.</p>
<p>More than five dozen firms including Amazon and Apple responded to queries from the Indian watchdog &#8212; the Competition Commission of India &#8212; during the course of the investigation, the report said.</p>
<p>The Indian watchdog also found issues with the way Google has enforced policies on Play Store, saying those are “one-sided, ambiguous, vague, biased and arbitrary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google said it looks forward to engage with the CCI to demonstrate how &#8220;Android has led to more competition and innovation, not less.&#8221; Indian newspaper Times of India <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/google-abusing-position-playing-unfair-cci-probe/articleshow/86306396.cms">first wrote</a> about the report.</p>
<p>The report&#8217;s findings &#8212; which are yet to be formally published by the CCI &#8212; is the latest setback for Google in India, where it is facing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/india-orders-antitrust-investigation-against-google-over-alleged-abuse-of-androids-dominance-in-smart-tv-market/">several</a> other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/india-opens-antitrust-case-against-google-over-its-payments-app/">antitrust probes</a> and daggers from a growing number of domestic startups, founders, and investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Alliance of Digital India Foundation, a group of 350 startups, founders and investors, lauded the CCI report&#8217;s findings and said the watchdog&#8217;s step &#8220;is in line with the Indian digital ecosystem&#8217;s needs.&#8221;</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s a story common to all sectors today: investors only want to see ‘uppy-righty’ charts in a pitch. However, edtech growth in the past 18 months has ramped up to such an extent that companies need to be presenting 3x+ growth in annual recurring revenue to even get noticed by their favored funds.</p>
<p>Some companies are able to blast this out of the park — like GoStudent, Ornikar and YouSchool — but others, arguably less suited to the conditions presented by the pandemic, have found it more difficult to present this kind of growth.</p>
<p>One of the most common themes Brighteye sees in young companies is an emphasis on international expansion for growth. To get some additional insight into this trend, we surveyed edtech firms on their expansion plans, priorities and pitfalls. We received 57 responses and supplemented it with interviews of leading companies and investors. Europe is home 49 of the surveyed companies, six are based in the U.S., and three in Asia.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Going international later in the journey or when more funding is available, possibly due to a VC round, seems to make facets of expansion more feasible. Higher budgets also enable entry to several markets nearly simultaneously.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The survey revealed a roughly even split of target customers across companies, institutions and consumers, as well as a good spread of home markets. The largest contingents were from the U.K. and France, with 13 and nine respondents respectively, followed by the U.S. with seven, Norway with five, and Spain, Finland, and Switzerland with four each. About 40% of these firms were yet to foray beyond their home country and the rest had gone international.</p>
<p>International expansion is an interesting and nuanced part of the growth path of an edtech firm. Unlike their neighbors in fintech, it’s assumed that edtech companies need to expand to a number of big markets in order to reach a scale that makes them attractive to VCs. This is less true than it was in early 2020, as digital education and work is now so commonplace that it’s possible to build a billion-dollar edtech in a single, larger European market.</p>
<p>But naturally, nearly every ambitious edtech founder realizes they need to expand overseas to grow at a pace that is attractive to investors. They have good reason to believe that, too: The complexities of selling to schools and universities, for example, are widely documented, so it might seem logical to take your chances and build market share internationally. It follows that some view expansion as a way of diversifying risk — e.g. we are growing nicely in market X, but what if the opportunity in Y is larger and our business begins to decline for some reason in market X?</p>
<p>International expansion sounds good, but what does it mean? We asked a number of organizations this question as part of the survey analysis. The responses were quite broad, and their breadth to an extent reflected their target customer groups and how those customers are reached. If the product is web-based and accessible anywhere, then it’s relatively easy for a company with a good product to reach customers in a large number of markets (50+). The firm can then build teams and wider infrastructure around that traction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“I’ve seen startups spend thousands of dollars inefficiently as a result of not having optimal signal in their paid acquisition campaigns.

<p><strong>Marketer:</strong> Andrew Race, <a href="https://www.thinkjuice.com/">Juice</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Orin Singh, <a href="https://www.merchantindustry.com/">Merchant Industry</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“We were referred to Juice by a family friend of my company&#8217;s owner and as a personal courtesy they said they were giving us their best guy. Naturally we thought that is what everyone says but they were not kidding. Andrew was singularly leagues above our previous marketing company.

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/in-growth-marketing-signal-determines-success/">In growth marketing, signal determines success:</a> Martinez learned from his mistakes, and share the lessons learned with us. From selecting the signal, to how to enhance it, Martinez covers key aspects including how to take advantage of iOS 14. He says, “So how do you stay ahead and continue moving the needle on your growth marketing campaigns? First and foremost, constantly question the events you’re optimizing for. And second, leave no stone unturned.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2203699&amp;preview=true">Marketers should plan for more DIY metrics as iOS 15 nears: </a>The release of iOS 15 will change that playing field for marketers. They&#8217;ll have to rely on metrics that use zero and first-party data rather than relying on email open rates as the main metric. Miranda spoke with Sharma about how this release will impact the industry and what marketers should focus on. One tip from Sharma is, &#8220;Focus on down funnel metrics like clicks and conversions &#8212; that&#8217;s what it really comes down to and that&#8217;s the truest indicator of engagement.&#8221;</p>

On social proof, Costelloe says, &#8220;Have you ever stopped to check out a restaurant because it had a large lineup out front? That wasn&#8217;t by chance. It&#8217;s common for restaurants to limit the size of their reception area. This forces people to wait outside, and the line signals to people walking past that the restaurant is so good it&#8217;s worth waiting for.&#8221;</p>

<h2>4 ways to leverage ROAS to triple lead generation</h2>
<p>In school, it&#8217;s highly unethical to copy someone else&#8217;s work and pass it off as your own. In business, however, it&#8217;s encouraged.</p>
<p>Xiaoyun TU, global director of demand generation at Brightpearl, wrote a comprehensive guide that describes how a better understanding of return on advertising spend (ROAS) can triple your company&#8217;s lead generation.</p>
<p>&#8220;A &#8216;good&#8217; ROAS score is different for each company and campaign,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;If your figure isn’t where you’d like it to be, you can leverage ROAS data to create targeted campaigns and personalized experiences.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://blumbergcapital.com/">Blumberg Capital</a>, founded in 1991 by investor David Blumberg, has just closed its fifth early-stage venture fund with $225 million, a vehicle that Blumberg says was oversubscribed &#8212; he planned to raise $200 million &#8212; and that has already been used to invest in 16 startups around the world (the firm has small offices in San Francisco, New York, Tel Aviv and Miami, where Blumberg moved his family last year).</p>
<p>We caught up with him earlier this week to talk shop and he sounded almost ecstatic about the current market, which has evidently been good for returns, with Blumberg Capital&#8217;s biggest hits tied to Nutanix (it claims a 68x return), DoubleVerify (a 98x return at IPO in April, the firm says), Katapult (which went public via SPAC in July), Addepar (currently valued above $2 billion) and Braze (it submitted its S-1 in June).</p>
<p>We also talked a bit about his new life in Florida, which he was quick to note is &#8220;not a clone of Silicon Valley.&#8221; Not last, he told us why he thinks we&#8217;re in a &#8220;golden era of applying intelligence to every business,&#8221; from mining to the business of athletic performance.</p>
<p>More from our conversation, edited lightly for length and clarity, follows:</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are you funding right now?</strong></p>
<p>DB: Our last 30 to 40 deals have basically been about big data that&#8217;s been analyzed by artificial intelligence of some sort, then riding in a better wrapper of software process automation on rails of internet and mobility. Okay, that&#8217;s a lot of buzzwords.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Yes.</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DB: What I&#8217;m saying is that this ability to take raw information data that&#8217;s either been sitting around and not analyzed, or from new sources of data like sensors or social media or many other places, then analyze it and take it to all these businesses that have been there forever, is beginning to [have] incremental [impacts] that may sound small [but add up].</p>
<p>One of our [unannounced] companies applies AI to mining &#8212; lithium mining and gold and copper &#8212; so miners don&#8217;t waste their time before finding the richest vein of deposit. We partner with mining owners and we bring extra data that they don&#8217;t have access to &#8212; some is proprietary, some is public &#8212; and because we&#8217;re experts at the AI modeling of it, we can apply it to their geography and geology, and as part of the business model, we take part of the mine in return.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So your fund now owns not just equity but part of a mine?</strong></p>
<p>DB: This is evidently done a lot in what&#8217;s called E&amp;P, exploration and production, in the oil and gas industry, and we&#8217;re just following a time-tested model, where some of the service providers put in value and take out a share. So as we see it, it aligns our interests and the better we do for them, the better they do.</p>
<p><strong>TC: This fund is around the same size of your fourth fund, which closed with $207 million in 2017. How do you think about check sizes in this market?</strong></p>
<p>DB: We write checks of $1 million to $6 million generally. We could go down a little bit for something in a seed where we can&#8217;t get more of a slice, but we like to have large ownership up front. We found that to have a fund return at least 3x &#8212; and our funds seem to be returning much more than that &#8212; [we need to be math-minded about things].</p>
<p>We have 36 companies in our portfolio typically, and 20% of them fail, 20% of them are our superstars and 60% are kind of medium. Of those superstars, six of them have to return $100 million each in a $200 million fund to make it a $600 million return, and to get six companies to [produce a] $100 million [for us] they have to reach a billion dollars in value, where we own 10% at the end.</p>
<p><strong>TC You&#8217;re buying 10% and maintaining your pro rata or this is after being diluted over numerous rounds?</strong></p>
<p>DB: It&#8217;s more like we want 15% to 20% of a company and it gets [diluted] down to 10%. And it&#8217;s been working. Some of our funds are way above that number.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are all four of your earlier funds in the black?</strong></p>
<p>DB: Yes. I love to say this: We have never, ever lost money for our fund investors.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You were among a handful of VCs who were cited quite a lot last year for hightailing it out of the Bay Area for Miami. One year into the move, how is it going?</strong></p>
<p>DB: It is not a clone of Silicon Valley. They are different and add value each in their own way. But Florida is a great place for our family to be and I find for our business, it&#8217;s going to be great as well. I can be on the phone to Israel and New York without any time zone-related problems. Some of our companies are moving here, including one from Israel recently, one from San Francisco and one from Texas. A lot of our LPs are moving here or live here already. We can also get up and down to South America for distribution deals more easily.</p>

<p>If we need to get to California or New York, airplanes still work, too, so it hasn&#8217;t been a negative at all. I&#8217;m going to a JPMorgan event tonight for a bunch of tech founders where there should be 150 people.</p>
<p><strong>TC: That sounds great, though how did you feel about <a href="https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-hits-weather-records-for-heat-and-humidity-12415457">summer</a> in Miami?</strong></p>
<p>DB: We were in France.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the technology and business world worked towards the weekend, developer operations (DevOps) firm GitLab <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001653482/000162828021018818/gitlab-sx1.htm">filed</a> to go public. Before we get into our time off, we need to pause, digest the company&#8217;s S-1 filing, and come to some early conclusions.</p>
<p>GitLab competes with GitHub, which Microsoft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock/">purchased for $7.5 billion back in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>The company is notable for its long-held, remote-first stance, and for being more public with its metrics than most unicorns — for some time, GitLab had a November 18, 2020 IPO target in its public plans, to pick an example. We also knew when it crossed the $100 million recurring revenue threshold.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Considering GitLab&#8217;s more recent results, a narrowing operating loss in the last two quarters is good news for the company.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s IPO has therefore been long expected. In its last primary transaction, GitLab <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/gitlab-hauls-in-268m-series-e-on-2-768b-valuation/">raised $286 million</a> at a post-money valuation of $2.75 billion, per <a href="http://pitchbook.com">Pitchbook data</a>. The same information source also notes that GitLab <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/gitlab-oversaw-a-195-million-secondary-sale-that-values-the-company-at-6-billion/">executed a secondary transaction</a> earlier this year worth $195 million, which gave the company a $6 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s parse GitLab&#8217;s growth rate, its final pre-IPO scale, its SaaS metrics, and then ask if we think it can surpass its most recent private-market price. Sound good? Let&#8217;s rock.</p>
<h2>The GitLab S-1</h2>
<p>GitLab intends to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol &#8220;GTLB.&#8221; Its IPO filing lists a placeholder $100 million raise estimate, though that figure will change when the company sets an initial price range for its shares. Its fiscal year ends January 31, meaning that its quarters are offset from traditional calendar periods by a single month.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the big numbers.</p>
<p>In its fiscal year ended January 2020, GitLab posted revenues of $81.2 million, gross profit of $71.9 million, an operating loss of $128.4 million, and a modestly greater net loss of $130.7 million.</p>
<p>And in the year ended January 31, 2021, GitLab&#8217;s revenue rose roughly 87% to $152.2 million from a year earlier. The company&#8217;s gross profit rose around 86% to $133.7 million, and operating loss widened nearly 67% to $213.9 million. Its net loss totaled $192.2 million.</p>
<p>This paints a picture of a SaaS company growing quickly at scale, with essentially flat gross margins (88%). Growth has not been inexpensive either — GitLab spent more on sales and marketing than it generated in gross profit in the past two fiscal years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you really want to video chat tonight with William Hung of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RrLQUN8UJg">retro American Idol fame</a>&#8230; got twenty bucks to spare? Yesterday, Cameo launched its Cameo Calls products, which lets fans video chat for up to 15 minutes one-on-one with their favorite influencers and celebrities. The talent sets the duration, time, and price of their call, which Cameo says <a href="https://cameoblog.medium.com/bringing-fans-and-talent-closer-together-with-cameo-calls-fb52f4a40dbc">averages around $31</a>.</p>
<p>To book a call, users can go to Cameo&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cameo.com/cameo-calls">website</a> or app to see a schedule of upcoming Cameo Calls that they can buy. These also appear on individual talent&#8217;s Cameo pages. When you purchase a Cameo Call, you get a unique ticket code that you enter on the app to join your call.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lk1wD0z91rE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>In June 2020, Cameo enabled users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/you-can-set-up-a-zoom-call-with-tony-hawk-or-sinbad-using-cameos-latest-feature/">book Zoom calls</a> with celebrities as lockdown became a global norm, but Cameo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22678456/cameo-calls-live-app-chat-celebrities-meet-and-greet">phased out</a> that feature in April. Instead, Cameo Calls now offers a native experience in the app, rather than relying on third-party software. The downside for consumers, though, is that this makes it more difficult to invite your favorite reality star to your office&#8217;s Zoom happy hour. But on the bright side, the Cameo Calls includes a dedicated photo op at the end of the call, so you can get your celebrity selfie without dealing with the awkwardness of asking to take a photo.</p>
<p>Experiences like Cameo Calls make sense in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, when celebrity meet-and-greets might not be safe in many places. But Cameo also thinks this product can stand in for a typical meet and greet even in &#8220;normal&#8221; times. Often, celebrity meet-and-greets require waiting in a long line to only have 5 or 10 seconds of time with the talent. Even though many Cameo Calls sessions are only a few minutes long, you might be able to get a more personal experience than if you were the 100th fan in a long in-person line.</p>
<p>“We foresee Cameo Calls replacing meet and greets at music festivals and world tours, fan conventions, sporting events, and more,&#8221; said Cameo co-founder &amp; CEO Steven Galanis.</p>
<p>Cameo says it tested this product with over 3,000 calls &#8212; talent-hosted themed meet-and-greets, coffee chats, private concerts and tarot card readings. Some performers who tested the feature include James and Oliver Phelps, who played the Weasley twins in the Harry Potter movies, and David Henrie, a former Disney Channel star.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been a heady 12-18 months for <a href="http://zoom.com">Zoom</a>, the decade-old company that experienced monster 2020 growth and more recently, a mega acquisition with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/18/zoom-buys-cloud-call-center-firm-five9-for-14-7-billion/">the $14.7 billion Five9 deal</a> in July. That addition is part of a broader strategy the company has been undertaking the last couple of years to move beyond its core video conferencing market into adjacencies like phone, meeting management and messaging, among other things. Here&#8217;s a closer look at how the plan is unfolding.</p>
<p>As the pandemic took hold in March 2020, everyone from businesses to schools to doctors and and places of worship moved online. As they did, Zoom video conferencing became central to this cultural shift and the revenue began pouring in, ushering in a period of sustained triple-digit growth for the company that only recently abated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s a big day for the Amazon of the decentralized internet &#8212; OpenSea now has an app for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1582861796">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.opensea">Android</a>. For most companies, having a mobile app is a milestone you&#8217;d reach before hitting a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/nft-market-opensea-hits-1-5-billion-valuation/">$1.5 billion valuation</a>. But like any store &#8212; whether you&#8217;re selling NFT art or not &#8212; there&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">a hefty price</a> to pay for app store transactions, whether you&#8217;re on Android or iOS. That&#8217;s possibly why OpenSea&#8217;s shiny, new app is only for browsing NFTs, not for buying or selling them. For context, OpenSea saw<a href="http://cnbc.com/2021/09/16/opensea-amid-insider-trading-controversy-rolls-out-nft-app.html"> $3.4 billion in trading volume</a> across two million transactions in August. With Apple and Google taking 30% of in-app transactions, if that volume had been traded on the new app&#8230; what&#8217;s 30% of $3.4 billion?</p>
<p>Perhaps more of a roadblock, there&#8217;s still no way to make in-app payments with crypto. If OpenSea wanted to support buying and selling, it would have to build out its infrastructure for USD payments and push more users toward it. But part of the appeal of OpenSea is that it&#8217;s a crypto-native platform, largely reliant on the Ethereum blockchain, which gives people easier access to information about when an NFT was minted, who minted it, how it&#8217;s been traded, etc. It could upset the existing ecosystem of users if the startup pushed the platform toward being more dollar-friendly.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QKt59kExL-o?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>On the OpenSea app, users can connect their profile, browse NFTs, favorite NFTs, search and filter NFTs and view collection and item stats. When you view an NFT in the app, a button appears that lets you share the NFT outside of the app. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/nft-marketplace-startup-rarible-closes-14-2-million-series-a/">Rarible</a>, another NFT marketplace, released a mobile app about a month ago. Like OpenSea&#8217;s app, on the Rarible app, you can only browse NFTs, not buy, sell or trade them.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2204523" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2204523" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2204523" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/new-ios-app.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/new-ios-app.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/new-ios-app.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/new-ios-app.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/new-ios-app.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/new-ios-app.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/new-ios-app.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2204523" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OpenSea</p></div></p>
<p>OpenSea hasn&#8217;t yet responded to questions from TechCrunch about the company&#8217;s plans for the app, including whether or not users might one day be able to buy and sell NFTs in the app. It wouldn&#8217;t be the first time that crypto was exchanged on an app, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/paypals-new-feature-allows-u-s-consumers-to-check-out-using-cryptocurrency/">even PayPal</a> now lets you pay with crypto. Instead, perhaps the app can offer a way to help new users onboard into the NFT space, giving them an easy, user-friendly way to browse NFT art without knowing anything about wallets or blockchains or apes.</p>
<p>This app was unveiled just days after an OpenSea executive was accused of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/opensea-admits-incident-as-top-exec-is-accused-of-trading-nfts-on-insider-information/"> trading NFTs on insider information</a>. The company announced on its blog Wednesday that the employee has since <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/employee-information-use-at-opensea/">resigned</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When people are uncertain, they look to others for behavioral guidance. This is called social proof, which is a physiological effect that influences your decisions every day, whether you know it or not.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.demandcurve.com/">Demand Curve</a> and through our agency <a href="https://www.bellcurve.com/">Bell Curve</a>, we&#8217;ve helped over 1,000 startups improve their ability to convert cold traffic into repeat customers. We&#8217;ve found that effectively using social proof can lead to up to 400% improvement in conversion.</p>
<p>This post shares exactly how to collect and use social proof to help grow your SaaS, e-commerce, or B2B startup.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Surprisingly, we&#8217;ve actually seen negative reviews help improve conversion rates. Why? Because they help set customer expectations.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>How businesses use social proof</h2>
<p>Have you ever stopped to check out a restaurant because it had a large line of people out front? That wasn&#8217;t by chance.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s common for restaurants to limit the size of their reception area. This forces people to wait outside, and the line signals to people walking past that the restaurant is so good it&#8217;s worth waiting for.</p>
<p>But for Internet-based businesses, social proof looks a bit different. Instead of people lining up outside your storefront, you&#8217;re going to need to create social proof that resonates with your target customers — they&#8217;ll be looking for different clues to signal whether doing business with your company is &#8220;normal&#8221; or &#8220;acceptable&#8221; behavior.</p>
<h3>Social proof for B2B</h3>
<p>People love to compare themselves to others, and this is especially true when it comes to the customers of B2B businesses. If your competitor is able to get a contract with a company that you&#8217;ve been nurturing for months, you&#8217;d be upset (and want to know how they did it).</p>
<p>Therefore, B2B social proof is most effective when you display the logos of companies you do business with. This signals to people checking out your website that other businesses trust you to deliver on your offer. The more noteworthy or respected the logos on your site, the stronger the influence will be.</p>
<h3>Social proof for SaaS</h3>
<p>Depending on the type of SaaS product or service you&#8217;re selling, you&#8217;ll either be selling to an individual or to a business. The strategy remains the same, but the channels will vary slightly.</p>
<p>The most effective way to generate social proof for SaaS products is through positive reviews from trusted sources. For consumer SaaS, that will be through influential bloggers and YouTubers speaking highly of your product. For B2B SaaS, it will be through positive ratings on review sites like G2 or Capterra. Proudly display these testimonials on your site.</p>
<h3>Social proof for e-commerce brands</h3>
<p>E-commerce brands will typically sell directly to an individual through ads, but because anyone can purchase an ad, you&#8217;re going to need to signal trust in other ways. The most common way we see e-commerce brands building social proof is by nurturing an organic social media following on Instagram or TikTok.</p>
<p>This signals to new customers that you&#8217;ve gotten the seal of approval from others like them. Having an audience also allows you to showcase user-generated content from your existing customers.</p>
<h2>How to collect social proof</h2>
<p>There are five avenues startups can tap to collect social proof:</p>
<ol>
<li>Product reviews</li>
<li>Testimonials</li>
<li>Public relations and earned media</li>
<li>Influencers</li>
<li>Social media and community</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are a few tactics we&#8217;ve used to help startups build social proof.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The final countdown to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> is on, folks and we cannot be more excited to get this party started. In a just a few days — on September 21-23 — we spotlight the people who envision the future and push beyond what exists to create what will be.</p>
<p>It may sound high falutin’, but when you’re talking biotech, synthetic DNA and space entrepreneurs, we can make room for a little poetic license, amirite?</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the deal:</strong> TC Disrupt 2021 is packed with experts, events, advice and opportunity. If you want to get amongst it, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">buy a pass before Monday for</a> less than $100.</p>
<p>You know about the big marquee events, right? Iconic founders on the main stage — like Duo Lingo CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/discover-how-duolingo-started-with-ceo-luis-von-ahn-at-disrupt-2021/">Luis von Ahn</a> and celebrity-slash-entrepreneur <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/seth-rogen-is-coming-to-techcrunch-disrupt-to-talk-about-the-weed-business/">Seth Rogen</a>. Always a huge draw, Startup Battlefield features 20 top early-stage founders pitching their hearts out for $100,000.</p>
<p>All of it’s awesome (not-so-humble brag), but we want to make sure you know about some of the other Disrupt happenings that can help you build your business — and have some fun while you’re at it. Ready? Let’s begin.</p>
<p>Jump start your networking at our 30-minute <strong>Meet-and-Greet Sessions</strong> on Monday September 21 — the day before Disrupt officially begins. Choose from a series of 10 sessions — 30-minutes long, each with a specific demographic focus — scheduled to take place on our CrunchMatch platform between 12:30 pm – 5:30 pm (PT).</p>
<p>Download your <strong>Disrupt Passport</strong> card, complete one row of five experiences at Disrupt — meet a sponsor, attend a breakout session, etc. — and submit your card with proof of participation for a chance to win one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/stamp-your-passport-to-disrupt-for-a-chance-to-win-these-prizes/">three certifiably cool prizes</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tune in to one of the many <strong>Startup Alley Crawls</strong> to meet and learn more about the early-stage founders exhibiting in Startup Alley. Each business category gets its own hour-long crawl, and Team TechCrunch will interview select startups in each category live from the main stage.</p>
<p>Go to one (or all) of the many <strong>Startup Pitch Feedback Sessions</strong> scheduled over the three days of Disrupt. Every Startup Alley exhibitor gets to pitch to a savvy TC staffer. You can learn a lot by watching other founders pitch and hearing experienced advice. You might just walk away with ideas to improve your own elevator pitch. Oh, and check out the presentation called <strong>Crafting a Pitch Deck that Can’t Be Ignored</strong> for tips on bullet-proofing your pitch deck.</p>
<p>Confused about crypto? Muddled over metaverse? Serious about SPAC? You’ll find sessions addressing all of these deep topics — along with more than 80 other presentations and breakout sessions spanning all tech sectors — in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">Disrupt 2021 agenda</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> takes place September 21-23 — mere days away. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">Buy your pass</a>, explore the events, learn about new trends and technologies and discover opportunities to help you envision and build your future.</p>
