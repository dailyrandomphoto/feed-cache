										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A federal judge has ruled that Apple can&#8217;t push back the deadline to update App Store policies, as previously ordered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">in the court&#8217;s decision</a> on California&#8217;s Epic Games v. Apple lawsuit. Though Apple largely won that lawsuit when the judge declared that Apple was not acting as a monopolist as Epic Games had alleged, the court sided with the Fortnite maker on the matter of Apple&#8217;s anti-steering policies regarding restrictions on in-app purchases. The court&#8217;s original ruling stated that Apple would no longer be allowed to prohibit developers from pointing to other means of payment besides Apple&#8217;s own payment systems, but Apple wanted that decision put on hold until its appeals case was decided &#8212; a delay that would have effectively pushed back the App Store changes by a matter of years.</p>
<p>Specifically, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">September 10, 2021 ruling</a> issued by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on the Epic Games antitrust case had ordered Apple to no longer stop developers from:</p>
<blockquote><p><em> &#8220;&#8230;including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231630" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The court also said Apple couldn&#8217;t prevent developers from communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through their account registration within the app.</p>
<p>Apple in October <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/apple-updates-its-app-store-guidelines-to-permit-developers-to-contact-customers-about-other-payment-methods/">officially updated its App Store rules</a> to address developers&#8217; ability to communicate with their users, as that change was also a part of its settlement with a group of U.S. developers in a class-action lawsuit over the same matter. However, upon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">its appeal of the Epic Games lawsuit</a>, Apple asked for a stay on the injunction Judge Gonzalez Rogers had put into place which would open up the App Store to non-Apple payment systems.</p>
<p>Per the ruling, the required App Store policy changes had an early December deadline, as the judge ordered the injunction to be implemented within 90 days of the September 10 ruling. That meant, if Apple wasn&#8217;t granted this stay on the injunction, it would have to permit developers to point to alternative means of payment inside their iOS apps.</p>
<p>During a November 9 hearing to hear arguments both for and against the stay, Apple&#8217;s legal counsel argued that the changes Apple was being forced to implement would &#8220;upset the platform.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;They will harm consumers. They will harm developers. That is the fact. It is going to happen,&#8221; said Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher partner Mark Perry, a lead lawyer for Apple on the Epic Games case. He reiterated Apple&#8217;s position that allowing links inside apps could introduce security and privacy risks into the iOS ecosystem.</p>
<p>Epic Games&#8217; counsel, Gary Bornstein, pointed out that Apple said during the trial that its first-party payments platform competed with web payments. It can&#8217;t turn around and now say that raising consumer awareness about this competitive alternative would now cause &#8220;irreparable harm.&#8221; He added, too, that Apple shouldn&#8217;t be left to sort out the changes on its own as, so far, many of the steps Apple has taken to open up the App Store were in response to either class action lawsuits or legislative and regulatory developments. Apple disagreed, pointing to other pro-consumer changes it has made, like the App Store privacy labels.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the judge ruled today that Apple failed to successfully argue its case for a stay and denied the motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;In short, Apple’s motion is based on a selective reading of this Court’s findings and ignores all of the findings which supported the injunction, namely incipient antitrust conduct including supercompetitive commission rates resulting in extraordinarily high operating margins and which have not been correlated to the value of its intellectual property,&#8221; wrote Judge Gonzalez Rogers. &#8220;This incipient antitrust conduct is the result, in part, of the anti-steering policies which Apple has enforced to harm competition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Apple said it intends to try again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple believes no additional business changes should be required to take effect until all appeals in this case are resolved. We intend to ask the Ninth Circuit for a stay based on these circumstances,&#8221; an Apple spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Epic Games didn&#8217;t have any immediate comment.</p>
<p>The court&#8217;s decision, if upheld, could have a significant impact on the App Store&#8217;s business model, as developers looking to skirt Apple&#8217;s commissions would be able to point their users to other payment methods when the policy is updated. The fallout from the decision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business">could cost</a> the company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-10/apple-stands-to-lose-a-few-billion-dollars-annually-from-ruling?sref=gni836kR">billions</a>, depending on how many developers take up the opportunity and how many consumers decide to pay outside the App Store.</p>
<p>Already, some in the market were moving forward to capitalize on that potential change before the policy had been officially revised.</p>
<p>For example, Paddle, a solutions provider for subscription businesses, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/in-hopes-of-app-store-changes-paddle-develops-an-alternative-to-apples-payments-system/">announced</a> rather prematurely it would introduce a new in-app purchasing system aimed at iOS developers that would allow a drop-in replacement to Apple’s own payments system as soon as the injunction went into effect. Facebook, meanwhile, just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/facebook-apple-subscription-fees-custom-links/">rolled out a system for direct creator payments</a> bypassing the App Store. This system was technically permitted because Facebook isn&#8217;t taking a cut of creator revenues for the time being. But with a decision that permits other payment mechanisms, that system could change in the future opening up a new revenue stream for the social network.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how exactly Apple will rewrite its rules to comply with the court&#8217;s decision if it&#8217;s not able to convince the court to grant its motion. When South Korea <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">issued a new law</a> also requiring app stores to allow for other payment mechanisms, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/facebook-apple-subscription-fees-custom-links/">Google complied</a> but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-targets-apple-over-new-app-store-regulation-2021-10-15/">Apple said</a> its current policies were in compliance due to how the law was written.</p>
<p>The court reminded Apple it had 90 days to comply with the injunction per the original ruling and still has approximately 30 days before it goes into effect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric automaker Rivian <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has priced its initial public offering at $78 a share, pushing it far above its targeted share price as investors dove in the year&#8217;s most highly anticipated IPO.</span></p>
<p>The regulatory filing was <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521324915/d439957ds1mef.htm">posted late Friday evening</a>.</p>
<p>The company, which is backed by Amazon, said in a filing earlier this month that it planned to offer 135 million shares at a price between $57 and $62. Underwriters also had an option to buy up to 20.25 million additional shares. It then upped the range to between $72 and $74 due to investor interest in company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231786" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The IPO sale raised $10.5 billion. The sale values Rivian at $66.5 billion. However, Rivian&#8217;s market cap could hit $68.1 billion if underwriters exercise those options.</p>
<p>On a fully dilated basis, that places Rivian&#8217;s valuation at more than $77 billion.</p>
<p>Rivian filed October 1 to become a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/rivians-ipo-filing-is-now-public/">publicly traded company</a> in the United States. The S-1 document did not disclose the targeted share price at the time. An amended document filed Monday provided the new information, which included interest from repeat backer Amazon and newcomer Blackstone in Rivian.</p>
<p>Amazon, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Coatue Management, Franklin Templeton, Capital Research Global Investors, D1 Capital Partners LP, Third Point LLC, funds affiliated with Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, Dragoneer Investment Group LLC and certain entities affiliated with Soros Fund Management LLC have indicated an interest in buying up to $5 billion of shares of Class A common stock.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A recent filing by Amazon shows the e-commerce giant already holds more than a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/amazon-reveals-20-stake-in-rivian-ahead-of-ev-makers-ipo/">20% stake in Rivian</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beating the street and its own guidance, Zynga reported record third-quarter revenue of $705 million, up 40% from the same period last year and reaching its largest mobile audience ever of 183 million monthly active users, up 120% year over year.</p>
<p>Despite warning in the second quarter of a material impact from Apple’s privacy policy changes that caused a dramatic 30% sell off in its stock from August 5 through November 4, Zynga’s share price jumped today on news that it had better than expected user-acquisition performance and is back on track to finish the year strong.</p>

<p>TechCrunch spoke with Zynga CEO Frank Gibeau on how the mobile game giant has been able to navigate the advertising crisis while making moves to expand cross-platform and onto the blockchain.</p>
<h2>Weathering the storm<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>On <a href="https://qz.com/1997873/apples-idfa-privacy-update-threatens-to-upend-the-ad-industry/">April 26</a>, when Apple changed its IDFA (Identifier For Advertisers) and required developers to use its ATT (App Tracking Transparency) tool to allow users to opt out of being tracked across iOS apps, it shook the mobile ad ecosystem. New users gained during the lockdown dropped off in droves as pandemic restrictions lifted but as targeting became more difficult, acquisition costs soared. Companies began to report a <a href="https://www.consumeracquisition.com/idfa-impact-q2-earnings-reports">15%-20% hit to revenue</a> according to marketing firm Consumer Acquisition. Among those most affected were ad platforms like <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/snap-snapchat-q3-2021-stock-drop-1235094751/">Snapchat</a>, advertisers like <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1456369493890850818?s=20">Peloton</a> and Zynga, which is both an ad platform and advertiser.</p>
<p>“The midpoint of this year was tough,” Gibeau told TechCrunch. “We were one of the first ones out of the chute with the combination of IDFA and the great reopening demand issues. To navigate, we pulled back on our ad spend and began to experiment with new tools and techniques, and by September, we started to see yields come back to normal.”</p>
<p>Gibeau said they waited to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/zynga-farmville-3-launches/">FarmVille 3</a> until growth rates returned, and he was excited to see the game shoot to the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the top free iPad and iPhone app store, respectively, after its November 4 launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I’m happy to report that we feel the worst is behind us and we are scaling up our spending for new games as we head into the fourth quarter. The key to navigating this period has been how we use our first-party data with the Chartboost platform,” he said, referencing the ad network Zynga acquired earlier this year.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of data about what happens when players come into our games, the events they play and what advertisers are doing in our existing supply. First-party data allows us to build models that make predictions about the types of returns or auctions that would be beneficial to us,” he said.</p>
<p>Zynga is also partnering with Unity, Google and Iron Source, among others, to find ways to better target players.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of smart people attacking this problem. It’s more a function of time than there’s not going to be a solution,” he said. “Over the long term, Apple is building a capable platform to support a healthy advertising market while protecting player privacy, and we’re happy to work with them on this,” he said.</p>
<h2>Rocking hypercasual</h2>
<p>Although 80% of Zynga’s business is subscriptions and microtransactions from in-app purchases, a fifth of the company’s revenue is from advertising, a fast-growing segment being driven by the popularity of hypercasual games, which are games with simple interfaces that can typically be played in fewer than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, Zynga nearly doubled its advertising revenue over the prior-year period, said Gibeau, attributing its success to Rollic, an Istanbul-based game studio that Zynga <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/zynga-completes-rollic-acquistion/">acquired a year ago</a> that helped it become a top-three publisher in the category.</p>
<p>“If you look at the number of installs on the app stores, hypercausal is the largest category. These are very inexpensive games that reach massive audiences and utilize advertising as its primary means of monetization. It’s a very lucrative place for us to be and a great feeder of users into our network that ties into our ambitions to create an at-scale publishing and advertising platform that will be a growth driver for us into 2022 and beyond,” said Gibeau.</p>
<h2>All roads lead to the metaverse</h2>
<p>Zynga’s next big game release is <a href="https://www.starwars.com/games-apps/star-wars-hunters">Star Wars: Hunters</a>, which is soft launching on Android in select markets next week and testing on iOS and Switch in the New Year, Gibeau said. It’s the company’s first cross-platform game on console and FarmVille 3 was its first cross-platform launch on macOS.</p>
<p>Gibeau explained his interest in making Zynga’s mobile games playable on other platforms.</p>
<p>“FarmVille fans and Star Wars fans are everywhere, so it really behooves us to be platform agnostic and make our experience available as many places as possible,” he said. “At the end of the day, we’re a social game company that believes it’s more fun to play games together than by yourself. So as part of our culture, we like to innovate and try new things.”</p>
<p>Since 2020, Zynga has had games on <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/11/snap-hits-100-million-players-teams-with-zynga-and-launches-more-chat-games/">Snapchat</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/zynga-to-put-words-with-friends-style-game-on-google-nest-devices-in-bid-to-lure-nongamers">Google Nest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/amazon-and-zynga-partner-on-word-pop-a-words-with-friends-spinoff-created-for-alexa/">Amazon Alexa,</a> and just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/tiktok-ventures-into-mobile-gaming-initially-in-partnership-with-zynga/">released its first game on TikTok called Disco Loco 3D</a>, which is a free-to-play music and dance challenge.</p>

<p>“In gaming you can get caught out if you miss the next platform. If you get that wrong, it can be pretty painful. So we thought it would be cool to develop experiences on these social platforms to see if there’s any interest. With Snapchat, we partnered with them to help them figure out how to make gaming more a part of their ecosystem, and we’re seeing some good results — but it’s early days,” said Gibeau emphasizing that these games are intended to be proof of concept more than revenue generators.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/let-the-games-begin-a-new-way-to-experience-entertainment-on-mobile">Netflix Gaming</a> having launched on November 2 with former Zynga chief creative officer Mike Verdu at the helm, Gibeau said, “For Netflix, there’s a lot to learn in terms of how they want to approach the subscriptions end of the business and how their users interact with the games, so I don’t know if they’re ready yet for third-party content, but it would be great to talk with them at some point in the future.”</p>
<p>He added, “Whether it’s Netflix or Roblox or Epic or Valve, if they have a platform and it makes sense for our content to be there and reach an audience, we’ll definitely investigate it.”</p>
<p>But perhaps Zynga’s biggest venture ahead lies with the hire of former EA executive Matt Wolf to head up its new blockchain gaming division. As the NFT craze sweeps the gaming industry, blockchain startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/studio-behind-early-access-crypto-game-blankos-block-party-banks-monster-1-25b-valuation-from-a16z/">Mythical Games</a>, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/05/20/forte-raises-185m-at-1b-valuation-for-blockchain-game-platform/">Animoca and Forte</a> have reached billion-dollar valuations in the past few months to help developers create permanent collectible items that can be used across games.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of capital and talent heading into the space,” said Gibeau, explaining the timing of the decision. “Our founder and chair, Mark Pincus, and longtime board member, Bing Gordon, are very hot on the sector and we believe that blockchain is going to be part of the fabric of gaming long term.”</p>
<p>Gibeau said Wolf is setting up a skunkworks project to identify the best path forward and will be looking at things like how owning a farm in the FarmVille franchise could drive greater engagement and retention.</p>
<p>“We plan to move at Zynga speed so you should start to see some things from us in the coming months,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://mevo.com/pages/mevo-camera" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mevo Start 3-pack with the Mevo Multicam App</a> three-camera kit costs $999. Add some good lights and a half-decent microphone, and you have a full multi-cam streaming setup for less than $2,000. That would have been completely unthinkable just a few years ago, and let&#8217;s just take a minute to consider how absolutely astonishing how far we have come. Add a rock-solid internet connection, and you have essentially replicated the core functionality of a satellite van full of equipment costing two orders of magnitude more than this kit.</p>
<p>Could a professional broadcast news crew use a Mevo Start kit? No &#8212; you would need higher reliability, better redundancy and equipment facing the needs of a live news reporter. But if you come at the same problem from another angle, things start to make a lot more sense.</p>
<p>What if you are a YouTube streamer who wants to up your game? Perhaps you have been using a collection of web cameras and <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OBS</a> to run your livestreaming, and you just want a setup that is easier to disassemble and re-assemble. Maybe you are a music streamer on Twitch. You&#8217;ve done a couple of streams with your band, and you are keen to up your game with multi-camera livestreaming. Or perhaps you want to start livestreaming events that happen in various venues. In that context, Mevo Start 3-pack suddenly seems to seem like an absolute bargain. Best of all, once you get it set up the first time, it is very quick to set up and re-assemble.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231329" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s the theory, at least. Taking a step back, the question becomes whether it works this well in practice.</p>
<p>Every now and again, a tech reviewer is facing an impossible task: How do you review a product that wasn&#8217;t made for you, and how do you give meaningful input on whether that product is fit for the audience it was designed for? Mevo Start 3-pack with the Mevo Multicam App from <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/creators/products-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logitech for Creators</a> is precisely one of those products. I&#8217;m not a Twitch, YouTube or Facebook streamer &#8212; but on the other hand, I do have a journalism degree with a focus on broadcast journalism, and I fondly remember being trained as a news anchor and live television reporter. I was on the live link unit (i.e. the satellite van) for BBC News for a hot minute. I used to be a TV producer.</p>
<p>The problem is, when you have extensive experience in professional aspects of an industry, you approach a product with different expectations. When I was at the BBC, if the signal to the satellite dropped for even a fraction of a second in the middle of a live broadcast, you wouldn&#8217;t believe the level of stress in the RxTx (receiving and transmissions) center back at the newsroom. But, put simply, this kit isn&#8217;t designed to replace a small truck&#8217;s worth of equipment meant to broadcast breaking news to millions of people. It&#8217;s meant to make life easier for YouTube streamers.</p>

It is an excellent and elegant way to do multi-camera streaming. <strong>Photo:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On paper, the product looks like a very, very good idea &#8212; but that isn&#8217;t the same as saying that Mevo Start is perfect &#8212; it was clearly designed by people who haven&#8217;t spent a lot of time in dark clubs setting up camera equipment, and it&#8217;s obvious to me that the product team never had to set up and dismantle the kit 30 times in rapid succession. If they had, they&#8217;d have made some subtly different decisions that can have a disproportionate effect on the final product.</p>
<p>One truly stupid decision, for example, is the power button on the cameras. It is completely flush with the body, and while it is rubberized, it doesn&#8217;t have a divot on the button, or any way to find it by touch. To make matters worse, the button is matte black against a matte black camera body. Try to find that in the dark while trying to set up the cameras between two sets of musicians. To be fair to Mevo, this is often the case with the product design: It is designed in CAD packages and tested out in a brightly lit hardware lab, and only too late does someone think to set it up in the various use cases in which users might use the cameras.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231537" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231537" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2231537 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1366" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04937.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231537" class="wp-caption-text">The back of the camera includes a USB-C port for power, a MicroSD card slot for local recording, a microphone input and an almost-impossible-to-find-in-the-dark power button. <strong>Photo:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Sorry to harp on about one design feature, but given it is literally the only button on the camera, it seems important. One thing I love about the power button is that it is pretty hard to press in &#8212; you have to use quite a bit of force to actuate it. That is great: It is hard to press the button by accident, and accidents are the last thing you want during a livestream. What is less great is that when you are setting something up for a livestream in a hurry, you&#8217;re going to have your hands full &#8212; I found myself needing to turn the cameras on and off with one hand regularly because I had a microphone or another piece of equipment in the other hand. That means that when you are pressing the power button on the camera, the only way to get real leverage is to hold the camera in place on the opposite side of the camera, at the same height as the power button. Unfortunately, that means that the only natural way to press the power button is to also grab the lens for leverage. I probably don&#8217;t have to spell this out, but I will anyway &#8212; the lens is literally the only part of the camera that would benefit from not having greasy fingerprints on it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231539" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231539" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2231539 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1366" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04946.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231539" class="wp-caption-text">The only way to turn the camera on and off with one hand is to hold the camera like this. My fingers are pressing the button &#8212; but look at where my thumb goes. The very next thing you need to do is clear the thumbprints off your lens. Why?! <strong>Photo:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Camera button aside, the cameras have a bunch of super-smart design features as well. There&#8217;s a small light hood to shield the dome-shaped lens from stray light, which hugely helps reducing light flares. The tripod thread can be taken out of the bottom of the camera, turning it into a much larger thread so you can fit it on a microphone or light stand. The light LED on the front of the camera uses a green LED to show which of the cameras are ready to go live &#8212; and a red one that shows which camera actually <em>is</em> live. The cameras have built-in batteries that drastically simplify the setup; you don&#8217;t need a power source to start streaming &#8212; great for on-the-go live broadcasts. All of these things are very well-thought-through features.</p>
<p>Getting the camera set up was profoundly frustrating. Straight out of the box, all three cameras needed firmware upgrades. It&#8217;s possible that this is an effect of me using an Android phone, and that the iOS version of the app is more mature, but the process ended up taking several hours of indecipherable error messages. I was finally able to get things to work, but that involved me having to restart my phone six times &#8212; once to get it to connect to each camera in the first place, then once to recover from a failed firmware upgrade.</p>
<p>I reached out to Mevo&#8217;s press team when I ran into these firmware issues. They offered to put me in touch with the development team to get me up and running. I thought about it, but decided to decline their offer. As a hardware reviewer, I get the benefit of being able to get on the phone with someone who helped build the product, but as a consumer, it&#8217;s often a very different experience.</p>
<p>If I had bought these cameras for my own use, at this point I would have returned them to Mevo: In my many years as a hardware reviewer, I have never tested out a product where I needed to restart my phone six times before I was even able to start the review process. I gave up for a few days, and when I finally was ready to put the cameras through their paces in earnest, there was another set of firmware upgrades. This time, I got through the process pretty smoothly, but having to update the camera firmware twice in a few weeks isn&#8217;t exactly encouraging.</p>
<p>The core problem is one of trust. There are a lot of products where it doesn&#8217;t matter if you have to try something twice or even three times. If you try to change the temperature on your Nest thermostat, and it doesn&#8217;t take the first time, that&#8217;s kind of okay. You try again, it works. You shrug it off. Livestreaming is not like turning on the air conditioner &#8212; when you have a couple of thousand people watching a live gig, stress levels are running high, and even the smallest technical issues can cause tremendous amounts of stress. My context for this is a live satellite link with potentially millions of viewers and a live television news broadcast getting ruined by the newsroom not getting a live report from the field. Perhaps other livestreamers are more Zen about technical issues than I am.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231540" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231540" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2231540 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1366" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04948.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231540" class="wp-caption-text">One extremely welcome design touch is the removable inserts. Without the insert, it fits on a microphone stand. The insert is double threaded: one side is the size of a light stand and the other side has a tripod-size thread. Very clever indeed. Also worth noting that the cameras get fingerprint marks on them very easily &#8212; not great for product photography, but not an issue when you are using the cameras. <strong>Photo:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Once I was able to get the product set up fully, it had a chance to shine. The Mevo apps powering the cameras are outstanding. The multi-camera app lets you prepare a shot from one camera and fade between cameras. You can zoom in, use overlays and even configure digital panning movements. For what is, at its core, a pretty simple setup, you can create extraordinarily powerful results.</p>
<p>Despite my frustrated rage with the setup process, the Mevo cameras deserve a break: I tested the cameras in a number of different contexts, and they never let me down once. No hiccups, no buffering, no delays, no disconnections.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231535" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231535" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2231535 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1366" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04925.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231535" class="wp-caption-text">Multi-camera streaming is perfect for creative pursuits, live music and live-action events. Mevo represents incredible value in a small package. <strong>Photo:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The problem was that I was never fully able to trust the cameras, and as a result, I would probably never use them for a livestream I care about. Would I set up a three-camera setup and do a livestream of my foster kittens playing? Absolutely, and that would be both worth watching and beyond adorable. Would I use it to livestream a friend playing a concert at a local bar to his dozens of livestreaming fans? Probably not &#8212; my stress level would be too high, and I would need to do many hours of streaming without any problems before I would even start to trust the cameras enough to rely on them for anything important.</p>
<p>And herein lies the conundrum. Livestreaming is so high-stakes and stressful that it&#8217;s crucial that you feel that you can trust your equipment. Part of building that trust is the first-use experience with a product, and Mevo&#8217;s cameras were some of the worst devices I have ever reviewed in that respect. But the flip side is also true: The life of a reviewer is that you see devices with their first versions of the firmware, and with software that was maybe not <em>quite</em> ready for prime time yet. I am willing to accept that Mevo might be able to sort out the problems I found in my review and that three or six months from now, the cameras will be great.</p>
<p>O<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">n paper and in theory, at least, they could be a cost-effective and near-perfect solution for livestreamers who want to dip their toes in the multi-cam world. I would have to revisit the product in a few months to know whether or not to recommend it. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle startup Workhorse Group is hemorrhaging money. During the company&#8217;s third-quarter earnings call, Workhorse reported an <a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_2602c9bad137b59411e9819ecc4d09aa/workhorse/news/2021-11-09_Workhorse_Group_Reports_Third_Quarter_2021_185.pdf">$81 million loss</a>, blaming an increase in operating costs and a suspension of production due to recalls. Revenue is also in the negative to the tune of $576,600, which is largely related to refunds issued to customers who had their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/workhorse-group-suspends-deliveries-recalls-c-1000-electric-delivery-van/">C-1000 cargo delivery vans recalled</a> due to safety issues.</p>
<p>Workhorse sold 41 vans this year before it had finished ensuring the design was in compliance with federal safety standards set by the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA). The company was forced to suspend sales in order to complete testing, recall all of the vehicles and slow production to two trucks per week.</p>
<p>Workhorse CEO Rick Dauch admitted on Tuesday that, aside from federal safety issues, the C-1000 just might not be up to the task of heavy duty deliveries. The company is performing additional testing of the current truck design, which Dauch said is presently &#8220;not robust nor is it profitable.&#8221; What&#8217;s more likely to happen is that Workhorse will scrap it and reconfigure the van&#8217;s design altogether, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616733/workhorse-c1000-electric-van-truck-redesign-wkhs-usps">something the company said it might do back in August</a>. Workhorse said it expects to provide a production forecast early next year, even going so far as to promise delivery of &#8220;best-in-class vehicles for the commercial electric vehicle market starting in 2023.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231702" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That might be hard to do without raising more money from investors who are likely wary of empty promises. Dauch took the helm of Workhorse in July when the company was chaotically trying to ship its non-compliant vehicles that were built with parts bought via online auctions from Asia. Dauch acknowledged that he inherited a company plagued by poor leadership and a lack of communication, with a cash burn rate that was not only unsustainable, but also downright detrimental. Workhorse&#8217;s supply chain was, and remains, not yet Tier 1 qualified and it lacks a range of systems for production, which in all fairness is common for a startup, says Dauch.</p>
<p>Workhorse is also currently under investigation by both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, the company said in a regulatory filing on Monday. The SEC probe is related to trading in the company&#8217;s securities before the award of a United States Postal Service contract to build the agency&#8217;s next-generation mail truck — Workhorse ended up not winning that bid, which caused its shares to plummet. The Justice Department&#8217;s investigation is &#8220;related&#8221; to the SEC probe, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/business/energy-environment/workhorse-electric-vehicle-earnings.html">according to the New York Times</a>.</p>
<p id="sDpV9v">Despite powerful headwinds, Dauch thinks Workhorse is still poised for success in large part due to macroeconomic trends and regulatory factors that are driving future growth. The pandemic only solidified the importance in e-commerce that the entire world is experiencing. With tightening government emissions regulations and the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/28/politics/infrastructure-bill-explained/index.html">passing of the U.S. infrastructure bill</a>, the need for electric delivery vans will only grow. No one has yet cornered this market, so Workhorse thinks it still has time to get itself together and take a slice of that pie.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have near-term financial flexibility based on our improved balance sheet and reduced monthly cash consumption rate,&#8221; said Dauch during the conference call, also noting Workhorse&#8217;s &#8220;solid purchase orders&#8221; and &#8220;strong customer support.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the third quarter of 2021, Workhorse&#8217;s selling, general and administrative expenses — which include &#8220;higher compensation-related costs due to increased headcount, severance pay, stock-based compensation, legal costs and insurance costs&#8221; — increased to $10.6 million compared to $6 million in the same period last year.</p>
<p>In June, Workhorse filed suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the USPS for awarding its contract to defense contractor Oshkosh Defense. Workhorse had been fighting for this coveted spot since 2015. The startup dropped the lawsuit in September, probably after it had a look at its balance sheet and realized it couldn&#8217;t afford to take USPS to court. Indeed, during the earnings call, Workhorse CFO Greg Ackerson pointed to dropping the lawsuit as one of the key actions taken to reduce spending.</p>
<p>Workhorse also converted $172.5 million of debt into equity, slowed inbound material, eliminated air freight and reduced consulting by adding in-house expertise, according to Ackerson. That said, the startup&#8217;s R&amp;D expenses increased to $2.8 million compared to $1.6 million in Q3 of 2020, which was related mainly to increased headcount and higher consulting costs. Presumably, Workhorse needs to spend a little more on talent in order to get a functioning, and safe, electric van that&#8217;s ready for production before the company loses its &#8220;loyal&#8221; customer base.</p>
<div class="css-53u6y8">
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Workhorse’s stock was down 3.6% at the close on Tuesday afternoon and trading at $6.64. Shares have fallen more than 80% since February.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced today that it will no longer allow advertisers to target users based on potentially &#8220;sensitive&#8221; topics like health, sexual orientation, or religious and political beliefs. &#8220;Lung cancer awareness,&#8221; &#8220;LGBT culture&#8221; and &#8220;Jewish holidays&#8221; are just some of the interest categories that will no longer be targeted starting early next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decision to remove these Detailed Targeting options was not easy and we know this change may negatively impact some businesses and organizations,&#8221; the company wrote in a blog post, saying input from civil rights experts, policymakers and other stakeholders contributed to its decision. Advertising revenue is Facebook&#8217;s leading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebook-reports-revenue-miss-plans-to-break-out-ar-vr-top-lines/">source of income</a>, so any major change to ad policy can have significant ramifications.</p>
<p>Facebook can target users based on information provided in their profile, like their age, location or gender. But the platform never made it possible to target people based on the sexual orientation listed in their profile, a representative from the company told TechCrunch. Rather, the advertising that will be removed refers to ads that are served based on your profile&#8217;s interest categories.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231629" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Facebook assigns these interest categories to your profile based on your activity. Based on how you engage with Facebook content, you might be assigned categories that Facebook would call &#8220;sensitive,&#8221; like &#8220;American Jewish culture,&#8221; &#8220;LGBT rights&#8221; or &#8220;Barack Obama.&#8221; Starting January 19, advertisers will no longer be able to target their ads based on interests like these. Other interest groups like &#8220;rock climbing&#8221; and &#8220;knitting,&#8221; not being sensitive, will still be targetable &#8212; there are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/technology/meta-facebook-ad-targeting.html">tens of thousands</a> of these categories, sensitive or not.</p>
<p>Users can see their profile&#8217;s interest groups by navigating on desktop to Settings and Privacy &gt; Settings &gt; Ads &gt; Ad Settings &gt; Categories used to reach you &gt; Interest Categories. If you don&#8217;t want to receive ads based on a certain interest, you can opt out.</p>
<p>This change in ad policy comes as Meta &#8212; the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">newly renamed</a> parent company to the Facebook platform &#8212; faces increased scrutiny after a series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">senate hearings</a> related to documents leaked by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">whistleblower</a> Frances Haugen. As more documents are leaked to the press, Meta has gone on the defensive, claiming that some journalists&#8217; reporting has <a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1450154004730707972">misrepresented</a> its actions.</p>
<p>But Facebook&#8217;s ad policy has been a topic of concern for years. Leading up to the U.S. presidential election in 2020, Facebook placed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/facebook-to-block-new-political-ads-1-week-before-nov-3-adds-more-tools-and-rules-for-fair-elections/">limitations</a> on the kinds of political ads that could be created. In 2018, Facebook conducted a similar removal of over 5,000 targeting options for ads after the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) filed a <a href="https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_18_085">complaint</a> against Facebook that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/19/hud-complaint-accuses-facebook-ads-of-violating-fair-housing-act/">accused it of helping</a> landlords and home sellers violate the Fair Housing Act. Before that, in 2016, Facebook disabled &#8220;ethnic affinity&#8221; targeting for housing, employment and credit-related ads after <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a ProPublica report</a> suggested that these capabilities could be used for discriminatory advertising. When it comes to housing and employment, it&#8217;s illegal to target ads based on certain demographics. Another <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters">report from ProPublica</a> spurred Facebook to remove ad targeting based on anti-Semitic interest categories.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We want to better match people’s evolving expectations of how advertisers may reach them on our platform and address feedback from civil rights experts, policymakers and other stakeholders on the importance of preventing advertisers from abusing the targeting options we make available,&#8221; the company wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/removing-certain-ad-targeting-options-and-expanding-our-ad-controls">blog post</a>. &#8220;The decision to remove these Detailed Targeting options was not easy and we know this change may negatively impact some businesses and organizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Facebook said it made these decisions based on concerns about how data could be abused by bad actors, there are instances in which this data could be used in a potentially positive way, which worried some stakeholders. For example, if someone was interested in &#8220;Diabetes awareness,&#8221; they could be connected with nonprofits working to treat the condition.</p>
<p>Still, Facebook offers businesses a number of tools to access a specific audience. If users are opted into ad tracking on an iPhone, for example, Facebook advertisers can use that information for ad targeting. Businesses can also leverage <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1090330204367211?id=2469097953376494&amp;helpref=search&amp;sr=1&amp;query=ENGAGEMENT%20CUSTOM%20AUDIENCES">engagement custom audiences</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531?id=401668390442328&amp;helpref=search&amp;sr=4&amp;query=lookalike%20audiences">lookalike audiences</a> and other techniques for reaching users, as the company outlines in its blog post.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Wolt represents DoorDash’s sixth acquisition and its second in 2021.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand delivery giant DoorDash announced Tuesday it was acquiring food delivery company Wolt in an all-stock deal valued at €7 billion, or $8.1 billion.</p>
<p>Talking about the acquisition, Tony Xu, co-founder and CEO of DoorDash said in a statement that the move “will accelerate our product development, bring greater focus to each of our markets and improve the value we provide to consumers, merchants, as well as Dashers and couriers around the world.”</p>
<p>Finland-based Wolt was founded in 2014 by Miki Kuusi, who, upon the deal closing, will run DoorDash International and report to Xu. The company has over 4,000 employees across 23 countries and its technology enables users to easily discover and receive food via its platform by selecting a restaurant, placing the order and hitting send.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231738" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Wolt has raised over $850 million to date, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wolt/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to its Crunchbase profile</a>. Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/wolt-closes-530m-round-to-continue-expanding-beyond-restaurant-delivery/">most recent funding round was $530 million</a> in January, led by Iconiq Growth, with participation from Tiger Global, DST, KKR, Prosus, EQT Growth and Coatue.</p>
<p>Wolt represents DoorDash’s sixth acquisition <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/doordash/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Crunchbase data</a> and its second in 2021, which includes an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/doordash-acquires-salad-making-robotics-startup-chowbotics/">acquisition of Chowbotics</a> earlier this year. The latest transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>DoorDash was one of the benefactors of the global pandemic, <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/280253921/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/DASH-Q2-2021-Letter-to-Shareholders_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managing to set records</a> for orders and the value of those orders as reported in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/airbnb-doordash-report-earnings-as-covid-threatens-to-slow-the-irl-economy-again/">second-quarter earnings</a> for the three-month period ending June 30. However, the company was unprofitable overall with a net loss of $102 million for the quarter.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello friends! Welcome to Daily Crunch for November 9, 2021. Today we have lots of good news and some bad news. The good? Another startup is taking on the incumbent web search provider, and we’re seeing more funds in more places raise bigger investing vehicles. The bad? Well, it depends on whether or not you are a Robinhood user. — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/robinhood-data-breach/"><strong>Robinhood’s data breach steals from the user and gives to the hacker:</strong></a><strong> </strong>A social-engineering hack led to Robinhood’s internal tools being accessed by an external party. Per TechCrunch reporting, “more than 5 million customer email addresses and 2 million customer names taken, as well as a much smaller set of more specific customer data.” For a company that recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/robinhoods-nasty-quarter-shows-the-ups-downs-of-trading-incomes/">posted somewhat lackluster earnings</a>, it’s not a great look.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/you-com-lands-20m-series-a-to-reimagine-the-search-engine/"><strong>You.com wants to take on Google:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The list of startups taking on Google search is starting to get somewhat lengthy. <a href="https://brave.com/search/">Brave</a> is at it. So is <a href="https://neeva.com/">Neeva</a>. <a href="http://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> has <em>been</em> working on the matter. And now You.com has $20 million to help with its search service, which, I found today while testing it, has a somewhat radical interface on display.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/twitter-blue-launches-in-the-u-s-and-new-zealand-with-expanded-feature-set/"><strong>Twitter gets the blues:</strong></a><strong> </strong>But it’s pretty happy about it. Why? Because Twitter’s subscriber service, Blue, is now out in more markets. This led to a wave of folks signing up and playing around with the service, at least on my timeline. So far people seem to like it. It’s cheap, and given how much time so many of us spend on Twitter, something of a no-brainer at this stage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/health-tech-startup-color-raises-100m-at-a-4-6b-valuation/"><strong>Health tech startup Color snags $100M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>After raising $167 million earlier this year, Color is back to the funding well with yet another nine-figure round. The startup’s “software and infrastructure provide tools for preventative health and infectious disease management by making healthcare programs more accessible,” TechCrunch reports. Given that the company is now valued like a public company, it will be interesting to see how quickly Color files an S-1.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/chicagos-origin-ventures-just-closed-its-biggest-fund-yet-with-130-million-in-commitments/"><strong>Good news for Chicago:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, the Midwest is seeing its startup fundraising totals boom, but not all that capital is flowing from local sources. More of it might in the future with the city’s Origin Ventures securing its biggest fund yet.</li>
<li>TechCrunch’s Brian Heater has some really neat notes on a startup building tiny robots <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/these-tiny-robots-inspired-by-starfish-larva-move-courtesy-of-ultrasound/">here</a>. Which I bring up so that you can read it, <em>and</em> so that you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">sign up</a> for his upcoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/actuator/">robotics newsletter called Actuator.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/solidus-labs-rakes-in-another-15-million-as-crypto-risk-monitoring-tools-take-off/"><strong>$15M to track crypto shenanigans:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Per TechCrunch, crypto risk monitoring is increasingly big business, leading to Solidus Labs raising eight figures for its work in the market. It can detect manipulation and other sorts of market distortions that folks likely care about, given just how much money is sloshing around the crypto markets these days.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/medium-snatches-up-projector-and-beefs-up-management-team/">Medium buys Projector:</a> </strong>In its current permutation, Medium is a publishing platform with a focus on external contributors. I think. It’s been a few cycles since I was last hype about the company. Regardless, the former publisher — plastisher? — bought a startup called Projector, and TechCrunch has the story.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/talent-hack-raises-17-million-led-by-emergence-to-power-the-fitness-creator-economy/"><strong>Emergence invests in Talent Hack:</strong></a> Focused on fitness creators, Talent Hack has raised a $17 million round for its service that provides “payment processing, website design and publishing, scheduling software, email automation and CRM” to its target niche. Given how big the creator economy is today, seeing targeted services crop up is not a surprise.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/airbase-announces-free-tier-plans-to-return-nearly-all-interchange-revenue-to-its-customers/"><strong>Airbase goes free, challenges rivals:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In the Great Corporate Spend Wars, the free-versus-paid discussion took on a new bent this morning with Airbase announcing a zero-cost tier of its previously paid service, and that it is going to return nearly all of its interchange revenues to users. Damn. Expect rival moves from Ramp and Brex in short order.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/truveta-is-making-progress-towards-building-a-living-medical-portrait-of-america/"><strong>Truveta raises $100M for its health-data platform:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Working with north of a dozen healthcare providers, Truveta is now quite a lot richer than it was and is ready to start letting early adopters use its data service. The company’s tech can provide a daily snapshot of America’s health, including how different vaccines are performing in the market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/identity-verification-startup-socure-raises-450m-at-4-5b-valuation-adding-tiger-global-as-new-investor/"><strong>If something safe is secure, is something that is <em>very</em> safe Socure?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Look, we’re just trying to figure out this startup’s name. Regardless, the company just raised $450 million at a $4.5 billion valuation. The richly valued private company uses AI and ML to confirm online identities. It has now raised through a Series E, which stands for Enough already; go public.</li>

<p>&#8220;If you invest too early in an innovation, then you will have suboptimal returns,” said founding partner Manish Singhal. “If you invest too late, you may also end up getting suboptimal returns, because it is no longer a cutting-edge thing.</p>
<p>“If investment and the timing of innovation getting to a resonance point come together, then good things happen.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A bipartisan group of House lawmakers has introduced legislation that would give people more control over the algorithms that shape their online experience. If passed, the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21100363-buck_030_xml-filter-bubble" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Filter Bubble Transparency Act</a> would require companies like Meta to offer a version of their platforms that runs on an &#8220;input-transparent&#8221; algorithm that doesn&#8217;t pull on user data to generate recommendations.</p>
<p>The bill would not do away with &#8220;opaque&#8221; recommendation algorithms altogether but would make it a requirement to include a toggle that allows people to switch that functionality off. Additionally, platforms that continue to use recommendation algorithms need to have a notification that informs people those recommendations are based on inferences generated by their personal data. The prompt can be a one-time notice, but it would need to be presented in a &#8220;clear, conspicuous manner,&#8221; according to the proposed bill.</p>
<p>The legislation was introduced by Representatives Ken Buck (R-CO), David Cicilline (D-RI), Lori Trahan (D-MA) and Burgess Owens (R-UT). It&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=0CA78D6E-C0A8-4BDB-9AA9-1900238810E5" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">companion bill</a> to legislation Senators John Thune of South Dakota and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut introduced this past June. &#8220;Consumers should have the option to engage with internet platforms without being manipulated by secret algorithms driven by user-specific data,&#8221; Buck told <a href="https://www.axios.com/algorithm-bill-house-bipartisan-5293581e-430f-4ea1-8477-bd9adb63519c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>Axios</em></a>, the first outlet to report on the legislation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231716" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lawmakers have frequently criticized social media giants for using recommendation algorithms to boost user engagement, but so far, there&#8217;s been little legislative action to curb their use. In the aftermath of the January 6th US Capitol attack, a group of more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/democrats-facebook-twitter-youtube-suggestion-algorithms-194136288.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">30 Democratic lawmakers</a> called on Meta (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">then known as Facebook</a>), Twitter and YouTube to make substantive changes to their recommendation engines but ultimately stopped short of threatening regulatory action. Although the Filter Bubble Transparency Act has bipartisan support across the House and Senate, it&#8217;s unclear if it would pass.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Discord is already the de facto home for NFT communities, but the company could be planning to deepen those connections in a big way.</p>
<p>On Monday, Discord founder and CEO Jason Citron tweeted a screenshot depicting Discord integrated with popular crypto wallet service MetaMask and WalletConnect, an open protocol that many mobile crypto wallets are built on. Citron employed the NFT Twitterverse phrase &#8220;probably nothing,&#8221; shorthand for <em>this will be a huge deal</em>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">probably nothing <a href="https://t.co/p4P6MoNGgd">pic.twitter.com/p4P6MoNGgd</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231693" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Jason Citron (@jasoncitron) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1457841222995693570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The wallet support looks purely exploratory for now. Citron didn&#8217;t offer any details on how a hypothetical crypto integration would work or how serious Discord is about exploring crypto integrations and the company also declined to provide specifics.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re always exploring and hacking away at things we think will improve Discord for all the communities we serve,&#8221; a Discord spokesperson told TechCrunch, adding that the screenshot was from a recent hackathon.</p>
<p>Discord&#8217;s interest in adding crypto features into the social chat app might be hypothetical, but if the company was to build in support for Ethereum those plans could go well beyond payments. Discord also recently polled users on their thoughts about NFTs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh No <a href="https://t.co/YEfVt8Xrwe">pic.twitter.com/YEfVt8Xrwe</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jason Scott (@textfiles) <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1457751651465449475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Discord became a natural home for thousands of NFT projects this year. Many of those projects keep in touch with followers, send updates and track sales and market movement through dedicated Discord servers. It&#8217;s also the app of choice for coordinating distribution events, where NFTs are &#8220;minted&#8221; and sold or given out to supporters before eventually making their way onto trading platforms like OpenSea, often at huge markups (yes, usually for JPEGs).</p>
<p>While Discord could just have transactions in Ethereum and other digital currencies in mind, it&#8217;s also possible that Citron&#8217;s hint about MetaMask support suggests a more ambitious plan centered on NFTs. A coin like Ethereum can be used for basic payments and transactions, but the cryptocurrency also serves as the technical backbone for most NFTs, which are tracked and traded through smart contracts on Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain.</p>
<p>Discord is a savvy company that likely has a good idea of how people are already using NFTs to express their digital identities. Discord is a text and voice chat app where the main expression of user identity is through what avatar you pick — something that NFTs are all about right now. On Twitter and Discord, NFT-savvy users already pick their rarest — and often priciest — NFT to use as their PFP (profile picture). With MetaMask support, Discord could become a place where people display their NFTs in galleries linked to user profiles or choose &#8220;verified&#8221; avatar images, with ownership backed up through the blockchain.</p>
<p>The company is particularly well positioned to leverage its foothold in the burgeoning Web3 space — the next phase of the internet that many people predict will be defined by a wave of decentralization, digital goods and ownership-based virtual identity. But Discord&#8217;s also got a good thing going as it stands now.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Citron&#8217;s tweet combined with the survey the company sent out about &#8220;Discord &amp; Web3&#8221; proved polarizing. A number of accounts rallied Discord users to cancel their premium Nitro subscriptions, which provide feature perks for a monthly fee, citing concerns that Discord might go all-in on NFTs. &#8220;Canceled my nitro sub, fuck @discord, and fuck NFTs,&#8221; one tweet with nearly 10,000 likes stated.</p>
<p>Others flocked to Citron&#8217;s tweet to bemoan Discord&#8217;s nascent crypto plans as scams and spam clogs up their community servers. Citron reassured some Twitter users that Discord created a new team to specifically address the rampant sketchy behavior that plagues many servers, including those centered around swapping and selling NFTs. &#8220;Spam and security are a top priority for us in this space,&#8221; Citron wrote. &#8220;We have recently spun up team working on it specifically. More to come soon.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin’s failed lawsuit against NASA over the Human Landing System (HLS) contract, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/federal-judge-quashes-bezos-lawsuit-against-nasa-over-spacex-contract/">thrown out by a judge</a> last week and the growing progress of the Chinese space program were top of mind for NASA officials during a Tuesday briefing updating the public on the agency’s Artemis program.</p>
<p>NASA Administrator Bill Nelson had strong words on the lawsuit, saying that the agency lost “nearly seven months in litigation” over HLS, leading to two of the forthcoming missions being pushed back by a year or more. Now, Artemis-2 will take place in May 2024, while Artemis-3 — which aims to put the first woman and the first person of color on the moon — will take place no earlier than 2025. (Artemis-1, an uncrewed mission and the first to use NASA’s Space Launch System and Orion capsule, is on track for early 2022.)</p>
<p>The Artemis program is an ambitious series of planned launches by NASA to return humans to the moon since the days of the Apollo program. The HLS will be the final capsule that will transport astronauts to the lunar surface.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231700" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Blue Origin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-goes-toe-to-toe-with-nasa-in-federal-court-over-award-to-spacex/">brought the lawsuit</a> against NASA over the HLS award in August, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/feds-dismantle-blue-origin-and-dynetics-protests-of-nasas-spacex-lunar-lander-award/">unsuccessfully petitioning</a> the Government Accountability Office over the agency’s decision to award the HLS to SpaceX. Blue argued that NASA’s evaluation of proposals was “unlawful and improper” and has stated in other protests that a single contract award was anti-competitive.</p>
<p>However, it’s unclear whether the legal battle with Blue Origin is the sole reason, or even the dominant reason, for why the missions have been delayed. For instance, Nelson also noted that the Trump Administration’s target of 2024 for the third mission “was not grounded in technical feasibility,” and that Congress did not appropriate enough funds to support the development of multiple human landing systems.</p>
<p>The Senate budget committee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/senate-budget-committee-tells-nasa-to-select-two-developers-for-lunar-lander-program/">was very clear</a> that it wants NASA to select two developers for the HLS program, but it only earmarked an additional $100 million for the agency to do so.</p>
<p>“After having taken a look under the hood for the last six months, it’s clear to me that the agency will need to make serious changes for the long-term success of the program,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He also pointed to COVID as another reason for the delay, which has caused supply chain disruptions and impacts to the workforce.</p>
<h2>Nelson: “We are facing a very aggressive and good Chinese space program”</h2>
<p>Nelson also repeatedly brought up China’s rapidly advancing space program, noting that the country is “increasingly capable” of landing taikonauts on the moon. He vowed that NASA would be as aggressive as it could be in a safe and technically feasibly way “to beat our competitors with boots on the moon.”</p>
<p>The Chinese space program has progressed over the past few years at a jaw-dropping pace, quickly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/china-launches-3-astronauts-to-its-new-space-station-core-module/">launching the first core module</a> of an independent space station earlier this year. It was the third of 11 planned launches through 2022 to get the station up and running. China has also landed a rover on Mars — the only other nation besides the U.S. to do so — and plans for a more complex sample return mission from the Red Planet by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Statements that the Chinese space program, which includes the Chinese military, have made give us indications that they are going to be very aggressive,&#8221; Nelson said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disrupting the traditional MBA may be the most tried, tested and tweaked edtech startup pitch out there. And rightfully so: Business school is damn expensive and largely reserved for a select group of people who have the time and money to invest in elite education.</p>
<p>While no single company has perfectly cracked the code yet, <a href="https://www.stoaschool.com/">Stoa School</a> isn’t phased. The Goa-based startup has raised millions to bring an unaccredited, high-quality alternative to higher business education in India amid a broader awakening of the country’s growing startup scene. The startup’s initial raise, a $1.5 million pre-seed party round, includes Udemy and Maven co-founder Gagan Biyani, Better Capital founder Vaibhav Domkundwar, Teachable co-founder Ankur Nagpal, NotBoring Media founder Packy McCormick, Dunce Capital investor John Danner and Zivame co-founder Richa Kar.</p>
<p>“People want to know more about startups and perhaps transition from working at a corporate job,” said co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/kunksed">Raj Kunkolienkar</a>, who estimates that headcount demands for Indian startups have gone up by 40% over the past year. His co-founder, <a href="https://twitter.com/bizaditya">Aditya Kulkarn</a>i, added that the startup is positioning itself “as a way to [fill] startup jobs, because not everyone is accustomed to ‘what is CAC, what is GTM and what is LTV.’</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231608" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The initial insight that eventually led to Stoa&#8217;s formation, per Kulkarni, was the fact that students in India don&#8217;t have many options to pursue a business education — unless they&#8217;re able to get into the Indian School of Business (ISB) or move to the United States. At the same time, Kunkolienkar was running a Lambda School for India, but realizing that &#8220;the financing and collections infrastructure in India isn&#8217;t evolved enough to run ISAs at scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, Stoa offers a six-month part-time program, StoaMBA, that combines tech relevant skills with business fundamentals for all participants. The majority of live programming happens on the weekends through cohort–based learning, business case hackathons and basic lectures with asynchronous learning happening throughout the week. On average, students spend 12 hours a week, three weeks a month with the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our idea is to give a sort of complete 360-degree overview of different business areas,&#8221; said Kunkolienkar. He estimates that during the 24 weeks, about 30% of the program is focused on foundational skills such as how to work with data and research better. The remaining time is reserved for deep dives into specific in-demand roles, such as digital marketing roles or product strategy tips.</p>
<p>The startup admits that it&#8217;s not at scale yet to be helping all of India&#8217;s startups fill empty sales roles, so it&#8217;s currently focused on training people to be generalists within the operations and sales world. StoaMBA is currently priced at $3,400, with the majority of students paying upfront. Stoa has partnerships that allow it to offer EMI-based financing options, in which students can pay on a monthly basis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In order to truly become an alternative to the traditional MBA, Stoa will need to focus on quality assurance of curriculum, measurable outcomes and continuous proof that unaccredited curriculum can make a difference in students’ lives.</p>
<h2>Understanding the unaccredited mindset</h2>
<p>Being the first layer between job seekers and their first job in tech may help Stoa avoid competing with bigger players, but this opportunity could be its biggest challenge, too.</p>
<p>Between cohort 1 and 2, only 40 out of 100 people opted into the startup’s career services, 38 of which made the transition into a new role. While the co-founders leaned more on the success of those who opted in versus why 60% didn’t, the imbalance could be illustrative of other market forces. Down the road, the startup is experimenting with creating a different program for those who want to undergo a serious career transition, those who want to learn basics and understand more about tech or those who want to learn single skills to upskill within their current roles.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people who apply to Stoa are looking for clarity,&#8221; said Kulkarni. &#8220;You want a certain change, but the first step toward evaluating that is whether I want to even do the change or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>While anecdotes and happy students can show the value of online learning, every bootcamp eventually gets to a place where they have to prove return of investment in order to scale. Flockjay, a bootcamp startup that helps laid off people and job seekers break into tech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/flockjay-cuts-at-least-half-of-its-workforce-as-it-pivots-away-from-bootcamps-into-b2b-saas/">recently cut half of its own employees</a> amid a broader pivot to a B2B SaaS platform. Lambda School, which has juggled lawsuits, layoffs and fundraises over the past few years, has been <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-promised-lucrative-tech-coding-career-low-job-placement-2021-10">scrutinized for shoddy marketing tactics around its job placement rates. </a></p>
<p>The startup also needs to bolster its diversity efforts, especially as a lot of its focus is accessibility. The co-founders currently estimate that 75% of its students are men and 25% are women. Given that female representation in Indian startups is decreasing due to the cost of maternity leave and inherent biases, Stoa has an opportunity to question the status quo — not reinforce it. Its cap table appears to be largely male, so having more female representation behind it could help with strategy. Kulkarni said that Stoa has offered scholarships to women but said &#8220;there&#8217;s definitely something that needs to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally, Stoa is yet another example of the growing difference between entrepreneurs who believe the future is unaccredited courses and those that believe accreditation is the only way to win legitimacy within higher education.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are a six-month degree, and Indian regulators are never going to accept that kind of degree or diploma,&#8221; said Kunkolienkar. &#8220;There are very specific rules around what is accredited here in India.&#8221; Stoa says it is set on not going the &#8220;degree way&#8221; because it wants to retain control over the brand, the curriculum and the ability to change and iterate fast.</p>
<p>As a result, Stoa’s brand will matter materially to its long-term health. In other words, it may be able to give a stamp of approval to a solid number of folks, but without the sign-off from regulators will hiring managers care about that stamp?</p>
<p>&#8220;India is obviously a society [and] culture that values credentialism a ton, but I think they have a cool opportunity to rebuild what an MBA does, means and delivers for the entire country,&#8221; said Ankur Nagpal, founder of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/vibe-capital-is-a-new-venture-firm-built-for-scrappy-international-founders/">Vibe Capital</a> and investor in the startup. &#8220;I think they have done brand-building and [developed an] alumni network well enough that it’s become an aspirational brand to those in the know.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Deck and Y Combinator have shown that it is possible to scale signal as a service to a certain extent, since both programs come with hints of prestige and community for those who graduate. While the accelerators are for insiders who may understand the nuances of business, Stoa thinks it can conquer those who want to enter the startup ecosystem, per the co-founders.</p>
<p>But landing a job in tech can sometimes be harder and more complex than starting a company. Stoa’s next, venture-backed steps will hopefully change that by removing traditional gatekeepers and teaching through example.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/project-relate/">looking for help developing</a> an Android app aimed at providing more communication options for people with speech impairments. Project Relate, as the effort and app is now called, will provide voice transcription and synthesis that could make it easier for users to be understood.</p>
<p>The project is descended from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/googles-project-euphonia-wants-to-make-voice-recognition-work-for-people-with-speech-impairments/">Project Euphonia</a>, which we covered back in 2019 when it was first announced and later when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/google-details-ai-work-behind-project-euphonias-more-inclusive-speech-recognition/">published some of its research</a>. The effort was spearheaded by Google research scientist Dimitri Kanevsky, who himself has impaired speech and brought firsthand knowledge to the AI-based solution. Now one of the project&#8217;s main partners and users of the app is Aubrie Lee, who&#8217;s on the marketing team there (she named the app) and due to muscular dystrophy has trouble being understood by both other people and apps. (You can see her in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/EU2oCVlzEZk">here</a> or below.)</p>
<p>The simple fact is that speech recognition engines need lots of recorded speech to learn how to interpret it correctly, and that data is biased in favor of common speech patterns. People with accents aren&#8217;t as well represented in these data sets, so they aren&#8217;t understood as well — and people with speech impairments are even less commonly included, making it practically impossible for them to use common voice-powered devices.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231483" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/speechmatics-pushes-forward-recognition-of-accented-english/">Startups and improvements to the basic tech</a> are improving the understanding of accented language, but it takes a special effort to collect and analyze the highly individualized speech patterns of those with impairments and disabilities. Every voice is different, but uncommon and unique patterns like those resulting from a stroke or injury can be tough for a machine learning system to understand reliably.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XDncA0Wmgu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/speechmatics-pushes-forward-recognition-of-accented-english/">Speechmatics pushes forward recognition of accented English</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Speechmatics pushes forward recognition of accented English&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/speechmatics-pushes-forward-recognition-of-accented-english/embed/#?secret=XDncA0Wmgu" data-secret="XDncA0Wmgu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Project Relate is at its core a better voice transcription tool for those with speech impairments. The &#8220;Listen&#8221; function turns the user&#8217;s speech directly into text, so it can be pasted elsewhere or read by others. &#8220;Repeat&#8221; listens first then repeats what they&#8217;ve said in a voice that&#8217;s hopefully clearer. &#8220;Assistant&#8221; basically forwards their transcribed speech directly to Google Assistant for common tasks like playing music or asking about the weather.</p>
<p>To enable these capabilities, the work at Google has been first to collect as much data as possible, and to that end the researchers note they&#8217;ve built a database of over a million speech samples by volunteers. This was used to train up what might be called the base level of intelligence for the speech-recognition AI. But like any other ML system, the more data — and the more specific that data is to the individual use case — the better.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EU2oCVlzEZk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;We know the community of people with speech impairments is incredibly diverse and how people will interact with Project Relate may be different,&#8221; said Julie Cattiau, Google Research product manager in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;We want to avoid assuming what our target audience needs and the best way to do that is to build our product hand in hand with the people who will be using it. By engaging in testing with an initial group of people, we can better understand how our application will work for people in their daily lives, how accurate it will be and what areas of improvement there might be, before we expand to a broader audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is recruiting a first round of real-world testers to use the app regularly. The first step will be to record a set of phrases, which will be integrated with the speech model to better cater to their speech patterns. If you think this could be helpful in your everyday life, feel free to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_9fFSD4IAqHaePFebXMBOUML8rEFyZD4DNxG5LaZhpW5QXQ/viewform">sign up as a potential volunteer</a> and maybe you&#8217;ll help make the app better for everyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/republic-may-build-a-secondary-exchange-for-digital-securities-fueled-by-150-million-in-new-funding/">Off the heels of a $150 million Series B fundraise</a>, New York-based investing platform Republic has acquired Arora Project, an equity crowdfunding media agency that helps startups create and launch campaigns. Krishan Arora, CEO and founder at Arora Project, declined to tip TechCrunch the total transaction amount but said that it was a “large, multimillion dollar deal.”</p>
<p><a href="https://republic.co/">Republic</a>, which is now five years old, is perhaps best known for facilitating crowdfunding campaigns for startups and small businesses under Reg CF, a rule that allows non-accredited investors to participate in private funding rounds. The startup’s reputation grew when the SEC recently raised the cap for how much money can be raised through a Reg CF, from $1.07 million to $5 million per year, ushering in a new wave of startups that can raise meaningful money from their communities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aroraproject.co/">Arora Project</a> is built off of the same tailwinds. The Miami-based startup is a digital media agency, paired with an angel syndicate, that helps companies build campaigns to eventually post on crowdfunding platforms like WeFunder, StartEngine or Republic. It has helped founders raise more than $100 million in capital since being founded in 2016.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231678" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We&#8217;re sort of the management consultants of the space,” said Arora. “Founders come to us, we put them on the right platform, create all the content, run the acquisition of the data analytics and get them the money they need so they can focus on running the business instead of the fundraise.” The acquisition now means that Arora will be in an exclusive partnership with Republic</p>
<p>Arora Project will first bring marketing chops to the retail, equity crowdfunding investment side of Republic’s business. Down the road, Arora will integrate into Republic’s other sub companies, which include a private capital division, blockchain incubator and fund, and eventually, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/republic-may-build-a-secondary-exchange-for-digital-securities-fueled-by-150-million-in-new-funding/">a compliance-focused marketplace for digital securities. </a></p>
<p>Last week, Indiegogo announced that it will begin to more closely screen crowdfunding campaigns on its platform. While Republic focuses more on equity crowdfunding campaigns versus Indiegogo’s specialty of rewards-based and donation-based crowdfunding, the news triggered questions on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/06/all-things-in-moderation-including-moderation/">the future of moderation</a> within the broader crowdfunding world. Arora Project boasts that it has a “rigorous vetting process” and accepts less than 10% of applications that it receives every month. Republic Chief of Staff Kyle McCormick said that the marketplace is &#8220;an entirely different beast&#8221; than Indiegogo.</p>
<p>“Even though we may share users with platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, we’re going after a different part of that user’s wallet — their investable assets on which they hope to make a return. Not checking for fraud (at a bare minimum) would be deeply negligent,” McCormick then said. He admitted that there are still challenges with this model: “How do we deliver quality in a scalable way? How do we support venture-backed companies without mirroring gender and race biases in venture capital? All things we think about everyday.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founder Arora says that quality assurance is certainly one of his goals, in addition to driving overall deal volume and total investment volume on the platform.</p>
<p>Republic has always been a more curated platform due to its focus, but Arora Project and future acquisitions could help it find better ways to answer some of these questions — either by introducing a new cohort of investors to its platform, or by helping more startups launch campaigns that balance transparency with ambition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.fubo.tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FuboTV</a> is making a significant move in Europe with plans to acquire Molotov, a French startup with a leading television streaming service. FuboTV also operates a TV streaming platform, but it is currently only operating in the U.S., Canada and Spain.</p>
<p>The transaction is a cash-and-stock deal that values Molotov at $190 million (€164.3 million). The deal is pending approvals and closing conditions. FuboTV expects to close the acquisition at some point during the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>If you have been following Molotov for long enough (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/18/how-a-team-of-accomplished-entrepreneurs-plan-to-revolutionize-your-television-experience/">like me</a>), you may remember that telecom company Altice also announced plans to acquire a majority stake in Molotov <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/altice-to-acquire-majority-stake-in-ott-startup-molotov/">back in 2019</a>. But that deal fell through, meaning that Altice never managed to secure control of the French streaming startup. Let’s hope that this time things will work out as planned.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231359" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Molotov started in France with a well-designed over-the-top streaming platform. You can find all major TV channels, stream live content and watch replays for free. There are optional subscriptions to unlock more features, such as cloud recordings and, of course, premium channels.</p>
<p>At the time, a key feature that differentiated Molotov from other ways to watch TV was that you could sign in with your account and find your content on any platform. Molotov has apps for desktop, mobile, tablet, Apple TV, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV and many smart TVs. Since then, many over-the-top TV services have launched with a focus on an account-based user experience.</p>
<p>Over time, Molotov launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/molotov-starts-its-international-expansion-with-seven-african-countries/">new countries</a> and added more content from various partners. It also operates its own ad-supported streaming service called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/molotov-launches-free-ad-supported-streaming-service-mango/">Mango</a> and has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/molotov-will-provide-infrastructure-service-to-other-ott-platforms/">B2B division</a> to run the OTT platform of other media and telecom companies. Overall, 17 million people have created a Molotov account — most of them are in France.</p>
<h2>An easy market expansion</h2>
<p>As for fuboTV, the company started off as a soccer streaming service. It quickly expanded to focus on sports in general, and then non-sports content. For instance, fuboTV <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/19/fubotv-inks-discovery-deal-adds-13-more-networks-to-its-live-tv-streaming-service/">has inked a deal</a> with Discovery, Inc. and its various channels, such as Discovery Channel, TLC, Investigation Discovery, Animal Planet, OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network and MotorTrend.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>FuboTV also offers cloud DVR features as well as the ability to pause and unpause livestreams. You can also restart a show already in progress in case you&#8217;re late.</p>
<p>Molotov’s co-founder and CEO Jean-David Blanc will remain at the helm of the European company. He will also be appointed chief strategy officer. FuboTV already says in its announcement that it plans to expand the team in Paris.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud of this new step for Molotov. We share with fuboTV the same ambition and the same vision of a live TV streaming platform on both sides of the Atlantic. Our goal is to offer consumers a best-in-class streaming experience with premium television content on a global scale&#8221;, Jean-David Blanc said in a statement.</p>
<p>In other words, a deal between fuboTV and Molotov makes sense as both companies operate in the same industry, but there’s no geographical overlap. FuboTV will now have two strong customer bases on two continents. And Molotov will act as the European hub for fuboTV when the acquisition goes through.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shin Kim spent nearly two years helping renowned entrepreneur and investor Elad Gil vet deals and dream up new ideas as his chief of staff. In the process, an idea bubbled up that seemed too compelling to let go. Now called <a href="https://www.tryeraser.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eraser</a>, that year-old startup, which is centered around a collaborative digital canvas for whiteboarding and note-taking, has raised $4 million in seed funding led by Caffeinated Capital. It has also attracted what Kim says is more than 1 million users since its March launch, from &#8220;five-person startups to the largest global tech companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>We talked with Kim last week to learn more about his transition from right-hand man to startup founder, as well as to understand why, in a world that is suddenly rife with tools that help remote teams collaborate more efficiently, he&#8217;s confident there is room for Eraser to grow.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have two computer science degrees, from the University of Chicago and from Berkeley. How did you end up working with Elad Gil?</strong></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231500" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>SK: [After school], I went into finance and investing in San Francisco [as an associate with JPMorgan, then Oak Hill Capital], and I met Elad through my brother. He was an investor in my brother&#8217;s startup, <a href="https://www.bitwiseinvestments.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitwise Asset Management</a>, which is a crypto asset manager [where Kim&#8217;s brother is CTO]. He was looking for a chief of staff as he just had so many things going on, and it was just him at that point with his EA. So I joined to help him with companies, doing due diligence, getting deep into the stories of companies and their financials and their data.</p>
<p>We were also working on incubating some ideas together, and that was the main draw for me &#8212; that in addition to investing, he wanted to find ideas that should exist in the world but don&#8217;t and to build something from the ground up, and Eraser was a collaboration in that regard. It was the pandemic. We had worked through a few ideas, and this was the final one that we hit on.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What was the special insight here?</strong></p>
<p>SK: Collaboration in general was really tough during the pandemic, right? Everything was broken, everything was suddenly Zoom-based, and as I talked to a bunch of companies both large and small in Silicon Valley, it seemed like ideation, or getting a project started off the ground, seemed really tough as opposed to executing on existing projects. Especially on a remote basis, this process of brainstorming together and building on top of each other&#8217;s ideas is really tough. That&#8217;s how the genesis of Eraser came to be.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: So this is an all-in-one ideation platform for technical teams. What does that mean, exactly?</strong></p>
<p>SK: To unpack that a bit, by technical teams, we mean engineering teams and data science teams, and by ideation, our platform consists of three functionalities. One is a canvas where you can visually collaborate &#8212; you can create diagrams or system architecture. You can create wireframes to visualize front-end UI mock ups. And you can annotate things, like scribble math equations [with a stylus, using its app in the iPad], like you would on a physical whiteboard.</p>
<p>The second piece is the note editor, where you can turn those figures and diagrams into some kind of documentation or reference document. This is where we serve technical teams better because oftentimes, they&#8217;re using Google Docs as their documentation platform and then copy-pasting images that they drew on some other visualization tool into Google Docs. We have that capability natively inside of Eraser.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And the last piece?</strong></p>
<p>SK: You can post the entire conversation on Eraser or using audio chat. We realized that when users are doing brainstorming remotely, oftentimes Zoom or Google Meet is in the background and they&#8217;re only using audio and really video because they&#8217;ve been working with these people for a long time and don&#8217;t need to see their faces to be brainstorming. It&#8217;s more about the content.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Does Eraser save the audio so if you want to go back and replay that whole meeting, or also search through it, you can do this?</strong></p>
<p>SK: That&#8217;s to come. It&#8217;s definitely on our roadmap. Currently, we only have real-time audio communication.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve already told me you aren&#8217;t sharing customer names yet. What are some of the use cases you&#8217;re seeing?</strong></p>
<p>SK: We see individuals using it for hobby projects. We see educators using it. But our bread-and-butter use case is teams and companies that are using it for work. It&#8217;s very lightweight, compared to some of the other alternatives out there. I think engineers are generally reticent to go into designer tools like Figma, but with Eraser, engineers feel like they can create their own wireframes and create visualizations of what they&#8217;re imagining. That it&#8217;s usable, lightweight and there&#8217;s a lack of a learning curve is a lot of the feedback that we&#8217;ve been getting, especially compared with other products.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How are you getting the product out in the world?</strong></p>
<p>SK: It&#8217;s definitely word of mouth. Another go-to-market strategy we adopted was to partner with virtual office platforms like <a href="https://www.kumospace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kumospace</a> and <a href="https://www.gather.town/post/why-the-metaverse-matters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gather</a> [a &#8220;metaverse&#8221; startup that just last week announced $50 million in Series B funding co-led by Sequoia Capital and Index Ventures].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Who pays for that real estate? Are you charging these partners?</strong></p>
<p>SK: No, we&#8217;re not charging our partners. Monetization is something we want to get to later next year, though even then, we wouldn&#8217;t charge our partners. We would charge the end users who wind up saying, &#8216;Hey, I really like this whiteboard and want our entire team using it.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are these partners charging you, or will they receive a cut from these transactions?</strong></p>
<p>SK: That&#8217;s TBD, as well. I think we&#8217;re adding value by providing a whiteboard experience for their end users, which otherwise, they would have to create themselves, which would be a lot of work.</p>
<p><strong>TC: When you do start charging, do you see this being per seat or per session?</strong></p>
<p>SK: It would be a monthly-type deal where, we&#8217;re charging per user per month. It&#8217;s more of a classic subscription.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Microsoft just announced a whole lot of collaboration tools. Obviously this is a crowded industry generally, but out of curiosity, what did you make of the company&#8217;s recent announcements?</strong></p>
<p>SK: Even though Microsoft Loop describes itself as a collaborative canvas, it largely seems to be a next-generation document editor, competing against the likes of Notion and Coda. Eraser&#8217;s main use cases are built around visual collaboration like diagramming and wireframing, so I would argue the product identities between MS Loop and Eraser are dissimilar.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also focused on serving technical teams &#8212; engineers, data scientists &#8212; and want to build features to serve their needs like programmatically generating diagrams. MS Loop&#8217;s mandate will likely be to serve a broadest possible audience, so it doesn&#8217;t impact our core mission of building an end-to-end ideation platform for technical teams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/unity/">Unity</a> has just announced its intent to acquire <a href="https://www.wetafx.co.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weta Digital</a>, the legendary visual effects company co-founded by Peter Jackson, for a massive $1.625 billion.</p>
<p>Whether or not you recognize the name, you&#8217;ve seen Weta Digital&#8217;s work. From &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; to &#8220;Avatar&#8221; to &#8220;Shang-Chi,&#8221; if its the kind of movie where people say &#8220;you should really see it in theaters,&#8221; there&#8217;s a good chance Weta Digital played a huge role in the VFX.</p>
<p>Leading into this deal, Weta Digital was both a team of artists creating visual effects and a team of engineers developing many of the tools those artists use. It&#8217;s those tools and engineering teams, specifically, that Unity is acquiring; the visual effects artistry team, meanwhile, will be split off into its own new thing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231513" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Weta Digital&#8217;s 275+ engineers will join Unity. The VFX artists will be spun out into a new entity, &#8220;Weta FX,&#8221; of which Peter Jackson will continue to own the majority. The two companies expect to continue working together, with Unity noting that it sees Weta FX being one of their &#8220;largest customers in the Media and Entertainment space&#8221; moving forward.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Unity will be taking over the development of Weta Digital&#8217;s many built-in-house tools — things like City Builder (which procedurally generates the massive 3D cities we see destroyed in movies like &#8220;King Kong&#8221;), Manuka (their custom, physics-simulating renderer that helps make everything look oh-so-real in the final version), Gazebo (their faster real-time renderer, used by artists to accurately preview scenes before the much more time-consuming final render), and all of the other bespoke tech the team has built for rigging characters, animating and rendering faces, processing motion capture or simulating hair/fur/smoke/a thousand years of vegetation growth across an abandoned cityscape.</p>

<p>Why Weta? I hopped on a call with Unity SVP Marc Whitten to get his thoughts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Think back 10 years ago,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;Think about 2D, and just how many photos were being created. There was probably a lot! But project forward 10 years&#8230; and it&#8217;s just extraordinarily greater now. I think we&#8217;re in the same place for 3D.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The one difference, though&#8221; he notes, &#8220;is that 10 years ago, I &#8230; kind of thought I could take a photo. I can sort of do something with 2D. But that&#8217;s actually almost not-true — because every time I click the shutter button on my iPhone, it&#8217;s probably running 5 million lines of super advanced code to turn me into [a photographer]. But in 3D, I actually personally can&#8217;t model something today. What we need to do over the next 10 years is take that same approach; to take this incredibly deep technology and make sure that it works effortlessly.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words: Unity sees a growing need to make building in 3D less painful, and that&#8217;s something Weta has spent the last few decades figuring out.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Unity will also acquire the massive catalog of digital assets that Weta Digital has built over the years — a list of creations that is much, much, much too long to list, but think everything from 3D models of cities or cars or people, to the algorithms determining how smoke works as it comes off a fire in the rain, to simulations of how a herd of animals might move together through the trees — all of which, potentially, could find its way into Unity&#8217;s products for creators to build upon. (That won&#8217;t include &#8220;recognizably clear IP,&#8221; Whitten notes, so don&#8217;t expect to be able to drag-and-drop Gollum into your next game.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Unity built the world’s most popular game engine&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/how-unity-built-the-worlds-most-popular-game-engine/embed/#?secret=CcN5MPvzwh" data-secret="CcN5MPvzwh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Prior to this, Unity’s largest acquisition was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/unity-to-acquire-parsec-in-its-biggest-acquisition-to-date/"> its $320 million purchase of Parsec back in August of this year</a>. At the time, Whitten alluded to that purchase as part of Unity’s larger cloud ambitions &#8212; something this acquisition plays to, as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;What [Weta Digital&#8217;s] tools are&#8230; is really this pipeline,&#8221; says Whitten. &#8220;Each individual tool is individually powerful, but in conjunction together across this pipeline they all work really effortlessly. If you make a change in one particular tool, it shows up in the right way when you go to do the lighting, or compositing, in any other particular tool. Groups of people can work really, really easily together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ll do then,&#8221; he continues &#8220;is make sure that these cloud capabilities plug directly in where artists are and where they&#8217;re trying to do their work — inside of Maya, or inside of Houdini, or inside of Unity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe it&#8217;s important to make this pipeline available in the cloud, so that wherever you are, you can just sort of plug into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unity says it expects the deal to close in its 2021 Q4. Weta Digital CEO Prem Akkaraju will stay on as the CEO of the newly formed Weta FX, while CTO Joe Marks will move to Unity as CTO of Weta Digital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpinLaunch, a startup working on a kinetic space launch system, has successfully completed its first prototype flight. It’s a major milestone for the seven-year-old company as it works toward a test of its full-scale system.</p>
<p>The concept behind that system is pretty wild: Essentially, SpinLaunch wants to get to orbit by using a large, vacuum-sealed chamber and a hypersonic tether to spin a spacecraft at a high enough velocity &#8212; up to 5,000 miles per hour &#8212; to escape the atmosphere. That means no rocket, no rocket engines. It’s a markedly different way of thinking about spaceflight, much more akin to a giant rail gun rather than a conventional launch system.</p>
<p>According to SpinLaunch, such a system is now possible thanks to advances in small electronics and high-strength materials like carbon fiber, which can harden both the launch vehicle and small satellites to high-G forces.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231585" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The prototype flight took place on October 22 at Spaceport America in New Mexico. In addition to launching the test vehicle at supersonic speeds using the accelerator, which was around one-third the size of the planned system (but still larger than the Statue of Liberty, SpinLaunch notes on its website), the startup also recovered the vehicle to reuse it for later tests.</p>
<p>SpinLaunch, which was founded in 2014, aims to conduct around 30 suborbital test flights over the next six to eight months, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/spinlaunch-completes-first-test-flight-of-alternative-rocket.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC reported</a>. The startup has been backed by Airbus Ventures, Kleiner Perkins and GV.</p>
<p>The startup is not disclosing the site for its first orbital launch, but its website notes it will be “a coastal region of the United States.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA["I think we're now better off than we were before the pandemic. But that was a bit of a wake-up call to us. That wake-up call actually led to a lot of changes."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Airbnb announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/airbnb-boosts-host-protection-adds-wifi-speed-verification/">over 50 new features coming to the platform</a> this morning. The big ones include a new, smarter Translation Engine, a way to know if a rental has solid WiFi, an expanded Ask A Superhost program, more flexibility in search and tools to verify any accessibility features a listing might promise.</p>
<p>The biggest announcement of all, however, comes in the form of AirCover. It&#8217;s a new coverage policy that protects a listing from top to bottom (including most items in the home) from damage and theft. It includes protection for pet damage, deep cleaning and income loss.</p>
<p>This is particularly critical because right now, Airbnb suffers from a high-class problem, according to CEO Brian Chesky. Suddenly, as pandemic restrictions loosen and more people venture out of their homes to travel, supply is not meeting demand.</p>
<p>I sat down with Chesky to discuss growing the supply side of the business, how he&#8217;s felt as a leader of a massive travel company over the past year and the future of Airbnb as a whole.</p>
<p><em>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: The last time that we talked, we discussed what it was like to be CEO during a pandemic. Obviously, you&#8217;re the CEO of a <em>travel</em> company, so that makes it 20 times more difficult. As we&#8217;re moving through this pandemic, it&#8217;s starting to feel like things are kind of swinging in your direction. You had a great Q3 earnings report recently. Interest in travel is up, bookings are up, borders are opening. How safe or secure do you feel Airbnb is right now compared to a year ago?</strong></p>
<p>Brian Chesky: Much more secure. I feel like we&#8217;re on solid ground now. I felt like we spent 10 years building this company that was really a pretty hot company. If you think about it, in the 2000s, Airbnb and Uber were the two companies that were riding a lot of trends and we were very high. I felt like before the pandemic, I thought we were kind of on top of the world. But then the gods struck down on us and we lost 80% of our business in eight weeks. And we had to raise that. Let me just give you a point of reference. We had to raise an emergency round of financing of $2 billion, including a $1 billion loan from Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners. We just did a billion dollars in profit in Q3. So it&#8217;s almost like doing a billion-dollar round without having to give away any equity. I remember Paul Graham used to say the best fundraising round you can do is to be profitable because you never get diluted.</p>
<p>Just to summarize, the brand is as relevant as it ever was. It&#8217;s a noun and a verb all over the world. Travel is coming back. So, I think 80% of our business before the pandemic involved someone either crossing a border or going to a city, which is basically the two types of travel that weren&#8217;t really happening. That&#8217;s coming back. But the reason we&#8217;re doing so well is partly because all these new ways of traveling and living have emerged, which I think are here to stay. People are living on Airbnb on a monthly basis. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going away, because I don&#8217;t think people are going back to the office five days a week. Those things are here to stay. And, we actually have a much better cost structure.</p>
<p>So, for all those reasons, I feel more secure. Maybe the most important final thing I&#8217;ll say is this: Having gone through managing a company in a pandemic where people were predicting our imminent demise, having to rebuild the company from the ground up and take it public on Zoom as a travel company … if I can get through that and we can get through, then I can get through anything. So I think we&#8217;re a lot tougher, a lot sharper. And once you&#8217;re in a foxhole with 1,000 people, you feel like you can do anything. That&#8217;s kind of how we feel now.</p>

<p><strong>You said that you believe that work from home or &#8220;work anywhere&#8221; is here to stay. So what does that mean for Airbnb HQ? Are you going to renew the lease, or what exactly does the future of Airbnb as a workforce look like?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great question. We&#8217;ll still have our offices. Not as many. Not as much space. But we&#8217;ll still have our offices. We&#8217;ll still have our main headquarters in San Francisco. We&#8217;re definitely going to adopt a flexible work policy. I don&#8217;t know exactly what it&#8217;s going to be. I think every CEO is trying to imagine how everyone&#8217;s going to work in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microrobots have been a longtime fascination for many in the industry. Such technologies could ultimately provide a slew of applications, including a handful of useful features in healthcare. Things like targeted delivery of medication and microsurgical procedures are frequently mentioned.</p>
<p>Mobility is among the biggest questions that arise from the tech. Specifically, how can roboticists get them to move without batteries and other technologies on board. Magnets are a fairly common suggestion, <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2021/11/finding-inspiration-in-starfish-larva.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but a team at ETH Zurich is exploring an altogether different solution</a>: ultrasound.</p>
<p>The robots, which measure smaller than the diameter of a human hair, were created using photolithography. They’re covered with synthetic versions of the sort of cilia that cover starfish larva. In the biological example, these ultra-fine hair-like structures beat the surrounding water in patterns that create small vortexes, propelling the young echinoderms through the fluid. Effectively, the system either pushes water or pulls it in.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231418" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jn30ct9u1UY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The team says it was able to create similar propulsion in its tiny robots by applying ultrasound waves, allowing them to swim in a straight line. The objects you see around the robot in the photos and video are plastic microbeads added to the water to demonstrate how it moves in circular patterns around the robot.</p>
<p>Drug delivery is the most broadly discussed application here &#8212; specifically, the ability to deliver medication directly to the site of something like a stomach tumor. Doing so could ensure that it’s used more efficiently, while reducing potential side effects.</p>
<p>“But before this vision can be realized, a major challenge remains to be overcome: imaging,” the school writes. “Steering the tiny machines to the right place requires that a sharp image be generated in real time. The researchers have plans to make the microrobots more visible by incorporating contrast agents such as those already used in medical imaging with ultrasound.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
