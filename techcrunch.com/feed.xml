										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mountaintop, a sort of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/oculus-co-founder-and-games-industry-vets-form-mountaintop-studios/">supergroup game development studio</a> founded by veterans from a multitude of other major companies in the industry, has collected a $5.5 seed round from friends and family, and announced that their first title will be a PvP shooter.</p>
<p>The company emerged last summer, headed by Oculus co-founder Nate Mitchell and several others from larger gaming concerns that decided to strike off on their own. The idea would be to create an independent studio free from the pervasive culture of crunch and toxicity frequently found (or <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-21/ubisoft-sexual-misconduct-scandal-harassment-sexism-and-abuse">reported</a>) at bigger publishers and developers.</p>
<p>Being independent also means no allowance from a big publisher, so they needed to get some capital to work with. That manifested from the enviably deep pockets of their families and friends, who I suppose felt more than justified in funding the activities of people whom they know to be successful entrepreneurs and industry movers and shakers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The $5.5 million seed will go towards their first title, which will be a PvP shooter. Now, this may give some pause, as PvP shooters number among the last five years&#8217; biggest successes (Overwatch, PUBG, Fortnite, Apex) and most notable failures (Crucible, Battleborn, Paragon, Gigantic) — the latter seemingly in fruitless attempts to emulate the former.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4wRNQ4ExDp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/oculus-co-founder-and-games-industry-vets-form-mountaintop-studios/">Oculus co-founder and games industry vets form Mountaintop Studios</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Oculus co-founder and games industry vets form Mountaintop Studios&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/oculus-co-founder-and-games-industry-vets-form-mountaintop-studios/embed/#?secret=4wRNQ4ExDp" data-secret="4wRNQ4ExDp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But the opportunistic corporate me-too attitude that sunk many a game is unlikely to exist at Mountaintop, a small team with no shareholders breathing down their neck — except their friends and family, who will be too polite to do so. If they think they can make an interesting and commercially viable PvP shooter, I say have at it, I&#8217;m tired of the other ones.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be nice to know that the product came from a crunch-free environment as well — as we&#8217;ve seen with Supergiant&#8217;s &#8220;Hades,&#8221; people working on their own schedules to make something they care about can have remarkable results.</p>
<p>As Mitchell put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>We all know great games and products can be built without crunch. It&#8217;s about thoughtful scoping, planning, execution every step of the way. That’s not to say that avoiding crunch is easy — it’s incredibly challenging, especially with unexpected curve balls along the way.</p>
<p>In the end though, it always comes down to leadership and the decisions they make. At Mountaintop, we&#8217;re committed to doing right by the team, always.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company has grown from the founding team of five now to 20. Although Mountaintop wasn&#8217;t intended from the start to be a pandemic-proof setup, its remote-first approach did mean that hiring during COVID didn&#8217;t mean changing how they planned for the company to work. Currently they have people from Epic, Blizzard, Naughty Dog, Respawn, Infinity Ward, Ubisoft, Raven, Turtle Rock, Double Fine, PopCap, and (obviously) Oculus.</p>
<p>But among the team&#8217;s other priorities were diversity and inclusion. With 19 of the 20 people on staff men, and 18 of the 20 white, that seems to be presenting more of a challenge to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just getting started, but we&#8217;re building a studio with diversity and inclusion at the core, where everyone feels like they belong. We have a long way to go, but we&#8217;re committed to seeing it through,&#8221; said Mitchell. With a target headcount of about 50, there&#8217;s a still a lot of room to grow into that promise.</p>
<p>No indication when we&#8217;ll learn more about the game, but at the current cadence we can probably expect another tidbit of info this summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The cloud infrastructure market in 2020 reflected society itself, with the richest companies getting richer and the ones at the bottom of the market getting poorer. It grew to $129 billion for the year, according to <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/cloud-market-ends-2020-high-while-microsoft-continues-gain-ground-amazon">data from Synergy Research Group</a>. That&#8217;s up from around $97 billion in 2019.</p>
<p>Synergy also reported that the cloud infra market reached $37 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $33 billion in the third quarter, and 35% from a year ago.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard from every founder under the sun for the last 9 months that the pandemic was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/the-accelerating-digital-transformation-redux/">accelerating digital transformation</a>, and that a big part of that was an expedited shift to the cloud. These numbers would seem to bear that out.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>As usual the big three were Amazon, Microsoft and Google, with Alibaba now firmly entrenched in fourth place and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/ibm-transformation-struggles-continue-with-cloud-and-ai-revenue-down-4-5/">IBM falling back to fifth</a>. But Microsoft grew more quickly than rival Amazon, reaching 20% market share at the end of 2020 for the first time. Keep in mind that the Redmond-based software giant has now doubled its share since 2017. That&#8217;s remarkably rapid rapid growth. Meanwhile Google and Alibaba took home 9% and 6% respectively.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what that all looks like in chart form:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108512" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108512" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2108512" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CIS-Q420.jpg?w=680" alt="Cloud infrastructure marketshare for fourth quarter 2020 from Synergy Research." width="680" height="448" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CIS-Q420.jpg 1127w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CIS-Q420.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CIS-Q420.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CIS-Q420.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CIS-Q420.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CIS-Q420.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108512" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Synergy Research</p></div></p>
<p>Amazon is an interesting case in that it has plateaued at around 33% for four straight years of Synergy data, but because it&#8217;s one-third share of an increasingly growing market, that means that it has kept growing its public cloud revenues as the category itself has expanded.</p>
<p>Amazon closed out the year with $12.74 billion in Q4 AWS revenue, putting it on a run rate of over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">just over $50 billion</a> for the first time. That was up from $11.6 billion the prior quarter. While Microsoft&#8217;s numbers are always difficult to parse from its earning&#8217;s reports, doing the math of 20% of $37 billion, it came in with $7.4 billion up from $5.9 billion last quarter.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="I4pt2bhSIh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/embed/#?secret=I4pt2bhSIh" data-secret="I4pt2bhSIh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Google brought in $3.3 billion, up from $2.98 billion in Q3 2020, and Alibaba pulled in $2.22 billion, up from $1.65 billion over the same timeframe.</p>
<p>John Dinsdale, principal analyst at Synergy says the leaders are pretty firmly entrenched at this point with huge absolute market numbers and also huge gaps between the cloud providers. &#8220;AWS has been a great success story for over ten years now and it remains in an extremely strong market position despite increasing competition from a broad swathe of strong IT industry companies. That is a great testament both to Amazon and to the AWS leadership team and you’d have to suspect that will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/">not change with the new regime</a>,&#8217; he told me.</p>
<p>He sees Microsoft as a worthy rival, but one that is bound to hit a growth wall at some point. &#8220;It is certainly feasible that Microsoft will continue to narrow the gap between itself and Amazon, but the bigger Microsoft Azure becomes the tougher it is to maintain really high growth rates. That is just the law of large numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, market share at the bottom of the cloud infrastructure space continued to decline even while the number of dollars at stake have continued to expand dramatically. &#8220;The market share losers have been the large group of smaller cloud providers, who collectively have lost 13 percentage points of market share over the last 16 quarters,&#8221; Synergy wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>Dinsdale says all is not lost for these players, however. &#8220;Regarding the smaller players (or the big companies that have only a small market share), they can either focus on specific market niches (can be based around geography, service type or customer vertical) or they can try to offer a broad range of cloud services to a broad range of customers. Companies doing the former can do quite well, while companies doing the latter will find it extremely tough,&#8221; Dinsdale told me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-cloud-market-q4-2020">Canalys has slightly different numbers</a> with a total market of around $142 billion and almost $40 billion for the quarter, but the percentages are in line with Synergy&#8217;s:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108514" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108514" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2108514" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-5.35.58-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="Canalys 4th quarter 2021 cloud infrastructure market share percentages" width="680" height="644" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-5.35.58-PM.jpg 1098w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-5.35.58-PM.jpg?resize=150,142 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-5.35.58-PM.jpg?resize=300,284 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-5.35.58-PM.jpg?resize=768,727 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-5.35.58-PM.jpg?resize=680,644 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-5.35.58-PM.jpg?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108514" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canalys</p></div></p>
<p>At some point the numbers get so big they almost cease to have meaning, but as large as the public cloud revenue numbers become, they remain a relatively small percentage of overall worldwide IT spend. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-10-20-gartner-says-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-4-percent-in-2021">According to Gartner estimates</a>, worldwide IT spend in 2020 was $3.6 trillion (with a T). That means that the cloud infrastructure market accounted for just 3.85% of total spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Think about that for a moment: less than 4% of IT spend currently is on cloud infrastructure, leaving so much room for growth and for those billions to grow ever bigger in the coming years.</p>
<p>It would certainly make it more interesting if someone could come in and disrupt the leaders, but for now at least they are going to be hard to push out of the way unless something unforeseen and dramatic happens to the way we think about computing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies gather more data, ensuring that they can trust the quality of that data is becoming increasingly important. An analytics pipeline is only as good as the data it collects, after all, and messy data &#8212; or outright bugs &#8212; can easily lead to issues further down the line.</p>
<p>Seattle-based <a href="https://iterative.ly/">Iteratively</a> wants to help businesses build data pipelines they can trust. The company today announced a $5.4 million seed funding round led by Google&#8217;s AI-centric Gradient Ventures fund. <a href="http://fika.vc/">Fika Ventures</a> and early Iteratively investor <a href="https://www.psl.com/">PSL Ventures</a> also participated, with Gradient Ventures partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-bratun-glennon-b4a16026/">Zach Bratun-Glennon</a> joining the company&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Patrick Thompson, <span class="il">Iteratively</span>’s Co-founder and CEO, started working on Iteratively about two years ago. Before that, we worked at Atlassian and at Simplicity, where he met his co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hrebicek/">Ondrej Hrebicek</a>. After getting started, the team spent six months doing customer discovery and the theme they picked up on was that companies weren&#8217;t trusting the data they captured.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We interviewed a ton of companies who built internal solutions, trying to solve this particular problem. We actually built one at Atlassian, as well, so I was very much intimately familiar with this pain. And so we decided to bring a product to market that really helps alleviate the pain,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108591" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108591" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2108591" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2108591" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Iteratively</p></div></p>
<p>In a lot of companies, the data producers and data consumers don&#8217;t really talk to each other &#8212; and if they do, it&#8217;s often only through a spreadsheet or wiki. Iteratively aims to provide a collaborative environment to bring these different groups together and create a single source of truth for all stakeholders. &#8220;Typically, there&#8217;s a handoff process, either on a JIRA ticket or a Confluence page or spreadsheet, where they try to hand over these requirements &#8212; and generally, it&#8217;s never really implemented correctly, which then causes a lot of pain points down down the line,&#8221; Thompson explained.</p>
<p>Currently, Iteratively focuses on event streaming data for product and marketing analytics &#8212; the kind of data that typically flows into a Mixpanel, Amplitude or Segment. Iteratively itself sits at the origin of the data, say an app, and then validates the data and routes it to whatever third-party solution a company may use. That means the tool sits right where the data is generated, but this setup also means that none of the data ever flows through Iteratively&#8217;s own servers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108592" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iteratively-logo.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108592" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2108592" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iteratively-logo.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="49" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iteratively-logo.png 972w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iteratively-logo.png?resize=150,25 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iteratively-logo.png?resize=300,49 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iteratively-logo.png?resize=768,126 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iteratively-logo.png?resize=680,112 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iteratively-logo.png?resize=50,8 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2108592" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Iteratively</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t actually see the data,&#8221; Thompson stressed. &#8220;We&#8217;re not a data set processor. We&#8217;re a wrapper over the top of your own analytics pipeline or your own third party SaaS tools, but we verify the payloads as they flow through our SDK on the client.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over time, though, that may change, he acknowledged and Iteratively may do some data processing as well, but likely with a focus on metadata and observability.</p>
<p>Since the company doesn&#8217;t actually process any of the data itself, it&#8217;s <a href="https://iterative.ly/pricing">charging customers by seat</a> and not based on how many events moves they push through their pipelines, for example. That may obviously change over time as the company looks into doing some data processing on its side as well.</p>
<p>Currently, Iteratively has about 10 employees and plans to grow that to 20 by the end of the year. The company plans to hire across R&amp;D, sales and marketing.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="il">Iteratively</span>&#8216;s software has a unique approach to enabling company-wide collaboration and enforcing data quality,&#8221; said Grandient&#8217;s Bratun-Glennon. &#8220;Going forward, we believe that intelligent analytics and data-driven business decision making will differentiate successful companies and best-in-class products. <span class="il">Iteratively</span>&#8216;s mission, product and team are poised to give each of their customers these capabilities.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The commercialization of space isn&#8217;t just about what new sensors we can put into orbit on cheaper and smaller satellites – it&#8217;s also about studying and leverage the advantages of a microgravity environment on manufacturing and production. European startup Space Cargo Unlimited is focused on turning microgravity benefits into viable commercial ventures on Earth, and it just announced it will be working with global vine nursery company Mercier on applying the benefits of space to create more hardy wine grape vines.</p>
<p>Space Cargo Unlimited has already done some work on how microgravity can impact wine – it shipped a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/a-startup-just-launched-red-wine-to-the-international-space-station-to-age-for-12-months/">crate of red wine to the International Space Station in 2019</a>, and then returned it to Earth last year after a full 12 months aging aboard the station in near zero-G. Now, the startup has formed a subsidiary dedicated to in-space biotech specifically, Space Biology Unlimited, and it&#8217;s going to be the one working with Mercier on figuring out how to grow new grape vine varietals that are more resistant to changes in the climates in which they grown.</p>
<p>In addition to the case of Bordeaux that Space Cargo Unlimited sent up, the company also sent 320 vine canes (basically the core structure of a vine that results from the maturation of the juvenile shoot), and it just recently received those back on SpaceX&#8217;s cargo dragon return trip from the ISS. Those canes, half from Cabernet grapes, and half from Cabernet Sauvignon, have shown &#8220;unprecedented biological changes&#8221; according to Mercier CEO Guillaume Mercier in a statement. They&#8217;ll now be cloned and studied to see if they provide any advantages in terms of potential for growth on &#8220;our fast-warming planet,&#8221; he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Arb69JkeV9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/a-startup-just-launched-red-wine-to-the-international-space-station-to-age-for-12-months/">A startup just launched red wine to the International Space Station to age for 12 months</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A startup just launched red wine to the International Space Station to age for 12 months&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/a-startup-just-launched-red-wine-to-the-international-space-station-to-age-for-12-months/embed/#?secret=Arb69JkeV9" data-secret="Arb69JkeV9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Everything from battery production, to additive manufacturing, to basic chemical and medical manufacturing has been tested in a microgravity environment. Microgravity can reduce the physical strain of gravity, most obviously, to make production of complex structures possible where it wouldn&#8217;t be on Earth. The unique environment, which also includes a much different radiation profile, also leads to unexpected variances in the growth and development of organic structures that, while they don&#8217;t occur naturally on Earth, can sometimes be replicated to achieve useful outcomes.</p>
<p>The effects of microgravity have been studied using the ISS for years, but more affordable and frequent access to space has made it a much more promising commercial avenue for many companies and startups that previously wouldn&#8217;t have been able to justify the associated costs or timeframes around the work. Space Cargo Unlimited is one of the companies that looks well-positioned to capitalize on this growing trend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, two giants of the cannabis industry are announcing a partnership to create an improved retail experience for consumers and dispensaries alike. Through this partnership, <a href="https://www.leafly.com">Leafly</a> and <a href="https://www.iheartjane.com">Jane&#8217;s</a> technology solutions will offer dispensaries powerful tools to sync online e-commerce with in-store inventory &#8212; something that is sorely lacking in the cannabis world.</p>
<p>Legal weed shoppers know the pain. A handful of different apps report to show the inventory of local dispensaries and yet, the online menus often do not line up with the store&#8217;s real-time inventory. What&#8217;s more, sometimes other dispensaries have different ways of listing the same product. There&#8217;s a good reason for the dispensaries: there&#8217;s not an industry standard UPC barcode and the dispensaries often have hundreds of fast-moving SKUs from dozens of vendors.</p>
<p>Leafly and Jane&#8217;s partnership seeks to solve the pain on both sides of the counter. Jane&#8217;s technology enables dispensaries to build a modern e-commerce platform through automation and machine learning. Jane&#8217;s technology will soon be built into Leafly&#8217;s Menu Solutions that works with over 30 point-of-sale systems. This should result in less tedious work for the dispensaries and a much more consistent online experience for the shopper.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jane and Leafly have deep inroads into the cannabis world. According to this announcement&#8217;s press release, over the past year, Jane&#8217;s solution powered over 17 million orders and $2 billion in cannabis sales. Over 1,800 dispensaries and brands use Jane. Likewise, in 2020, more than 4,500 cannabis retailers used Leafly&#8217;s platform, and the company saw 120 million visitors to its online marketplace.</p>
<p>Despite the successes, Leafly experienced a turbulent 2020 with layoffs and leadership changes. Yoko Miyashita took over as the company&#8217;s CEO in August 2020 and has been focused on Leafly leaning heavily into building a better online shopping experience.</p>
<p>Right now, in early 2021, there isn&#8217;t an Amazon of weed or even a Shopify of weed for several reasons, but primarily because the cannabis industry is still under a federal prohibition. This solution pushes the cannabis industry closer to a modern e-commerce business. With Jane&#8217;s ability to standardize and auto-populate product listings, and Leafly&#8217;s deep point of sale integrations, both the consumer and dispensary sees benefits.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke to Leafly and Jane&#8217;s CEOs on this partnership. It&#8217;s clear that the two are excited about this project and see this partnership as a watershed moment for retail cannabis.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Dispensaries] don&#8217;t have a solution that can be seamless like a Shopify or Amazon,&#8221; Jane&#8217;s CEO Socrates Rosenfeldsaid. &#8220;I think, together with Jane&#8217;s ability to cleanse information in real-time, and essentially automate e-commerce for large brick and mortar selling sellers, combining that with Leafly&#8217;s consumer marketplace, we are making shopping for cannabis as simple as shopping on Amazon.&#8221;</p>
<p>TK explained that he sees this partnership goes behind an Amazon-like shopping experience. He sees this as a way of returning value and protecting local dispensaries by empowering them with technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problems in cannabis are unique enough, and the plant has a complexity that we want to honor,&#8221; Leafly CEO Yoko Miyashita said. We don&#8217;t think we can get there with antiquated ways of doing things. It&#8217;s bringing the intentionality around shared values to innovate and ultimately empower the communities that we serve.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Identity and access management service Okta today launched its new design system, both for its own corporate and brand use, but also as an open-source project under the <a href="https://github.com/okta/odyssey">Apache 2.0 license</a>. The <a href="https://odyssey.okta.design/">Odyssey Design System</a>, as the company calls it, is similar to the likes of Google&#8217;s Material Design or Microsoft&#8217;s Fluent Design. It may not have quite the same number of features, but what makes it stand out is a focus on accessibility, with every element of the design system being compliant with the W3&#8217;s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Brian Hansen, Okta&#8217;s SVP of Design, told me that until now, the company didn&#8217;t really have a unified design system. Instead, it had what he called a &#8220;glorified pattern library.&#8221; And while the engineers loved it, because it allowed them to build new UIs quickly, it was hard for the team to add new patterns. &#8220;And so it was limited in what it could do,&#8221; Hansen said. &#8220;And what you ended up having to do sometimes is compromise &#8212; particularly as a designer &#8212; and kind of shove the square peg into the round hole.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108572" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_BrandSystem.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108572" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2108572" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_BrandSystem.png" alt="" width="576" height="629" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_BrandSystem.png 576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_BrandSystem.png?resize=137,150 137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_BrandSystem.png?resize=275,300 275w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_BrandSystem.png?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2108572" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Okta</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now that Okta has moved beyond its early startup roots, though, the team decided that it was time to go back to the drawing board and build a more fully-featured design system for the company &#8212; and you may soon see it yourself in Okta&#8217;s sign-in widget, which is where most users are likely to encounter it. But it&#8217;s worth remembering that Okta, the platform, also offers a plethora of backend tools for admins that most users never see. Those admins typically want a very information-dense user experience and a design that makes it easy for them to get things done and move on. Okta&#8217;s third group of users, Hansen stressed, is developers and what matters a lot to them &#8212; in addition to all the technical details &#8212; is documentation, which has to be easily readable (from a design perspective).</p>
<p>As Hansen noted, though, internally, it wasn&#8217;t a realistic project to simply switch every surface area to Odyssee at once. &#8220;As a designer, you want everything to be perfect all at once. But you also have to be pragmatic and live with some things that aren&#8217;t perfect,&#8221; he acknowledged. So while the Okta brand is now getting this refresh and some of the user-facing services, it&#8217;ll take a while before every Okta service can make this move.</p>
<p>For the admin console, for example, Hansen&#8217;s team decided that it would take years to switch out the UI. So instead, the team opted for a bridge strategy where it created the style sheets to essentially mimic the Odyssee design. &#8220;Then we can cut over to Odyssee-native components and they&#8217;ll blend in. We can&#8217;t have a Franken app &#8212; we can&#8217;t have two different generations of UI coexisting. That to me just ruins trust. No one would be happy with that,&#8221; Hansen said.</p>
<p>Developers who want to give Odyssee a try for their own projects can do so and <a href="https://odyssey.okta.design/components/">explore the different components it has to offer</a>. And designers can <a href="https://www.figma.com/files/676870123940302956/project/2512934/Odyssey-UI">try it out in Figma</a>, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft today launched Viva, a new &#8220;employee experience platform,&#8221; or, in non-marketing terms, its new take on the intranet sites most large companies tend to offer their employees. This includes standard features like access to internal communications built on integrations with SharePoint, Yammer and other Microsoft tools. In addition, Viva also offers access to team analytics and an integration with LinkedIn Learning and other training content providers (including the likes of SAP SuccessFactors), as well as what Microsoft calls Viva Topics for knowledge sharing within a company.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like most employees, you know that your company spends a lot of money on internal communications and its accompanying intranet offerings &#8212; and you then promptly ignore that in order to get actual work done. But Microsoft argues that times are changing, as remote work is here to stay for many companies, even after the pandemic (hopefully) ends. Even if a small percentage of a company&#8217;s workforce remains remote or opts for a hybrid approach, those workers still need to have access to the right tools and feel like they are part of the company.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108356" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Learning-resources-in-Microsoft-Viva-Learning.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108356" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2108356" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Learning-resources-in-Microsoft-Viva-Learning.gif" alt="" width="960" height="650" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2108356" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have participated in the largest at-scale remote work experiment the world has seen and it has had a dramatic impact on the employee experience,&#8221; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a pre-recorded video. &#8220;As the world recovers, there is no going back. Flexibility in when, where and how we work will be key.&#8221;</p>
<p>He argues that every organization will require a unified employee experience platform that supports workers from their onboarding process to collaborating with their colleagues and continuing their education within the company. Yet as employees work remotely, companies are now struggling to keep their internal culture and foster community among employees. Viva aims to fix this.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Viva is powered by Microsoft 365 and all of the tools that come with that, as well as integrations with Microsoft Teams, the company&#8217;s flagship collaboration service, and even Yammer, the employee communication tool it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/19/microsoft-completes-its-1-2b-yammer-acquisition/">acquired back in 2012</a> and continues to support.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/6aDLjVQZmno?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>There are several parts to Viva: Viva Connections for accessing company news, policies, benefits and internal communities (powered by Yammer); Viva Learning for, you guessed it, accessing learning resources; and Viva Topics, the service&#8217;s take on company-wide knowledge sharing. For the most part, that&#8217;s all standard fair in any modern intranet, whether it&#8217;s from a startup provider or an established player like Jive.</p>
<p>Viva Insights feels like the odd one out here, especially after Microsoft&#8217;s kerfuffle around <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/12/01/our-commitment-to-privacy-in-microsoft-productivity-score/">its Productivity Score</a>. The idea here is to give managers insights into whether their team (but not individual team members) are at risk of burnout, for example, in order to encourage them to turn off notifications or set daily priorities (a good manager, I&#8217;d hope, could do this without analytics, but here we are, in 2021). It&#8217;s also meant to help company leaders &#8220;address complex challenges and respond to change by shedding light on organizational work patterns and trends.&#8221; Sure.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWwYHGOB8DI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Because this is Microsoft in 2021, there&#8217;s also a lot of talk about employee well-being in today&#8217;s announcement. For most employees, that means fewer meetings, more focus time and turning off notifications after work. Obviously there are technical tools to help with that, but it&#8217;s really a question of company culture and management. I&#8217;m not sure you need analytics integrated with LinkedIn&#8217;s Glint for that, but you can now have those, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the world of work changes, the next horizon of innovation will come from a focus on creativity, engagement and well-being so organizations can build cultures of resilience and ingenuity,&#8221; said Jared Spataro, corporate vice president, Microsoft 365. &#8220;Our vision is to deliver a platform for the employee experience that helps organizations create a thriving culture with engaged employees and inspiring leaders.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div title="Page 1">
<p id="speakable-summary">With more of us spending significant amounts of time at home because of Covid-19, our attention has turned increasingly to how and what we eat. Even for those who like to cook, but especially for those who might not have the time or inclination, it can be a challenge to come up with tasty, nutritious, and new things to eat all the time. Today, one of the startups that has seen a lift in its business as a result of that is announcing a round of funding to expand its operations.</p>
<p><a href="http://tovala.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tovala</a>, the smart oven and meal kit service, has closed a Series C of $30 million. David Rabie, the Chicago startup&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that it plans to use the funding in large part to open a second facility, most likely in Utah, to help with fresh food distribution to the western half of the U.S. Other investments will include improving customer service and bringing in more talent.</p>
<p>It will also slowly start to bring in more options for pre-made meals and recipes: Rabie said it is working on a service with leading restaurants and chefs to create meals to sell and cook in the Tovala oven.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We think we can come closer to the restaurant experience because of the oven,&#8221; said Rabie. &#8220;By pre-making food rather than just reheating, we think we can open up reach for a local restaurant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Left Lane Capital, with Finistere Ventures, Comcast Ventures, OurCrowd, Origin Ventures, Pritzker Group Venture Capital, and Joe Mansueto &#8212; all previous backers &#8212; also participating.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/08/meet-tovala-a-smart-oven-that-aims-to-perfectly-cook-ready-made-meals-in-under-30-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">incubated at Y Combinator</a>, Tovala has attracted other interesting investors in the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/tyson-foods-invests-in-tovalas-new-oven-and-meal-kit-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including poultry giant Tyson</a>. Notably, this is the second round of funding for the startup in the space of six months, after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/chicagos-tovala-gobbles-up-20m-for-its-smart-ovenmeal-kit-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">picked up $20 million in a Series B last June</a>.</p>
<p>As with that previous round, the valuation is not being disclosed today. However, the company has hit some significant numbers, evidenced by this funding, which point to how its value may well be on the rise.</p>
<p>Annualized revenue grew tenfold in the last 18 months (that is, including growth before Covid-19); employee count for the year is up 40%; the company has passed 3 million meals shipped; and the company says that its ovens are being used 32 times on average each month by their owners (a stat it can track because those devices are connected).</p>
<p>But it is still not disclosing total user numbers, Rabie said.</p>
<p>Tovala&#8217;s oven sells for $299, but the company usually knocks off $100 if you also commit to six of its $11.99 meals (which feeds one person) over the next six months. Right now &#8212; possibly to tap into the wave of people who are rethinking how they eat in the wake of restaurant closures and simply spending more time at home &#8212; it seems Tovala is offering discounts of up to $130 to those buying the oven without the meal obligation, dropping the oven price down to about $170.</p>
<p>In addition to the company&#8217;s own pre-made trays that you pop in the oven and then garnish when complete (garnishes are included), Tovala&#8217;s oven can also cook hundreds of pre-made dishes and meals sold in stores by way of scanning package barcodes; and recipes that it devises and you can make yourself and program the oven to cook by way of the Tovala app. You can also use the Tovala in the same way that you might use any countertop oven, to toast, steam, bake and broil whatever you choose to independent of all that.</p>
<p>A profusion of meal kit and food delivery businesses, which let you order things to eat at the tap of a finger, have changed how a lot of people think about food at home.</p>
<p>All of them are built in aid of making the process of eating eaiser. But in that wider selection of options, Tovala has been building out its business in the hopes that it can cover a specific niche: people who want to eat fresh food they cook at home, but who don&#8217;t have time or interest in putting those meals together &#8212; not even when they come with items precut and measured by meal kit companies.</p>
<p>However, that is just one side of the business: Tovala&#8217;s ovens, Rabie said, are a central part of the vertical integration that the company has built, and even with the stories you might hear about how &#8220;hardware is hard&#8221;, they are here to stay as part of the proposition.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in the business of getting high quality meals to people, and the oven is our vehicle for doing that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are both a tech and food company, and at no point do I see us getting out of oven business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having said that, the company is also expanding with partnerships with others that produce ovens, too.</p>
<p>Specifically, Tovala has a deal with LG to embed its software in LG ovens, to enable them to cook Tovala&#8217;s meals and the other dishes that can be programmed with its app and barcode scanning system. Rabie said the deal made sense since the kinds of full-sized LG ovens that will run Tovala&#8217;s software are &#8220;not the kind of product line that we will get into.&#8221;</p>
<p>It appears that LG is not an investor, and it&#8217;s not clear when these new devices will be rolled out: the deal between the two was announced <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/press-release/lg-expands-roster-of-smart-kitchen-partnerships-with-unique-tovala-integration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Still, that partnership is a mark of how the hardware companies that are building connected appliances, and services around them, are knitting together more closely with incumbents to take their next scaling steps.</p>
<p>In at least two instances, that has led to would-be competitors getting acquired: BBQ giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/weber-acquires-smart-cooking-start-up-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weber snapped up smart oven startup June</a> (which it had also invested in previously) in January. And back in 2017, <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/02/06/anova-electrolux/?_ga=2.240598923.907098425.1612175151-209244718.1579131500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrolux acquired sous vide startup Anova for $250 million</a>.</p>
<p>An exit of that kind may or may not be on the menu for Tovala, but it&#8217;s a signal of the options that the startup has for moving from appetiser to main course in the future.</p>
<p>For now, the idea is to stay independent and grow, though. Rabie had told me that Left Lane&#8217;s interest was based on how it saw Tovala as a &#8220;Peloton&#8221;-like category definer for smart food preparation at home, in part because of how it could become part of a person&#8217;s daily habits and routines.</p>
<p>“The pairing of a meal subscription with a connected device has enabled Tovala to achieve a customer retention rate that is a step-function better than anything else we’ve seen in food delivery — in many ways similar to what Peloton achieved in a traditionally low-retention fitness industry,” said Jason Fiedler, co-founder and managing partner at Left Lane Capital, in a statement. “Our team brings a proven track record of investing in category-defining consumer subscription businesses, and we’re excited about Tovala’s potential to be the next major food tech company.” Fiedler is joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was only a matter of time before application programming interfaces came for the carbon credit offsets &#8212; the voluntary programs that allow companies to cancel out their greenhouse gas emissions (on paper) by financing renewable energy projects or carbon sequestration projects globally.</p>
<p>Massive e-commerce and payments companies Shopify and Stripe are already providing emissions offsets as a service for their customers, but now a clutch of startups are looking to automate the process through software.</p>
<p>Among them are<a href="https://www.cloverly.com/"> Cloverly</a>, a startup launched internally by the massive southeastern utility, Southern Company; <a href="https://patch.com/">Patch</a>, which was launched by two alums from the apartment management and short-term rental service, Sonder; <a href="https://www.cooler.dev/">Cooler.dev</a> and now <a href="https://pachama.com/api">Pachama</a>, which operates its own international offset marketplace focusing on reforestation and forest management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/investors-and-utilities-are-seeding-carbon-markets-with-new-startups/">new movement among early stage companies</a> to launch services for businesses and consumers that offer ways to examine and reduce their environmental footprint.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dmjZCxSkr6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/investors-and-utilities-are-seeding-carbon-markets-with-new-startups/">Investors and utilities are seeding carbon markets with new startups</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Investors and utilities are seeding carbon markets with new startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/investors-and-utilities-are-seeding-carbon-markets-with-new-startups/embed/#?secret=dmjZCxSkr6" data-secret="dmjZCxSkr6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For Pachama, the idea of incorporating an API into the business model was baked into the business plan from the beginning, according to the company&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive, Diego Saez Gil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things got accelerated when we closed Shopify as a customer,&#8221; Gil said. &#8220;Shopify wanted to offer carbon neutral services. And they do. And we are already selling carbon credits to them, but we we were processing orders in a manual way&#8230; If you want to do this at scale, you need to automate the purchase of credits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Things accelerated for Pachama after the company inked another deal with the massive logistics company, Shipbob, which is offering their customers carbon neutral fulfillment services, Gil said.</p>
<p>In contrast with companies like Patch and Cloverly, Gil feels Pachama has an advantage thanks to its ability to tap its own offset marketplace to provide credits.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have the marketplavce and verification and monitoring service for everything that we bring through our platform,&#8221; Gil said.</p>
<p>Having this kind of background could provide greater transparency into the quality of the offsets on offer.</p>
<p>Carbon offsets have proven to be a useful, if fraught, mechanism for combating climate change. While most projects provide real benefits to communities in the form of renewable energy or reclaimed forestland or the preservation of existing forests and land, there can be problems with double counting or simply fraudulent projects whose value as a carbon offset is overstated.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-nature-conservancy-carbon-offsets-trees/">series</a> of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-17/the-real-trees-delivering-fake-climate-progress-for-corporate-america">articles</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/ben_elgin">Ben Elgin</a> at Bloomberg News underscore the breadth of the problem, which even managed to include projects from well respected organizations like <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/">The Nature Conservancy</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This comes to the question of net additionality,&#8221; said Gil. &#8220;What is the actual additional carbon sequestration or carbon avoidance of everything that&#8217;s around the project&#8230; We need to have a science based approach and very conservative assumptions when assessing the value of offsets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Transparency and accountability are critical to the development, monitoring and management of these kinds of offsets, especially as these offsets assume a more central role for companies looking to dramatically reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with their operations.</p>
<p>And these offsets are only a stop-gap measure. Ultimately businesses need to remove carbon emissions from their own operations as quickly as possible to reduce the risk of climate change having an even greater impact on society.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s super exciting to me that there are a lot of companies that want to offer carbon neutral services. That&#8217;s going to become the norm, and they&#8217;re going to do it because customers want that,&#8221; said Gil.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://joompay.com/">Joompay</a>, a startup with an iOS and Android app similar to Venmo and TransferWise, has now launched in Europe after obtaining a Luxembourg Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license. The app allows people to send and receive money with anyone, instantly and for free. However, it enters a crowded market, competing with peer to peer payment features from the likes of Revolut, N26, Monese and Monzo. Joompay was started by the founders of Joom, an ecommerce marketplace.</p>
<p>Users just need to know an email or a phone number to send money to someone — or a custom paytag that does not reveal any personal details. They can jointly pay a bill, make purchases online and send money to someone in another country. It also allows users to create customizable payment pages, share their personal Joompay URL, collect money from customers, and receive donations, not unlike Paypal.</p>
<p>&#8220;The app has been engineered to deliver a best-in-class and the first pan-European experience of peer-to-peer payment solutions,&#8221; Yuri Alekseev, CEO and co-founder of Joompay said in a statement. &#8220;The increasing popularity of non-cash payments during the pandemic ensured us that now is an excellent opportunity for further development.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In December, Joompay became a Principal Member of the Visa card scheme, allowing it to issue its new Joompay cards across Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Genetics testing and genome research company 23andMe is set to <a href="https://mediacenter.23andme.com/press-releases/23andme-merges-with-vagc/">go public</a> via a merger with special purpose acquisition corp (SPAC) VG Acquisition Corp, a vehicle set up by Richard Branson and his company Virgin Group. The transaction is expected to result in 23andMe having around $984 million in cash available at close to spend on product development, hires and other growth strategies, and will value the company at around $3.5 billion, close to the total cited by an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/23andme-is-said-to-be-in-talks-to-go-public-via-branson-spac">earlier report</a> detailing the talks leading up to this deal.</p>
<p>23andMe, founded in 2006 by CEO Anne Wojcicki, Linda Avey and Paul Cusenza, has raised a total of just under $900 million to date, including an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/23andme-raises-82-5-million-in-new-funding/">$85 million Series F round</a> announced last December. The company was one of the first to debut at-home genetic testing for individual consumers, providing kits that people can use to find out more about their own DNA, and what it says about their potential health issue, ancestry and more.</p>

<p>More recently, the company has turned its massive genomic data store into an opt-in genetic research resource that is used for discovery of future therapies and treatments. It also monetizes through aggregated, anonymized sharing of the data it collects with third-parties, for research and business purposes.</p>
<p>The deal will include $25 million each invested into the private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction that accompanies the merger from Wojcicki and from Richard Bransons. It&#8217;s expected to close in the second quarter of this year, and the resulting company will be listed on the NYSE under the ticker &#8220;ME.&#8221;</p>
<p>The current SPAC craze has proved a path to an exit for a number of startups, and long-private companies like 23andMe that technically still fit our definition because of the lack of an exit event, but that have also seemed content to rely on private investors to supply their cash reserves for a long time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://monkey.exchange/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monkey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a financial marketplace for receivables in Latin America, has raised $6 million in Series A funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quona Capital and Kinea Ventures co-led the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The São Paulo-based startup was founded in 2016 by a trio that includes former Citi investment banker Gustavo Müller, Bruno Oliveira (who worked in strategic planning for Telefonica) and Felipe Adorno, an ex-senior developer for Netshoes and Infracommerce.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monkey has developed what it describes as Supply Chain Finance (SCF) programs for small and medium enterprises. So what does that mean exactly? It pairs up SMEs with large enterprises such as Brazilian petrochemical giant Petrobras and Fiat Chrysler, and banks. Through its network, the company claims that buyers can “find the best receivables in the market, suppliers get the best sales conditions, and sponsors strengthen their businesses and production chains.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monkey was founded on the premise that the Brazilian financial system is highly concentrated among just a few players, with little competition &#8212; a common refrain in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have high rates, the spreads are crazy and it’s almost impossible for small and medium companies to access additional capital at a reasonable price,” CEO Müller told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monkey’s goal, he said, is to solve SMEs frustrations by creating “a competitive environment that brings multiple financial institutions onto Monkey&#8217;s platform to compete for the purchase of SMEs’ receivables with top tier buyers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Monkey has 55 large companies on its platform, many of whom signed on in 2020, leading the startup to see its trading volume surge from about $187 million to $1.5 billion over the course of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Whittle, partner and co-founder of Quona Capital, said his firm &#8212; which invests in startups focused on fintech for inclusion in emerging markets &#8212; was impressed with what he described as Monkey’s “novel approach.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By combining buyer-sanctioned marketplaces and auction-based pricing through a multi-funder platform, small and medium enterprises in Brazil have access to credit in a way that they never have before, making the cost of capital more affordable, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we&#8217;re excited about with Monkey is how it is opening up access to Supply Chain Finance for all the suppliers of larger enterprises, not just the large and mid-sized ones that have typically had access to it,” Whittle told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its fresh capital to double its team of 40 in 2021, and to grow operations not only in Brazil, but across Latin America by providing the same offerings for its own clients in other countries. It also plans to use the money to improve user experience and roll out new products such as a credit card marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We actually think that what they&#8217;re doing is fundamentally different to the way that Supply Chain Finance has been done anywhere around the globe,” Whittle said. “Typically these have been relationships between one bank and a buyer. And what Monkey is doing is kind of turning it on its head with a value proposition that we think is super strong for all three participants in the marketplace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quona’s other investments in the region include Creditas, BizCapital, Neon, Contabilizei, Kovi, Konfio, Klar and ADDI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinea Ventures is a venture capital fund focused on investments in the financial services and technology space. The new fund is part of one of the main alternative investment managers in Brazil, Kinea Investimentos, which was founded in 2007 in a partnership with Itaú Unibanco, and currently has US$13 billion in assets under management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monkey had previously raised about $1.5 million through two seed rounds from investors such as Wayra Brazil – Telefonica Group&#8217;s CVC – and Parallax Ventures.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London and Barcelona based audio-as-a-service SaaS startup <a href="https://www.aflorithmic.ai">Aflorithmic</a> has scooped up $1.3 million in seed funding from <a href="https://crowdmedia.com">Crowd Media Holdings</a>, an Australia-based company focused on influencer-based &#8216;social commerce&#8217; and marketing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s taking a 10% stake in Aflorithmic, per a <a href="https://www.thesentiment.com.au/crowd-media-adds-voice-cloning-for-immersive-celebrity-experiences-in-ai-deal/">press release</a>, where it says the strategic investment is aimed at enabling it to offer FaceTime conversations with celebrities through &#8220;best-in-class voice cloning technology&#8221;.</p>
<p>Two year old Aflorithmic may not have chosen a name that trips off the tongue but it&#8217;s all about speech and audio. It&#8217;s built a platform that offers fully automated, scalable audio production by using AI-driven synthetic media, (&#8220;ethical&#8221;) voice cloning, and audio mastering &#8212; which can be delivered to people&#8217;s ears via websites, mobile apps, smart speakers and so on via its APIs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Text in beautiful audio out&#8221; is its pithy slogan. Prior to the seed round it says it had taken in more than $887k in external capital, including via an oversubscribed pre-seed/FFF/angel round after bootstrapping for the first 10 months.</p>
<p>Sample clips on its website illustrate the personalization element with synthesized (robot-voiced) voice overs greeting a named customer before plunging into the detail of whatever content it&#8217;s been programmed to deliver.</p>
<p>Some of Aflorithmic&#8217;s current (proof of concept/pilot) customers are using its tools to create audio books for kids, for personalized narration of wellness/nutrition programs and even a robot butler concierge service for hotel guests. Its business thesis is that demand for audio far outstrips the ability of studio-produced human-spoken voiceovers to deliver.</p>
<p>Hence it reckons synthesized media will be needed to plug the demand gap &#8212; serving up infinite permutations of a voice track, each one personalized to a particular customer of the brand or enterprise. For now it&#8217;s working on around 10 projects with early beta customers, focused on the edtech, martech and health &amp; fitness sectors.</p>
<p>At the same time, the popularity of podcasts and live-voice streaming shows no sign of abating &#8212; speaking to the staying power of audio in a video-heavy era.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Elon Musk busts Clubhouse limit, fans stream to YouTube, he switches to interviewing Robinhood CEO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/elon-musk-goes-live-on-clubhouse-but-with-the-room-full-fans-stream-audio-on-youtube/embed/#?secret=jhNVJIMwVh" data-secret="jhNVJIMwVh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Aflorithmic&#8217;s new investor, Crowd Media Holdings, has rather more ambitious designs on what its tools can help it do &#8212; and talks about &#8216;completely reshaping the way consumers engage in ecommerce&#8217;.</p>
<p>The specific driver for its investment in Aflorithmic (aka AFLR) is a plan to blend synthesized voice with video to let fans engage in &#8220;immersive&#8221; video chats with simulated versions of their favorite celebrities.</p>
<p>Taking a stake in the audio startup to partner on that project helps it de-risk that plan, it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;AFLR brings the audio tech that will replicate a celebrity’s accent, tone and mannerisms as if the celebrity were on the other end of a call,&#8221; Crowd Media writes, noting that &#8220;the actual content&#8221; the (future) cloned celebrity will sweetly whisper to your face will be &#8220;driven by&#8221; its own AI-driven chatbot technology &#8212; based on drawing on a knowledge base of answers built up from responding to more than 180M user-submitted questions (&#8220;via text-only mediums&#8221;).</p>
<p>Turning all that text into soothing synthesized voice is where Aflorithmic comes in. While the video piece of the cloned celebrity plan entails 3D imaging &#8212; with the tech for that being provided by three other synthetic media firms (UK-based Forever Holdings, digital human makers Zoe01 and Uneeq).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Deepfake video app Reface is just getting started on shapeshifting selfie culture&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/deepfake-video-app-reface-is-just-getting-started-on-shapeshifting-selfie-culture/embed/#?secret=0AmOZcikmY" data-secret="0AmOZcikmY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>More broadly, Crowd Media says it will be integrating Aflorithmic’s technology into other of its social commerce applications, including its AI-driven chatbot (CM8) &#8212; which is targeted at customer service use cases across sectors like marketing, education, and health sectors.</p>
<p>For its part, Aflorithmic says it will be using the new funding for R&amp;D for its API audio-production engine, voice cloning, and talent acquisition.</p>
<p>It offers its API-based audio-as-a-service to a range of customers &#8212; noting use-cases such as &#8220;hyper-personalized newsletters and podcasts&#8221; and voice cloning for marketing applications.</p>
<p>It also touts a &#8220;vast&#8221; voice library for customers to choose a robot speaker. But it also lets them record a snippet of their own voice to create personalized audio content through its voice cloning AI.</p>
<p>&#8220;Users can compose professional-quality pieces including music and complex audio engineering, then deliver the final product to any device or platform such as websites, mobile apps, or smart speakers &#8212; all without any previous production experience,&#8221; it writes.</p>
<p>Commenting on the funding in a statement, Timo Kunz, co-founder, and CEO at Aflorithmic, said: “We are excited to learn from Crowd’s experience in empowering companies to reach mass markets, and are pleased to accompany them as they define the future of social commerce. We believe audio creation as we know it is making way for automated, scalable, dynamic audio experiences &#8212; and companies like ours are at the forefront.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Synthetic audio production has a seemingly endless range of functions &#8212; the potential within marketing applications alone is mindblowing,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Imagine Kim Kardashian being a personal shopper for each of her 200M followers, or Lewis Hamilton explaining why YOU personally need the new Pirelli P Zero Rosso. All of this is just around the corner with our tech.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the business model he also told us: &#8220;We use a SaaS model similar to Twilio or Messagebird. There is a baseline monthly subscription based on usage, i.e audio tracks played. On top of that, we charge a fixed sum for cloning a voice. However, we also offer a free tier. For larger collaborations that have a heavy R&amp;D aspect we will negotiate a custom price.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alforithmic&#8217;s other two co-founders are Peadar Coyle and Björn Ühss.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s claim of &#8220;ethical&#8221; voice cloning points to the challenges inherent for all companies working on  commercial tools to power the production of synthesized media.</p>
<p>While a cloned celebrity might just sound like a bit of fun, there is huge potential for misuse and abuse via individual voice cloning &#8212; from phishing scams and identity theft to emotional manipulation and blackmail. Copyright is another consideration.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.aflorithmic.ai/company#ethics">ethics section</a> of its website Alforithmic offers a brief nod to the risks in &#8220;making personalized audio scalable&#8221;. &#8220;With great innovation comes great responsibility,&#8221; it writes, adding: &#8220;We are committed to ethical, fair, transparent AI following the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/understanding-artificial-intelligence-ethics-and-safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK</a>´s and <a href="https://ai.bsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AIHLEG_EthicsGuidelinesforTrustworthyAI-ENpdf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Union’s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence</a>. All our work and voice models and algorithms are only trained on and with the full compliance and approval of the individual data owner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Responding to questions about how it prevents misuse of its voice cloning tech, Kunz told TechCrunch: &#8220;This is a huge point. We thought about the ethics of synthetic audio very early and security is something we take very seriously and plays a key role in our early discussions with potential customers. We treat voice data like sensitive personal information and with the same care. All customer voices we clone need to give us written consent from the original speaker and we have a close look at how they use it &#8212; especially in the early stages.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, our API infrastructure is securely designed to only allow access to paying customers, who have been onboarded and vetted by our team.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We purposefully don’t ride the Deep Fake wave,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Not only does it have negative connotations, but it’s also not purposeful use of the technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the competitive front, the startup points to Descript, which raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/descript-raises-30m-to-build-the-next-generation-of-video-and-audio-editing-tools/">$30M round just last month </a>&#8212; and acquired another voice cloning startup, Lyrebird, back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/descript-audio/">2019</a> &#8212; although its tools cover both video and audio vs Alforithmic being more fully focused on automating the entire audio production process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Descript is positioning itself more as a creator tool, which is great and they are doing fantastic. However, they don’t cover the full production process from text to speech, over music and sound editing to post-production. We think automating this process is a big deal. Taking audio production to the cloud allows for economies of scale and you can create a different audio track for every listener,&#8221; said Kunz.</p>
<p>&#8220;While Descript focuses on a sort of &#8216;studio&#8217; as a &#8216;Photoshop for voice&#8217; to make editing easy, we see ourselves more as a &#8216;Stripe for Audio&#8217; making it very easy for companies to integrate Audio-As-A-Service into their products through our API instead of &#8216;just editing&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;If you use health apps like Peloton as an example, this would allow them to create highly personalized workouts very easily. They could bring a hyper-personalized AI Coach into the workout who would help motivate users to give more and feel like there is a personal trainer next to them that offers motivation based on their previous workout data, personal bests etc.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Regarding video, that was a deliberate choice,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Audio is very personal and getting the nuances right is very complex and hard. We do collaborate with more than one AI video platform though, providing the audio for them because they found out by hard how challenging synthetic audio can be.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most Indians <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/slice-raises-6m-to-help-young-indians-pay-digitally-and-build-credit-score/">can&#8217;t access credit from formal financial institutions</a> because they don&#8217;t have a credit score of any form to prove their creditworthiness.</p>
<p>As an alternative, they look at informal institutions such as pawn shops or more recently, apps that offer loans without any paperwork but could <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-loan-apps-india-deaths">charge interest rates as high as 1,000%</a> and threaten anyone in your phone&#8217;s contact list in case of delays in repayment.</p>
<p>(Google caught wind of this recently, and last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/google-cracks-down-on-personal-loan-apps-in-india-following-abuse-and-outcry/">removed hundreds of such apps from the Play Store in India</a>. But it wasn’t until several people committed suicide in the country in an attempt to save themselves from embarrassment from family, colleagues and society.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Then there&#8217;s gold.</p>
<p>For generations, Indians across the socio-economic spectrum have preferred to stash their savings &#8212; or at least a part of it &#8212; in the form of gold. In fact, such is the demand for gold in India &#8212; Indians stockpile more gold than citizens in any other country &#8212; that the South Asian nation is also one of the world&#8217;s largest importers of this precious metal.</p>
<p>They use this gold not only as a saving instrument, which protects them from the ups-and-downs of the financial market, but also as an asset against which they could get credit. However, selling off your gold in the form of jewellery or otherwise, has a stigma attached to it &#8212; one is so broke that they had to pawn off their last asset of financial security.</p>
<p>Keeping this gold locked in homes &#8212; according to estimates by the World Gold Council, Indians have stashed <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-53590846">25,000 tons of gold</a>, whose value today is over $1.4 trillion &#8212; is also dragging the economy. Monetizing even a third of it can add 2% to the GDP growth rate, analysts say. Banks and other financial institutions love gold as it&#8217;s a great secure asset whose value has only grown over the decades.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/deepakabbot">Deepak Abbot</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nitinmisra">Nitin Misra</a>, two former executives of Paytm, India’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/">most valuable startup</a>, believe that this problem can be solved by digitally transforming lending against gold.</p>
<p>New Delhi has made several efforts, too, to get stashed gold back in circulation through initiatives such as the <a href="https://m.rbi.org.in/Scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=110">gold monetization scheme</a>, but it hasn&#8217;t had much success with it so far.</p>
<p>The core challenge with convincing people to part ways with their gold is that it&#8217;s an emotional asset, said Misra and Abbot in an interview with TechCrunch. Gold jewellery is a show of strength and pride in India, and families pass on their reserve to future generations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Irrespective of your state, religion, community, in India, gold has a certain auspicious sentiment attached to it. You worship it. Even when tax concession and premium price is offered to someone, they can&#8217;t fathom the idea of their necklaces and other jewellery being melted and going away,&#8221; said Misra.</p>
<p>The other challenge is that even when someone absolutely needs to sell their gold, which is often their last resort, to attend a family emergency or other urgent and unavoidable cause, the process of selling it is an awkward and embarrassing experience for many because of the stigma of pawning their family&#8217;s precious property.</p>
<p>In recent years, a handful of firms and startups &#8212; in collaboration with banks &#8212; have attempted to remove this stigma by visiting the customer at their doorstep to some success.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2108697" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nitin-and-Deepak.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="641" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nitin-and-Deepak.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nitin-and-Deepak.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nitin-and-Deepak.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nitin-and-Deepak.jpg?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nitin-and-Deepak.jpg?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nitin-and-Deepak.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Abbot and Misra, pictured above, think they have a better approach and broader idea.</p>
<p>Many people in India keep their gold stash and other precious items in a safe locker at a bank that can charge as high as $65 a month for this service. (Banks require customers to pay the fee annually, however.) There are some downsides to using a bank&#8217;s locker: Accessing this locker is a long-process and can easily take half of your day, if not more. There&#8217;s also no insurance protection on items people keep in the locker. Customers are also required to put up a security deposit of a few hundred dollars to avail this service &#8212; and, there is also a long-waiting period before people can even avail this service.</p>
<p>Through their newfound startup <a href="https://indiagold.co/">indiagold</a>, Abbot and Misra are offering customers a similar locker service for as little as $1.36 a month, which also includes full insurance coverage. The idea, the duo explained, is to make it easier and convenient for people to secure their previous metal reserve.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sign up on indiagold app, our agents come to your house, inspect and weigh the gold, and put it in a tamper proof bag. We also attach an RFID sticker to the bag, which once scanned, can detect if there was any attempt to open it. They then put the bag inside a steel box, which is locked by the customer with their fingerprint. And all of this is being captured through a body camera by one of our agents, which is streaming the feed in real-time to the customer as they leave the premise to the designated vault location,&#8221; said Misra.</p>
<p>With crime rates going up, very few people bark at the idea of securing their jewelries and especially when they know that their property is being insured, the duo said. Once they have deposited their gold stash with indiagold, the startup displays the real-time value of their property and offers a line of credit that could be accessed within seconds.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine if the customer doesn&#8217;t want a loan, but should they ever need it, they have a zero-touch option available. They know that their gold is secured in a locker with their fingerprint, so their jewellery is not going to be melted or broken. If they ever need a line of credit, they can avail it in 30 seconds without talking to anyone, or even having someone quietly visit their home,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they have deposited multiple jewellery items, they can avail loan against just some of them. Say if the person knows that they need to use some necklace in an event soon, they can take a loan against other items in that case. And we charge at max 1% interest rate on the loan,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>This is just part of the problem that indiagold, which kickstarted its operation late last year, is trying to address.</p>
<p>It has built a platform that determines the credit worthiness of its customers, and provides APIs to banks and other lenders who are trying to reach this untapped market.</p>
<p>The startup, which is currently operational in Delhi-NCR, recently raised $2 million in a financing round led by Leo Capital, with participation from high-profile investors including Kunal Shah of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/india-cred-raises-81m-buys-back-1-2m-shares-from-employees/">Cred</a>, Amrish Rau of PineLabs, Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal of Snapdeal, Ashneer Grover and Bhavik Koladiya of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/bharatpe-raises-75m-to-help-indian-merchants-accept-digital-payments-and-secure-working-capital/">BharatPe</a>, Miten Sampat of Cred and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/indias-mx-player-expands-to-us-uk-and-other-markets-in-international-push/">MX Player</a>, Sameer Mehta of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/indian-electronics-and-lifestyle-brand-boat-raises-100-million-from-warburg-pincus/">Boat</a>, Ashish Sharma of Innoven Capital, Ankit Agarwal of Alteria Capital, Rahul Soota of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/indias-30-year-old-mymoneymantra-raises-15m-to-scale-its-financial-services-marketplace/">MyMoneyMantra</a>, Ramakant Sharma of Livspace, and Blume Founders Fund.</p>
<p>“We think this is the only way this huge market can really be addressed, and now we are beginning to scale our efforts,” said Misra.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We talk a lot these days about the future of work and the proliferation of new and better tools for distributed workforces, but companies focused on developing fleet management software &#8212; even if they have not really been viewed as &#8220;tech startups&#8221; &#8212; have been working on this problem for many years already. Today, one of the older players in the field is announcing its first significant round of investment, a sign both of how investors are taking more notice of these B2B players, and how the companies themselves are seeing a new opportunity for growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://bigchange.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BigChange</a>, a UK startup that builds fleet management software to help track and direct jobs to those on the go whose &#8220;offices&#8221; tend to be vehicles, has closed a round of £75 million ($102 million at today&#8217;s rates). U.S. investor <a href="https://www.greathillpartners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Hill Partners</a>.</p>
<p>The company has built a business by tapping into the advances of technology to build apps for field service engineers and those back at the mothership who run operations and help manage their jobs, workers who in the past might have used phone calls, paperwork and lots of extra round trips between offices and sites in order to run things.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I founded BigChange to revolutionise mobile workforce management and bring it into the 21st century. Our platform eliminates paperwork, dramatically cuts carbon, creates efficiency, promotes safer driving and means that engineers are spending less time on the roads or filling out forms and more time completing jobs,&#8221; said founder and CEO Martin Port in a statement. &#8220;We are incredibly excited to partner with Great Hill and leverage their successful track-record scaling vertical and enterprise software companies both in the UK and overseas.”</p>
<p>BigChange said that Great Hill&#8217;s stake values the company at £100 million (or $136 million). <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/private-equity-sale-is-big-change-for-entrepreneur-martin-port-b63wd2w2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One report</a> points to part of that funding being a secondary transaction, with Port pocketing £48 million of that. The company has been around since 2012 and appears to be profitable. It has raised very little in funding (around $2 million) before this, at one point trying to raise an angel round but cancelling the process before it completed, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/156589-30/company/profile#general-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filings tracked by PitchBook</a>.</p>
<p>As the technology industry continues to become essentially a part of every other industry in the world, this <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">deal is notable as a sign of how its</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> boundaries are expanding and getting more blurred. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">BigChange is not a London startup, nor from the Cambridge or Oxford areas, nor from Bristol or anywhere in the south. It&#8217;s from the north, specifically Leeds &#8212; a city that has an impressive<a href="https://www.seedtable.com/startups-leeds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> number of startups in it</a> even if these have not had anything like the funding or attention that startups in cities and areas in the South have attracted. (One eye-catching exception is the online store <a href="http://pharmacy2u.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pharmacy2U</a>: the Leeds startup has been <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/57772-09/company/profile#investors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backed</a> by Atomico, BGF and others: given the interest of companies like Amazon to grow in this space, it&#8217;s likely one to watch.)</span></p>
<p>One of the big themes in technology right now is how a lot of the action is getting decentralised &#8212; a result of many of us now working remotely to stave off the spread of Covid-19, many people using that situation to reconsider whether they need to be living in any specific place at all, and subsequently choosing to relocate from expensive regions like the Bay Area to other places for better quality of life.</p>
<p>There are of course other cities like Manchester, Edinburg, Cardiff and more in the U.K. with technology ecosystems (just as there have been across many cities in the U.S. for years). But when one of these, this time out of Leeds, attracts a significant funding round, it points to the potential of something similar playing out in the U.K., too, with not just talent but more money going into regions beyond the usual suspects.</p>
<p>The other part of the decentralisation story here focuses on what BigChange is actually building.</p>
<p>Here, it&#8217;s one of the many companies that have dived into the area of building apps and larger pieces of software aimed not at &#8220;knowledge workers&#8221; but those who do not sit at desks, are on the move, and tend to work with their hands. For those who are on the road, it has apps to better manage their jobs and routes (which it calls JourneyWatch). For those back in the dispatch part of the operations, it has an app to track them better and use the software to balance the jobs and gain further analytics from the work (sold as JobWatch). These work on ruggedised devices and lean on SaaS architecture for distribution, and there are some 50,000 people across some 1,500 organizations using its apps today, with those customers located around the world, but with a <a href="https://www.bigchange.com/recommendations/customer-success-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large proportion of them in the U.K. itself</a>.</p>
<p>BigChange is not the only company targeting workers in the field. We covered a significant funding round for another one of them out of North America, Jobber, which builds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/jobber-raises-60m-as-its-platform-for-home-service-professionals-hits-100k-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">software for service professionals</a>, just last month. Others tapping into the opportunity of bringing tech to a wider audience beyond knowledge workers include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/hover-secures-60m-for-a-3d-imaging-platform-used-to-assess-and-fix-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hover</a> (technology and a wider set of tools for home repair people to source materials, make pricing and work estimates, and run the administration of their businesses) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/gosite-snags-40m-to-help-smbs-bring-their-businesses-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoSite</a> (a platform to help all kinds of SMBs — the key factor being that many of them are coming online for the first time — build out and run their businesses). Others in this specific area include <a href="http://klipboard.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Klipboard</a>, <a href="http://azuga.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azuga</a>, <a href="http://servicetitan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ServiceTitan</a>, <a href="http://servicemax.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ServiceMax</a> and more.</p>
<p>You might recognise the name Great Hill Partners as the PE firm that has taken majority stakes in a range of media companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/great-hill-partners-acquires-gizmodo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gizmodo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/04/ziff-davis-acquired-by-former-time-exec-vivek-shah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ziff Davis</a> (way back when) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/private-equity-firm-great-hill-partners-acquires-stock-media-service-storyblocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Storyblocks</a>, and backed companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/06/the-realreal-ropes-in-50-million-in-new-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Real</a> and <a href="https://www.greathillpartners.com/media/great-hill-partners-and-charlesbank-capital-partners-lead-535-million-private-placement-in-wayfair" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a>. In this case, the company was attracted by how BigChange was being adopted by a very wide range of industries that fall under &#8220;field service&#8221; as part of their workload.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike niche players that focus on smaller customers and specific sub-verticals, Martin and his accomplished team have built a flexible, all-in-one platform for field service professionals and operators,&#8221; said Drew Loucks, a partner at Great Hill Partners, in a statement. &#8220;BigChange’s technology is differentiated not only by its ability to serve commercial and residential clients of nearly any scale or vertical, but also by its award-winning product development and customer service capabilities.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a year since I covered <a href="https://www.manomano.fr">ManoMano</a>, the French e-commerce platform focused on DIY, home improvement and gardening products. And 2020 has been a successful years as the company’s gross merchandise volume doubled to €1.2 billion ($1.45 billion at today’s rate).</p>
<p>ManoMano’s sales are also accelerating as the company reported a 50% increase in 2019 gross merchandise volume compared to 2018.</p>
<p>When it comes to “softer” metrics, the company now attracts 50 million unique visitors per month, which represents a 70% year-over-year increase. There are 7 million active clients on the platform — that’s a 100% increase.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to France, ManoMano is operating in Spain, Italy, Germany, the U.K. and Belgium. In 2021, the company plans to double down on Northern Europe (Germany and the U.K.) and improve the experience for both merchants and customers.</p>
<p>France still represents 60% of the company’s sales volume. And the company is currently profitable on this market if you look at this segment independently from the rest of the company.</p>
<p>While ManoMano operates a marketplace, it also offers a fulfillment service for third-party retailers. The company is also growing nicely on the professional segment with its <a href="https://www.manomano.fr/pro">ManoManoPro</a> vertical.</p>
<p>The startup has raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/01/manomano-raises-125-million-for-its-home-improvement-e-commerce-platform/">$125 million</a> in 2019 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/manomano-raises-139-million-for-its-home-improvement-e-commerce-platform/">$139 million</a> in 2020. It is still actively hiring and growing the team. There are currently 650 employees and the company could work with 1,000 people at the end of 2021.</p>

<p>Sure further assets that the venture firm &#8212; 29-year-old <a href="https://www.iacapgroup.com/">IA Capital Group</a> of New York &#8212; has continued to &#8220;harass&#8221; Sure over information rights that it is no longer entitled to receive, given its conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>As why he thinks there&#8217;s still interest in his company, Sure&#8217;s founder and CEO, Wayne Slavin, suggests that it&#8217;s because Sure&#8217;s growth is outpacing that of Boost. &#8220;We&#8217;ve grown headcount almost 50% through COVID,&#8221; says Slavin. Sure now has annual recurring revenue in the &#8220;double digit millions&#8221; and is profitable, he adds, hinting that Boost has not fared as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Andy Lerner, a managing partner with IA Capital who has been with the firm since 1995, disputes Sure&#8217;s characterization of events. &#8220;It&#8217;s very important [to note] that we did not invest knowingly in two companies that were direct competitors,&#8221; he said earlier today when asked about Sure&#8217;s claims.</p>
<p>Alex Maffeo, a former investor with IA Capital Group who sat on Sure&#8217;s board before incubating Boost inside the venture firm, then leaving to become its CEO, said in response to Sure&#8217;s claims: &#8220;We have no knowledge of the situation between Sure and IA Capital, nor do we receive any information about any of the companies in IA&#8217;s portfolio. I haven&#8217;t worked at the firm for almost four years now, and Boost has been focused on the same mission to power insurtech startups and other digital distribution partners from the start. We have always and continue to wish Wayne and his team nothing but the best as both of our companies thrive in our respective lanes.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what went so awry here? The conflict between the two sides dates back to nearly 2017, when IA Capital led an $8 million Series A round for Sure. More specifically, it wrote the company a $2 million check from a fund whose sole limited parter is the insurance giant Prudential.</p>
<p>Lerner says that at the time, Sure was a &#8220;mobile insurance distributor,&#8221; one that was focused on items in transit, including, &#8220;flight insurance, smart phone insurance, baggage insurance.&#8221; Slavin says this is false, however. He says Sure &#8212; which sells its software as a service to large companies like Tesla, Intuit, Mastercard, and other customers that use its technology to run their digital insurance programs &#8212; had already begun working instead on an embedded insurance API strategy soon after its seed round closed in 2015.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">That Boost offers the same service today could be coincidence, but Slavin doesn&#8217;t think so. </span>In fact, according to both sides, a rift began to emerge soon after IA Capital, which invests solely in insuretech startups, began working on an internal program called &#8220;Project Boost&#8221; led by Maffeo. The original idea, says Slavin, was for this company to offer insurtech startups the capital needed to quickly bring new insurance products to market, and for it to raise $40 million toward this end. When a big round didn&#8217;t materialize, IA Capital and Maffeo pivoted and with seed funding from IA Capital, Maffeo resigned as an investor and joined what became Boost Insurance as CEO.</p>
<p>The crux of the problem, says Slavin, is that without discussing these moves with Sure, Boost quickly began to &#8220;drift in our lane.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Slavin, this was especially worrisome given that Maffeo had spent almost a full year on the Sure board and understood its prospects, some of the intricacies of its tech, and what was on its roadmap. Unsure of how to fight back, it decided with its board to invoke a provision of its investment documents with IA Capital that at least enabled it to stop providing IA Capital with the same level of information to which it was entitled earlier. By late 2019, it stopped sending IA Capital anything at all.</p>
<p>That hasn&#8217;t sat so well with Lerner, who maintains that Sure and Boost &#8220;are not that similar,&#8221; and that, in any case, because &#8220;once in a while they overlap,&#8221; his firm hopped off the board when Sure closed its Series B round in 2018, a $12.5 million financing led by the publicly traded insurance holding company W. R. Berkley.</p>
<p>More, says Lerner, after some &#8220;back and forth,&#8221; IA Capital agreed to accept a more bare-bones &#8220;income statement and balance sheet, so we [could] value and report on Sure to our LPs every quarter. We didn&#8217;t ask for any sensitive information or technical information or who its customers are. We basically just wanted financial information to do our audit and value our stake . . . and Sure said they wanted to send us zero information.&#8221;</p>
<p>With some animus now on both sides, what happens from here is the biggest question.</p>
<p>Slavin suggests he was willing to quietly endure the bad governance &#8220;nightmare that we&#8217;re living and that [IA Capital] just won&#8217;t acknowledge,&#8221; he says. But a surprise letter from IA Capital&#8217;s attorneys a few days before this past Christmas &#8212; one that asked for private shareholder information &#8212; went too far, he says.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, he wrote to all of Sure&#8217;s shareholders and told them about such these behind-the-scenes wranglings for the first time. Through Sure&#8217;s attorney, Evan Bienstock of Fenwick &amp; West, the company also told IA Capital that if its investor, Prudential, wants more information about Sure, Sure will provide it to the insurance giant directly. (Prudential did not respond to a request for comment this afternoon.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I probably should have stood up to the bully sooner,&#8221; says Slavin. &#8220;But it&#8217;s really hard when, as the founder, you know you might need that reference check. You might need that gatekeeper to help you along, even though they&#8217;re not necessarily looking out for the interests of the company and the interests of the other shareholders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lerner meanwhile suggests it&#8217;s all been a big misunderstanding, that IA Capital didn&#8217;t realize there was a potential conflict until Boost was &#8220;already well underway.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that IA Capital wants to &#8220;have a great relationship with [Sure]. We regret that there&#8217;s a dispute. We just want them to send us the minimal information so we can audit and do our report to our LPs in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Said Lerner: &#8220;I think we&#8217;re reasonable, and we wanted to work things out. They&#8217;re an insuretech that seems to be doing well, and we&#8217;re a large insuretech VC, and we could certainly be helpful to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked why IA Capital doesn&#8217;t simply sell its shares to existing shareholders, or let Sure buy them back in order to resolve the situation, Lerner claimed his venture firm would be willing to sell its shares, but he said it would first &#8220;need some information to evaluate what&#8217;s a fair price.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alas, Slavin, who says Sure has bumped up against Boost twice recently to win recent deals, says he doesn&#8217;t see how that happens at this point. Too much damage has been done. Besides, he says, &#8220;Andy can discern revenue run rates from a financial statement; he can figure out how big our contracts are based on what he’s asking.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it drags on for all parties.</p>
<p>Sure has raised $23.1 million in funding to date, including from Menlo Ventures and ff Venture Capital.</p>
<p>Boost has meanwhile raised $17 million, including from Coatue, Greycroft, and Tusk Venture Partners.</p>
<p>Slavin says that IA Capital owns less than 5% of Sure. Lerner today declined to say how much of Boost that IA Capital owns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, Quadpay. These are some of the big global players in the buy now, pay later (BNPL) movement. They allow shoppers to purchase products online and pay in installments with nominal or no fees, and have become more prominent due to how the pandemic accelerated e-commerce market growth around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit card companies have filled in this gap for a long time. But the problem is credit cards rely on exorbitant fees, leading people to debt in the long run. While the pandemic left many jobless, it taught millennials and Gen Zers &#8212; a growing demographic with more than $200 billion in spending power &#8212; the hard way of sorting out their debt issues. In turn, a number of them have become debt-averse and increased their demand for better financing options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/buy-now-pay-later-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 poll carried out by Motley Fool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> surveyed 1,800+ people on why U.S. consumers use BNPL services. From the survey, 39% of the respondents said they used BNPL services to avoid paying credit card interest rates, while 16.3% said they don&#8217;t like to use credit cards and 14% said their credit cards were maxed out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To millennials, there’s no incentive to own a credit card these days. A shift of preference to buy products on credit at the point-of-sale is on the rise; </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200922005066/en/Buy-Now-Pay-Later-Digital-Spend-Led-by-Klarna-PayPal-Afterpay-to-Double-by-2025-Reaching-680-Billion---Kaleido-Intelligence"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$680 billion will be spent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by global consumers using online POS finance or BNPL over e-commerce channels by 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, as established players continue to have thousands of merchants and millions of users on their platforms, BNPL services are just picking up in Africa.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;In the &#8216;buy now, pay later&#8217; wars, PayPal is primed for dominance&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/in-the-buy-now-pay-later-wars-paypal-is-primed-for-dominance/embed/#?secret=U1cBpW7aXQ" data-secret="U1cBpW7aXQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a continent where debit cards (not credit) are prevalent, the upcoming players are primarily lending companies who have found a way to assess their customers&#8217; credit risk via technology. Gathering data from partnerships with merchants, they use consumers&#8217; shopping habits and purchasing power to drive their BNPL ambitions.</span></p>
<h2>How these platforms assess credit risk</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Nigerian digital bank Carbon </span><a href="https://blog.getcarbon.co/spread-payments-on-purchases-at-zero-interest-with-carbon-zero/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introduced Carbon Zero</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a product that lets customers purchase electronics and gadgets while paying in small installments at a 0% interest rate. However, before a purchase is made, a percentage of the total cost is paid upfront. After that, customers can pay the remaining price over six months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different reasons why such services hardly exist on the continent. For one, the country&#8217;s </span><a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/01/06/digital-lenders-need-data/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit infrastructure is still a work in progress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and most of its citizens have limited purchasing power. So how does Carbon plan to assess risk? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company started in 2012 as a digital lender. But it has since grown to become one of the country&#8217;s few digital banks providing different financial services to its more than 659,000 customers. With extensive experience and a track record of providing loans to Nigerians (in 2020, its loan disbursement volume was $63 million), Carbon has found itself in pole position to enter the buy now, pay later market with Carbon Zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We do not believe that a firm without a track record of lending can provide a similar service, except they have a significant amount of capital to burn. Carbon has been lending in Nigeria for nearly 10 years, so we have a lot of credit history of our customers, and we believe we can assess new customers very well,&#8221; Chijioke Dozie, the company&#8217;s CEO, told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZQM0pKmbuw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nigerian-digital-bank-carbon-hit-240m-in-payments-processed-last-year-up-89-from-2019/">Nigerian digital bank Carbon hit $240M in payments processed last year, up 89% from 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigerian digital bank Carbon hit $240M in payments processed last year, up 89% from 2019&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nigerian-digital-bank-carbon-hit-240m-in-payments-processed-last-year-up-89-from-2019/embed/#?secret=ZQM0pKmbuw" data-secret="ZQM0pKmbuw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dozie says Carbon Zero hopes to be the embodiment of the promise made to its customers years ago to embed finance in their everyday purchase. But there&#8217;s a benchmark to who these customers are. According to the company, Carbon Zero can only be accessed by customers who earn at least ₦200,000 ($500) monthly, representing a small amount of the population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case of finding a market need and product-market fit was slightly different for Egyptian digital lending platform </span><a href="https://shahry.app/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shahry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2019, co-founders </span><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/elrakabawy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sherif ElRakabawy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Mohamed Ewis, while running Yaoota &#8212; Egypt&#8217;s largest shopping engine and price comparison website &#8212; noticed that one of the most frequent requests they got from users was the option to buy products and pay for them later. Simultaneously, the Egyptian pound was experiencing devaluation against the dollar, thereby causing inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders launched Shahry targeting the underbanked part of its young population to pay for products in installments, going head to head with the banks that offered similar services, albeit via credit cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re currently the only buy now, pay later app in Egypt that offers a fully online service with no physical friction or paperwork from signing up to product home delivery,&#8221; the CEO ElRakabawy told TechCrunch.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Shahry’s model does not require a down payment, it does require that users apply for virtual credit through their mobile app, which they use to buy products from Arab e-commerce giant Souq. The company determines creditworthiness using algorithms and a credit risk review based on customer data. The company is also working on an AI model for fully automated instant decisions.</span></p>
<h2>Partnering with merchants and raising capital to compete</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the vertical, BNPL helps merchants drive sales, increase conversion rates and improve transaction sizes at decent percentages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On how it makes money, Shahry takes interests and commission fees from merchants &#8212; a method Carbon Zero adopts. Via Souq, Shahry has Amazon as an online partner, and ElRakabawy says the company plans to onboard hundreds of brick and mortar, and online, merchants later this year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Carbon Zero launched with merchants that are top distributors of authentic electronics and gadgets in Nigeria. Although these merchants sell competing products, Dozie says Carbon doesn&#8217;t control the prices. The company is only concerned with financing the products as other necessities like product pricing, fulfilment and logistics is between the merchant and the customer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have told merchants it&#8217;s in their best interest to provide the best pricing as we will not favour any merchant over the other. Customers can choose which Zero merchant they want to use, and they will vote with their wallet,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To embark on a BNPL journey, a company must have a functioning credit system and a large war chest. This is why the likes of Affirm and Klarna have raised billions, and Afterpay millions, of dollars in investments. While Shahry and Carbon don&#8217;t have those amounts to burn, they will make do with what they have, as is usual with most African startups &#8212; case in point, despite raising just $650,000 in pre-seed investment last year, Shahry claims to have been experiencing double-digit month-on-month growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But ElRakabawy reckons that financing these transactions have put a strain on the business even though the company is yet to scratch the surface of what could be achieved in the Egyptian market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The market is huge and still mostly underserved,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The demand is so big that we&#8217;re currently only capped by the amount of loan capital we can disburse.&#8221; In the coming months, the company plans to close a second round of funding from new and existing investors to meet the growing demand for its service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carbon might be looking to do the same as the company gears up for a Series B in the foreseeable future. However, what is top of mind for Dozie is not fundraising; it is how to tailor the buy now, pay later service, which has become a global phenomenon, to a harsh market like Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We see a lot of potential in the Nigerian market for Carbon Zero. We do not believe we can blindly copy other BNPL players like Affirm or Klarna because they operate in markets that have an established offline and online retail market,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Carbon Zero will not only adapt to its environment to offer payment experience in the retail space</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> but also in other areas where customers need to spread payments &#8212; in travel, education, and healthcare.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Until now <a href="https://www.generalcatalyst.com/">General Catalyst</a> has been better known as a US VC which makes occasional forays into European territory. But that changes with the news today that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-bischoff-65394828/">Chris Bischoff</a>, an experienced London-based investor, joins as Managing Director of its new London office.</p>
<p>Bischoff brings with him an extensive track record of investment across the US and Europe, participating in the fund-raising for Avito, Babylon, Betterment, Cedar, VillageMD, Livongo and Cityblock Health, among others. He joins from the role of senior investment director at venture and growth fund <a href="https://www.kinnevik.com/">Kinnevik AB</a> where he led several investments most notably in the healthcare realm but also participated in deals alongside General Catalyst in companies such as Livongo (now Teladoc, NYSE: TDOC) and Cityblock.</p>
<p>In a statement, Bischoff said: “I’ve known and greatly admired GC for many years and have successfully partnered with the team on multiple occasions. I am strongly aligned with their purpose, approach, and culture, so this is a natural step.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>General Catalyst is no stranger to Europe, having invested most recently in British used-car startup Cazoo, FinTech as a Service company Rapyd, and Remote.com, a platform for managing remote workforces. It’s also an investor in Bloom &amp; Wild, and most recently it led a $44M Series B funding into Multiverse, founded by Euan Blair (former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair’s eldest son). It’s also a long-time investor in food delivery startup Deliveroo.</p>
<p>Last year it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/general-catalyst-just-announced-2-3-billion-in-new-capital-commitments-across-three-funds/">secured</a> $2.3 billion in capital commitments across three funds: a $600 million early-stage fund, a $1 billion growth fund for companies with $10 million-plus in annual revenue and a $700 million “endurance fund” to back large companies doing more than $100 million in sales.</p>
<p>In a statement Hemant Taneja, managing partner, General Catalyst said: “Having invested alongside and worked with Chris as a fellow director, I know firsthand that he shares our commitment to backing and building enduring companies with the potential to materially improve the lives of many.”</p>
<p>Bischoff will be adding to the firm’s bench of healthcare investors given its involvement in Livongo, Cityblock, Oscar, Color and Ro Health, among others.</p>
<p>General Catalyst accelerated its interest in European and Israeli tech companies when managing director Adam Valkin joined from Accel Partners in London, bringing with him plenty of European savvy.</p>
<p>Valkin and Bischoff will run the deals in Europe and Israel, and no doubt more efficiently, now that GC has Bischoff with his feet under a desk in London, even if for the time being that will be a home office desk.</p>
<p>Valkin said: “Europe and Israel have unequivocally become major centers for global-scale innovation, and having Chris on the ground here is a huge asset for our firm. I have known Chris for many years and have observed his talent as an investor, his outstanding portfolio, and importantly, his reputation as a trusted partner for ambitious founders.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Accel, Valkin led investments in Gocardless, Flywire, Fiverr, and Spotify, and then joined General Catalyst in 2013 to build out the New York office.</p>
<p>In an interview, he told me: “In 2015 GC started looking into Europe in a more serious way… perhaps a little bit more opportunistically at that point. We invested in a number of European companies like Brainly in Poland and Fundbox in Israel. And then 2016 was sort of a big year for us because we led both a series A of Lemonade out in Israel, and a growth round and Deliveroo in the UK.”</p>
<p>He said GC decided to get a little bit more organised about Europe, and spent a lot more time with founders there, gradually ramping up its activity.  “So, our European journey essentially began, five, six years ago. And we&#8217;ve become very active there, both in the UK in Europe as well as Israel. The big question for us was when would it make sense to have a team on the ground. And we actually got to know Chris about five years ago, in the context of what we were doing in Europe, and also just as a really important growth stage investor in Europe.”</p>
<p>Bischoff added: “ If you look at what GC has done in Europe, it really is across both consumer and enterprise, and across the sector. I’ve done quite a bit in healthcare, obviously, a bit in FinTech and consumer which are pretty large sectors in Europe… it&#8217;s not narrowly focused in Europe.
