										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sure, we&#8217;re heading into a holiday weekend here in America, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the good ship TechCrunch is going to slow down. We&#8217;re diving right back in next week with another installment in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/announcing-the-extra-crunch-live-event-series/">season two of Extra Crunch Live</a>, our regular interview series with startup founders, venture capitalists, and other leaders from the technology community.</p>
<p>This series is for Extra Crunch members, so if you haven&#8217;t signed up you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=jaidaspost">hop on that train right here</a>.</p>
<p>Next week I&#8217;m virtually sitting down with <a href="https://twitter.com/jai_das?lang=en">Jai Das</a>, a well-known managing director at <a href="https://sapphireventures.com/">Sapphire Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Das as invested in companies like MuleSoft (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/salesforce-is-buying-mulesoft-at-enterprise-value-of-6-5-billion/">sold for $6.5 billion</a>), Alteryx (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/24/alteryx-rises-11-in-data-analytics-ipo/">now public</a>), Square (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/19/square-nyse-pop/">also public</a>), Sumo Logic (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/unpacking-the-sumo-logic-s-1-filing/">yep, public</a>) while at Sapphire, having previously worked corporate venture jobs at Intel Capital and Agilent Ventures. (Sapphire was itself originally SAP&#8217;s corporate venture capital arm, but it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/sap-spinout-sapphire-ventures-raises-1-4b-for-new-investments/">split off from its parent in 2011, rebranded, and kept on raising funds</a>.)</p>
<p><em>Here <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/why-bessemers-byron-deeter-thinks-saas-companies-could-grow-even-faster-in-2021/">are notes</a> from the last episode of Extra Crunch Live with Bessemer&#8217;s Byron Deeter.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be fun as there&#8217;s so much to talk about. I&#8217;m still bubbling up my question list, so to avoid giving the Sapphire PR team too much pre-discussion ammo let&#8217;s just say that corporate venture capital&#8217;s place in the 2020 boom is an interesting topic for both founders, and investors alike.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll want to press Das on the current market for software startups, where we are in the historical arc of SaaS multiples, the importance of API-led tech upstarts, where founders might look to build the next great enterprise startup, and if there are any new platforms bubbling up that could be a foundation for future founders to later leverage.</p>
<p>As this is an Extra Crunch Live, I&#8217;ll also work in a few questions from the audience (that means you, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=jaidaspost">make sure you Extra Crunch subscription is live</a>), to augment my own clipboard of notes.</p>
<p>This is going to be a good one. I&#8217;ll see you next Tuesday for the show.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>Below are links to add the event to your calendar and to save the Zoom link. We’ll share the YouTube link shortly before the discussion:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you launch an application in the public cloud, you usually put everything on one provider, but what if you could choose the components based on cost and technology and have your database one place and your storage another?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what <a href="http://cast.ai">Cast.ai</a> says that it can provide, and today it announced a healthy $7.7 million seed round from TA Ventures, DNX, Florida Funders and other unnamed angels to keep building on that idea. The round closed in June.</p>
<p>Company CEO and co-founder Yuri Frayman says that they started the company with the idea that developers should be able to get the best of each of the public clouds without being locked in. They do this by creating <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kubernetes" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kubernetes">Kubernetes <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> clusters that are able to span multiple clouds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Cast does not require you to do anything except for launching your application. You don&#8217;t need to know  [&#8230;] what cloud you are using [at any given time]. You don&#8217;t need to know anything except to identify the application, identify which [public] cloud providers you would like to use, the percentage of each [cloud provider&#8217;s] use and launch the application,&#8221; Frayman explained.</p>
<p>This means that you could use Amazon&#8217;s RDS database and Google&#8217;s ML engine, and the solution decides how to make that work based on your requirements and price. You set the policies when you are ready to launch and Cast will take care of distributing it for you in the location and providers that you desire, or that makes most sense for your application.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cKbtarELGt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/startups-are-helping-cloud-infrastructure-customers-avoid-vendor-lock-in/">Startups are helping cloud infrastructure customers avoid vendor lock-in</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startups are helping cloud infrastructure customers avoid vendor lock-in&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/startups-are-helping-cloud-infrastructure-customers-avoid-vendor-lock-in/embed/#?secret=cKbtarELGt" data-secret="cKbtarELGt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company takes advantage of cloud native technologies, containerization and Kubernetes to break the proprietary barriers that exist between clouds, says company co-founder Laurent Gil. &#8220;We break these barriers of cloud providers so that an application does not need to sit in one place anymore. It can sit in several [providers] at the same time. And this is great for the Kubernetes application because they&#8217;re kind of designed with this [flexibility] in mind,&#8221; Gil said.</p>
<p>Developers use the policy engine to decide how much they want to control this process. They can simply set location and let Cast optimize the application across clouds automatically, or they can select at a granular level exactly the resources they want to use on which cloud. Regardless of how they do it, Cast will continually monitor the installation and optimize based on cost to give them the cheapest options available for their configuration.</p>
<p>The company currently has 25 employees with four new hires in the pipeline, and plans to double to 50 by the end of 2021. As they grow, the company is trying keep diversity and inclusion front and center in its hiring approach and they currently have women in charge of HR, marketing and sales at the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have very robust processes on the continuous education inside of our organization on diversity training. And a lot of us came from organizations where this was very visible and we took a lot of those processes [and lessons] and brought them here,&#8221; Frayman said.</p>
<p>Frayman has been involved with multiple startups including <a href="http://cujo.ai">Cujo.ai</a>, a consumer firewall startup that participated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/cujo/">in TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield</a> in New York in 2016.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European Union lawmakers have laid out a major legislative proposal <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2102">today</a> to encourage the reuse of industrial data across the Single Market by creating a standardized framework of trusted tools and techniques to ensure what they describe as &#8220;secure and privacy-compliant conditions&#8221; for sharing data.</p>
<p>Enabling a network of trusted and neutral data intermediaries, and an oversight regime comprised of national monitoring authorities and a pan-EU coordinating body, are core components of the plan.</p>
<p>The move follows the European Commission&#8217;s data strategy announcement in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais/">February</a>, when it said it wanted to boost data reuse to support a new generation of data-driven services powered by data-hungry artificial intelligence, as well as encouraging the notion of using &#8216;tech for good&#8217; by enabling “more data and good quality data” to fuel innovation with a common public good (like better disease diagnostics) and improve public services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The wider context is that personal data is already regulated in the bloc (such as under the General Data Protection Regulation; GDPR), which restricts reuse. While commercial considerations can limit how industrial data is shared.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s executive believes harmonzied requirements that set technical and/or legal conditions for data reuse are needed to foster legal certainty and trust &#8212; delivered via a framework that promises to maintain rights and protections and thus get more data usefully flowing.</p>
<p>The Commission sees major business benefits flowing from the proposed data governance regime. &#8220;Businesses, both small and large, will benefit from new business opportunities as well as from a reduction in costs for acquiring, integrating and processing data, from lower barriers to enter markets, and from a reduction in time-to-market for novel products and services,&#8221; it writes in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2103">press release</a>.</p>
<p>It has further data related proposals incoming in 2021, in addition to a package of digital services legislation it&#8217;s due to lay out early next month &#8212; as part of a wider reboot of industrial strategy which prioritises digitalization and a green new deal.</p>
<p>All legislative components of the strategy will need to gain the backing of the European Council and parliament so there&#8217;s a long road ahead for implementing the plan.</p>

<h2>Data Governance Act</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">EU lawmakers often talk in shorthand about the data strategy being intended to encourage the sharing and reuse of &#8220;industrial data&#8221; &#8212; although the Data Governance Plan (DGA) unveiled today has a wider remit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Commission envisages the framework enabling the sharing of data that&#8217;s subject to data protection legislation &#8212; which means personal data; where privacy considerations may (currently) restrain reuse &#8212; as well as industrial data subject to intellectual property, or which contains trade secrets or other commercially sensitive information (and is thus not typically shared by its creators primarily for commercial reasons). </span></p>
<p>In a press conference on the data governance proposals, internal market commissioner Thierry Breton floated the notion of &#8220;data altruism&#8221; &#8212; saying the Commission wants to provide citizens with an organized way to share their own personal data for a common/public good, such as aiding research into rare diseases or helping cities map mobility for purposes like monitoring urban air quality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through personal data spaces, which are novel personal information management tools and services, Europeans will gain more control over their data and decide on a detailed level who will get access to their data and for what purpose,&#8221; the Commission writes in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2103">Q&amp;A</a> on the proposal.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s planning a public register where entities will be able to register as a &#8220;data altruism organisation&#8221; &#8212; provided they have a not-for-profit character; meet transparency requirements; and implement certain safeguards to &#8220;protect the rights and interests of citizens and companies&#8221; &#8212; with the aim of providing &#8220;maximum trust with minimum administrative burden&#8221;, as it puts it.</p>
<p>The DGA envisages different tools, techniques and requirements governing how private sector bodies share data vs private companies.</p>
<p>For public sector bodies there may be technical requirements (such as encryption or anonymization) attached to the data itself or further processing limitations (such as requiring it to take place in &#8220;dedicated infrastructures operated and supervised by the public sector&#8221;), as well as legally binding confidentiality agreements that must be signed by the reuser.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever data is being transferred to a reuser, mechanisms will be in place that ensure compliance with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en">GDPR</a> and preserve the commercial confidentiality of the data,&#8221; the Commission&#8217;s PR says.</p>
<p>To encourage businesses to get on board with pooling their own data-sets &#8212; for the promise of a collective economic upside via access to bigger volumes of pooled data &#8212; the plan is for regulated data intermediaries/marketplaces to provide &#8220;neutral&#8221; data-sharing services, acting as the &#8220;trusted&#8221; go-between/repository so data can flow between businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;To ensure this neutrality, the data-sharing intermediary cannot exchange the data for its own interest (e.g. by selling it to another company or using it to develop their own product based on this data) and will have to comply with strict requirements to ensure this neutrality,&#8221; the Commission writes on this.</p>
<p>Under the plan, intermediaries&#8217; compliance with data handling requirements would be monitored by public authorities at a national level.</p>
<p>But the Commission is also proposing the creation of a new pan-EU body, called the European Data Innovation Board, that would try to knit together best practice across Member States &#8212; in what looks like a mirror of the steering/coordinating role undertaken by the European Data Protection Board (which links up the EU&#8217;s patchwork of data protection supervisory authorities).</p>
<p>&#8220;These data brokers or intermediaries that will provide for data sharing will do that in a way that your rights are protected and that you have choices,&#8221; said EVP Margrethe Vestager, who heads up the bloc&#8217;s digital strategy, also speaking at today&#8217;s press conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that you can also have personal data spaces where your data is managed. Because, initially, when you ask people they say well actually we do want to share but we don&#8217;t really know how to do it. And this is not only the technicalities &#8212; it&#8217;s also the legal certainty that&#8217;s missing. And this proposal will provide that,&#8221; she added.</p>

<h2>Data localization requirements &#8212; or not?</h2>
<p>The commissioners faced a number of questions over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/max-schrems-on-the-eu-court-ruling-that-could-cut-facebook-in-two/">hot button issue of international data transfers</a>.</p>
<p>Breton was asked whether the DGA will include any data localization requirements. He responded by saying &#8212; essentially &#8212; that the rules will bake in a series of conditions which, depending on the data itself and the intended destination, may mean that storing and processing the data in the EU is the only viable option.</p>
<p>&#8220;On data localization &#8212; what we do is to set a GDPR-type of approach, through adequacy decisions and standard contractual clauses for only sensitive data through a cascading of conditions to allow the international transfer under conditions and in full respect of the protected nature of the data. That&#8217;s really the philosophy behind it,&#8221; Breton said. &#8220;And of course for highly sensitive data [such as] in the public health domain it is necessary to be able to set further conditions, depending on the sensitivity, otherwise&#8230; Member States will not share them.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe puts out advice on fixing international data transfers that&#8217;s cold comfort for Facebook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/embed/#?secret=JmmEP3SHMA" data-secret="JmmEP3SHMA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;For instance it could be possible to limit the reuse of this data into public secure infrastructures so that companies will come to use the data but not keep them. It could be also about restricting the number of access in third countries, restricting the possibility to further transfer the data and if necessary also prohibiting the transfer to a third country,&#8221; he went on, adding that such conditions would be &#8220;in full respect&#8221; of the EU&#8217;s WTO obligations.</p>
<p>In a section of its Q&amp;A that deals with data localization requirements, the Commission similarly dances around the question, writing: &#8220;There is no obligation to store and process data in the EU. Nobody will be prohibited from dealing with the partner of their choice. At the same time, the EU must ensure that any access to EU citizen&#8217;s personal data and certain sensitive data is in compliance with its values and legislative framework.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the presser, Breton also noted that companies that want to gain access to EU data that&#8217;s been made available for reuse will need to have legal representation in the region. &#8220;This is important of course to ensure the enforceability of the rules we are setting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is very important for us &#8212; maybe not for other continents but for us &#8212; to be fully compliant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The commissioners also faced questions about how the planned data reuse rules would be enforced &#8212; given ongoing criticism over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">lack of uniformly vigorous enforcement</a> of Europe&#8217;s data protection framework, GDPR.</p>
<p>&#8220;No rule is any good if not enforced,&#8221; agreed Vestager. &#8220;What we are suggesting here is that if you have a data sharing service provider and they have notified themselves it&#8217;s then up to the authority with whom they have notified actually to monitor and to supervise the compliance with the different things that they have to live up to in order to preserve the protection of these legitimate interests &#8212; could be business confidentiality, could be intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a thing that we will keep on working on also in the future proposals that are upcoming &#8212; the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act &#8212; but here you have sort of a precursor that the ones who receive the notification in Member States they will also have to supervise that things are actually in order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also responding on the enforcement point, Breton suggested enforcement would be baked in up front, such as by careful control of who could become a data reuse broker.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Firstly] we are putting forward common rules and harmonized rules&#8230; We are creating a large internal market for data. The second thing is that we are asking Member States to create specific authorities to monitor. The third thing is that we will ensure coherence and enforcement through the European Data Innovation Board,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just to give you an example&#8230; enforcement is embedded. To be a data broker you will need to fulfil a certain number of obligations and if you fulfil these obligations you can be a neutral data broker &#8212; if you don&#8217;t</p>
<p>Alongside the DGA, the Commission also announced an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2188">Intellectual Property Action Plan</a>.</p>
<p>Vestager said this aims to build on the EU&#8217;s existing IP framework with a number of supportive actions &#8212; including financial support for SMEs involved in the Horizon Europe R&amp;D program to file patents.</p>
<p>The Commission is also considering whether to reform the framework for filing standards essential patents. But in the short term Vestager said it would aim to encourage industry to engage in forums aimed at reducing litigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;One example could be that the Commission could set up an independent system of third party essentiality checks in view of improving legal certainty and reducing litigation costs,&#8221; she added of the potential reform, noting that protecting IP is an important component of the bloc&#8217;s industrial strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we head into the biggest shopping period of the year &#8212; which this year may well have an even stronger online component than usual because of Covid-19 &#8212; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has launched its latest effort to combat the sale of counterfeit goods on its site.</p>
<p>The e-commerce giant today <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201125005567/en/Amazon-Launches-IP-Accelerator-in-Europe-to-Help-Small-Businesses-Protect-Their-Brands-and-Tackle-Counterfeit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> that its <a href="http://brandservices.amazon.com/ipaccelerator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP Accelerator</a> in now live in Europe &#8212; specifically France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands and the United Kingdom &#8212; to help SMBs selling on Amazon obtain trademarks on their intellectual property, protect their brands and tackle the sale of counterfeit goods, connecting companies with recommended legal firms to carry out work. Joining the IP Accelerator is free, while the legal aid is provided as &#8220;low-cost assistance&#8221;, with those costs coming in the form of &#8220;competitive, pre-negotiated rates,&#8221; Amazon said.</p>
<p>The European launch &#8212; in Amazon&#8217;s six biggest markets in Europe, covering more than 150,000 small and medium businesses selling on Amazon&#8217;s platform, which account for more than half the products sold in the region &#8212; comes just over a year after Amazon kicked off an IP Accelerator in the U.S., in <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/amazon-intellectual-property-accelerator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2019</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon today said that the U.S. effort has so far yielded 6,000 trademark applications submitted to the US Patent and Trademark Office by SMBs working through the program.</p>
<p>Amazon has long struggled with counterfeit and other illicit items sold through its marketplace &#8212; which brings in third-party sellers and is built on the very concept of economies of scale, offering a vast array of choices to shoppers, and the IP Accelerator comes on the heels of a lot of other proactive efforts to battle the situation.</p>
<p>They have included Amazon filing a number of lawsuits &#8212; both on its own and in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/amazon-and-valentino-team-up-in-joint-lawsuit-against-new-york-counterfeiter-over-rockstud-knock-offs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">partnership with others</a>, and most recently, just this month, being the plaintiff in a case that interestingly extended outside its own platform to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/amazon-sues-online-influencers-engaged-in-a-counterfeit-scheme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">target online influencers</a>.</p>
<p>It also has built a lot of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/amazon-expands-transparency-anti-counterfeit-codes-to-europe-india-and-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technology</a> also to help track and spot illicit goods.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s working with government authorities, most recently in an initiative to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201124005382/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">halt the import</a> of counterfeit inventory before it gets sold or delivered to buyers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Sisyphean task in some regards: Amazon&#8217;s growth means more sellers, and more goods to triage, and more chances for dodgy items. But it&#8217;s one that is very much in Amazon&#8217;s interest to get right: if it can&#8217;t protect IP, the best brands will stay away, and consumers will start to lose confidence in the platform, too.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where initiatives like the IP Accelerator come in, where the idea is that it gives sellers who are smaller more direct control over their own brand destinies.</p>
<p>The focus on SMBs is very specific and not just because of their collective selling power on Amazon. They <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">are most often not in full possession of their legal options, and perhaps also worried about the costs of getting involved in trademarking, with a recent <a href="https://www.clustercollaboration.eu/sites/default/files/news_attachment/roadmap_-_intellectual_property_action_plan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> from the European Intellectual Property Office finding that just 9% of SMBs have registered IP rights, versus 36% of larger companies.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We know from our conversations with small business owners that there is often confusion about why IP rights are important and how sellers can secure them,&#8221; said Francois Saugier, Vice President for EU Seller Services, Amazon, in a statement. &#8220;As part of our broader commitment to supporting small businesses, we have set up IP Accelerator to make the IP registration process as easy and as affordable as possible for entrepreneurs in the early days of their businesses.”</p>
<p>In addition to legal assistance, SMBs in the program can then join the Amazon&#8217;s Brand Registry. This currently covers some 350,000 brands and gives businesses the ability to manage and track their brands, using automated algorithms built by Amazon and giving participants a hotline to reporting and acting on potential copycats and other trademark criminals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2019/11/13/amazon-primed-disrupt-legal-field-launch-ip-accelerator-program/id=115796/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One IP publication, IP Watchdog, describes how</a> the IP Accelerator is a particularly disruptive concept in part because of that quick access to the Brand Registry: Previously, a company would have had to have a trademark approved by the patent office before joining. Now, it seems that as long as the application is in progress &#8212; via the legal firms that have been picked to be a part of the IP Accelerator &#8212; you can join the registry. Businesses generally try to join it to get a leg up on their marketing, and critics see the Accelerator as one way to potentially game that system.</p>
<p>(The other way that the IP Accelerator is disruptive, according to the article? By forcing a pricing structure for trademarking services that departs from the norm, for a potentially very large audience of customers, which also could lay the groundwork for a wider set of legal services for businesses.)</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The business of providing business services to SMBs on the platform is an interesting one.</span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">number of startups emerge in recent times</a> that are looking to acquire and roll up the best of the SMBs that sell on Amazon with big ambitions of their own.</p>
<p>Their plans are to use economies of scale to run these businesses better, with better supply-chain management, marketing, IP control and more. That strategy is predicated on the fact that those small businesses are finding it a challenge to take their enterprises to the next level on their own.</p>
<p>In that regard, Amazon&#8217;s IP Accelerator potentially gives those smaller sellers another helping hand to stay independent (or at least grow their businesses enough to catch the attention of these consolidators).</p>
<p>“Great ideas are the core of every good business. Turning those ideas into a reality relies on IP,&#8221; said Pippa Hall, director of Innovation and Chief Economist at the UK’s Intellectual Property Office, said in a statement. &#8220;Understanding, protecting and getting the most out of your IP is a crucial ingredient of success. A good IP strategy should sit at the heart of every good business plan.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/unacademy" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="unacademy">Unacademy, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> an online learning platform in India, has added two more marquee investors to its cap table. The Bangalore-based startup, which focuses on K-12 online education, said on Wednesday it has raised new funds from Tiger Global Management and Dragoneer Investment Group.</p>
<p>The funding round, which is between $75 million to $100 million in size (according to a person familiar with the matter; Unacademy has not disclosed the figure), valued the four-and-a-half-year-old startup at $2 billion, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/facebook-backs-indian-education-startup-unacademy/">up from about $500 million in February this year</a> when Facebook joined its list of backers, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/indias-online-learning-platform-unacademy-raises-150-million-at-1-45-billion-valuation/">$1.45 billion in September</a>, when SoftBank led the round.</p>
<p>“Our mission from Day One has been to democratise education and make it more affordable and accessible. We have consistently built the most iconic products that deliver high quality education to everyone. Today, I’m delighted to welcome Tiger Global and Dragoneer as our partners in the journey. They are both marquee global investors with a history of partnering with innovative companies that are making an impact on people’s lives,” said Gaurav Munjal, co-founder and chief executive of Unacademy, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://unacademy.com/">Unacademy</a> helps students prepare for competitive exams to get into a college, as well as those who are pursuing graduate-level courses. On its app, students watch live classes from educators and later engage in sessions to review topics in more detail. In recent months, the startup has held several online interviews of high-profile individuals, such as Indian politician Shashi Tharoor, on a range of topics, which has expanded its appeal beyond its student base.</p>
<p>The platform has amassed over 47,000 educators, who teach students in 5,000 cities in India in over 14 languages. Over 150,000 live classes are conducted on the platform each month and the collective watch time across platforms is over 2 billion minutes per month, the startup said.</p>
<p>“The opportunity to improve lives through online education is enormous because of its sheer accessibility. The Unacademy team has innovated rapidly to build a leading platform that is taking education to the farthest corners of India. We are very excited to partner with Unacademy and look forward to seeing it scale further,” said Scott Shleifer, Partner at Tiger Global, in a statement.</p>

<p>Scores of education startups in India have reported skyrocketing growth in recent months as schools remain shut across the country amid the coronavirus pandemic. Even as most Indians tend not to pay for online services — just ask Google and Facebook, both of which count India as their biggest market by users but make little in the country — the education category is an outlier. Indian families continue to spend heavily on their children’s education in hopes of paving the way for a better future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/coinbase-launches-margin-trading-for-some-users/">a few months after</a> launching margin trading on Coinbase Pro, the company is <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-pro-disables-margin-trading-42f5862f8a66">disabling the feature</a>. Margin trading lets you trade on leverage. But it works both ways — margin trading lets you multiply your gains <em>and</em> your losses.</p>
<p>Starting on November 25, 2pm PT, users won’t be able to place new margin trades. Existing margin positions will expire over the coming days and weeks. Once those positions expire, margin trading will be disabled for good.</p>
<p>The company is following guidance from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Interestingly, the CFTC was well aware of the company’s plans to launch margin trading.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="coinbase">Coinbase <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says it has regular conversations with the CFTC and gives them a heads up about upcoming products and services. The same thing happened with margin trading.</p>
<p>Margin trading hasn’t been available on Coinbase’s main website. It has been limited to some Coinbase Pro users with a cap on the number of users who can access the feature.</p>
<p>And yet, Coinbase wouldn’t have launched margin trading if the company could have anticipated a change of course on the regulatory front. More than 100,000 users signed up to the wait list, indicating some interest from Coinbase’s user base.</p>
<p>But the company has no choice but to end margin trading as it tries to be as compliant as possible with current regulation. Let’s see if other exchanges that operate in the U.S. will follow suit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://wegift.io/">WeGift</a>, the London-based startup that has built an &#8220;incentive marketing&#8221; platform that lets businesses easily issue e-gift cards and other digital rewards to customers, has raised $8 million in new funding.</p>
<p>Dubbed a Series A extension, the round is led by AlbionVC. Existing investors including Stride.vc, SAP.iO fund and Unilever Ventures also followed on. Following the fundraise, Ed Lascelles, general partner at AlbionVC, is joining the WeGift board.</p>
<p>WeGift says it will use the additional capital to continue building out its &#8220;real-time infrastructure&#8221; for digital rewards and incentives. This will include investment in building its supply chain through direct integrations with brands, and product development &#8220;that serves corporate marketing teams looking to acquire, activate and retain customers at scale&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2016 by Aron Alexander, WeGift wants to digitise the $700 billion rewards and incentives industry, which is largely still powered by legacy systems built for physical gift cards.</p>
<p>“Currently payments are a one way street,” WeGift’s Alexander <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/wegift/">told TechCrunch in June</a>. “Payments technology is built to enable businesses to take money from consumers but it doesn’t let businesses send money to consumers.</p>
<p>“We’ve created a new category of digital non-cash rewards to power customer acquisition, retention and loyalty globally: the ‘Twilio for e-gift cards&#8217;”.</p>
<p>To do this, WeGift offers a “cloud-based, open API” platform that allows businesses to automate sending digital incentives. This is combined with analytics, making it easier to track ROI on incentive marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>Since we last covered the startup, WeGift has grown its network to more than 700 brand partners (such as Nike and Uber), across 30 markets and 20 currencies. It claims “hundreds of clients,” such as Vodafone, Samsung, Vouchercodes, Perkbox and Sodexo, among others.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve become a favourite of the telecom and energy industry with companies like Vodafone, Utilita, LookAfterMyBills and E.ON using our platform,” Alexander tells me.</p>
<p>WeGift is disclosing 317% in annual revenue growth, but isn’t providing actual revenue numbers. Notably, the company has also opened a New York office.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With COVID-19 making commuters switch to bikes, and cities wanting cleaner air, the e-bike revolution is only just getting started. Further evidence of this is the news that today British e-bike manufacturer <a href="https://www.furosystems.com/">FuroSystems</a> has closed its first institutional venture funding round of £750,000 with participation by <a href="https://tspventures.co.uk/">TSP Ventures</a> and European impact investment bank, <a href="https://www.clearlyso.com/">ClearlySo</a>, as well as a number of angel investors.</p>
<p>Not unlike the ‘new wave’ of startup e-bike makers such as <a href="http://VanMoof.com">VanMoof</a> and <a href="http://Cowboy.com">Cowboy</a>, London-based FuroSystems is also bringing an interesting take on the e-bike concept. Key to its appeal is that its bikes are very light and can therefore be pedaled like normal bikes when not using the electric engine. Furthermore, their pricing is also highly competitive compared to conventional bikes.</p>
<p>Unlike many e-Bike makers, it also has a folding e-bike, the <a href="https://www.furosystems.com/fx/">Furo X</a>, whose carbon fiber frame makes it one of the lightest e-bikes in the world, weighing just 15kg. The high-density removable lithium-ion battery has a range of 55km. FuroSystems also makes a point of using industry-standard parts such as Shimano gears and hydraulic disk brakes, which makes it competitive with others such as Gocycle and Brompton.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These factors are helping to make them a hit amongst commuters.</p>
<p>As a result the company, which also makes electric scooters, says it has seen demand surge since the coronavirus lockdown, with year-on-year sales up fivefold. Unusually, the company says it has been profitable since it started, but this latest funding will be used to invest in R&amp;D to create its next line of products.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Eliott Wertheimer, said in a statement: “We’re currently experiencing a once-in-a-century shift in transport, thanks to increasing awareness of the impact we are having on our environment along with a renewed desire to make healthier personal choices. Electric bikes and electric scooters are crucial to solving the mobility issues we see today, of congestion and pollution.”</p>
<p>Wertheimer added that part of the bike manufacturing is likely to be brought to Portugal in order to fulfill demand.</p>
<p>TSP Ventures CEO Chris Smith, commented: “The e-bike market has exploded in recent years with sales set to reach €10 billion by 2025 and FuroSystems is at the intersection of this burgeoning industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup has also designed and manufactured the Fuze, a high-end e-scooter with over 800W of available peak power; double front and rear suspension; dual mechanical disc brakes; remote key lock and alarm system; reinforced inflatable pneumatic 10” wheels. The power and top-speed is able to be adjusted to comply with local regulations.</p>
<p>Upcoming will be the Aventa, an e-bike with aerospace-grade alloys; a boost system; hydraulic disk brakes; nine gears; high-performance clutch; integrated 504Wh battery; and the weight below 17kg. Prices for the Aventa will start at £1,399 and it will be available to pre-order from FuroSystems.com at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Founders Albert Nassar and Eliott Wertheimer met whilst studying mechanical and aerospace engineering respectively at the University of Bristol. Nassar went on to work with the autonomous drone inspection team at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory which later spun-out as Perceptual Robotics, whilst Wertheimer developed small nuclear batteries for tiny satellites in partnership with the European Space Agency and different UK universities. The pair reunited at Imperial College’s Business School in 2015, and created FuroSystems in 2017.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/universal-service-fund">Universal Service Fund</a> includes subsidies to build telecommunication infrastructure across the United States, especially for low-income or high-cost areas, rural telehealth services, and schools and libraries. The FCC issued an order on June 30 banning U.S. companies from using the fund to buy technology from Huawei and ZTE, claiming that both companies have close ties with the Chinese Communist Party and military.</p>

<p>Many smaller carriers rely on Huawei and ZTE, two of the world’s biggest telecom equipment providers, for cost-efficient technology. After surveying carriers, the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/federal-communications-commission" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="federal-communications-commission">FCC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> estimated in September that replacing Huawei and ZTE equipment <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-huawei-zte-network-replacement-cost-173935939.html">would cost more than $1.8 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Under the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act, passed by Congress this year, most of that amount would be eligible for reimbursements under a program referred to as &#8220;rip and replace.&#8221; But the program <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1331709/lawmakers-urge-fcc-to-initiate-rip-and-replace-effort">has not been funded by Congress yet</a>, despite bipartisan support.</p>
<p>In today’s announcement about ZTE, chairman Ajit Pai also said the FCC will vote on rules to implement the reimbursement program at its next Open Meeting, scheduled to take place on December 10.</p>
<p>The FCC passed its order barring companies deemed national security threats from receiving money from the Universal Service Fund in November 2019. Huawei fought back by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/huawei-sues-fcc-over-unconstitutional-ban-the-use-of-federal-subsidies-to-buy-its-equipment/">suing the FCC over the ban</a>, claiming it exceeded the agency&#8217;s authority and violated the Constitution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, we had the chance to talk with <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> cofounder Ev Williams, along with operator-turned investor James Joaquin, who helps oversee the day-to-day of the mission-focused venture firm they separately cofounded six years ago, <a href="https://obvious.com/">Obvious Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>We collectively discussed lot of venture-y things, some of which we&#8217;ll publish next week, so stayed tuned. In the meantime, we spent some time talking specifically with Williams about both <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/medium" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="medium">Medium <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and some of the day&#8217;s biggest headlines. Following are some excerpts from that chat, lightly edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: A lot of tech CEOs have been saying goodbye to San Francisco in 2020. Do you think the trend is attracting too much attention or perhaps not enough?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>EW: I moved away to New York from the Bay Area a little over a year ago with my family. I&#8217;d lived in San Francisco for 20 years, and I had never lived in New York and thought, &#8216;Why not go? Now seems like a good time.&#8217; Turns out I was wrong. [Laughs.] It was a very bad time to move to New York. So I was there for for six months and quickly came back to California, which is a great place to be in a world where you&#8217;re not going into bars and restaurants and seeing people.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You moved when COVID took hold?</strong></p>
<p>EW: Yes. In March, Manhattan suddenly seemed not ideal. So now I&#8217;m on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peninsula">peninsula</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m from San Francisco. It was really, for me, just honestly looking for a change. But an enabling factor that could be common in many of these cases is the fact that I no longer have to be in the office in San Francisco every day, [whereas] for most of 20 years [beforehand], all my work life was in an office in San Francisco, generally with a company I had started, so I thought it was important to be there.</p>
<p>This was pre COVID and remote work. But remote work was becoming more common. And I noticed in 2018 or so, with this massive number of companies that were in San Francisco &#8212;  startups and large public companies and pre IPO companies &#8212; that competition for talent had gotten more extreme than it had ever been. So it got me &#8212;  along with a lot of founders and CEOs &#8212; thinking about maybe the advantage of hiring locally and having everybody in the same office [was a pro] that was starting to get outweighed by the cons. . . And, of course, the tools and technology that make remote work possible were getting better all the time.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Given that you cofounded Twitter, I have to ask about this presidential transition that is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/24/trump-carries-on-election-fight-440496">maybe</a>, finally happening. In January, Donald Trump will lose the privileges he enjoyed as president. </strong><strong>Given the amount of <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1325099845045071873">disinformation</a> he has published routinely, do you think Twitter should have cracked down on him sooner? How would you rate its handling of a president who really tested its boundaries in every way?</strong></p>
<p>EW: I think what Twitter has done especially recently is a pretty good solution. I mean, I don&#8217;t agree with the the notion that he should have been removed altogether a long time ago. Having the visibility, literally seeing, what what the President is thinking at any given moment, as ludicrous as it is, is helpful.</p>
<p>What he would be doing if he didn&#8217;t have Twitter is unclear, but he&#8217;d be doing something to get his message out there. And what the company has done most recently with the warnings on his tweets or blocking them is great. It&#8217;s providing more information. It&#8217;s kind of &#8216;buyer beware&#8217; about this information. And it&#8217;s a bolder step than any platform had taken previously. It&#8217;s a good version of an in-between where previously [people would] talk about just kicking people off, [and] allowing freedom of speech.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You started Blogger, then Twitter, then Medium. As someone who has spent much of your career  focused on content and distribution, do you have any other thoughts about what more Twitter or other platforms could be doing [to tackle disinformation]? Because there is going to be somebody who comes along again with the same autocratic tendencies.</strong></p>
<p>EW: I think all of society gets more information savvy &#8212; that&#8217;s one hope over the long term. It wasn&#8217;t that long ago that if something was in &#8220;media,&#8221; it was accepted as true. And now I think everyone&#8217;s skeptical. We&#8217;ve learned that that&#8217;s not necessarily the case and certainly not online.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we&#8217;re now at the point where a lot of people have lost faith in everything published or shared anywhere. But I think that&#8217;s a step along the evolution of just getting more media savvy and knowing that sources really matter, and as we build both better tools, things will get better.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Speaking of content platforms, Medium charges $50 per year for users to access an unlimited amount of articles from individual writers and poets. Have you said how many subscribers the platform now has?</strong></p>
<p>EW: We haven&#8217;t given a precise number, but I can tell you it&#8217;s in the high hundreds of thousands. It&#8217;s been a been a couple years now, and I&#8217;m a very firm believer in the model &#8212; not only that people will pay for quality information, but that it&#8217;s just a much healthier model for publishers, be they individuals or companies, because it creates that feedback loop of &#8216;quality gets rewarded.&#8217;</p>
<p>If people aren&#8217;t getting value, they unsubscribe, and that isn&#8217;t the case with an advertising model. If people click, you keep making money, and you can kind of keep tricking people or keep appealing to lowest-common-denominator impulses. There were a couple of decades where the mantra was &#8216;No one will pay for content on the internet,&#8217; which obviously seems silly now. But that was that was the established belief for such a long time.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you ever think you should have charged from the outset? I sometimes wonder if it&#8217;s harder to throw on the switch afterward.</strong></p>
<p>EW: Yes, and no. When we first switched to this model in 2017, we created a subscription, but the vast majority of content was &#8212; and actually still is &#8212; outside of the paywall. And our model is different than most because it&#8217;s a platform, and we don&#8217;t own the content, and we have an agreement with our creators that they can publish behind the paywall if they want, and we will pay them if they do that. But they can also publish outside the paywall if they&#8217;re not interested in making money and want maximum reach. And those models are actually very complimentary because the scale of the platform brings a lot of people in through the top of the funnel.</p>
<p>Scale is really important for most businesses, but for a paywall, it&#8217;s especially important because people have to be visiting with enough frequency to actually hit the paywall and be motivated to pay.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Out of curiosity, what do you make of <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>, a startup that invites writers to create their own newsletters using a subscription model and then takes a cut of their revenue in exchange for a host of back end services.</strong></p>
<p>EW: There&#8217;s a bit of a creator renaissance going on right now that is part of a bigger wave of a people being willing to pay for quality information and independent writers and thinkers actually breaking out on their own and building brands and followings. And I think we&#8217;re going to see more of that.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Medium has raised $132 million over the years. Will you raise more? Where do you want to take the platform in the next 12 to 24 months?</strong></p>
<p>EW: We&#8217;re not yet profitable, so I anticipate that we will raise more money.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a very big business to be built here. While more and more people are willing to pay for content, I don&#8217;t think that means that most people will subscribe to dozens of sources, whether they&#8217;re websites with paywalls or newsletters. If you look at how basically every media category has evolved, a lot of them have gone through this shift from free to paid, at least at the higher end of the market. That includes music, television, and even games. And at the high end, there tend to be players who own a large part of the market, and I think that comes down to offering the best consumer value proposition &#8212; one that gives people lots of optionality, lots of personalization, and lots of value for one price.</p>
<p>I think that the same thing is going to play out in this area, and for the subscription that&#8217;s able to reach critical mass, that&#8217;s a multi-billion dollar business. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re aiming to build.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s launch took off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, lifting off at 9:13 PM EST (6:13 PM PST).

<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-ecb7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-ecb7">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> aims for greater usability as a way to continue to reduce costs – every time it flies a component used in a previous mission, it realizes some degree of cost savings vs. using all new parts. Today&#8217;s mission represents likely its most cost-effective flight to date as a result.</p>
<p>This is SpaceX&#8217;s sixteenth Starlink mission thus far, and it has now launched nearly 1,000 total small satellites for its constellation. The service is currently operating in beta, and recently expanded from parts of the U.S. to areas in southern <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/canada-c0c7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="canada-c0c7">Canada <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest is getting into online events. The company has been spotted testing a new feature that allows users to sign up for Zoom classes through Pinterest, while creators use Pinterest&#8217;s class boards to organize class materials, notes and other resources, or even connect with attendees through a group chat option. The company confirmed the test of online classes is an experiment now in development, but wouldn&#8217;t offer further details about its plans.</p>
<p>The feature itself was discovered on Tuesday by reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane">Jane Manchun Wong</a>, who found details about the online classes by looking into the app&#8217;s code.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Currently, you can visit some of these &#8220;demo&#8221; profiles directly &#8212; like &#8220;<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pinsmeditation/_saved/">@pinsmeditation</a>&#8221; or &#8220;<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pinzoom123/_saved/">@pinzoom123,</a>&#8221; for example &#8212; and view their listed Class Communities. However, these communities are empty when you click through. That&#8217;s because the feature is still unreleased, Wong says.</p>
<p>When and if the feature is later launched to the public, the communities would include dedicated sections where creators will be able to organize their class materials &#8212; like lists of what to bring to class, notes, photos and more. They could also use these communities to offer a class overview and description, connect users to a related shop, group chat feature and more.</p>

<p>Creators are also able to use the communities &#8212; which are basically enhanced Pinterest boards &#8212; to respond to questions from attendees, share photos from the class and otherwise interact with the participants.</p>
<p>When a user wants to join a class, they can click a &#8220;book&#8221; button to sign up, and are then emailed a confirmation with the meeting details. Other buttons direct attendees to download Zoom or copy the link to join the class.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that Pinterest would expand into the online events space, given its platform has become a popular tool for organizing remote learning resources during the coronavirus pandemic. Teachers have turned to Pinterest to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/pinterest-launches-a-today-tab-featuring-daily-recommendations-and-trending-topics/">keep track of lesson plans</a>, get inspiration, share educational activities and more. In the early days of the pandemic, Pinterest reported record usage when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/pinterest-launches-a-today-tab-featuring-daily-recommendations-and-trending-topics/">saw more searches and saves</a> globally in a single March weekend than ever before in its history, as a result of its usefulness as a online organizational tool.</p>
<p>This growth has continued throughout the year. In October, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/28/pinterest-stock-soars-more-than-10percent-revenue-up-49percent.html">Pinterest&#8217;s stock jumped on strong earnings</a> after the company beat on revenue and user growth metrics. The company brought in $443 million in revenue, versus $383.5 million expected, and grew its monthly active users to 442 million, versus the 436.4 million expected. Outside of the coronavirus impacts, much of this growth was due to strong international adoption, increased ad spend from advertisers boycotting Facebook and a surge of interest from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/pinterest-breaks-daily-download-record-thanks-to-user-interest-in-ios-14-design-ideas/">users looking for iOS 14 home screen personalization ideas</a>.</p>
<p>Given that the U.S. has failed to get the COVID-19 pandemic under control, many classes, events and other activities will remain virtual even as we head into 2021. The online events market may continue to grow in the years that follow, too, thanks to the kickstart the pandemic provided the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are experimenting with ways to help creators interact more closely with their audience,&#8221; a Pinterest spokesperson said, when asked for more information.</p>
<p>Pinterest wouldn&#8217;t confirm additional details about its plans for online events, but did say the feature was in development and the test would help to inform the product&#8217;s direction.</p>
<p>Pinterest often tries out new features before launching them to a wider audience. Earlier this summer, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/pinterest-has-begun-testing-a-new-version-of-stories-called-story-pins-with-u-s-creators/">reported on a Story Pins feature the company had in the works</a>. Pinterest then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/pinterest-story-pins/">launched the feature in September.</a> If the same time frame holds up for online events, we could potentially see the feature become more widely available sometime early next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/netflix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="netflix">Netflix, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/06/netflix-earmarks-420m-to-fight-disney-in-india/">invested more than $500 million to gain a foothold in India</a> in recent years, is slowly finding out what all could upset some people in the world’s second-largest internet market: Apparently everything.</p>
<p>A police case has been filed this week against two top executives of the American streaming service in India after a leader of the governing party objected to some scenes in a TV series.</p>
<p>The show, &#8220;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10795574/">A Suitable Boy</a>,&#8221; is an adaptation of the award-winning novel by Indian author Vikram Seth that follows the life of a young girl. It has a scene in which the protagonist is seen kissing a Muslim boy at a Hindu temple.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Narottam Mishra, the interior minister of the central state of Madhya Pradesh, said a First Information Report (an official police complaint) had been filed against Monika Shergill, VP of Content at Netflix and Ambika Khurana, Director of Public Policies for the firm, over objectionable scenes in the show that hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus.</p>
<p>“I had asked officials to examine the series &#8216;A Suitable Boy&#8217; being streamed on Netflix to check if kissing scenes in it were filmed in a temple and if it hurt religious sentiments. The examination prima facie found that these scenes are hurting the sentiments of a particular religion,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Gaurav Tiwari, a BJP youth leader who filed the complaint, demanded an apology from Netflix and makers of the series (directed by award-winning filmmaker Mira Nair), and said the film promoted “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Jihad">love jihad</a>,” an Islamophobic conspiracy theory that alleges that Muslim men entice Hindi women into converting their religion under the pretext of marriage.</p>
<p>Netflix declined to comment.</p>
<p>In recent days, a number of people have expressed on social media their anger at Netflix over these “objectionable” scenes. Though it is unclear if all of them &#8212; if any &#8212; are a Netflix subscriber.</p>
<p>The incident comes weeks after an ad from the luxury jewelry brand Tanishq &#8212; part of the 152-year-old salt-to-steel conglomerate &#8212; which celebrated interfaith marriage received <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/india-religion/tata-group-pulls-ad-featuring-hindu-muslim-family-after-outcry-idINKBN26Z0WF">intense backlash</a> in the country.</p>
<p>For Netflix, the timing of this backlash isn’t great. The new incident comes days after the Indian government announced new rules for digital media, under which the nation’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/indias-broadcasting-ministry-secures-power-to-regulate-streaming-services-online-content/">regulating online streaming services</a>. Prior to this new rule, India’s IT ministry oversaw streaming services, and according to a top streaming service executive, online services enjoyed a great degree of freedom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> looks ready to proceed to the next crucial phase of its Starship spacecraft development program: A 15km (50,000 feet) test flight. This would far exceed the max height that any prior Starship prototype has achieved so far, since the current record-setting hop test maxed out at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/spacex-completes-another-successful-short-test-flight-of-its-starship-spacecraft-prototype/">around 500 feet</a>. Elon Musk says that <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1331386982296145922?s=21">SpaceX will look to make its first high-altitude attempt sometime next week</a>.</p>
<p>This tentative date (these are always subject to change) follows a successful static test fire of the current SN8 generation prototype &#8212; essentially just firing the test spacecraft&#8217;s Raptor engines while it remains stationary on the pad. That&#8217;s a crucial step that paves the way for any actual flight, since it proves that the spacecraft can essentially hold together and withstand the pressures of active engines before it leaves the ground.</p>
<p>SpaceX&#8217;s SN8 prototype is different from prior versions in a number of ways, most obviously because it has an actual nosecone, along with nose fins. The prototypes that did the short test hops, including SN6, had what&#8217;s known as a mass simulator up top, which weighs as much as an actual Starship nose section but looks very different.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ernuofuS7k"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/spacex-completes-another-successful-short-test-flight-of-its-starship-spacecraft-prototype/">SpaceX completes another successful short test flight of its Starship spacecraft prototype</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SpaceX completes another successful short test flight of its Starship spacecraft prototype&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/spacex-completes-another-successful-short-test-flight-of-its-starship-spacecraft-prototype/embed/#?secret=ernuofuS7k" data-secret="ernuofuS7k" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Musk added that the chances of an SN8 high-altitude flight going to plan aren&#8217;t great, estimating that there&#8217;s &#8220;maybe a 1/3 chance&#8221; given how many things have to work correctly. He then noted that that&#8217;s the reason SpaceX has SN9 and SN10 ready to follow fast, which is a theme of Starship&#8217;s development program to date: building successive generations of prototypes rapidly in parallel in order to test and iterate quickly.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll likely get a better idea of when the launch will take place due to alerts filed with local regulators, so watch this space next week as we await this major leap forward in SpaceX&#8217;s Starship program.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the consumer, leisure and media companies hard, but a new venture firm called <a href="https://www.the-wolfpack.com/">The-Wolfpack</a> is still very upbeat on those sectors. Based in Singapore, the firm was founded by former managing directors at GroupM, one of the world’s largest advertising and media companies, and plans to work very closely with each of its portfolio companies. Its name was chosen because they believe &#8220;entrepreneurs thrive best in a wolfpack.&#8221;</p>
<p>The-Wolfpack’s debut fund, called the Wolfpack Pioneer VCC, is already fully subscribed at $5 million USD, and will focus on direct-to-consumer companies, with plans to invest in eight to 10 startups. The firm is already looking to raise a second fund, with a target of $20 million SGD (about $14.9 million USD) and above, and will set up another office in Thailand, with plans to expand into Indonesia as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The-Wolfpack was founded by Toh Jin Wei and Simon Nichols, who met while working at GroupM, and Tan Kok Chin, a former director at Sunray Woodcraft Construction who has worked on projects with Marina Bay Sands, Raffles Hotel and the Singapore Tourism’s offices.</p>
<p>In addition to providing financial capital, The-Wolfpack wants to build ecosystems around its portfolio companies by connecting them with IP owners, digital marketing experts, content producers and designers who can help create offline experiences. It also plans to invest in startups based on opportunities for them to collaborate or cross-sell with one another.</p>
<p>Toh told TechCrunch that formal planning on The-Wolfpack began at the end of 2019, but he and Nichols started thinking of launching their own business five years ago while working together at GroupM.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our perspective on what the industry needed was similar &#8212; strategic investors who truly knew how to get behind D2C founders,&#8221; Toh said.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact has hurt spending in The-Wolfpack&#8217;s three key sectors (consumer, leisure and media). But it also presents opportunities for innovation as consumer habits shift, Nichols said.</p>
<p>For example, even though consumer spending has dropped, people are still &#8220;drawn towards brands that build towards higher-quality engagements,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is a real business advantage for D2C brands who’ve recognized this shift and know how to act on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The-Wolfpack hasn’t disclosed its investments yet since deals are still being finalized, but some of the brands its debut fund are interested in include one launched by an Australian makeup artist who wants to scale to Southeast Asia, and an online gaming company whose ecosystem includes original content, gaming teams and studios. The-Wolfpack plans to help them set up a physical studio to create an offline experience, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Typically brands have talked at customers, but it’s become a two-way conversation, and startups who get D2C right have a real potential for exponential growth that’s worth investing in,&#8221; said Toh.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">2020 has felt excessively long, and Election Day was no different. A drawn-out, five-day statistics exam for the nation, the process of naming our 46th president was met with exhaustion and, for many, elation when <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/joseph-biden" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="joseph-biden">Joe Biden <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> finally took the stage in Wilmington, Delaware, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/biden-speech-transcript.html">to deliver his acceptance speech</a>. The speech would have been the most noteworthy moment of the evening if only there hadn’t been <em>that</em> drone show, wowing both America and Biden himself, whose wide-eyed look of awe was immediately meme-ified.</p>
<p>The patriotic display was the work of <a href="https://www.verge.aero">Verge Aero</a>, a small Philadelphia-based startup with six employees that’s pulled in pretty big clients, including the <a href="https://verge.aero/eagles/">Philadelphia Eagles</a>, Microsoft and, now, the crowning achievement for President-elect Biden’s campaign. With software and drones designed in-house specifically for light-show entertainment purposes, Verge Aero not only cornered the market on making impressive displays more accessible, but gave many who watched at home their first look at the precision of modern aerial imagery.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/verge-aero" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="verge-aero">Verge Aero <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Nils Thorjussen, an industry leader with a background in <a href="https://www.lsionline.com/news/events/nils-thorjussen-building-dronehog">developing lighting solutions</a>, led his team on three years of research and development to simplify and perfect the drone light show process. By building everything in-house, the company emerged with a fully integrated system, allowing the ease and execution befitting of large-scale events. When used in tandem, the design software and customized drones make producing an aerial display safer, easier and more cost-effective, not to mention extremely nimble.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Given <a href="https://verge.aero/biden/">only two weeks</a> to put Biden’s victory show together, Verge Aero collaborated with <a href="https://www.strictlyfx.com/about-us/">Strictly FX</a> on a fireworks-laden display of 200 drones spelling out Biden’s campaign logo, “President Elect” and a map outline of the United States. Verge Aero’s Design Studio was created specifically for challenges like these, simplifying the entire process to build last-minute, large-scale shows with ease.</p>
<p>By eliminating hand-off from one platform to another, which can increase error risk, the all-in-one software suite automatically handles anti-collision calculations and flags issues and fixes for human error. Because of this, Verge Aero’s software application <a href="https://medium.com/vergeaero/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-drone-light-shows-bc9d3bcd08a2">guarantees flight paths will not intersect</a>. Simply put, their drones will not collide — and if you’re going to fly a swarm of drones near the president-elect, this is probably who you want doing it.</p>
<p>Gaining security clearances and governmental approvals<a href="https://verge.aero/biden/"> may have been arduous</a>, but the election night presentation was precisely what Verge Aero was created for: high adaptability that is executed flawlessly. (Thorjussen was unable to speak candidly about the process of Biden’s drone show when we talked, but further details about Verge Aero’s involvement <a href="https://verge.aero/biden/">have since been made public</a>.)</p>
<p>Reticent to divulge specifics of how one pulls off a show of this kind, it’s easy to see the challenges involved in gaining clearance to fly hundreds of tiny robots within striking distance of the future leader of the free world. Not only was there pressure of a high-security, high-profile drone show, but one that had no guaranteed launch date. “A lot of our work is in highly unstructured changing environments, so we&#8217;re kind of used to rolling with the punches,” says Thorjussen; for the Biden display, their special effects team was on standby for nearly a week, from Tuesday through Saturday night.</p>
<p>Still, with an average Verge Aero drone show taking two people 45 minutes to set up 100 drones, it’s likely that prep time for Biden’s light display was less than two hours. Tight software-hardware integration removes the need for individualized flight paths and starting locations, a seamless change that allows show setup <a href="https://vimeo.com/424060799">to be enacted more quickly</a>.</p>
<p>Each drone also has a full copy of the show, not just their individualized flight pattern, and can be placed at any start position while software automatically checks placement and readiness.</p>
<p>“The reason it took us so long to get to where we are today, just in terms of development, is we wanted to create this toolkit for the designers that I&#8217;m used to working with so that they can operate the way they want to,” Thorjussen says. “One piece of that is being able to deploy quickly and to make changes quickly and on the fly, so that you can match the needs of the production as they evolve.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2078413" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2078413" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2078413 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Biden3.jpg" alt="Drone light show displaying US map on the evening of Election Day" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Biden3.jpg 1501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Biden3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Biden3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Biden3.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Biden3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Biden3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2078413" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Strictly FX</p></div></p>
<p>The first and only time Verge Aero flew the Biden drone show was the night of the acceptance speech. There was no need for a dress rehearsal, because there rarely is. Thorjussen stresses that Verge Aero’s pre-show renderings are pretty much identical to what you’d see in real life — a WYSIWYG ethos baked into their unique design.</p>
<p>“[I said] we&#8217;re gonna get this right from the beginning, do it from first principles, and actually create a proper infrastructure to do everything that we want to do — or anticipate wanting to do — so that we don&#8217;t get started and hit a roadblock because we can’t support what our designers want to do,” says Thorjussen.</p>
<p>Like their custom software, Verge Aero also developed their own drones, but not necessarily by choice. “It’s simply because we couldn’t go out and buy what we needed,” he says. “We&#8217;ve invested in some of the technology to make it super reliable, particularly with regards to communication, so that necessitated us making our own drone.”</p>
<p>Verge Aero worked toward developing a workhorse that could do a lot of tasks reliably, providing the clearly identifiable designs on display at Biden’s acceptance speech.</p>
<p>“We made two significant design decisions up front,” explains Thorjussen. “We focused on high accuracy in terms of positioning and&#8230; having a lot of light output. And when you have those two things, then you can do shows with fewer drones, because you have more precision.</p>
<p>Intel may be the household name, but Verge Aero is hot on its heels with a product that’s more nimble, easier to execute and much more dynamic. Like their in-house software, Verge Aero’s X1 drones are specifically created for light shows — no cameras, a “<a href="https://medium.com/vergeaero/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-drone-light-shows-bc9d3bcd08a2">blindingly bright</a>” LED light source — with top speed, show duration and wind tolerance nearly double that of the Intel Shooting Star.</p>
<p>Developed to be a workhorse specifically used in lighting displays, the X1 is heavier than the Shooting Star but a better and safer fit for entertainment purposes than Intel’s drones, and not just because theirs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/18/an-intel-drone-fell-on-my-head-during-a-light-show/">once fell on a TechCrunch writer’s head</a>.</p>

<p>Still, it’s their multidisciplinary collaboration with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/strictly-fx" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="strictly-fx">Strictly FX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> that made this month’s rousing display so memorable — a testament for where Verge Aero’s leader sees their work heading in the future.</p>
<p>“Just doing drones, ultimately, will be boring,” says Thorjussen. “If you just do what I call ‘marching band content’ — you do Logo A to Logo B to Logo C — it’s not so interesting over time. Drones are just one tool in the arsenal of people putting on productions&#8230;the more elements, the more compelling a show will be.”</p>
<p>It seems to have been proven true — not just by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/business/media/biden-election-cable-tv-ratings.html">more than 35 million households watching at home</a> but also President-elect Biden’s gleeful reaction to seeing it overhead. “I think that&#8217;s part of what made that a special moment,” says Thorjussen. “Needless to say, my phone exploded [when the] show was over.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I never thought I’d need a pair of serious noise-canceling headphones. I don’t mind hours of droning white noise on international flights and generally don’t like feeling like my head’s been locked in an airless tomb, so I&#8217;ve always used open headphones that let ambient sound in. But 2020 broke me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I&#8217;ve always preferred</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the hushed, mild chatter of a co-working space to the distractions of home (no offense to my wife who has to be on Zoom all day, every day!). Stranded without the productivity-inspiring hum of a lot of people doing their own thing in one space together, I suddenly needed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">quiet </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a serious way. And I was ready to invest in it. </span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll focus on over-ear headphones here because if you need the absolute best noise canceling money can buy, chunky ear-hugging headphones are always going to blow earbud-style options out of the water. And after you listen to any of these picks, you&#8217;ll agree with us when we say the same goes for sound quality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2077787" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077787" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2077787 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09883.jpg" alt="Sony WH-1000XM4 laying on table" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09883.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09883.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09883.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09883.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09883.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09883.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077787" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Taylor Hatmaker/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<h3>Sony WH-1000XM4</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sony&#8217;s line of premium wireless over-ear active noise-canceling headphones has been regarded as the crème de la crème for a minute now, and that title is very well-deserved. At $350, Sony&#8217;s new Sony WH-1000XM4s aren’t cheap, but from the quality hard-sided case to the solid build quality, you’ll definitely get what you paid for here. Full disclosure: The previous generation of these headphones are what I opted for back in the beginning of the pandemic and I’ve recommended them to many friends with similar needs since.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sound quality on these is a joy. If you’re the kind of audiophile that wouldn’t be caught dead in a serious listening session wearing white earbuds, you’re in for a treat. Set-up on the Sonys was painless and the app is actually useful, providing fine-tuned EQ adjustments, sound profiles and a slider that dials the intensity of the noise canceling up or down,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">though cupping your hand over the earphone also allows ambient sound to pass through. These headphones also went <em>loud</em> if you’re a fan of listening to big music at full volume (I am).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This pair of headphones does a lot of things right. The music quality is excellent, the noise canceling is eerily good, even with no music playing. A few little quality of life perks makes this pair even more appealing than its already very appealing predecessor (the previous version now makes for a great value). Something very subtle also seems to have changed with the fit here, and the M4s did feel less pinchy on the top of my head than the M3s. Sony also added multi-device pairing and a new ear-detection sensor with this generation so they pause automatically when you remove them, which I personally find to be a totally necessary feature. Sony also improved the call quality for the M4s, but it isn&#8217;t their strong suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other strikes against the Sony WH-1000XM4s? There aren’t many, but these headphones, like most in their class, are kind of heavy. You probably can’t wear them for five hours at a time without wanting to take a little break, but they work really well for hourlong bursts of total silence when you really need to put your head down at work. If you aren’t a fan of Sony’s characteristically punchy, bass-forward sound, you might look elsewhere. They have a classic chunky over-ear headphone design, which probably won&#8217;t excite anybody, but it&#8217;s still a good look. And if you&#8217;re someone who plans to take long calls on their over-ear headphones, you might want to look elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need absolute top-tier noise canceling to drown out whoever you’re sharing your makeshift office with these days, this is the pair of headphones you want. The fact that music sounds so incredible is just icing on the cake.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verdict: Top-notch noise canceling with incredible sound</span></i></p>

<h3>Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between this pair of headphones and the Sonys, anyone who doesn’t mind the sensation of over-the-ear headphones should find something to like. The noise canceling on the Bose 700s is top-notch, offering Bose’s signature accuracy and crisp sound along with the ability to totally hush the world around you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hese sounded great for a feature-rich pair of wireless do-it-all headphones. Bose’s neutral, clean sound is lighter on the bass than Sony and feels slightly less vibrant, but if you’ve liked Bose headphones in the past you’ll probably be more than happy here too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bose pair is a bit of a departure from the norm, design-wise. Rather than extending in the middle of the headband, this pair has a kind of stalk on the side of the earcup that slides up or down. The sizing mechanism probably isn’t going to make or break the headphones for anybody, but it does give them a different look, feel and balance when compared to traditional, chunkier designs. Touch controls were very responsive and you can toggle between noise-canceling modes using a set of mirrored buttons on the earcup. They also get a respectable 20 hours of battery life, which is really quite a lot, though 10 hours less than the Sony pair if extreme longevity is a concern.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077782" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077782" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2077782 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09864.jpg" alt="Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09864.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09864.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09864.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09864.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09864.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09864.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077782" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Taylor Hatmaker/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set-up was a little rocky with these as I thought they sounded muddy and awful, but really they just needed a firmware update. Unfortunately, Bose requires you to sign up for an account to use the app and set up your headphones, which is silly and really off-putting, but ultimately probably not a meaningful hurdle for most people. I also got an error message with a second firmware update the app prompted me to download and had to mess around with things to get them to connect again, which was annoying, but did resolve eventually. Without that update I wasn’t able to make EQ adjustments, so be sure to check that if yours don&#8217;t ship with the latest update. It’s worth noting that you don’t get full EQ sliders after the update, just bass, mids and treble. That&#8217;s either going to bug the hell out of you or be a total non-issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bose 700s cost $340 now on Bose’s website, with a light “soapstone” color variant marked down to $300. If you’re not into standard black headphones and would prefer some lighter options this is probably a great option. We tested a silver review unit that had a kind of futuristic vibe, paired with the smooth, matte material on the headband. Bose’s pair is sleek and modern, offering something a bit more eye-catching, especially in its non-black color variations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re using your noise-canceling headphones for frequent phone calls, this Bose pair is well-regarded in terms of its mic and call quality, though the new Sony pair has made strides there too. Both the Bose pair and the Sonys come with an aux cable to extend their use beyond the already impressive battery life that each boast. Both also connect to Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri if you’re the spoken commands type.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For anyone who likes Bose&#8217;s signature clean sound and needs a pair of headphones with excellent noise canceling and a good mic, this pair of headphones is a very solid choice.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verdict: Another great pick for serious noise-canceling needs</span></i></p>

<h3>Sennheiser PXC 550-II</h3>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sennheiser" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sennheiser">Sennheiser’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> PXC-550 II might not be vying for the title of absolute premium noise-cancelingest headphones, but they emerged as a dark horse in our testing. Like the others on this list, Sennheiser’s noise-canceling headphones are wireless with an over-ear design, but that’s where the similarities end.</p>
<p>While the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bose" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bose">Bose <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sony" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sony">Sony <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> pairs feel expensive and substantial, the Sennheiser PXC 550-IIs are relatively plasticky — but that might actually be a good thing. The noise canceling here is totally adequate for normal needs, but not top-of-the-line extreme like the other two picks. It mutes background noise within reason rather than transporting you to an eerily totally silent realm, and that&#8217;s probably sufficient for a lot of people. The sound quality is notably good for the lower price range ($200 from Sennheiser, at the time of writing), defined by Sennheiser&#8217;s signature clean, clear style. If you’ve liked Sennheiser sound in the past, you’ll like it here.</p>
<p>Where the Sennheisers really shine is day-to-day use. I found myself reaching for this pair more often than not during my testing, which was surprising given that I have quite a few higher-end pairs of headphones laying around. The reason? For one, they are made of plastic; they’re light and wearing them for very extended periods of time (many hours at once) was comfortable. Pairing and set-up was a breeze.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077781" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077781" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2077781 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09856.jpg" alt="Sennheiser PXC 550-II headphones on table" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09856.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09856.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09856.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09856.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09856.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC09856.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077781" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Taylor Hatmaker/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>I was also surprised by how much I liked the mechanism for turning on the PXC 550-IIs: Rather than feeling around for a tiny button usually proximal to other tiny buttons, you can actually twist the headphones on and off with a satisfying click. I thought this would be a gimmick, but it&#8217;s super convenient and it feels nice to know your headphones won&#8217;t be burning any battery life by accident. There’s also a small battery indicator light that gives you an idea how much juice is left, a feature that might seem vestigial to some people but I personally found it super useful.</p>
<p>The knocks against the PXC 550-IIs? The less premium feel isn’t for everyone. They charge via an outdated micro-USB port, which is annoying because generally it meant toting around an extra cable. The headphones can also pair to more than one device at once, which is cool but did result in a British AI voice repeating “phone one connected, phone two connected” in a maddening monotone more than I cared for.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what it is about these Sennheisers, but I really fell in love with them. In spite of using a pair of <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sony WH-1000XM3s</span> as my day-to-day headphones, I’ll probably pick up a pair of these too, eventually. They’re just that charming — and for $150 less than our other picks, they&#8217;re a great value too.</p>
<p><em>Verdict: All-day noise-canceling headphones with crisp sound and a great price</em></p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t stand ear-hugging headphones, don&#8217;t fret — we&#8217;ve got some earbud-style noise-canceling recommendations coming soon. But if you&#8217;re open to big ol&#8217; headphones and need top-notch noise canceling paired with incredible sound, none of these picks will disappoint.</p>

<p>The Thermomix has been around for a while now, but the new TM6 model takes its concept of being a one-stop countertop cooking station even further. This new version is packed with smarts, including built-in Wi-Fi, and the inset touchscreen tablet control makes it super easy not only to follow along with recipe instructions, but also to find and save new recipes using Cookidoo, the software companion service to Thermomix&#8217;s hardware.</p>
<p>With the ability to blend, mix, chop, sauté, steam, slow cook, sous vide and much more, the Thermomix really can handle just about every task involved in cooking. Yes, it comes with a hefty price tag, but when you consider all the various kitchen gadgets it&#8217;s replacing &#8212; and the added benefits it includes, like the built-in guided recipe service &#8212; it becomes clear that the asking price is actually a bargain.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $1,499 from <a href="https://shop.thermomix.com/product/thermomix/">Thermomix</a></p>

<p>If you think you don&#8217;t have a knack for cooking meat properly, you might actually just be lacking a crucial tool &#8212; a good meat thermometer. The MEATER Plus is that and more, with connected features that provide you with real-time temp monitoring via mobile app, as well as a full guide of proper, safe temperatures for cooking all kinds of meat, and awesome charts and graphs of both the ambient temperature of whatever appliance you&#8217;re using to cook, in addition to the internal temp.</p>
<p>The Plus version of MEATER extends its Bluetooth range via the connected base, providing you with enough reach to monitor an outdoor cook throughout your house, for instance. The totally wire-free design and magnetic base is a nice touch for storage and convenience, and you can easily connect other MEATERs if you&#8217;re cooking a variety of things at once.</p>

<p>I used to enjoy BBQing quite a lot, but that was before I discovered the joys of a smoker. The Weber SmokeFire EX6 is one of two debut pellet smoker grills created by the iconic outdoor grilling company, and it&#8217;s the bigger version that provides enough grilling surface for you to feed a large family or a small sports team.</p>
<p>The SmokeFire EX6 has had some growing pains since its introduction to the market earlier this year, but consistent and frequent firmware updates delivered over-the-air to its Wi-Fi-connected controller have made it a top performer. You can use built-in cooking programs, along with up to four hardwired temperature probes, to prepare whatever you&#8217;re making to perfection. Low and slow, or high and hot, the EX6 does it all.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $1,199 from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08H8VLC9T/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08H8VLC9T&amp;linkId=371da5faec86ac27d6023fadd9cea4b2">Amazon</a></p>

<p>While a smoker offers a lot of benefit, especially for lower-temp cooking, it&#8217;s hard to beat a charcoal grill for everyday use, particularly with foods like hamburgers, fish and steaks, as well as roasted veggies. The Spark One is a smart grill that takes everything that&#8217;s good about the tried-and-tested &#8220;green egg&#8221; style cooker and updates it with connectivity and convenience.</p>
<p>Spark Grills has simplified charcoal grilling with their pre-formed Briqs, which are single-piece charcoal fuel blocks that slot perfectly into the Spark One and that ignite quickly via electric igniter to get to temp. Built-in fans keep the temperature consistent for the best possible, predictable cooks of all types of foods.</p>

<p>The Revolution R180 High Speed Smart Toaster is true to its name, cooking toast faster than most. But more than its speed, it deserves praise for its precision: What you see is what you get thanks to a visual doneness selector on the large touchscreen interface. It&#8217;s also got custom modes for bread, bagels, waffles, English muffins and even toaster pastries, as well as fresh, frozen and reheated versions of each.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an expensive toaster, but you probably don&#8217;t know what toast could be if you haven&#8217;t yet tried toast made by the R180.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $240 from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086H69SJ2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B086H69SJ2&amp;linkId=3ffd0bd4179d912b3a9113b5c9e90ca1">Amazon</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/netflix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="netflix">Netflix <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/coming-soon/whats-coming-to-netflix-in-november-2020-11-17/">started streaming &#8220;Chappelle&#8217;s Show&#8221;</a> at the beginning of November — but barely more than three weeks later, it has taken the Comedy Central sketch show off its service.</p>
<p>Co-creator <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/dave-chappelle" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="dave-chappelle">Dave Chappelle <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> offered some context for the decision in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CH-rR9znT3g/?utm_source=ig_embed">an Instagram clip</a> of what appears to be a recent standup set, in which he described any company streaming the show as &#8220;fencing stolen goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not that he&#8217;s accusing Comedy Central of violating its deal with him. Instead, it&#8217;s the contract that he&#8217;s criticizing, and he said he signed it &#8220;the way that a 28-year-old expecting father that was broke signs a contract.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>People think I made a lot of money from ‘Chappelle’s Show.&#8217; When I left that show, I never got paid. They didn’t have to pay me because I signed the contract. But is that right? I found out that these people were streaming my work and they never had to ask me or they never have to tell me. Perfectly legal because I signed the contract. But is that right? I didn’t think so either.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chappelle went on to describe himself as &#8220;furious&#8221; when he heard that Netflix was streaming the show:</p>
<blockquote><p>So you know what I did? I called them and I told them that this makes me feel bad. And you want to know what they did? They agreed that they would take it off their platform just so I could feel better. That’s why I fuck with Netflix. Because they paid me my money, they do what they say they’re going to do, and they went above and beyond what you could expect from a businessman. They did something just because they thought that <em>I </em> might think that they were wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking of deals, Netflix <a href="https://pagesix.com/2016/11/21/dave-chappelle-will-make-60m-from-netflix-specials/">signed a reported $60 million deal</a> with Chappelle in 2016 for the rights to three stand-up specials.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chappelle&#8217;s Show,&#8221; meanwhile, is still available on HBO Max (he has some choice words for HBO executives, as well) and on Comedy Central and CBS All Access — which, like Comedy Central, is owned by ViacomCBS.</p>
