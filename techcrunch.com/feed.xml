										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Scotts Miracle-Gro knows how to make plants grow, and now the company is looking to cannabis companies to grow its balance sheet. The company today announced an investment entity specifically for cannabis.</p>
<p>Called The Hawthorne Collective, the entity is said to be pursuing minority investments in companies not currently being pursued by ScottsMiracle-Gro’s cannabis subsidiary, The Hawthorne Gardening Company, which owns and operates dozens of cannabis-focused gardening brands.</p>
<p>The Hawthorne Collective’s first investment comes in a $150 million convertible loan to Toronto-based RIV Capital, a cannabis investment and acquisition firm. <a href="https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-creation-new-investment-entity">According to the company’s press release,</a> the note accrues interest at 2.03%, and upon close, RIV Capital will become The Collective’s preferred vehicle for future investments.</p>
<p>The addition of this investment vehicle gives Scotts Miracle-Gro a new entry into the expanding world of cannabis. Its operating subsidiary, The Hawthorne Gardening Company, already houses some of cannabis’ most potent gardening brands.</p>
<p>“Indeed, the growth of The Hawthorne Gardening Company over the past six years has generated significant shareholder value,” said Jim Hagedorn, Scotts Miracle-Gro Chairman and CEO, in a released statement. “It also has allowed us to develop a rare level of expertise and insight regarding the cannabis space without being involved in the plant-touching aspects of the industry. That is why we are beginning to invest in other areas of the industry through The Collective while continuing to pursue near-in strategic acquisitions to fold into the existing Hawthorne Gardening business.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Merchants use Upscribe’s technology to drive subscriber growth, reduce churn and enable personalized subscription experiences, like skipping shipments and swapping out products.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.upscribe.io">Upscribe</a> founder and CEO Dileepan Siva watched the retail industry make a massive shift to subscription e-commerce for physical products over the past decade, and decided to get in it himself in 2019.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles-based company, developing subscription software for direct-to-consumer e-commerce merchants, is Siva’s fourth startup experience and first time as founder. He closed a $4 million seed round to go after two macro trends he is seeing: buying physical products, like consumer-packaged goods, on a recurring basis, and new industries offering subscriptions, like car and fashion companies.</p>
<p>Merchants use Upscribe’s technology to drive subscriber growth, reduce churn and enable their customers to personalize a subscription experience, like skipping shipments, swapping out products and changing the order frequency. Brands can also feature products for upsell purposes throughout the subscriber lifecycle, from checkout to post-purchase.</p>
<p>Upscribe also offers APIs for merchants to integrate tools like Klaviyo, Segment and Shopify — a new subscription offering for checkouts.</p>
<p>Uncork Capital led the seed round and was joined by Leaders Fund, The House Fund, Roach Capitals’ Fahd Ananta and Shippo CEO Laura Behrens Wu.</p>
<p>“As the market for D2C subscriptions booms, there is a need for subscription-first brands to grow and scale their businesses,” said Jeff Clavier, founder and managing partner of Uncork Capital, in a written statement. “We have spent a long time in the e-commerce space, working with D2C brands and companies who are solving common industry pain points, and Upscribe’s merchant-centric approach raised the bar for subscription services, addressing the friction in customer experiences and enabling merchants to engage subscribers and scale recurring revenue growth.”</p>
<p>Siva bootstrapped the company, but decided to go after venture capital dollars when Upscribe wanted to create a more merchant-centric approach, which required scaling with a bigger team. The “real gems are in the data layer and how to make the experience exceptional,” he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is growing 43% quarter over quarter and is close to profitable, with much of its business stemming from referrals, Siva said. It is already working with customers like Athletic Greens, Four Sigmatic and True Botanicals and across multiple verticals, including food and beverage, health and wellness, beauty and cosmetics and home care.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to “capture the next wave of brands that are going to grow,” he added. Siva cites the growth will come as the DTC subscription market is forecasted to reach $478 billion by 2025, and 75% of those brands are expected to offer subscriptions in the next two years. As such, the majority of the funding will be used to bring on more employees, especially in the product, customer success and go-to-market functions.</p>
<p>Though there is competition in the space, many of those are focused on processing transactions, while Siva said Upscribe’s approach is customer relationships. The cost of acquiring new customers is going up, and subscription services will be the key to converting one-time buyers into loyal customers.</p>
<p>“It is really about customer relationships and the ongoing engagement between merchants and subscribers,” he added. “We are in a different world now. The first wave could play the Facebook game, advertising on social media with super low acquisition and scale. That is no longer the case anymore.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Weeks after Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">rolled out</a> increased protections for minors using its app, Google is now doing the same for its suite of services, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/families/giving-kids-and-teens-safer-experience-online/">including</a> Google search, <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/new-safety-and-digital-wellbeing-options-younger-people-youtube-and-youtube-kids/">YouTube</a>, YouTube Kids, Google Assistant, and others. The company this morning announced a series of product and policy changes that will allow younger people to stay more private and protected online and others that will limit ad targeting.</p>
<p>The changes in Google&#8217;s case are even more expansive than those Instagram announced, as they span across an array of Google&#8217;s products, instead of being limited to a single app.</p>
<p>Though Congress <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-google-and-twitter-grilled-by-congress-what-you-need-to-know/">has been pressing</a> Google and other tech companies on the negative impacts their services may have on children, not all changes being made are being required by law, Google says.</p>
<p>&#8220;While some of these updates directly address upcoming regulations, we’ve gone beyond what’s required by law to protect teens on Google and YouTube,&#8221; a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Many of these changes also extend beyond any single current or upcoming regulation. We’re looking at ways to develop consistent product experiences and user controls for kids and teens globally,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>In other words, Google is building in some changes based on where it believes the industry is going, rather than where it is right now.</p>
<p>On YouTube, Google says it will &#8220;gradually&#8221; start adjusting the default upload setting to the most private option for users ages 13 to 17 in the weeks ahead, which will limit the visibility of videos only to the the users and those they directly share with, not the wider public. These younger teen users won&#8217;t be prevented from changing the setting back to &#8220;public,&#8221; necessarily, but they will now have to make an explicit and intentional choice when doing so. YouTube will then provide reminders indicating who can see their video, the company notes.</p>
<p>YouTube will also turn on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/11/youtube-rolls-out-new-tools-to-help-you-stop-watching/">its &#8220;take a break&#8221; and bedtime reminders</a> by default for all users ages 13 to 17 and will turn off autoplay. Again, these changes are related to the default settings  &#8212; users can disable the digital well-being features if they choose.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4ec10qfiHX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/11/youtube-rolls-out-new-tools-to-help-you-stop-watching/">YouTube rolls out new tools to help you stop watching</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YouTube rolls out new tools to help you stop watching&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/11/youtube-rolls-out-new-tools-to-help-you-stop-watching/embed/#?secret=4ec10qfiHX" data-secret="4ec10qfiHX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On YouTube&#8217;s platform for younger children, YouTube Kids, the company will also add an autoplay option, which is turned off autoplay by default so parents will have to decide whether or not they want to use autoplay with their children. The change puts the choice directly in parents&#8217; hands, after <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22412232/youtube-kids-autoplay">complaints from child safety advocates and some members of Congress</a> suggested such an algorithmic feature was problematic. Later, parents will also be able to &#8220;lock&#8221; their default selection.</p>
<p>YouTube will also remove &#8220;overly commercial content&#8221; from YouTube Kid, in a move that also follows <a href="https://www.democraticmedia.org/article/ftc-complaints-filed-campaign-commercial-free-childhood-and-center-digital-democracy-lead">increased pressure</a> from consumer advocacy groups and childhood experts, who have long since argued that YouTube encourages kids to spend money (or rather, beg their parents to do so.) How YouTube will draw the line between acceptable and &#8220;overly commercial&#8221; content <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10938174">is less clear</a>, but the company says it will, for example, remove videos that focus on product packaging &#8212; like the popular &#8220;unboxing&#8221; videos. This could impact some of YouTube&#8217;s <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/22/18275767/toy-unboxing-videos-youtube-advertising-ethics">larger creators</a> of videos for kids, like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/24/949926198/9-year-old-boy-is-named-highest-earning-youtube-star-of-2020">multi-millionaire</a> Ryan&#8217;s Toy Review.</p>

<p>Elsewhere on Google, other changes impacting minors will also begin rolling out.</p>
<p>In the weeks ahead, Google will introduce a new policy that will allow anyone under the age of 18, or a parent or guardian, to request the removal of their images from Google Image search results. This expands upon the existing &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221; <a href="https://support.google.com/transparencyreport/answer/7347822?hl=en">privacy policies already live in the E.U.</a>, but will introduce new products and controls for both kids and teenagers globally.</p>
<p>The company will make a number of adjustments to user accounts for people under the age of 18, as well.</p>
<p>In addition to the changes to YouTube, Google will restrict access to adult content by enabling its <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/510?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en">SafeSearch</a> filtering technology by default to all users under 13 managed by its <a href="https://families.google.com/familylink/">Google Family Link</a> service. It will also enable SafeSearch for all users under 18 and make this the new default for teens who set up new accounts. Google Assistant will enable SafeSearch protections by default on shared devices, like smart screens and their web browsers. In school settings where Google Workspace for Education is used, SafeSearch will be the default and switching to Guest Mode and Incognito Mode web browsing will be turned off by default, too,<a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/safer-learning-with-google-for-education/"> as was recently announced</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, location history is already off by default on all Google accounts, but children with supervised accounts now won&#8217;t be able to enable it. This change will be extended to all users under 18 globally, meaning location can&#8217;t be enabled at all under the children are legal adults.</p>
<p>On Google Play, the company will launch a new <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/new-google-play-safety-section.html">section</a> that will inform parents about which apps follow its <a href="https://play.google.com/console/about/families/">Families policies</a>, and app developers will have to disclose how their apps collect and use data. These features &#8212; which were partially inspired by Apple&#8217;s App Store Privacy Labels &#8212; <a href="https://support.google.com/transparencyreport/answer/7347822?hl=en">had already been detailed for Android developers </a>before today.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lMdKQfcZ5b"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/google-unveils-its-proposed-safety-section-for-apps-on-google-play/">Google unveils its proposed &#8216;safety section&#8217; for apps on Google Play</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google unveils its proposed &#8216;safety section&#8217; for apps on Google Play&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/google-unveils-its-proposed-safety-section-for-apps-on-google-play/embed/#?secret=lMdKQfcZ5b" data-secret="lMdKQfcZ5b" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Google&#8217;s parental control tools are also being expanded. Parents and guardians who are Family Link users will gain new abilities to filter and block news, podcasts, and access to webpages on Assistant-enabled smart devices.</p>
<p>For advertisers, there are significant changes in store, too.</p>
<p>Google says it will expand safeguards to prevent age-sensitive ad categories from being shown to teens and it will block ad targeting based on factors like age, gender, or interests for users under 18. While somewhat similar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">to the advertising changes Instagram introduced</a>, as ads will no longer leverage &#8220;interests&#8221; data for targeting young teens and kids, Instagram was still allowing targeting by age and gender. Google will not. The advertising changes will roll out globally in the &#8220;coming months,&#8221; the company says.</p>
<p>All the changes across Google and YouTube will roll out globally in the coming weeks and months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every woman will go through menopause some time during her life, but like many other femtech topics, this one is still not talked about as much as it should be.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.elektrahealth.com/">Elektra Health</a>, a women’s health technology company startup that raised $3.75 million in seed funding to continue developing its platform that provides evidence-based care, education and a community for women going through the various stages of menopause.</p>
<p>Co-founders Alessandra Henderson and Jannine Versi told TechCrunch that more than 50 million women in the United States are currently in some stage of menopause, while the industry itself represents a <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/menopause-startups-vc-funding/">$600 billion global market opportunity</a>.</p>
<p>CEO Henderson, whose background includes business creation platform Human Ventures, called menopause a “cultural zeitgeist” that is coming into its own in terms of the conversation and having investors believe in Elektra’s mission. The company is also personal for Henderson — she went on a hormonal health journey that began four years ago after experiencing symptoms that went unexplained by specialists.</p>
<p>Several years later, she wanted to start a company in femtech. There was so much already in the reproductive space, yet no one was talking about what comes next or the phases for moving through menopause, Henderson said. It was when she was introduced to her co-founder Versi, whose background is in digital health, that the idea for Elektra came together.</p>
<p>Menopause is a hormonal health transition that typically starts in women when they reach their 40s or 50s. There have been up to 34 identified symptoms of menopause, and research has found that 80% of women say <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576769/">menopause symptoms have negatively impacted their quality of life</a> in some way. At the same time, <a href="https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2018/menopause-symptoms-doctors-relief-treatment.html#:~:text=Most%20medical%20schools%20and%20residency,Mostly%2C%20the%20courses%20are%20elective.">less than 20% of obstetrics/gynecology residency programs educate doctors about menopause</a>.</p>
<p>Elektra’s platform is picking up that slack by offering clinical care via telemedicine and its proprietary <a href="https://www.elektrahealth.com/services/">“Meno-morphosis” program</a> that features evidence-based guidance on symptoms, a community of support and access to a 1:1 dedicated menopause expert. The program will open completely to the public in 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are all about caring for women by providing content, education, care, coaching and counseling, especially working in the arc of their journey,” Versi said. “This is such an intimate topic, but we have referral rates of 40% where women are talking about it themselves and then bring a friend along. Sustaining that is important to us. We are seeing clusters of friends come along and really bond with the community.”</p>
<p>The New York-based company’s seed funding was co-led by Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six and Flare Capital Partners, with participation from City Light Capital, January Ventures, Human Ventures, The Fund, Community Fund and a group of angel investors, including Hannah and Guy Raz, Claire Diaz-Ortiz and Jenny Fielding.</p>
<p>This new round of funding will be used to grow its team and to expand its integrative, evidence-based solution to millions of women in the U.S., and beyond.</p>

<p>Since launching the company in 2020, more than 1,800 women have participated in Elektra’s private beta educational programming.</p>
<p>“Last year was about learning and growing the things that women want,” Henderson said. “We are making an impact in the way women deserve.”</p>
<p>Much of women’s health technology is aimed at fertility, but Elektra Health is not alone in tackling this issue: new startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/2182193/">Peppy recently reported funding</a> to address menopause in employee health; meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/personalized-menopause-platform-vira-health-raises-1-5m-from-localglobe-mmc-ventures/">Vira Health raised £1.5 million</a> in seed funding for a U.K. platform. Other startups, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/new-telemedicine-service-the-cusp-rolls-out-at-home-hormone-test-for-women-to-predict-menopause/">The Cusp</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/the-menopause-is-on-our-roadmap-says-clues-ida-tin/">Clue</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/10/curiemd-is-using-telehealth-to-plug-the-menopause-support-gap/">CurieMD</a>, are also targeting this space with products and services.</p>
<p>Katelin Holloway, founding partner at Seven Seven Six, said in her previous roles leading compensation and benefits for companies, she became increasingly aware that the need for menopause care was just as desired by employees as fertility benefits.</p>
<p>When her employees began requesting desk fans, she started investigating the source of the requests and found it was from the company’s non-Gen Z employees, and all women.</p>
<p>“I realized I had a decent cohort of women experiencing menopause,” Holloway said. “The fan on the desk was kind of a ‘bat signal’ to other employees, unlocking conversations between them where they had previously been experiencing these symptoms in silos.”</p>
<p>Once she became an investor, she put out the call again looking for a company providing that kind of care and was introduced to Elektra. Holloway said there is a whole new group of women entering their 40s who want to talk about menopause and have the technology available, while also wanting privacy for care and a community to share in the experience.</p>
<p>She called Elektra’s co-founders “incredible women who care deeply about this space and have amazing credentials and background to bring to this company.” She also said she was sold on their approach of care, community and content, which aligns with what was working in the pregnancy and fertility spaces.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The co-founders reached out to local home chefs and gathered them together in a marketplace where they could share their culture and passion of food with others.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Home-cooked food delivery service <a href="https://www.eatwoodspoon.com">WoodSpoon</a> is planning an expansion after raising $14 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Restaurant Brands International led the round along with World Trade Ventures and a group of individual investors, including Victor Lazarte.</p>
<p>New York-based WoodSpoon was started in 2019 by Oren Saar and Merav Kalish Rozengarten, two Israelis in America that longed for the food they grew up with. They began reaching out to local home chefs in the area and gathered them together in a marketplace where they could share their culture and passion of food with others.</p>
<p>Two years later, the company boasts over 16,000 active customers in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens and 50% month over month growth. Customers can order dishes that run the gambit of world cuisine through WoodSpoon’s website or app and receive on-demand delivery to their doorstep or schedule service. Saar told TechCrunch that 35% of WoodSpoon’s customers have ordered four times in 17 days after their first order.</p>
<p>The new funding gives the company a total of $16 million — it raised $2 million at the end of 2020. Saar said the Series A enables the company to accelerate growth through R&amp;D and marketing and to double its team so it can expand into new markets, like major cities across the United States, over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>At the same time as it brings customers culturally diverse food, WoodSpoon helps generate income for its home chefs — a mix of 150 active professional chefs, immigrants and cooks making dishes for the company at least three times a month. WoodSpoon interviews each chef, inspects their kitchens and provides training to keep consistent quality.</p>
<p>“When you scale, you can lose touch with your customers and lose the personal connection with the home chefs,” Saar said. “We feel every home chef is part of our family and want to help them build their brand, so it is important that this food is high quality.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>WoodSpoon has about 30 employees and plans to hire more engineers to continue developing its technology. Saar said a new product will be launching at the end of August, while WoodSpoon’s app will get an overhaul to have a new look and feel.</p>
<p>The Series A also enables WoodSpoon to onboard its waitlist of hundreds of home chefs that want to join the marketplace.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-online-food-delivery-services-market-report-2021-market-is-expected-to-reach-192-16-billion-in-2025--from-126-91-billion-in-2021---long-term-forecast-to-2030--301285677.html">global online food delivery services market</a> is forecasted to be $126.91 billion in 2021, and then reach $192.16 billion in 2025, according to consultancy firm Research and Markets.</p>
<p>Chris Brigleb, head of corporate development at Restaurant Brands International, said technology is a big focus for his company, which spent a lot of time looking around for potential investments beyond the traditional quick-serve restaurant space.</p>
<p>He began meeting with tech-enabled businesses and came across WoodSpoon four months ago. The more Brigleb learned about the company, the more he liked it, and even encouraged Saar to speed up WoodSpoon’s growth and fundraising plans, he said.</p>
<p>Though WoodSpoon’s concept is not new, he felt its approach was the complete package of user experience on the customer side, the ease of searching the marketplace by chef or cuisine and support for the chef in terms of providing packaging and logistics management.</p>
<p>“The delivery was a key for us and a differentiator,” Brigleb said. “They take all of the hard parts about delivering for home chefs off of their plate so they can focus on the actual cooking that is special to them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Niantic continues to push forward in its quest to build a 3D map of the world.</p>
<p>This morning the company announced that it has acquired <a href="https://scaniverse.com/">Scaniverse</a>, an iPhone/iPad app for scanning objects and environments in high-resolution 3D.</p>
<p>A rep for Niantic tells me that Scaniverse will remain on the App Store, with plans to continue supporting it as a standalone app. Features previously limited to a $17-per-year &#8220;Pro&#8221; subscription, including higher-resolution processing and support for exporting models to other 3D software, will now be free.</p>
<p>As I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/the-niantic-ec-1/">first wrote about years ago</a>, one of Niantic&#8217;s goals is to build a detailed and endlessly-evolving 3D map of the world — a step they see as fundamental to enabling true, rich augmented reality experiences if/when the world ever embraces something like AR glasses. It&#8217;s a rather massive (and never ending) task, but one made a bit more feasible by way of its ever-roaming player base across games like Pokémon GO, Harry Potter Wizards Unite, and Ingress.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Scaniverse creator Keith Ito will be joining Niantic&#8217;s AR team. The company declined to outline any other terms of the acquisition. This is Niantic&#8217;s latest acquisition in the 3D mapping space, having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/niantic-acquires-ar-startup-6d-ai-as-the-game-creator-squares-up-against-apple-facebook/">acquired 6D.ai for an undisclosed sum in early 2020</a>.</p>
<p>For context, here&#8217;s a demo of the Scaniverse app doing its thing:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Leafly is turning to a SPAC with Merdia Merger Corp. I to go public. The deal, valued at about $532 million and expected to generate proceeds of up to $161.5 million, includes Leafly’s recent capital raise of $31.5 million from investors, including Merida Capital Holdings.te</p>
<p>The company is expected to list on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol of LFLY as Merida will adopt the Leafly name. Existing Leafly shareholders will own about 72% of the merged company. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Leafly was founded in 2010 and has grown into a leading marketplace and resource. The company offers a deep library of content for consumers, including detailed information about strains, retailers, and current events. For retailers, Leafly offers a subscription-based platform that 7,800 brands and 4,600 retail subscribers use. <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/leafly-to-go-public-via-combination-with-spac-merida-merger-corp-i-271628512551">According to a report</a>, the company is expected to see revenue hit $43 million in 2021 and $65 million in 2022.</p>
<p>Despite the successes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/leafly-lays-off-91-employees-with-funding-on-pause/">Leafly experienced a turbulent 2020</a> with layoffs and leadership changes. Yoko Miyashita took over as the company’s CEO in August 2020 and has been focused on Leafly, leaning heavily into building a better online shopping experience. In February 2021, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/leafly-and-jane-partner-to-build-a-better-online-cannabis-shopping-experience/">the company partnered with Jane</a> to improve Leafly’s e-commerce tools.</p>
<p>By going public through a SPAC, Leafly is signaling it&#8217;s entering a growth phase just in time for the US Government to loosen cannabis restrictions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning, <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a> announced a new product for business owners called <a href="https://www.wix.com/app-builder">Branded App by Wix</a>, which allows users to develop native apps without writing code. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/05/twitter-friends-ahead-of-its-public-debut-wednesday-wix-prices-ipo-at-16-50-per-share-with-valuation-near-800m/">publicly-traded</a> company provides tools for people and businesses to manage their online presence, but it&#8217;s most well-known for its drag-and-drop website builder. Now, the platform is expanding its user-friendly approach by making it possible for anyone to build an app without learning how to code.</p>
<p class="p1">“Users came to us with the need to create a native app that is branded with their name and logo,&#8221; said Ronny Elkayam, SVP of Mobile, App Market &amp; Strategic Products at Wix. &#8220;Many of our users are businesses, and businesses have a desire to portray a situation that they are bigger than they are. They want to follow the big businesses that have native apps.&#8221;</p>
<p>At $200 per month, Branded App by Wix is no small investment; users will also have to pay a yearly $99 fee to be on the App Store, and a one-time $25 fee for Google Play. But according to Wix, native mobile apps can help businesses ultimately drive more sales. For users that already have a Wix website, the app builder can automatically integrate features from their website, making the process more simple.</p>
<p>“If you&#8217;re a restaurant, and you have your menu configured on your website for online ordering, the same menu is going to show up on the app. You don’t need to configure it. Any purchases or any orders from that menu are going to show up in your dashboard,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> Elkayam said.</span></p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oYYPmaFmCB4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Working in the world of disability insurance for a decade, Colin Nabity felt not everyone could access this type of insurance due to its nature of it being difficult to understand and underwrite.</p>
<p>Disability and critical illness insurance is typically income protection should someone be too sick or hurt to work. An average of <a href="https://disabilitycanhappen.org/disability-statistic/#:~:text=5.6%20percent%20of%20working%20Americans,on%20average%20every%20year5.">5.6% of working Americans each year will experience a short-term disability</a> during a period of six months or less due to illness, injury or pregnancy. At the same time, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/p0816-disability.html">1 in 4 Americans currently live with a disability</a> that impacts their major life activities.</p>
<p>Similar to other insurance products, disability insurance was sold the same way for more than 20 years: using outdated technology, data science and underwriting that didn’t provide consumers an appropriate policy based on their occupation and health. In addition, there was not a digital platform to sell this type of insurance directly to consumers, Nabity said.</p>
<p>Enter Omaha, Nebraska-based <a href="https://www.meetbreeze.com/">Breeze</a>, the company Nabity started in 2019 with Cody Leach to enable individuals to go online and complete in 10 minutes the application process to receive a personalized quote for either disability insurance or critical illness insurance.</p>
<p>There are large incumbents in the space — for example Aflac, but Nabity said Breeze’s platform offers a digital approach to disability and critical illness applications, quotes and policy-making that offers consumers protection during events like cancer, heart attacks, strokes and other medical conditions that can lead to a loss of income if someone is unable to work.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/disability-insurance-united-states/">U.S. market for disability insurance</a> was valued at $19.1 billion as of this year and was declining slightly since 2016, IBIS World reported. Breeze is reimagining these products to make them more affordable &#8212; a policy for several thousand dollars costs, on average, around $20 a month &#8212; and to provide consumer education so that purchasing this type of insurance is less intimidating, he added.</p>
<p>“We want a way for people to understand this type of insurance, make it more affordable and be bought completely online,” Nabity told TechCrunch. “These illnesses and injuries wreck families because they can be so financially devastating.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Breeze raised $10 million in Series A funding in a round led by Link Ventures that Nabity boasts is the “largest first round of institutional capital ever invested in a Nebraska-based software startup.” Northwestern Mutual Ventures, Silicon Valley Bank, M25, Fiat Ventures and Invest Nebraska also participated in the financing.</p>
<p>Lisa Dolan, managing director at Link Ventures, said she found the company while examining web traffic data, where Breeze was listed among industry incumbents among consumers searching for disability.</p>
<p>Dolan admits that even she was not familiar, at the time, with disability insurance and has since learned that the market is larger than originally thought. She believes that by using technology to route the appropriate customer to the approach insurance, Breeze is able to reach customers that incumbent insurance carriers can’t get to.</p>
<p>Nabity did not disclose any growth metrics, but said he intends to use the new funding — the company’s first round of institutional capital — to grow its core products and add new products, carriers and agents to the platform. He will also increase Breeze’s headcount in the areas of software development, customer service and marketing.</p>
<p>“We are in the process of opening up our platform to agents that have not sold these products before, and we will need product and support teams to handle that increased volume,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">No matter how carefully you set up your systems, sooner or later something fundamental breaks. How you react during those times and how quickly you respond to the crisis is what people remember after it&#8217;s over. <a href="https://www.firehydrant.io/">FireHydrant</a>, a startup that helps companies prepare for and manage such crises, announced a $23 million Series B investment today.</p>
<p>Harmony Partners led the round with participation from Salesforce Ventures and existing investors Menlo Ventures and Work-Bench. Today&#8217;s money brings the total raised to $32.5 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>The company focuses on helping customers navigate a crisis and a big part of that is run books, which act as playbooks for handling various crisis situations as they arise. As part of that, the company has added a directory of service owners to make it easier to find the people in charge of a given service should it be the cause or impacted by an ongoing event.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Robert Ross says that the company has grown customers 5x since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/firehyrdant-lands-8m-series-a-for-disaster-management-tool/">the startup&#8217;s A round last year</a>, and they are seeing customers get creative with how they use run books.</p>
<p>&#8220;The run books functionality is really the bread and butter of functionality of FireHydrant, and we&#8217;re seeing customers leverage them in ways we didn&#8217;t really imagine, and truly kind of outperforming a lot of the expectations of that functionality. So they&#8217;re getting really creative in using them to onboard people into incidents and using them for better incident communication. So that&#8217;s been a really nice thing to see,&#8221; Ross told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5sbX99Z7MP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/firehyrdant-lands-8m-series-a-for-disaster-management-tool/">FireHydrant  lands $8M Series A for disaster management tool</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;FireHydrant  lands $8M Series A for disaster management tool&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/firehyrdant-lands-8m-series-a-for-disaster-management-tool/embed/#?secret=5sbX99Z7MP" data-secret="5sbX99Z7MP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ross says that they are trying to position incident management as a business problem, rather than purely an engineering problem. That&#8217;s because if your site goes down for a sustained period of time, people on Twitter aren&#8217;t going to be talking about the company&#8217;s engineering failure, they are going to say the business is failing because it&#8217;s not up and running at full capacity or in some cases at all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Obviously I believe that site reliability in general is going to be something that has an impact on the business no matter what. If it&#8217;s something as simple as your app not working or just being glitchy, people are going to get upset,&#8221; Ross said.</p>
<p>The company has grown substantially since we spoke in May 2020 going from 10 employees to 54. As he continues to add new employees to the mix, Ross says that he trying to stay on top of all three aspects of diversity, equity and inclusion, but it all starts with the sources you use to hire new people. &#8220;Our philosophy is that diversity, equity and inclusion in the business starts at the top of your funnel, and we made sure to put a lot of effort into that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As the pandemic ebbs and flows, Ross says that he has no intention of requiring folks to come into the office, and this is especially true since he has been hiring regardless of geography since the pandemic began. He has a small office in New York City, but nobody is required to go in. He is considering adding office hubs when the pandemic quiets down in Austin, Denver and San Diego.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://butternutbox.com/">Butternut Box</a>, a London-based fresh dog food business with a tech-driven platform that delivers HelloFresh-style, catered dogfood, has raised $55.4 million (€47.2 million) in a funding round led by L Catterton, the consumer-focused private equity firm, and included participation from White Star Capital, Five Seasons Ventures and Passion Capital. We covered their early funding round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/17/butternut-box-raises-1m-for-its-algorithm-driven-natural-dog-food-startup/">back in 2017</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, Butternut Box bills itself as a “human-grade, fresh dog food company” with a “personalized dietary offering” driven by its own tech platform.</p>
<p>Jean-Philippe Barade, Partner, L Catterton Europe, and head of the firm’s London office, commented; “We have long been impressed by how Butternut Box has established itself as the trusted brand of choice in the UK among a loyal base of pet owners… Butternut Box continues to leverage its innovative digital platform to raise the bar in the growing pet food market.”</p>
<p>Led by Goldman Sachs alumni Kevin Glynn and David Nolan, the company says its proprietary algorithm identifies how many calories each individual dog needs based on age, weight, breed, activity levels, and body condition and then pre-portions this amount into daily servings.</p>
<p>It also makes its own “natural” dog food, because studies show that dogs fed a natural diet have a longer life capacity than those fed on industrial canned products &#8211; up to 3 years, a long time in dog years. Since British dog owners spend over £200 million in vet’s fees, overfeeding, and unhealthy food is a key issue for owners.</p>
<p>However, Butternut Box is not alone, since they competing with Lily’s Kitchen, Tails.com and Natural Instinct for this lucrative new market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is now complying with India’s new IT rules, New Delhi told a court Tuesday, in a move that is expected to ease months-long tension between the American social media network and the government of the key overseas market.</p>
<p>A lawyer representing the Indian government told the Delhi High Court that Twitter’s recent steps &#8212; appointment of chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer in the country &#8212; have made the social network &#8220;prima facie&#8221; compliant with the new law.</p>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson in India didn&#8217;t immediately return a text.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s new IT rules, which were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">unveiled in February this year</a>, mandates significant social media firms, among other things, to appoint officials to address on-ground concerns in the country.</p>
<p>Facebook and Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/facebook-whatsapp-google-and-other-internet-giants-comply-with-indias-it-rules/">complied with this requirement in May</a>, when the proposed rules went into effect in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Twitter, which was facing heat from the Indian government for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">not blocking some tweets</a> that the Indian government had deemed objectionable, had requested additional few months to comply with the new rules and in the meantime filled the required roles with temporary staff.</p>
<p>Tension has been brewing between the two for several months. Twitter <a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/twitter-labels-sambit-patras-tweet-cong-toolkit-manipulated-media-149257">labeled a tweet from Sambit Patra</a>, the spokesperson of India’s ruling party BJP, in May as “manipulated media.” Days later, a special squad of Delhi police that investigates terrorism and other crimes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">made a surprise visit to two of Twitter&#8217;s offices</a> in the country to seek information about Twitter’s rationale to term Patra&#8217;s tweets as manipulated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter at the time said it was &#8220;concerned by recent events regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve.”</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s slow-efforts to comply with the new IT rules had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/twitter-has-lost-liability-protection-in-india-government-says/">cost the firm liability protection in the country</a> last month, the Indian government said earlier. Separately, it warned Twitter that the firm was in &#8220;total noncompliance&#8221; with the law.</p>
<p>Internet services enjoy what is broadly referred to as “safe harbor” protection that say that tech platforms won’t be held liable for the things their users post or share online.</p>
<p>Twitter also received public criticism from several top Indian ministers.</p>
<p>&#8220;All social media platforms are welcome to do business in India. They can criticize Ravi Shankar Prasad, my Prime Minister or anyone. The issue is of misuse of social media. Some of them say we are bound by American laws. You operate in India, make good money, but you will take the position that you’ll be governed by American laws. This is plainly not acceptable,” Prasad, who was the IT minister of India until <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/india-it-ravi-shankar-prasad-and-broadcasting-minister-javadekar-resign/">resigning from the position last month</a>, said at a virtual conference early July.</p>
<p>The new rules also require significant social media firms operating encrypted messaging services to devise a way to trace originator of messages for special cases. Several firms including Facebook&#8217;s WhatsApp and Signal have not complied with this requirement. WhatsApp has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/whatsapp-sues-india-government/">sued the Indian government</a> over this requirement.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This presents a large market ripe for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitization,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and over the past five years, African startups have risen to the challenge, raising millions of dollars in the process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="https://www.omnibiz.com/">Omnibiz</a>, a Lagos-based startup, joins the fray and has raised a seed round of $3 million to expand into new markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omnibiz is a B2B e-commerce platform that connects fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) manufacturers to retailers by digitizing the supply chain stakeholders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform offers a mobile app, WhatsApp channel and a phone number that retailers can use to stock their shops</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omnibiz says in a statement that retailers &#8220;can place orders at their convenience and have goods delivered to their doorstep at no cost</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omnibiz </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepankarrustagi">Deepankar Rustagi</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Indian founder and CEO who has stayed in Nigeria for over two decades started his first startup, VConnect, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2011 as an online marketplace and search engine to find local professionals for service needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform connected individuals with more than 100 services and over</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 500,000 listed businesses across the country before shutting down in 2017, Rustagi claims.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post-VConnect, Rustagi consulted for multiple FMCG brands</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He figured a need existed for manufacturers and retailers of goods to digitize their processes leading to the launch of Omnibiz in late 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omnibiz operates an asset-light retail distribution model. When a retailer makes an order on the Omnibiz platform, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is requested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from partner distributors who store goods on behalf of manufacturers and are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">traditionally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> known to help out with warehousing and transportation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Omnibiz, these distributors can focus </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">solely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on warehousing and pass on the responsibility of transporting goods to Omnibiz&#8217;s third-party logistics providers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drivers of these logistics providers use Omnibiz to efficiently distribute the orders to the retailers within</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 24 hours</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We work with manufacturers to provide visibility. Then buy goods from them and keep them in partner hubs that act as warehouses and distributors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, use the services of drivers that work with third-party logistics drivers who get paid on every delivery made,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Rustagi told TechCrunch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digitizing this value chain helps retailers save working capital while Omnibiz connects them with more than 20 brands, including Coca-Cola, Nestlé, Kellogg&#8217;s, Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kimberly-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The B2B e-commerce retail company is currently in four cities across Nigeria &#8212; Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and Kaduna</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company will add two more cities, Ibadan and Kano, before the end of August, Rustagi adds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Rustagi&#8217;s account, Omnibiz will feed off his experience at VConnect, his prior business that struggled to monetize and scale despite the huge traction it got as a popular local marketplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We knew about small businesses and what sort of technology they like. That was our specialization, but our business model didn&#8217;t work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in this case [Omnibiz], the monetization happens on our platform, and there&#8217;s money to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the small business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We&#8217;ve been growing 30% month-on-month for the last 12 months,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The B2B informal e-commerce market has seen a resurgence in the last couple of years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Kenya&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/tradedepot-adds-10-million-to-add-financial-services-to-its-supply-chain-services-for-african-smbs/">Sokowatch</a> and <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2020/10/30/kenyan-agri-tech-startup-twiga-foods-secures-29-4m-ifc-debt-funding-to-assist-its-farmers/">Twiga</a>, Nigeria&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/sokowatch-raises-14m-to-digitize-africas-informal-b2b-supply-chain/">TradeDepot</a> and Egypt&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/maxab-the-egyptian-b2b-food-and-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-40m-for-expansion/">MaxAB</a> have longed vied for market-leader positions in their respective markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic spiked more interest in their activities as all the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aforementioned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> startups have raised money this past year, including newcomers Kenya&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/kenyas-marketforce-raises-2m-plans-to-focus-on-its-b2b-retail-marketplace-rejareja/">MarketForce</a> and now Omnibiz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some operate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">asset-light models, while others take up the responsibility of managing the end-to-end digitization process. Rustagi believes the former is perfect for the company because </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it helps distributors expand their reach rather than eliminate them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> scaling in one city with assets is not that difficult. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have to scale in 20, 24 cities in a country like Nigeria or Ghana, or Ivory Coast or East Africa, the investment required will be very high.&#8221; Rustagi continued.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without significant investment in assets, we will be able to scale much faster. And since we took the tech-first approach, we have good control over the business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we&#8217;re in the right space and the right time with the right model.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omnibiz&#8217;s seed round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> V&amp;R Africa, Timon Capital and Tangerine Insurance. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round also included Lofty Inc., Musha Ventures, Sunu Capital, Launch Africa, and Rising Tide Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It takes the company&#8217;s total investment to $4 million. Rustagi also disclosed that the company also got funding from Seedstars and will participate in the accelerator&#8217;s growth program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Omnibiz will be the role model for B2B retail in Africa and can scale well into other emerging markets. We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and happy to be supporting Omnibiz in all ways beyond </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> providing capital,&#8221; Raj Kulasingam and Vishal Agarwal of V&amp;R Africa said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next few months, Omnibiz will use the investment to expand in other West African cities outside Nigeria &#8212;  Abidjan, Takoradi, Kumasi and Accra. Food, non-alcoholic beverages, personal care, and baby care products are the top categories on the Omnibiz platform. The company is planning to expand into new categories like alcoholic beverages and OTC pharmaceutical products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omnibiz will also use the investment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to create new tech products that will enhance value for the retailers. The company will work with partners to increase the working capital availability for the retailers and digital tools to manage their business more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">efficiently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the key things we intend to do is to bring on medium-scale manufacturers who find it difficult to get the last-mile delivery to reach customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We want to scale them so they can reach a large number of retailers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s something we are rolling out so we can onboard more and more manufacturers,&#8221; said the CEO on Omnibiz&#8217;s next plans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robosoft Technologies, an India-headquartered maker of digital solutions, said on Tuesday it has reached a definitive agreement to sell the business to Japan’s IT services firm TechnoPro for $108 million.</p>
<p>Founded in 1996, <a href="https://www.robosoftin.com">Robosoft</a> Technologies started its journey as a software services firm specialising on the Mac platform and then offered app development as a service.</p>
<p>Robosoft was one of the earliest firms globally to be certified as Mac OS developer by Apple and has been recognized by the iPhone-maker several times in the decades since.</p>
<p>“We knew mobile was going to be big with the launch of iPhone and the App Store ecosystem. We began building mobile apps for clients across the globe and there’s been no looking back,” the companies describes on its website.</p>
<p>Robosoft, which counts Ascent Capital and Kalaari Capital among its investors, has courted clients operating in several categories including games, news, sports, utilities and lifestyle and expanded its offerings to include product advisory, and tools for design, engineering and analytics.</p>
<p>The original app for the Indian news network NDTV, for instance, was developed by Robosoft. Some of its other clients include media giant Viacom and McDonald&#8217;s India. It has clients in the U.S. and Middle East as well.</p>
<p>Since 2017, Robosoft has been attempting to position as a &#8216;digital solutions&#8217; company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement on Tuesday, Robosoft said its current management team will continue to lead the firm. “Robosoft has had a phenomenal journey over the last two decades and has grown by leaps and bounds during this period. The partnership with Ascent Capital and Kalaari Capital heralded a strong growth era for us and I am very happy that we are handing over the reins of the Company to a global player like TechnoPro,” said Rohith Bhat, Founder and Managing Director of Robosoft.</p>
<p>“We look forward to a close collaboration with Robosoft in the company’s next phase of growth and see tremendous synergies between TechnoPro and Robosoft,” said Takeshi Yagi, President and Representative Director and CEO of Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed firm TechnoPro.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.freshbooks.com">FreshBooks</a>, a Toronto-based cloud accounting software company focused on SMBs, announced today it has secured $80.75 million in a Series E round of funding, as well as $50 million in debt financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backer Accomplice led the equity financing, which the company described as &#8220;an inside round&#8221; that propelled FreshBooks to unicorn status with a valuation of “over $1 billion.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">J.P. Morgan, Gaingels, BMO Technology &amp; Innovation Banking Group and Manulife also participated in the equity investment, along with platform partner and new backer Barclays. With the new capital injection, FreshBooks has now raised a total of more than $200 million in funding over its lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FreshBooks </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has built a cloud-based accounting software platform designed to make things like invoicing, expenses, payments, payroll and financial reporting easier for small business owners and self-employed people (and their clients). The company, which says it has served more than 30 million people in over 160 countries, was bootstrapped for the first decade of its life.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;After relaunching its accounting platform, FreshBooks has raised another $43 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/18/freshbooks-43m-series-b/embed/#?secret=kFPJbfbk0G" data-secret="kFPJbfbk0G" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As in the case of many startups, FreshBooks was started to solve a pain point for one of its founders. In 2003, FreshBooks’ co-founder Mike McDerment was running a small design agency. When it came to billing clients, he found Word and Excel frustrating to use and felt like they weren’t built to create professional-looking invoices. So he coded his own solution that became the foundation of what is now FreshBooks. The company was self-funded until </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2014, when McDerment decided to bring on outside investors and raised $30 million from Oak Investment Partners, Accomplice and Georgian Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Don Epperson joined FreshBooks as executive director before transitioning to the role of CEO this year. McDerment, who previously held the position, remains as executive chair of the company.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FreshBooks has 500 employees in Canada, Croatia, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United States &#8212; hiring over 100 people in the past year. Also in the last year, the company entered the LatAm market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">after acquiring Mexico-based e-invoicing company </span><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/09/23/2098093/0/en/FreshBooks-acquires-Mexico-Based-E-Invoicing-Company-Facturama-Further-Expanding-Its-International-Presence.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facturama in September 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an effort to expand its audience in Spanish-speaking markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FreshBooks plans to use its new capital toward sales and marketing, research and development and additional strategic acquisitions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will also use its new funding toward investing in markets that are becoming more regulated and helping owners manage their finances through &#8220;simplistic workflows,&#8221; according to Epperson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, he said, more business owners are working to become digitally enabled to meet local tax and invoice compliance systems. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;The need for owners to manage their business digitally has accelerated, and this has changed how small business owners work with bookkeepers and accountants,&#8221; Epperson told TechCrunch. <span style="font-weight: 400;">“The funding comes as an injection of confidence in our mission to digitally enable small businesses.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to growth metrics like year-over-year revenue percentage growth, the exec </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was tight-lipped, saying only that FreshBooks has “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seen significant growth” in the number of new customers since last year, in part fueled by a pandemic-driven increase in new small businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic also uncovered the need for the company to understand how seismic events affect its customers, Epperson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After analyzing FreshBooks’ own proprietary data, we learned that businesses owned by women were taking three times longer to recover in the U.S. versus businesses owned by men,” Epperson said. “This stat laid the foundation for conducting more research into how the pandemic was affecting businesses across multiple industries and entering into</span><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/press/releases/freshbooks-announces-data-sharing-partnership-with-ontario-government-to-provide-insight-into-how-small-businesses-fared-during-covid-19"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data-sharing partnerships with local governments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help policymakers enact change in the support available to small business owners.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Fagnan, founder and managing partner at Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Accomplice, is clearly bullish on FreshBooks’ potential, saying of his firm’s continued investments in the Canadian company over the past seven years: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more people choosing self-employment, the FreshBooks team fundamentally believes in the growth of small businesses, and the importance of helping these businesses scale. As insiders, we have better context for how the company is scaling and how the market is growing, and this is why FreshBooks is our largest investment to date.”</span></p>
<p>FreshBooks is the latest in a growing number of Toronto-based unicorns. Late last month, 1Password raised $100 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/1password-raises-100m-at-a-2b-valuation/">a Series B round of funding</a> that doubled the company’s valuation to $2 billion. 1Password first became a unicorn in 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roughly a year ago, <a href="https://latentai.com/">Latent AI</a>, a now three-year-old, Menlo Park, Ca.-based startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/startup-battlefield-session-2-latent-ai/">pitched</a> a handful of investors during TechCrunch&#8217;s Battlefield competition. It <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/winner-startup-battlefield-disrupt-2020-200226359.html">didn&#8217;t win</a> that contest, but that hasn&#8217;t kept it from winning the interest of investors elsewhere. It just closed on $19 million in Series A funding in a round co-led by Future Ventures and Blackhorn Ventures, with participation from Booz Allen, Lockheed Martin, 40 North Ventures, and Autotech Ventures. The company has now raised $22.5 million altogether.</p>
<div>What are these backers funding exactly? The company says it makes software designed to train, adapt and deploy edge AI neural networks, irrespective of hardware constraints or the inexpensive chips that are typically found in edge devices. It also says it can compress common AI models by ten times without a noticeable change in accuracy, partly through an “attention mechanism” that enables it to save power and run only what is needed based on environment and operational context. Not last, it promises its users (who are edge device developers) that its software can do all of this with nearly zero latency (thus the company name).</div>
<p>Steve Jurvetson, the veteran investor and cofounder of Future Ventures, says of possible applications, &#8220;Think of face-detection algorithms running locally within security cameras or appliances, or Siri-like voice interfaces working instantly, even when there&#8217;s no network connectivity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly, there&#8217;s a growing market for the kind of tech that Latent AI is developing. Indeed, though in an interview earlier today, cofounder and CEO Jags Kandasamy declined to delve into specifics, he suggested that the U.S. government is already a customer, thanks in part to strategic investors like Booz Allen. (In a press release last month about Booz Allen&#8217;s investment in Latent AI, an SVP at the government services agency noted that the “ability to collect, analyze and quickly act on data is at the core&#8221; of the U.S.&#8217;s national defense strategy.)</p>
<p>Another strategic investor, Lockheed Martin, is very focused on finding ways that AI technologies can help the U.S. military improve on situational awareness across land, sea, air, space, cyber and electromagnetic spectrum domains, so it&#8217;s easy to appreciate its attraction to the startup.</p>
<p>Kandasamy also talked this afternoon about an unnamed ski manufacturer that it is using Latent AI&#8217;s tech in its Google Glass-like augmented reality goggles, and he suggested that Latent AI sees a world of opportunities in the commercial market, too.</p>
<p>Of course, given that the world is now rife with data-collecting-devices and that there&#8217;s an enormous interest in making that data actionable without having to send it back and forth to a distant cloud, there are many other companies and projects with the same objective as Latent AI. Among them are open source tools like TensorFlow, hardware vendors like Xilinx, and rival startups like <a href="https://octoml.ai/">OctoML</a> and<a href="https://www.deeplite.ai/"> Deeplite</a>.</p>
<p>Kandasamy insists that all fall short in some way. Of TensorFlow, he says that developers have only community support when it comes to production deployment. Of the chipmakers of the world, they&#8217;re focused on their own hardware and not vertically integrated. And what of those rivals? They&#8217;re either focused on compression or compiling and not both, says Kandasamy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Either way, Latent AI has the kind of backstory that investors like. After Kandasamy, a serial entrepreneur, sold his last startup to Analog Devices, he headed to SRI International in 2018 as an entrepreneur-in-residence. There, he was quickly wowed by tech being developed by Sek Chai, who was the research institution&#8217;s technical director for nearly a decade, and who specialized in low-power high performance computing, computer vision, and machine learning. Soon after, Kandasamy had Chai had formed Latent AI and begun smoothing out some of the kinks.</p>
<p>Now, with fresh funding and a small but growing customer base that pays Latent AI on a subscription basis to access to its tools (then deploy them on premise), the question is whether the 15-person outfit is coming along far enough, fast enough, to get ahead of its current and future rivals.</p>
<p>Jurvetson plainly thinks it&#8217;s well-positioned. He says he has been an advisory board member for SRI International for more than a decade and seen a good many technologies like Siri develop and then spin out of the organization.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the only one I have invested in,&#8221; he says.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With the fourth quarter now upon us, every industry faces a challenge in managing a holiday production calendar that will deliver the goods. The key for startups looking to defend the quarter from disruptions is to adopt a proactive, data-driven approach to inventory management.</p>
<p>Here are five methods we’ve been counseling clients to adopt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use data and analytics to identify and map out the inventory being affected by the global shipping crisis. If you don’t have the data about what is on a ship transporting your materials, then use this crisis as an opportunity to justify prioritizing supply chain digital transformation with data, IoT and advanced analytics (e.g., machine learning and simulation). You need to know the location of your goods all times if you are going to successfully gauge what impact a shortage will have on your operation. 	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Ultimately, AI will help startups understand how myriad disruptions affect their supply chain so they can better respond with a Plan B when the unthinkable happens.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</li>
<li>If you don’t have the data readily available, then you need to partner with a vendor and use a secure environment to share second-party data to deliver AI-driven actionable insights on the business impact on all parties involved, from startup to retailer to the consumer.</li>
<li>Simulate and forecast the impact of these supply-side issues on the demand side. Conduct scenario planning exercises and inform critical business decisions. If this ability is not in place, an emergency like a pandemic, civil unrest or an uncontrollable rate hike will wreak havoc on your business plan. Use this situation as an opportunity to put a disaster management program in place to prepare for the potential risks.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/car-sharing-startup-turo-has-filed-confidentially-for-an-ipo/">Turo is taking its car rental business public:</a> </strong>Turo, a well-known U.S. startup that allows folks to rent their car to other folks, has privately filed to go public. Oh boy are we curious what its numbers show. Not only because it’s an S-1 that we’ve wanted to read for some time, but also because we’re incredibly curious about how the company navigated the pandemic and the changing world of transit during the last 18 months or so. More when it files publicly, you know, to go public.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/the-china-tech-crackdown-continues/">China’s tech crackdown continues:</a> </strong>Another weekend, another set of regulatory actions from China’s government. Tencent and the larger gaming world could be in trouble next. The turbulence was enough for NetEase, a major gaming company in China, to delay the Hong Kong listing of its music business. Recall that Tencent Music is publicly listed.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/spacex-to-acquire-satellite-connectivity-startup-swarm-technologies/">SpaceX buys Swarm Technologies:</a></strong> After seeing a friend get hooked up to Starlink the other day, what SpaceX does in the connectivity space is now more real to your humble scribe than theoretical. So the news that the space launch company is buying Swarm Technologies caught my eye. What does Swarm do? Per TechCrunch, it “operates a constellation of 120 sandwich-sized satellites as well as a ground station network.” Precisely how that may or may not link up to current SpaceX efforts is unclear.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a brace of unicorn stories and then delve into some earlier-stage startup news, yeah?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/india-upgrad-enters-unicorn-club-with-185-million-fundraise/">Indian edtech is still hot:</a></strong> Another day, another edtech unicorn. This time it’s UpGrad, a Bangalore-based startup that “specializes in higher education and upskilling courses.” It just raised $185 million at a $1.2 billion valuation. Temasek led the round. Notably, it was a two-part affair, with an earlier tranche worth $120 million first valuing UpGrad at a price of around $600 million.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/turkeys-first-decacorn-trendyol-raises-1-5b-at-a-16-5b-valuation/">Turkey’s first $10B startup:</a></strong> $1 billion isn’t cool. You know what is? $10 billion. I suppose that that means that Turkish e-commerce platform Trendyol is cool? At least General Atlantic and SoftBank Vision Fund 2 think that it is cool enough to be worth $16.5 billion. Per our reporting, the company serves around 30 million shoppers who generate around 1 million packages per day. That’s a lot of shipping.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let’s talk about some younger startups:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/rentcheck-raises-millions/"><strong>RentCheck wants you to get your dang deposit back:</strong></a><strong> </strong>And it has raised $2.6 million to power its efforts. Everyone knows what the problem space is here, so we care a bit more about how the company intends to tilt the rental market more toward renters themselves. Per TechCrunch, the company’s software “works by providing a way for property managers to facilitate and conduct remote, guided property inspections.” So long as more of us get our dang money back, cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/canopy-raises-15m-series-a/"><strong>Canopy raises $15M for loan-servicing software:</strong></a> Sure, the back end of the financial world isn’t super fun to think about, but it is <em>huge</em> and potentially lucrative. Canopy Servicing is attacking the fintech market with a focus on building software that will help companies better offer and service loans. Credit is a massive problem space, and with $15 million new dollars, it will be interesting to see how quickly this API-delivered startup can grow.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/commandbar-raises-4-8m-to-make-web-based-apps-searchable/"><strong>Meta app search, hell yeah:</strong></a> Today CommandBar left its beta period and announced that it has raised $4.8 million. The company’s tech is a search layer that sits atop web apps, making them easier to, well, search. Frankly, this kicks butt. Why? Because finding what you need inside of web apps can be an enormous hassle if you are in a hurry and not fluent in the application you are presented with. Which happens to everyone. Every day.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/lawvu-a-cloud-based-platform-for-in-house-legal-teams-raises-17m-nzd-from-insight-partners/"><strong>LawVu is building Salesforce for legal teams:</strong></a> Back to the topic of things that are important, if not entirely Super Very Cool, let’s talk about software aimed at helping legal teams. LawVu is working in the space, and just raised $17 million NZD to back its efforts. It’s building a digital space for legal teams to share documents, communicate and more.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/moove-raises-23m-to-create-flexible-options-for-drivers-to-own-cars-in-africa/"><strong>Moove wants to provide car financing to African drivers:</strong></a> After noting that African car ownership rates lagged other continents, the founders of Moove decided to tackle the issue. The startup is starting with working to provide asset-backed financing to folks who make money with their cars and just raised $23 million.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Early-stage brands should also unlock the power of influencers</h2>
<p>Before you hire a marketing consultant who doesn&#8217;t understand your products or commit to a CMO who has several years of experience — but none in your sector — consider influencer marketing.</p>
<p>If the phrase evokes images of celebrities hawking hard seltzer, think again: An influencer can be as humble as an enthusiastic Reddit user who manages your Telegram channel.</p>
<p>According to Uber growth marketing manager Jonathan Martinez:</p>
<p>“ … You don’t need to find influencers with millions of followers. Instead, lean toward microinfluencers for testing, which will bring cost efficiency and the ability to sponsor a diverse range of people.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ariana Grande strutted and soared around a candy-colored series of Fortnite sets in Epic&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/fortnite-ariana-grande-rift-tour/"> latest major in-game live music event</a>. The multi-day &#8220;tour&#8221; offered gamers and Grande fans alike plenty to enjoy while showcasing Epic&#8217;s impressively smooth and visually inventive vision for live events that millions of people can enjoy simultaneously.</p>
<p>Fortnite players have known an Ariana Grande event was in the works for a while, and the concert followed previous in-game events featuring rapper Travis Scott and Marshmello. Scott&#8217;s in-game performance saw <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/travis-scott-fortnite-record-viewers-live-1234589033/">12.3 million live viewers</a>, a number that the Ariana Grande event is likely to top, given that it ran over multiple days.</p>
<p>Epic put up a video of the concert that&#8217;s well worth checking out, if only to marvel at the kind of stuff that&#8217;s possible in gaming worlds these days. Experiencing the event live in the game is obviously ideal, but the video captures the experience pretty well, minus the sense of presence from having an avatar zooming around the space with grande Grande.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gGYElBtjytU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>This time around, the show featured a handful of mini-games that gave players more to do than just flying around while a gigantic virtual pop star does her thing. The sequence kicked off with players surfing a rainbow racetrack, hitting power ups in a cross between Mario Kart and Splatoon to &#8220;Come &amp; Go&#8221; by Juice WRLD and Marshmello. The racetrack sequence was followed by bouncing players through a Dr. Seuss-style landscape with candy-pink trees and giant floating eyeballs before dropping them into a mini-game shooting down the game&#8217;s Storm King boss to Wolfmother&#8217;s &#8220;Victorious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grande made her Fortnite debut a few songs in with the 2019 hit &#8220;7 Rings,&#8221; streaking across the sky and materializing on top of a planet suspended in a sea of stars. Later she soared through the clouds with angelic wings as players followed, suspended in rainbow bubbles. In the coolest portion, a skyscraper-high Grande ascended a series of Escher-esque staircases with a giant diamond mallet before slinging it to shatter the sky, shotput-style.</p>
<p>Fortnite&#8217;s latest event didn&#8217;t have any huge surprises, but that&#8217;s only because Epic sets the bar so high. Getting dressed up in your favorite skin to sail around a skyscraper-tall pop star along with millions of people around the world might not be everyone&#8217;s vision for the metaverse, but Fortnite&#8217;s wildly imaginative live events are a taste of the future that here&#8217;s right now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.match.com/">Match</a> today is introducing new features that aim to address some of users&#8217; complaints with modern-day dating apps &#8212; like how much time it takes to find a relevant match and how frustrating it is when users ghost one another after the initial conversation fades. As part of a new strategy to better position Match for more &#8220;emotionally mature&#8221; singles (read: adults), the company says it will begin beta testing a recommendation system called &#8220;Matched by Us,&#8221; which may pave the way for a broader matchmaking service in the future. It&#8217;s also testing an anti-ghosting feature that pushes users to either continue a conversation or unmatch the recipient instead of leaving them hanging.</p>
<p>The features are designed to address the challenges that face Match&#8217;s older demographic. Match users tend to be in their 30s and up, and have full lives. They&#8217;re generally ready to find relationships and settle down with a partner. That&#8217;s a different life phase than those using other Match dating apps, like Tinder, where younger users are still in a more exploratory phase and enjoy going on many dates, including casual dates.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we talk to our members, we hear a lot of frustration around [there being] a lot of swiping, a lot of messaging back and forth &#8212; that&#8217;s happening in the dating world more broadly,&#8221; explains Dushyant Saraph, Match’s chief product officer. &#8220;When we think about folks on our product, who don&#8217;t have a ton of time, that&#8217;s where &#8216;Matched by Us&#8217; came from. Our singles don&#8217;t want to swipe through hundreds of profiles,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187490" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187490" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2187490" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs2.png?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs2.png 432w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs2.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs2.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs2.png?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs2.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187490" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Match</p></div></p>
<p>The new feature, which is made available to free and paid users alike, will present one, free customized match every week, where both users can see each other and no longer have to wait for a &#8220;like&#8221; back in order to engage in a conversation.</p>
<p>The system works to find compatible matches by algorithmically examining a new set of preferences around users&#8217; personalities, based on responses to questions posed in users&#8217; Match bios.</p>
<p>For example, questions may ask about users&#8217; five-year plans, their favorite weekend activities, or whether they&#8217;re open to moving somewhere new if they find the right person. The latter has become especially relevant in the new age of remote work, driven by the pandemic, which no longer requires people to live in the bigger cities where their company may be headquartered, Saraph notes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2187488" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187488" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2187488" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs.png?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs.png 432w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs.png?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187488" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Match</p></div></p>
<p>Currently, the system will recommend a match based on a holistic view of users&#8217; preferences, as determined by an algorithm, but the company has been internally testing adding a layer of human curation to its suggestions, as well.</p>
<p>In other words, Match is testing an actual match-making service.</p>
<p>For the time being, however, the human curation team inside Match is working in more of an R&amp;D capacity, Saraph says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been flexing how many experts we need as we&#8217;re testing kind of different concepts &#8212; everything from coaching to expert picks, where we&#8217;re doing human curation,&#8221; he says. The team also works on other features, like suggesting conversation starters to keep conversations going.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HM3wOzfLdU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/running-a-queer-dating-startup-amid-a-pandemic-and-racial-justice-uprising/">Running a queer dating startup amid a pandemic and racial justice uprising</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Running a queer dating startup amid a pandemic and racial justice uprising&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/running-a-queer-dating-startup-amid-a-pandemic-and-racial-justice-uprising/embed/#?secret=HM3wOzfLdU" data-secret="HM3wOzfLdU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Long-term we expect to be flexible, depending on which of these [products] is most interesting to our members, and scaling up our expert team accordingly. Right now, human curation is one area that we&#8217;re really excited about and want to crack, and I think you&#8217;ll hear more about that in the coming months,&#8221; Saraph adds.</p>
<p>Another new feature aimed at helping adults to stop waste their time on dating apps involves how Match will handle matches&#8217; conversations. Typically, conversations either take off leading to real-world dates, or slowly fade away, until communication stops altogether. Sometimes, the other party simply &#8220;ghosts,&#8221; and never responds at all.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187491" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187491" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2187491" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Prompts.png?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Prompts.png 432w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Prompts.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Prompts.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Prompts.png?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Prompts.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187491" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Match</p></div></p>
<p>Users told Match that their main issue with ghosting is the uncertainty around what it means.</p>
<p>Did the person they matched with just get busy, or did they decide they weren&#8217;t interested?, users wonder.</p>
<p>A new feature aims to keep conversations&#8217; momentum going by nudging users when a conversation is about to &#8220;expire&#8221; &#8212; that is, when it will be archived into a new section of the inbox for inactive conversations.</p>
<p>And if you are in the app, you can visit the conversation to get suggestions of conversation starters to help you pick things back up, or you can tap a button to unmatch the other user. The latter would send a more explicit signal to the recipient that there was a lack of interest, though it won&#8217;t actually push a notification that tells the user they&#8217;ve been unmatched. (That can sometimes lead to safety issues, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-20/rejection-violence-in-dating-apps/13253626">particularly for women</a> who have received threats from men they&#8217;ve rejected.)</p>

<p>Match says it&#8217;s currently testing the right number of days to elapse before it nudges users to either re-engage or end their conversations with an unmatch. But the right amount of time seems to be in the three to five-day range, Saraph says.</p>
<p>The new features are rolling out to some portion of Match&#8217;s U.S. user base in beta, as the company kicks off a new brand campaign targeting adult daters. The campaign&#8217;s message is that Match understands what modern adult singles are looking for in order to date better, and these features are an example of that understanding being put into practice.</p>
<p>The beta tests are rolling out across all Match platforms, including iOS, Android, mobile web and desktop over the next few months, starting in the U.S.</p>
<p>The news follows a mixed earnings report from the dating app giant, Match Group, which owns top brands including Match, Tinder, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Hinge and others. The company saw the impact of a pandemic recovery in the second quarter, with 15 million paying customers across its brands, up from 13 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenue was $707.8 million, topping analyst projections of $694 million. But Match Group <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/match-sales-grow-faster-than-expected-as-u-s-dating-scene-recovers-but-earnings-miss-hits-stock-11628021471">missed on earnings</a>, with net income of $140.9 million, or 46 cents a share, when analysts expected 49 cents per share.</p>

<p>The company also spoke in detail about its plans for social networking app maker Hyperconnect, a company Match bought for $1.73 billion earlier this year. Match Group said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/match-group-to-add-live-audio-and-video-to-its-dating-app-portfolio-starting-in-2021/">plans to add audio and video chat, including live video,</a> to its dating brand portfolio.</p>
<p>Match&#8217;s dating app is among those that will benefit from Hyperconnect integrations, Saraph told TechCrunch, as Match plans to explore &#8220;building out live experiences.&#8221; The company expects these to be added around year end toward the beginning of 2022, we&#8217;re told.</p>
