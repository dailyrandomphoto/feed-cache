										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PayPal <a href="https://happyreturns.com/blog/paypal-and-happy-returns">announced</a> today it&#8217;s acquiring <a href="https://happyreturns.com/">Happy Returns</a>, a returns solution provider that offers online shoppers access to easier ways to send back unwanted merchandise to retailers without having to box it up and ship it themselves. The company today offers a network off over 2,600 drop-off returns locations in the U.S., including those in over 1,200 metros and in every U.S. state.</p>
<p>It also has relationships with hundreds of brands who have been using its returns software and reverse logistics services. The company says it will continue to offer its returns experience to online retailers and shoppers as a part of PayPal.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, Santa Monica-based Happy Returns&#8217; value proposition was to take some of the overhead and cost out of the returns process for online retailers. Because online shoppers can&#8217;t inspect items they buy directly, online retail tends to see higher return rates, especially in apparel. Happy Returns found that online items are 3 to 4 times as likely to be returned than those purchased in store, for example.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, today&#8217;s retailers have to compete with giants like Amazon and Walmart, both which enable returns more easily for their customers by way of their large brick-and-mortar footprints &#8212; Amazon with Whole Foods other locations, and Walmart with its own stores. In fact, the foot traffic that offering an Amazon returns desk or locker system in-store has led retailers like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/you-can-now-take-your-amazon-returns-to-all-kohls-stores/">Kohl&#8217;s</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/21/stein-mart-embraces-the-enemy-with-installation-of-amazon-lockers-in-nearly-200-stores/"> Stein Mart</a> to embrace the enemy by catering to shoppers with Amazon returns in their own stores.</p>
<p>Today, the Happy Returns solution offers a combination of software, services and logistics that allows retailers to manage their returns through their own retail stores, by carrier, as well as through Happy Returns&#8217; &#8220;Return Bar&#8221; locations. These are found in physical retail stores like Paper Source, Sur La Table, Cost Plus World Market, and others. The service has been used by several digitally native brands, including Everlane, Rothy&#8217;s, and Parachute Home, among others.</p>
<p>Happy Returns has also been closely working with PayPal throughout its history, it notes. And notably,<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190425005248/en/Happy-Returns-Announces-Strategic-Investment-from-PayPal-to-Accelerate-Sales-and-Product-Development"> PayPal made a strategic investment in the business in 2019,</a> as part of an $11 million financing round.</p>
<p>Following the deal&#8217;s close, Happy Returns will continue to work with retailers and shoppers both on and off PayPal&#8217;s platform, it says. The company&#8217;s co-founders, David Sobie and Mark Geller, and its full 120+ team will join PayPal, and will report to Frank Keller, VP Consumer In-Store and Digital Commerce at PayPal.</p>
<p>PayPal is not disclosing the deal terms. To date, Happy Returns had raised $25 million in funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an incredibly exciting milestone for our company, and it would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our entire team,&#8221; an <a href="https://happyreturns.com/blog/paypal-and-happy-returns">announcement</a> on Happy Returns&#8217; website reads. &#8220;We are so proud of what our team has accomplished and are grateful for the tenacity, creativity and empathy Happy Returns employees bring to work each day. We are confident that the best is yet to come, and are looking forward to our next chapter as part of the PayPal organization.&#8221;</p>

		Krish Subramanian is co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.chargebee.com/">Chargebee</a>, a global leader in subscription billing and revenue management. He began his career as a software engineer at a startup before going on to specialize in indirect purchasing implementations for Fortune 500 customers.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Although recurring revenue businesses have been around for a long time, the trend toward a subscription economy has escalated rapidly in the last few years. IDC <a href="https://www.digitalistmag.com/cio-knowledge/2019/02/25/why-platforms-are-critical-when-building-for-intelligent-enterprise-06196545/">expects</a> that by 2022, 53% of all software revenue will be purchased with a subscription model. Even the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/subscriptions/2018/car-subscription-market-software-meal-kits-payment-methods/">car subscription market</a> is set to grow by 71% by 2022.</p>
<p>Many types of businesses are looking for ways to earn recurring revenue — and it has gone beyond business-to-consumer companies like Netflix and Dollar Shave Club. Business-to-business companies are also joining in, even those with products that last a long time. For instance, elevator-maker Otis offers<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/otis-launches-otis-one-iot-service-solution-for-the-worlds-largest-elevator-service-network-300643104.html"> Otis ONE</a>, a subscription-connected elevator solution that offers predictive maintenance insights.</p>

			Subscription billing options should make it easy to manage all types of subscriptions, including integrating analytics to provide a more complete picture of the subscriptions landscape.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Promising, but there are pitfalls</h2>
<p>Subscription business models are attractive, but there are two major pitfalls. At the top of the list is payment. Regardless of company size, there’s an ongoing need to convince customers to sign up long term.</p>
<p>Companies also need to accommodate new payment methods and ensure ongoing compliance with interstate and international tax laws. As a result, the payment process can quickly become painful.</p>
<p>As any company with recurring revenue scales, it becomes increasingly challenging to manage subscriptions, especially with homegrown systems, changing subscription offers and the complexities of converting customers from free trials to paid subscriptions. Subscription billing options should make it easy to manage all types of subscriptions, including integrating analytics to provide a more complete picture of the subscriptions landscape.</p>
<p>Businesses also have to keep in mind that every time they add more product categories or expand into new geographies, they need to tack on extra software code to change their operations and stay sales-tax-compliant. As they expand globally, this can become an obstacle to rapid growth and flexibility.</p>
<p>To keep the company focused and maintain growth without having to expend resources, subscription businesses need a specialized billing system so they can focus on customer acquisition and revenue growth rather than staying on top of billing complexity.</p>
<h2>The CAC payback gap constrains growth</h2>
<p>The second issue: How do businesses cover the funding gap between when customers sign up and when they pay? In the subscription economy, companies that would previously receive a customer&#8217;s payments all at once now earn revenue spread across a monthly or quarterly subscription fee.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the autonomous vehicle industry in the United States marches toward <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/02/after-2019s-reality-check-whats-ahead-for-driverless-cars-in-2020/">consolidation</a>, a funding spree continues to exhilarate China&#8217;s robotaxi industry. Momenta, Pony.ai, WeRide and Didi&#8217;s autonomous vehicle arm have all raised hundreds of millions of dollars over the past year. And 21-year-old search engine giant Baidu competes alongside the startups with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/21/baidu-announces-1-5b-fund-to-back-self-driving-car-startups/">$1.5 billion fund</a> launched in 2017 to help cars go driverless.</p>
<p>Their strategies are similar in some regards and diverge elsewhere. The biggest players have deployed small fleets of robotaxis, manned with safety drivers, onto certain urban roads and are diligently testing driverless vehicles inside pilot zones. Some companies embrace lidar to detect the cars&#8217; surroundings, while others agree with Elon Musk on a vision-only future.</p>
<p>The industry is still years from being truly driverless and operational at scale, so some contestants are seeking easier cases to tackle and monetize first, putting self-driving software inside buses, trucks and tractors that roam inside industrial parks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As consumer behavior and expectations around privacy have shifted &#8212; and operating systems and browsers have adapted to this &#8212; the age of cookies as a means of tracking user behavior is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">coming to an end</a>. Few people will bemoan this, but advertisers and marketers rely on having insights into how their efforts translate into sales (and publishers like to know how their content performs, as well). Google is obviously aware of this, and it is now looking to machine learning to ready its tools like Google Analytics for this post-cookie future.</p>

<p>Last year, the company brought several machine learning tools to Google Analytics. At the time, the focus was on alerting users to significant changes in their campaign performance, for example. Now, it is taking this a step further by using its machine learning systems to model user behavior when cookies are not available.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to underestimate the importance of this shift, but according to Vidhya Srinivasan, Google&#8217;s VP and GM for Ads Buying, <span class="il">Analytics</span> and Measurement who joined the company after a long stint at Amazon two years ago (and IBM before that), it&#8217;s also the only way to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;The principles we outlined to drive our measurement roadmap are based on shifting consumer expectations and ecosystem paradigms. Bottom line: The future is consented. It’s modeled. It’s first-party. So that’s what we’re using as our guide for the next gen of our products and solutions,&#8221; she said in her first media interview after joining Google.<i><br />
</i></p>
<p>It&#8217;s still early days and a lot of users may yet consent and opt in to tracking and sharing their data in some form or another. But the <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">early indications</a> are that this will be a minority of users. Unsurprisingly, first-party data and the data Google can gather from users who consent becomes increasingly valuable in this context.</p>

<p>Because of this, Google is now also making it easier to work with this so-called &#8220;consented data&#8221; and create better first-party data through improved integrations with tools like the Google Tag Manager.</p>
<p>Last year, Google launched <a href="https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/360/measure-conversions-while-respecting-user-consent-choices/">Consent Mode</a>, which helps advertisers manage cookie behavior based on local data-protection laws and user preferences. For advertisers in the EU and in the U.K., Consent Mode allows them to adjust their Google tags based on a user&#8217;s choices and soon, Google will launch a direct integration with Tag Manager to make it easier to modify and customize these tags.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s maybe more important, though, is that Consent Mode will now use <a href="https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/360/conversion-modeling-through-consent-mode-google-ads/">conversion modeling</a> for users who don&#8217;t consent to cookies. Google says this can recover about 70% of ad-click-to-conversion journeys that would otherwise be lost to advertisers.</p>
<p>In addition, Google is also making it easier for bring in first-party data (in a privacy-forward way) to Google Analytics to improve measurements and its models.</p>
<p>&#8220;Revamping a popular product with a long history is something people are going to have opinions about &#8212; we know that. But we felt strongly that we needed <span class="il">Google</span> <span class="il">Analytics</span> to be relevant to changing consumer behavior and ready for a cookie-less world &#8212; so that’s what we’re building,&#8221; Srinivasan said. &#8220;The machine learning that <span class="il">Google</span> has invested in for years &#8212; that experience is what we’re putting in action to drive the modeling underlying this tech. We take having credible insights and reporting in the market seriously. We know that doing the work on measurement is critical to market trust. We don’t take the progress we’ve made for granted and we’re looking to continue iterating to ensure scale, but above all we’re prioritizing user trust.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">They say for every door that opens another closes, and the executive shuffle at VMware is certainly proving that old chestnut true. Four months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/pat-gelsinger-stepping-down-as-vmware-ceo-to-replace-bob-swan-at-intel/">Pat Gelsinger stepped down as CEO</a> to return to run Intel, the virtual machine pioneer announced yesterday that long-time exec <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/ahead-of-dells-spin-out-vmware-appoints-longtime-exec-raghu-raghuram-as-its-new-ceo/">Raghu Raghuram was taking over</a> that role.</p>
<p>That set in motion another change when COO Sanjay Poonen, whom some had speculated might get the CEO job, announced yesterday afternoon on Twitter that<a href="https://twitter.com/spoonen/status/1392467802724868102?s=20"> he was leaving the company</a> after seven years.</p>
<p>Coincidence? We think not.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says that he was surprised that Poonen didn&#8217;t get the job, but perhaps the VMware board valued Raghuram&#8217;s product focus more highly. &#8220;At 50, he [would have been] a long-term solution, and he did a great job on the End User Computing (EUC) side of the product before becoming COO. I guess that it is still not VMware&#8217;s core business,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Regardless, Mueller still liked the choice of Raghuram as CEO, saying that he brought stability and reliability to the position, but he sees him likely as a solid interim solution for several years as the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/">spins out from Dell</a> and becomes a fully independent organization again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously the board wanted to have someone who knows product, and has been there a long time, and is associated with the VMware core success &#8212; so that creates relatability [and stability].&#8221; He added, &#8220;At 57 he is the transitional candidate, and a good choice, a veteran who is happy to run this two-three or maybe five years and won&#8217;t go anywhere [in the interim]. And the board has time to find a long-term solution,&#8221; Mueller told me.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ahead of Dell&#8217;s spin out, VMware appoints longtime exec Raghu Raghuram as its new CEO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/ahead-of-dells-spin-out-vmware-appoints-longtime-exec-raghu-raghuram-as-its-new-ceo/embed/#?secret=pbfoUEiHq6" data-secret="pbfoUEiHq6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mark Lockwood, lead analyst on VMware at Gartner, sees Raghuram as the right man for the job, with no reservations, one who will continue to implement the current strategy while putting his own stamp on the position.</p>
<p>&#8220;That the VMware board chose someone in Raghu Raghuram who has been <em>the</em> technical strategy executive inside the company for years speaks volumes about the board’s comfort level with the existing strategy trajectory of the company. Mr. Raghuram will most certainly steer the company slightly differently than Mr. Gelsinger did, but at least from the outside, the CEO appointment appears to be a stamp of approval on the company’s broad portfolio,&#8221; Lockwood said.</p>
<p>As for Poonen, he says that the writing was on the wall when he didn&#8217;t get the promotion. &#8220;Although Sanjay Poonen has indeed been a valuable executive for VMware, it was always unlikely that he would remain if not chosen for the CEO role,&#8221; Lockwood said.</p>
<p>Stephen Elliot, an analyst at IDC, was also bullish on the Raghuram appointment, saying he brings a broad understanding of the company, and that&#8217;s important to VMware right now. &#8220;He understands VMware customers, the technologies, M&amp;A, and the importance of execution and its impact on profitable growth. He has been central to almost every successful strategy the company has created, and been a leader for product strategy and execution. He has a very good balance of making tactical and strategic moves to anticipate the value VMware can deliver for customers in a one-three year horizon,&#8221; Elliot said.</p>
<p>Elliot thinks Poonen will be just fine and will find a landing spot pretty quickly. &#8220;He is another very talented executive; he will become a CEO elsewhere, and another company will be very lucky,&#8221; he said. He says that it will take time to see if there is any impact from that, but he believes that VMware shouldn&#8217;t have trouble attracting other executive talent to fill in any gaps.</p>
<p>For every executive move, there are choices for replacements, and subsequent fallout from those choices. We saw a full-fledged example of that yesterday on display at VMware. If these industry experts are right, the company chose stability and reliability and a deep understanding of product. That would seem to be solid enough reasoning on the part of the board, even though Poonen leaving seems to be collateral damage from the decision, and a big loss for the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Cloud Run</a>, Google Cloud&#8217;s serverless platform for containerized applications, is getting committed use discounts. Users who commit to spending a given amount on using Cloud Run for a year will get a 17% discount on the money they commit. The company offers a similar pre-commitment discount scheme for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/signing-up-committed-use-discounts">VM-based Compute Engine instances</a>, as well as automatic &#8220;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/sustained-use-discounts">sustained use</a>&#8221; discounts for machines that run for more than 25% of a month.</p>
<p>In addition, Google Cloud is introducing a number of new security features for Cloud Run, including the ability to mount secrets from the Google Cloud Secret Manager and binary authorization to help define and enforce policies about how containers are deployed on the service. Cloud Run users can also now use and manage their own encryption keys (by default, Cloud Run uses Google-managed keys) and a new Recommendation Hub inside of Cloud Run will now offer users recommendations for how to better protect their Cloud Run services.</p>
<p>Aparna Sinha, who recently became the director of product management for Google Cloud&#8217;s serverless platform, noted that these updates are part of Google Cloud&#8217;s push to build what she calls the &#8220;next generation of serverless.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really excited to introduce our new vision for serverless, which I think is going to help redefine this space,&#8221; she told me. &#8220;In the past, serverless has meant a certain narrower type of compute, which is focused on functions or a very specific kind of applications, web services, etc. &#8212; and what we are talking about with redefining serverless is focusing on the power of serverless, which is the developer experience and the ease of use, but broadening it into a much more versatile platform, where many different types of applications can be run, and building in the Google way of doing DevOps and security and a lot of integrations so that you have access to everything that&#8217;s the best of cloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>She noted that Cloud Run saw &#8220;tremendous adoption&#8221; during the pandemic, something she attributes to the fact that businesses were looking to speed up time-to-value from their applications. Ikea, for example, which <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90547486/ikeas-e-commerce-was-already-pretty-bad-during-covid-19-it-absolutely-fell-apart">famously</a> had a hard time moving from in-store to online sales, bet on Google Cloud&#8217;s serverless platform to bring down the refresh time of its online store and inventory management system from three hours to less than three minutes after switching to this model.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s kind of the power of serverless, I think, especially looking forward, the ability to build real-time applications that have data about the context, about the inventory, about the customer and can therefore be much more reactive and responsive,&#8221; Sinha said. &#8220;This is an expectation that customers will have going forward and serverless is an excellent way to deliver that as well as be responsive to demand patterns, especially when they&#8217;re changing so much in today&#8217;s uncertain environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the container model gives businesses a lot of flexibility in what they want to run in these containers &#8212; and how they want to develop these applications since Cloud Run is language-agnostic &#8212; Google is now seeing a lot of other enterprises move to this platform as well, both for deploying completely new applications but also to modernize some of their existing services.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;9 investors discuss hurdles, opportunities and the impact of cloud vendors in enterprise data lakes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/13/9-investors-discuss-challenges-opportunities-and-the-impact-of-cloud-vendors-in-enterprise-data-lakes/embed/#?secret=Hawu5yDNcK" data-secret="Hawu5yDNcK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For the companies that have predictable usage patterns, the committed use discounts should be an attractive option and it&#8217;s likely the more sophisticated organizations that are asking for the kinds of new security features that Google Cloud is introducing today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next generation of serverless combines the best of serverless with containers to run a broad spectrum of apps, with no language, networking or regional restrictions,&#8221; Sinha writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;The next generation of serverless will help developers build the modern applications of tomorrow—applications that adapt easily to change, scale as needed, respond to the needs of their customers faster and more efficiently, all while giving developers the best developer experience.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year and a half’s worth of global pandemic has had a profound impact on virtually every sector of the workforce. When it comes to future automation, food prep isn’t quite at the top of the list (that distinction likely goes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/robotics-roundup-11/">warehouse fulfillment</a>, for the time being), but it’s certainly up there. And it’s easy to see why the events of 2020 and beyond have left many kitchens looking for alternative sources of labor.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based Chef Robotics today announced that it has raised a combined $7.7 million pre-seed and seed round, with the goal of helping automate certain aspects of food preparation. The list of investors is pretty long on this one (with seed and pre-seed rolled up into one), including Kleiner Perkins, Promus Ventures, Construct, Bloomberg Beta, BOLD Capital Partners, Red and Blue Ventures, Gaingels, Schox VC, Stewart Alsop and Tau Ventures, among others.</p>

<p>The product team includes ex-employees of Cruise, Google, Verb Surgical, Zoox and Strateos. Chef’s team isn’t quite ready to show off its robot just yet (hence generic kitchen stock photo #8952 up top) &#8212; not entirely unusual for a robotics company still in the early stages. What it <em>has</em> outlined, thus far, is a robotics and vision system destined to increase production volume and enhance consistency, while removing some food waste from the process. Fast casual restaurants appear to be a key focus for this sort of tech.</p>
<p>The company describes it thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chef is designed to mimic the flexibility of humans, allowing customers to handle thousands of different kinds of food using minimal hardware changes. Chef does this using artificial intelligence that can learn how to handle more and more ingredients over time and that also improves. This allows customers to do things like change their menu often. Additionally, Chef’s modular architecture allows customers to quickly scale up just as they would by hiring more staff (but unlike humans, Chef always shows up on time and doesn’t need breaks).</p></blockquote>
<p>More details on the underlying tech soon, no doubt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://legionfarm.com/">Legionfarm</a>, the gaming platform that lets gamers play with pro players in their favorite games, has today announced the close of a $6 million Series A round. Investors in the round include SVB, Y Combinator, Scrum VC, Kevin Lin, Altair Capital, Ankur Nagpal and more.</p>
<p>Legionfarm launched out of Y Combinator at the beginning of last year with a mission to give pro players a way to generate income and amateur players the chance to get better by playing with a pro coach. It started out with an à la carte business model but has since added a subscription product.</p>
<p>It either costs $12/hour to play on an individual session basis (one hour of play) or you can pay $25 or $50/month. That gives gamers access to discounted prices for pros and unlimited sessions with pros who are brand new to the platform, which Legionfarm calls &#8220;rookies.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was founded by Alex Beliankin, who is a former pro gamer and was once in the top .01% of World of Warcraft players. There are many, many pro caliber players out in the world who can&#8217;t necessarily make a living off of gaming. They either have to be signed by an org (super limited supply) or play in as many tournaments as possible (unreliable) or stream on Twitch.</p>
<p>Legionfarm gives these pros the opportunity to earn a living playing the games they love.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YC-backed Legionfarm lets competitive gamers pay to play with pro coaches&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/yc-backed-legionfarm-lets-competitive-gamers-pay-to-play-with-pro-coaches/embed/#?secret=H20oOTqXNz" data-secret="H20oOTqXNz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, gamers are always looking to get better but don&#8217;t often have the environments in a game to do so, particularly in Battle Royale games. Legionfarm, which supports a couple of the biggest BRs (Call of Duty: Warzone and Apex Legends), allows these players to team up with pros and learn from them.</p>
<p>The startup is also running a hardware support program, which lets pros on the platform effectively rent gear by paying for it over time in installments that come directly out of their earnings each month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recently, we&#8217;ve learned that one pro player can acquire seven or more new customers to the platform if we work with the pro properly,&#8221; said Beliankin. &#8220;That&#8217;s the biggest growth point for us and the biggest challenge. We don&#8217;t need to demand in the performance channels, but through existing supply. If we manage to build some sustainable processes here, I think we&#8217;re going to skyrocket because we see some huge potential here.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An activist short seller has written a letter to the chief executive of insurance giant Lemonade with details of an &#8220;accidentally discovered&#8221; security flaw that exposes customers&#8217; account data.</p>
<p>Carson Block, founder of investment research firm Muddy Waters Research, sent the letter to Lemonade co-founder and chief executive Daniel Schreiber on Thursday, describing the bug that allowed anyone to inadvertently access personally identifiable data from customers’ accounts as “unforgivably negligent.”</p>
<p>Block&#8217;s <a href="https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/lmnd/open-letter/">letter</a> said: &#8220;By clicking on search results from public search engines, we shockingly found ourselves logged in to and able to edit Lemonade customers&#8217; accounts without having to provide any user credentials whatsoever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lemonade launched in 2015 and offers renters&#8217;, homeowners&#8217; and pet insurance policies across the U.S. and Europe. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/08/softbank-backed-lemonade-files-to-go-public/">went public last year</a> and saw its shares rocket by more than 130% on the day of its initial public offering. Lemonade <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/lemonade-stock-is-falling-after-earnings-februarys-freeze-in-texas-didnt-help-51620827012">this week</a> reported a $49 million quarterly loss, deeper than what Wall Street was expecting.</p>
<p>The bug was co-discovered by Muddy Waters Research and Wolfpack Research, Block said. In <a href="https://twitter.com/Reed_Wolfpack/status/1392829803246587908">a tweet</a>, Wolfpack lead analyst Reed Sherman said one of Muddy Waters&#8217; security experts &#8220;was able to send me a PDF of my renter&#8217;s insurance policy less than 15 minutes after this was first discovered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Block told TechCrunch that his firm is shorting the company&#8217;s stock, per his letter, &#8220;because it is clear Lemonade does not give a fuck about securing its customers&#8217; sensitive personal information.&#8221; Block said in his letter that Lemonade should &#8220;shut down its website, APIs, and mobile application&#8221; until the issue is fixed, which he says may date back to July 2020.</p>
<p>Block published his letter to Lemonade with redactions as to not give away specific details of the bug. In a call, Block provided more details about the bug to TechCrunch in order to verify the vulnerability. One indexed search result let us log into a person&#8217;s Lemonade account and view their name, address, and quote details without ever asking for the user&#8217;s password.</p>
<p>In a tweet, Lemonade&#8217;s president Shai Wininger <a href="https://twitter.com/shai_wininger/status/1392892957787885573?s=20">said</a> the bug is &#8220;not a vulnerability, it&#8217;s by design.&#8221; Yael Wissner-Levy, a spokesperson for Lemonade, also said that this was by design. A short time after the letter was made public, some of the indexed results stopped working.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK-based startup <a href="https://www.sylvera.com">Sylvera</a> is using satellite, radar and lidar data-fuelled machine learning to bolster transparency around carbon offsetting projects in a bid to boost accountability and credibility &#8212; applying independent ratings to carbon offsetting projects.</p>
<p>The ratings are based on proprietary data sets it&#8217;s developed in conjunction with scientists from research organisations including UCLA, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and University College London.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just grabbed $5.8M in seed funding led by VC firm Index Ventures. All its existing institutional investors also participated &#8212; namely: Seedcamp, Speedinvest and Revent. It also has backing from leading angels, including the existing and former CEOs of NYSE, Thomson Reuters, Citibank and IHS Markit. (It confirms it has committed not to receive any investment from traditional carbon-intensive companies when as ask.) And it&#8217;s just snagged a $2M research contract from Innovate UK.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problem it&#8217;s targeting is that the carbon offsetting market suffers from a lack of transparency.</p>
<p>This fuels concerns that many offsetting projects aren&#8217;t living up to their claims of a net reduction in carbon emissions &#8212; and that &#8216;creative&#8217; carbon accountancy is rather being used to generate a lot of hot air: In the form of positive sounding PR which sums to meaningless greenwashing and more pollution as polluters get to keep on pumping out climate changing emissions.</p>
<p>Nonetheless the carbon offset markets are poised for huge growth &#8212; of at least 15x by 2030 &#8212; as large corporates accelerate their net zero commitments. And Sylvera&#8217;s bet is that that will drive demand for reliable, independent data &#8212; to stand up the claimed impact.</p>
<p>How exactly is Sylvera benchmarking carbon offsets? Co-founder Sam Gill says its technology platform draws on multiple layers of satellite data to capture project performance data at scale and at a high frequency.</p>
<p>It applies machine learning to analyze and visualize the data, while also conducting what it bills as &#8220;deep analytical work to assess the underlying project quality&#8221;. Via that process it creates a standardised rating for a project, so that market participants are able to transact according to their preferences.</p>
<p>It makes its ratings and analysis data available to its customers via a web application and an API (for which it charges a subscription).</p>
<p>&#8220;We assess two critical areas of a project &#8212; its carbon performance, and its &#8216;quality&#8217;,&#8221; Gill tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We score a project against these criteria, and give them ratings &#8212; much like a Moody’s rating on a bond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carbon performance is assessed by gathering &#8220;multi-layered data&#8221; from multiple sources to understand what is going on on the ground of these projects &#8212; such as via multiple satellite sources such as multispectral image, Radar, and Lidar data.</p>
<p>&#8220;We collate this data over time, ingest it into our proprietary machine learning algorithms, and analyse how the project has performed against its stated aims,&#8221; Gill explains.</p>
<p>Quality is assessed by considering the technical aspects of the project. This includes what Gill calls &#8220;additionality&#8221;; aka &#8220;does the project have a strong claim to delivering a better outcome than would have occurred but for the existence of the offset revenue?&#8221;.</p>
<p>There is a known problem with some carbon offsets claimed against forests where the landowner had no intention of logging, for example. So if there wasn&#8217;t going to be any deforestation the carbon credit is essentially bogus.</p>
<p>He also says it looks at factors like permanence (&#8220;how long will the project’s impacts last?&#8221;); co-benefits (&#8220;how well has the project incorporated the UN’s Sustainability Development Goals?); and risks (&#8220;how well is the project mitigating risks, in particular those from humans and those from natural causes?&#8221;).</p>
<p>Clearly it&#8217;s not an exact science &#8212; and Gill acknowledges risks, for example, are often interlinked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is critical to assess these performance and quality in tandem,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;It’s not enough to simply say a project is achieving the carbon goals set out in its plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the additionality of a project is low (e.g. it was actually unlikely the project would have been deforested without the project) then the achievement of the carbon goals set out in the project does not generate the anticipated carbon goals, and the underlying offsets are therefore weaker than appreciated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the seed funding in a statement, Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas, partner at Index Ventures, said: “This is a phenomenally strong team with the vision to build the first carbon offset rating benchmark, providing comprehensive insights around the quality of offsets, enabling purchase decisions as well as post-purchase monitoring and reporting. Sylvera is  putting in place the building blocks that will be required to address climate change.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the pandemic finish line in sight &#8212; at least for some &#8212; now is a good time to start assessing which segments have been most impacted by the events of the past year and a half. In terms of robotics, investments have been all over the place &#8212; and for good reasons. COVID-19 seems destined to have a profound and lasting impact on work, and more than ever, robots and automation are going to play a part in that.</p>
<p>Food has been a big target. Manufacturing and health, as well &#8212; all for pretty clear reasons. When we come out of this, however, we may end up seeing that the most immediate and profound impact was on warehouse and fulfillment. Not that it needed much help, but online retail had a huge moment &#8212; led, naturally, by Amazon.</p>
<p>As the company butted heads with workers and union organizers at one fulfillment center in Alabama, the company has been readying additional fulfillment centers. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gov-edwards-announces-new-amazon-robotics-facility-in-shreveport-301286880.html">Shreveport, Louisiana is the latest</a>, with Governor John Bel Edwards referring to the new warehouse as a “robotics fulfillment center.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As with all of these, that means a combination of humans and robots. There are, of course, questions with regard to what the balance will be, going forward. And, of course, it’s no surprise that pro-union Amazon workers frequently cited being treated like a robot among their biggest workplace concerns.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="h9lIRb7Ryx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/robotics-startup-lets-machines-get-closer-as-humans-keep-their-distance/">Robotics startup lets machines get closer as humans keep their distance</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Robotics startup lets machines get closer as humans keep their distance&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/robotics-startup-lets-machines-get-closer-as-humans-keep-their-distance/embed/#?secret=h9lIRb7Ryx" data-secret="h9lIRb7Ryx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Attempting to stay afloat in the world of Amazon is a big part of why so many warehouses are particularly interested in robotics at the moment. After all, the tech has not only given the retailer a competitive advantage, it’s helped keep them running amid a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Berkshire Grey has been one of the bigger players in the category, thanks in no small part to some massive raises. To date, the Boston-area company has raised $263 million, before announcing a SPAC last year. <a href="https://www.berkshiregrey.com/resources/press-release/berkshire-grey-accelerates-company-momentum-in-2021/">Today, it announced</a> that it’s using some of that money to further expand into markets including Canada and Japan.</p>

<p>“2020 was a pivotal time for eCommerce companies, retailers, grocers and package handling logistics providers – and it continues into this year. The need to automate to meet consumer needs was already pronounced and the pandemic accelerated the changes and increased the need,” founder and CEO Tom Wagner said in a release. “Many of these changes in consumer behaviors are here to stay and that means, businesses need to adapt and improve operations with robotic automation to fulfill those needs. We’re honored to work with companies who have enlisted our AI-enabled robotic solutions to help meet business goals and consumer expectations.”</p>
<p>The already-hot China market continues to gain momentum, as well. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/youibot-funding/">Youibot this week</a> announced a $15 million raise, led by Softbank Ventures. The Shenzhen company is a HAX grad that produces manufacturing robots.</p>

<p>Here’s Rita on the company:</p>
<blockquote><p>Founded by a group of PhDs from China’s prestigious Xi’an Jiaotong University, Youibot develops solutions for factory automation and logistics management, as well as inspection and maintenance for various industries. For example, its robots can navigate around a yard of buses, inspect every tire of the vehicles and provide a detailed report for maintenance, a feature that helped it rack up Michelin’s contract.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Repairability has been a big sticking point for consumer electronics over the past several years. As devices have gotten thinner &#8212; and companies have pushed to maintain control over proprietary systems &#8212; many devices have become near impossible for an every-day person to repair.</p>
<p>It’s an issue for a number of reasons &#8212; not the least of which is an inability to upgrade a system instead of scrapping it altogether. In a world where human impact on the environment is increasingly top of mind, forced obsolescence is an understandably important issue for many.</p>
<p>Framework is one of an increasing number of companies working to address these issues. It’s a list that also includes products like Fairphone on the mobile side. It’s a niche versus the overall market, to be sure, but it’s one that could well be growing. Announced in January, the Framework Laptop <a href="https://frame.work/">is up for preorder today</a>. The 13.5-inch notebook starts at $999 and will start shipping at the end of July.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/7hMV1Jq8Vt4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The SF-based company had initially targeted spring shipping, but ongoing chip supply problems have delayed the product. The system actually doesn’t look half-bad for a product and company that are clearly repair/upgrade-first.</p>
<p>There are three basic configurations &#8212; Base, Performance and Professional, ranging from $999 to $1,999, upgrading from an Intel Core i5, 8GB of Ram and 256GB of storage to a Core i7 and 32GB/1TB. Windows also gets upgraded from Home to Pro at the top level. At $749, the company offers a barebones shell, where users can plug in their own internals.</p>

<p>Other upgrades include:</p>
<blockquote><p>On top of that, the Framework Laptop is deeply customizable in unique ways. Our Expansion Card system lets you choose the ports you want and which side you want them on, selecting from four at a time of USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, MicroSD, ultra-fast 250GB and 1TB storage, and more. Magnetic-attach bezels are color-customizable to match your style, and the keyboard language can be swapped too.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risk defense startup <a href="https://www.spec-trust.com/">SpecTrust</a> is emerging from stealth today with a $4.3 million seed raise and a public launch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyber Mentor Fund led the round, which also included participation from Rally Ventures, SignalFire, Dreamit Ventures and Legion Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpecTrust aims to “fix the economics of fighting fraud” with a no-code platform that it says cuts 90% of a business’ risk infrastructure spend that responds to threats in “minutes instead of months.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">January of 2020, I got a bug in my ear to, instead of an API, build a cloud-based service that handles all this complex orchestration and unifies all this data,” said CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nate Kharrl, who co-founded the company with Bryce Verdier and </span>Patrick Chen<span style="font-weight: 400;">. “And, it worked. And it worked fast enough that you can’t even tell it’s there doing its work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, he says, SpecTrust even in its early days was able to pull identity behavior information in seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, it’s more like five and seven milliseconds,” he said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, engineers don’t have to lift anything or adjust data models.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the San Jose, California-based startup’s offering is deployed on the internet, between a website or app and its users, an organization gets fraud protection without draining the resources of its engineers, the company says. Founded by a team that ran risk management divisions at eBay and ThreatMetrix, SpecTrust is banking on the fact that companies &#8212; especially financial institutions &#8212; will be drawn to the flexibility afforded by a no-code offering.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Don&#8217;t hate on low-code and no-code&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dont-hate-on-low-code-and-no-code/embed/#?secret=1iqWWNUCCM" data-secret="1iqWWNUCCM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the industry is split up between compliance and onboarding, authenticating risk and payments, and user trust and safety, Kharrl said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We put all the tools together to address all things combined, to make sure the person an institution is talking to is who they say they are, and not acting with malicious intent,” he told TechCrunch. “We sit in between them and their traffic to make sure the risk and fraud teams have what they need to spot bad guys.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151466" style="width: 1337px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151466" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2151466 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpecTrust.jpg" alt="" width="1327" height="716" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpecTrust.jpg 1327w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpecTrust.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpecTrust.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpecTrust.jpg?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpecTrust.jpg?resize=680,367 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpecTrust.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1327px) 100vw, 1327px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151466" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: SpecTrust</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online businesses spend billions on risk defense yet still lose a lot of money to fraudsters, scammers and identity thieves, Kharrl said. And, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a global shift in the digital economy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as more people came to rely on the internet to meet day-to-day needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With these new trends in commerce and banking came more opportunities for fraudsters, scammers and identity thieves to target people and businesses,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he added. For example, an alarming number of cybercriminals employed no-code attack tools and click-to-deploy infrastructure to launch sophisticated attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech and crypto companies are feeling the biggest impacts, as legacy software designed for big banks, for example, can be slow and expensive, said Kharrl. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We built SpecTrust to instantly put complete assessment, automation and enforcement capabilities in the hands of teams charged with fighting modern cybercrime threats,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using its platform, the company says an organization’s risk team can review and investigate everything a customer does “from its first page view to its last click with unified behavior, identity, history and risk data.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even non-technical staffers can do things like identify attack behavior,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> verify customer identity information, validate payment details and work to mitigate threats before they become losses, according to Kharrl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jon Lim of SignalFire says that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SpecTrust has built an end-to-end risk protection platform that enables customers of all sizes and risk profiles “to access the latest innovative risk protection solutions, quickly respond to the evolving threat landscape and share the best practices and learnings across the entire customer base.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, it was drawn to the startup’s no-code platform and ability to provide visibility over every user interaction versus treating each interaction as an independent event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This not only delivers stronger protection to customers but also a smoother experience to the end user,” Lim said.</span></p>
<p>The fraud prevention space is hot these days. Sift, which also aims to predict and prevent fraud, in April <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/fraud-prevention-platform-sift-raises-50m-at-over-1b-valuation-eyes-acquisitions/">raised $50 million in a funding round</a> that valued the company at over $1 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’re new to Discord, you might be thrown off by the lack of an endless feed peppered with ads. On Discord, all of the action happens in interest-specific servers, and the company wants to make it easier for anyone to stumble across and plunge into those communities.</p>
<p>The company launched<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/"> Stage Channels</a>, its own Clubhouse-like voice event rooms, in late March. With those building blocks in place, in June Discord will start surfacing events (think open mic nights, book clubs, etc.) through a new portal called Stage Discovery, adding a way for anybody to connect with the cool communities in the process.</p>
<p>Discord Product Manager Rick Ling says Stage Channels are a hit so far, and the company realized that events can be a gateway to introduce new users to the communities at the heart of the platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;For us, just dropping in and out of these audio conversations is not the end goal,&#8221; Ling said during a press event. Soon, servers will be able to list public events, inviting anybody to come check things out. Discord also says that its new discovery feature will launch with some noteworthy partners, hinting that “one rhymes with…… rhymes.” (It’s Grimes.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2151701 size-full alignnone" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/discord-stage-discovery.jpeg" alt="discord-stage-discovery" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/discord-stage-discovery.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/discord-stage-discovery.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/discord-stage-discovery.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/discord-stage-discovery.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/discord-stage-discovery.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/discord-stage-discovery.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Discord has a few other new features around the corner too. Threaded conversations are on the way this summer and the company is about to begin a pilot program to test paid, ticketed audio events. The latter could be a huge boon for creators, who haven&#8217;t been able to make money through the platform previously, and an important extra revenue stream for a platform that has no plans to get into the targeted advertising game.</p>
<p>Discord is obviously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/clubhouse-payments/">taking notes from Clubhouse here</a> — live audio event discovery is Clubhouse&#8217;s whole<em> thing</em> — but Discord&#8217;s deep well of interest-based communities stands to push its own experience far beyond what the newer audio upstart can offer. The company has a five year head start and universal brand recognition with young people: most of its 150 million monthly active users are the 18-24 year-olds who comprise a big chunk of Gen Z.</p>
<p>Discord doesn&#8217;t really need to compete with Clubhouse — in many ways, it was there first. The company might have cribbed some smart features along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">everybody else</a>, but Clubhouse&#8217;s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/clubhouse-downloads-900000-in-april-2021-5">downloads are falling off a cliff</a> and the latter app probably needs to prove it can compete with Discord at this point.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Discord&#8217;s next evolution</h2>
<p>Stage Discovery is a bit of a departure for Discord. Previously, to check out a live event, you needed to pop into a server first. Because the platform is so community-based, people interested in a topic, say a particular Twitch streamer, often hop directly into those servers from elsewhere. Discord does have some discovery and search functionality — users can thumb through popular and featured public servers in its Discover tab — but historically it’s been relatively basic. But by expanding the “discovery surface,” Discord is likely to attract a lot of people who either haven’t heard of the app or think it’s just a voice chat utility for gamers.</p>
<p>Discord&#8217;s new discovery feature will show up in the home tab, offering a directory of live voice events. The feature’s real promise is that those events can bring new users into the fold, connecting them to thriving communities that have a lot more going on beyond events. Users will be able to see voice events at which their friends are hanging, events that servers they belong to are hosting and other live events that they aren’t connected to.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, this is still really a window into communities and how to join communities,” Discord Product Marketing spokesperson Jesse Wofford told TechCrunch. Wofford emphasized that Discord isn’t trying to lure anybody into an endless scrolling loop — instead the goal is connecting users with the vibrant communities for which the platform is known.</p>
<p>Discord is also celebrating its sixth birthday by sprucing up its brand a little, brightening its color scheme and making a few tweaks to its apparently beloved anthropomorphized little purple controller dude, Clyde. (Discord insists that Clyde is “blurple.”) The company says it wants to keep things playful while making its visual identity “more inclusive and welcoming” to the kind of people who haven’t been using the app for years.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2151767" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clyde.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /></p>
<p>While a big boost to discovery is on the near horizon, Discord’s product philosophy hasn’t changed. “There are no feeds, no likes, no way for anything to go viral,&#8221; Discord founder and CEO Jason Citron said, adding that Discord was designed with community building in mind from day one.</p>
<p>Discord wasn’t always such a welcoming place. The app has always served gamers, but it was also a<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/technology/discord-chat-app-alt-right.html"> haven for white supremacists</a>, including the ones who organized the Charlottesville rally that left Heather Heyer dead. In a not-so-distant past life, dangerous far-right extremism thrived on Discord, even as the company largely avoided the bad headlines that slammed more mainstream social platforms for facilitating hate.</p>
<p>Discord <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/28/17062554/discord-alt-right-neo-nazi-white-supremacy-atomwaffen">rooted out neo-Nazis</a> and other dangerous communities starting in 2017, and by 2021 the company was well-positioned to tell a different story. Now, 15% of the company works on its Trust and Safety team, a group dedicated to protecting users and shaping content moderation policies. The product was built for gamers from the get-go, but Discord has been broadening its horizons recently and started having conversations with users about how it’s helped them fight isolation during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s aspirations ultimately go well beyond the gaming community. Unlike Instagram’s ad-choked social feed or Twitter’s often brain-melting endless feed, Discord remains a joy to use. And all of that user-friendliness doesn’t appear to be a bait and switch either. Revenue from its Nitro premium product and other paid perks are growing fast and the company has no plans for targeted ads.</p>
<p>Discord&#8217;s savvy pandemic-era campaign to broaden Discord’s appeal to nongaming communities — musicians, study groups, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/3uFgJhu">surrealist fantasy baseball leagues</a> — appears to be paying off. Discord’s user numbers are explosive and the company is adding sensible new features at a healthy clip. The outlook is good for the company and its users alike, and what a rare convergence that is.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the old software world — think Oracle and SAP — sales were the competitive advantage. Today, we live in a world of product-led growth, where engineers (and the software they have built) are the biggest differentiator. If your customers love what you’re building, you’re headed in the right direction. If they don’t, you’re not.</p>
<p>However, even the most successful product-led growth companies will reach a tipping point, because no matter how good their product is, they’ll need to figure out how to expand their customer base and grow from a startup into a $1 billion+ revenue enterprise.</p>
<p>The answer is the hamburger model. Why call it that? Because the best go-to-market (GTM) strategies for startups are like hamburgers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The bottom bun:</strong> Bottom-up GTM.</li>
<li><strong>The burger</strong>: Your product.</li>
<li><strong>The top bun:</strong> Enterprise sales.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the hamburger GTM model, your product is the meat. We’ll go through each layer before talking about some of the best ways to implement the model successfully at your company.</p>
<h2>The hamburger model</h2>
<p><strong>The meat — product at the center</strong>: The hamburger model starts with a great product. As a founder, this means you don’t need to think about revenue on Day One. You do, however, need to obsess over your customers, what they want and how to build it. Nothing is more important.</p>
<p><strong>The bottom bun —</strong> <strong>users not leads:</strong> In a top-down sales model, marketing creates leads that are then converted into sales by enterprise reps. In a bottom-up model, marketing creates users, not leads, and those users are never touched by sales. For companies that have been customer-obsessed from the very beginning because they built something people love, this bottom-up model can feel far more natural and fuel a successful business.</p>
<p><strong>The top bun —</strong> <strong>building enterprise sales:</strong> Even the best bottom-up sales models aren’t enough on their own, and every company eventually needs top-down sales. It may sound counterintuitive, but even the companies most famous for their bottom-up approaches now have enterprise sales teams. That’s because there are certain types of customers — for example, healthcare, insurance and government — that require salespeople to engage with due to compliance and security reasons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the basic elements of the hamburger GTM model: A killer product that sets you apart, a bottom-up sales strategy to convert users into paying customers, and a sales team to go after bigger customers that require more attention.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Retail giant Walmart <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/05/13/walmart-announces-plans-to-acquire-zeekit-a-leading-virtual-fitting-room-platform-to-enable-enhanced-and-social-shopping-experience-for-customer">announced</a> this morning it&#8217;s acquiring the Tel Aviv-based startup <a href="https://zeekit.me/">Zeekit</a>, which allows consumers to virtually &#8220;try on&#8221; clothing when shopping online. The company leverages a combination of real-time image processing, computer vision, deep learning and other AI technology to show shoppers how they would look in an item by way of a simulation that takes into account body dimensions, fit, size and even the fabric of the garment itself.</p>
<p>Deal terms were not disclosed. According to data from PitchBook, Zeekit had raised over $24 million in outside capital, but we&#8217;ve confirmed that&#8217;s inaccurate. Zeekit <a href="https://jewishbusinessnews.com/2016/09/15/israeli-startup-zeekit-the-most-advanced-virtual-fitting-room-app-raises-9-million/">raised a $9 million Series A</a> in 2016, and has raised a total of $16 million since 2014.</p>
<p>The company had already been working with a range of retailers and brands ahead of the acquisition, including Walmart, as well Macy&#8217;s, Asos, Tommy Hilfiger, Adidas and others. It had once <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/09/rebecca-minkoffs-fashion-week-show-uses-augmented-reality-to-help-real-women-shop-the-look-live/">worked with Rebecca Minkoff during Fashion Week</a> to help women shop the show&#8217;s looks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zeekit was founded in 2013 by CEO Yael Vizel, VP of Research and Development Nir Appleboim and CTO Alon Kristal, with the premise that if online shoppers could see how clothing would look on their own bodies, the technology could reduce the rate of returns due to non-fitting, non-flattering items.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151668" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151668" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2151668" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/download.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151668" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Walmart</p></div></p>
<p>Walmart says customers will be able to use the Zeekit technology to virtually try on items from brands including Free People, Champion, Levi Strauss, ELOQUII Elements, Free Assembly, Scoop, Sofia Jeans by Sofia Vergara, plus its own private label brands, like Time and Tru, Terra &amp; Sky, Wonder Nation and George.</p>
<p>When the technology goes live on Walmart.com, customers can choose to upload an image of their own or choose from a series of models that best represent their height, shape and skin tone in order to see themselves virtually in any item of clothing. The goal is to provide a similar experience to trying on clothing when shopping online as you would otherwise have had when in a retail store.</p>
<p>Shoppers will also be able to share their virtual outfits with friends for a second opinion, via the new integration, adding the social element back into online shopping.</p>
<p>In addition to the virtual try-on, Walmart says Zeekit&#8217;s technology may be used to build other fashion experiences over time, including a virtual closet experience where you could mix and match styles.</p>
<p>With the deal&#8217;s closure, Zeekit&#8217;s three co-founders will be joining Walmart.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re confident that with the team’s expertise in bringing real-time image technologies, computer vision and artificial intelligence to the world of fashion, we’ll identify even more ways to innovate for our customers in our continued effort to be the first-choice destination for fashion,&#8221; said Denise Incandela, Walmart U.S. EVP of Apparel and Private Brands, in an <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/05/13/walmart-announces-plans-to-acquire-zeekit-a-leading-virtual-fitting-room-platform-to-enable-enhanced-and-social-shopping-experience-for-customer">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Walmart in years past had heavily invested in apparel, including by acquiring online brands like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/16/walmart-to-buy-bonobos-for-310m-in-its-bigger-push-into-fashion-retail/">Bonobos</a>, ModCloth, Eloquii and others, and even tried offering some brands, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/05/bonobos-and-nike-get-their-own-branded-shops-on-walmarts-jet-com/">Nike</a>, their own shop on Walmart. com. Not all of these efforts paid off. <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/walmart-sells-modcloth-to-financial-firm/564464/">Walmart sold ModCloth</a> only a couple of years after buying it, for example, after ModCloth customers balked at being owned by a retail giant, and the brand remained unprofitable. More recently, Walmart <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/09/rebecca-minkoffs-fashion-week-show-uses-augmented-reality-to-help-real-women-shop-the-look-live/">partnered</a> with online consignment shop ThredUP to list a large number of secondhand items on Walmart&#8217;s website.</p>

<p>In addition to the struggles around profitability, apparel more broadly has been a harder area for online retail to get right, often because of the difficulties involved with picking out items that have to fit unique bodies and the non-standard sizing fashion designers use &#8212; meaning clothing can run smaller or larger, depending on a given brand, even when shopping &#8220;your size.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another factor that may have impacted the acquisition was the pandemic, which pushed e-commerce years ahead, as retailers closed their doors and consumers stayed home to shop online due the circumstances of the health crisis. During this time, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/amazon-unseats-walmart-to-become-the-no-1-apparel-retailer-in-the-us.html?">Amazon passed Walmart</a> as the top apparel retailer in the U.S., according to Wells Fargo, which estimated its apparel and footwear sales grew 15% in 2020 to over $41 billion, or 20-25% higher than Walmart.</p>
<p>Walmart didn&#8217;t say when Zeekit would go live on Walmart&#8217;s website, only that it would show up &#8220;soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>We understand that, post-acquisition, Walmart will not continue to operate Zeekit’s existing business. Zeekit will work with their current customers on a transition plan.</p>
<p><em>Updated 5/13/21, 11:05 AM ET with more accurate funding totals. Previously we noted PitchBook data. We&#8217;ve since confirmed the figures directly. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.blubracket.com/">BluBracket</a>, an early-stage startup that focuses on keeping source code repositories secure, even in distributed environments, announced a $12 million Series A today.</p>
<p>Evolution Equity Partners led the round, with help from existing investors Unusual Ventures, Point72 Ventures, SignalFire and Firebolt Ventures. When combined with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/blubracket-scores-6-5m-seed-to-help-secure-code-in-distributed-environments/">$6.5 million seed round</a> we reported on last year, the company has raised $19.5 million so far.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, being able to secure code in distributed environments came in quite handy when much of the technology world moved to work from home last year. BluBracket co-founder and COO Ajay Arora says that the pandemic forced many organizations to look carefully at how they secured their code base.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;So the anxiety organizations had about making sure their source code was secure and that it wasn&#8217;t leaking, from that standpoint that was a big tailwind for us. [With companies moving to a] completely remote development workforce, and with code being so important to their business as intellectual property, they needed to get that visibility into what vulnerabilities were there,&#8221; Arora explained.</p>
<p>Even prior to the pandemic, the company was finding they were gaining traction with developers and security pros by using a bottom up approach offering a free community version of the software. Having that free version as a top of the funnel for their sales motion was also helpful once COVID hit full force.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zRMcejaEB6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/2020-was-a-disaster-but-the-pandemic-put-security-in-the-spotlight/">2020 was a disaster, but the pandemic put security in the spotlight</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;2020 was a disaster, but the pandemic put security in the spotlight&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/2020-was-a-disaster-but-the-pandemic-put-security-in-the-spotlight/embed/#?secret=zRMcejaEB6" data-secret="zRMcejaEB6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today, Arora says the company has multiple thousands of developers, DevOps and SecOps users across dozens of organizations using the company&#8217;s suite of products. The big reference company right now is Priceline, but he says there are other big names that would prefer not to be public about it.</p>
<p>The company currently has 30 employees, with plans to double that by the end of the year, and he says that building diversity and inclusion into the hiring process is part of the company&#8217;s core values, and part of how the executive team gets measured.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re big believers in putting our money where our mouth is and one of the OKRs for me and my co-founder [CEO Prakash Linga], or one of the things that we&#8217;re actually compensated for, is how well we are doing in building diversity and inclusion on the team,&#8221; he said. He adds that the recruiters that they are using are also being held to the same standard when it comes to providing a diverse set of candidates for open positions.</p>
<p>The company launched in 2018 and the founding team came from Vera, a startup that helped secure documents in motion. That company <a href="https://www.helpsystems.com/about/news/helpsystems-acquires-vera-broaden-data-security-portfolio">was sold to HelpSystems in December 2020</a> after Arora and Linga had left to start BluBracket.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Companies across the United States should be closely following the California State Legislature hearings on the “Silenced No More Act,” which would prevent the use of nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence employees from speaking up about all forms of discrimination and harassment.</p>
<p>The legislation was introduced in response to the stunning claims brought forward by former Pinterest employees alleging a pattern of racial and gender discrimination, harassment and retaliation. They courageously called attention to the hypocrisy of Pinterest’s aspirational comments on social issues even though the company had required them to sign NDAs.</p>
<p>As attorneys who work with shareholders to hold companies accountable for this misconduct, these allegations have deeply impacted our work. They formed the basis of an ongoing shareholder derivative lawsuit that a state pension fund we represent brought against Pinterest’s board of directors and top executives for participating in and otherwise protecting powerful executives who are alleged to have discriminated against Pinterest employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			Failure to recognize this necessity will lead to future corporate scandals as multiple accounts of the same type of misconduct in the workplace come to light.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The Silenced No More Act would extend existing laws that limit the use of NDAs. Such laws are important because NDAs are intended to protect executives by keeping their harassment, discrimination and retaliation under wraps. That NDAs chill the voices of employees who have already been victimized makes them even more toxic. NDAs cause women to fear reprisal from the company, sometimes even incorporating financial penalty clauses, long after their individual claims have been resolved.</p>
<p>The Silenced No More Act should pass swiftly and be a model for other states, but this is what all companies throughout the country should be doing on their own, rather than waiting for legislation to drag an ethical NDA policy out of them.</p>
<p>Failure to recognize this necessity will lead to future corporate scandals as multiple accounts of the same type of misconduct in the workplace come to light. It will continue to uphold an unsustainable corporate system where executives in positions of power assume they will be protected no matter how unlawful their behavior toward others in the workplace.</p>
<p>We have seen from our investigations the compounding impacts of NDAs and how they allow problems to fester over years.</p>
<p>The two of us, working with others and on behalf of Alphabet shareholders, were part of the team that led a groundbreaking <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/alphabet-settles-shareholder-lawsuit-.html">$310 million settlement</a> with the tech company that led to historic diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) reforms at the company. That settlement was the result of a shareholder derivative lawsuit where stockholders alleged that executives and board members violated their fiduciary duties by enabling a double standard that allowed executives to sexually harass and discriminate against women without consequence.</p>
<p>In that case, we believe Alphabet’s “culture of concealment” was driven in large part by the silencing effects of NDAs.</p>
<p>The duration of misconduct, enabled by NDAs, goes far beyond Alphabet and Pinterest. There is no shortage of #MeToo scandals at powerful companies, many with presences in California, that were exacerbated by muzzling NDAs. Weinstein Company, Wynn Resorts, NBC and 21st Century Fox are prominent examples of companies that first tried to keep allegations quiet through the use of NDAs and later faced a firestorm of allegations from former employees.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the landscape surrounding discrimination and harassment in the workplace is changing. Shareholders, workers, customers and other key business stakeholders are becoming more active in demanding that companies stop protecting harassers.</p>
<p>All of this should send a message to boards and C-suite executives that they must set the tone from the top and they are far better off being proactive than reactive. That means actively creating a company culture where DEI is a foundational component &#8212; not an afterthought. It also means intentionally prioritizing transparency and proactively doing away with policies that are antithetical to that goal, like NDAs that are intentionally designed to suppress the voices of employees.</p>
<p>The public and shareholders want to be associated with companies that do right by their employees. Business should recognize this change from a culture of compliance to one of equity and inclusion and embrace this new reality by stopping the practice of requiring complainants to enter into NDAs and fostering a culture of inclusion and accountability.</p>
