					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hi friends!</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/grg">Greg</a> here again for this edition of the Daily Crunch on Thursday, September 9, 2021. <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex Wilhelm</a> is still out on vacation for a few more days … even though he&#8217;s still tweeting a lot, which leads me to think he&#8217;s either bad at vacation or dislikes Twitter less than I do. Whatever the case, I&#8217;ll keep that daily recap goodness flowing to give you a glimpse into the biggest stories to cross our front page.</p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/facebook-debuts-its-ray-ban-stories-smart-sunglasses/"><strong>Facebook&#8217;s smart Ray-Bans:</strong></a> Five years after Snap shipped its Spectacle sunglasses, Facebook is taking a swing at the concept. But you won&#8217;t find the Facebook logo anywhere on these things (presumably because nobody on the planet wants the Facebook logo on their face). Built in partnership with Ray-Ban&#8217;s parent company, they look just like a classic pair of Wayfarers with an added bit of heft … and cameras. A white LED lights up when you&#8217;re shooting photos or videos, and near-ear speakers pipe in your tunes and phone calls. You can&#8217;t get them wet, which is great because no one wears sunglasses around places with water, like pools or beaches. Lucas Matney <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/facebooks-first-smart-glasses-make-the-case-for-face-worn-wearables/">reviewed them here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/the-newest-roomba-gets-smarter-as-it-vacuums/"><strong>Roomba gets smarter:</strong></a> New Roomba incoming! The big new feature? It&#8217;ll try to detect and avoid poop your pets might have left in its path. Past models would just blast right through that mess and drag it around, leaving owners quite the horror show to come home to.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/notion-acquires-indias-automate-io-in-push-to-accelerate-product-expansion/">Notion acquires Automate.io:</a></strong> Notion is buying Automate.io, a startup out of India that lets you easily hook into services like Mailchimp or Gmail or Salesforce (or Notion!) and create complex automated workflows. &#8220;It&#8217;s a sizable acquisition,&#8221; Notion&#8217;s COO said without disclosing exactly how much it spent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/solar-powered-aircraft-developer-skydweller-aero-adds-8m-to-series-a-partners-with-palantir/">Skydweller Aero raises $8M for solar-powered planes:</a></strong> &#8220;Airplanes and drones today, regardless of size or fuel type, all face the same limitation: eventually they have to land.&#8221; writes Aria Alamalhodaei. &#8220;Skydweller Aero, the U.S.-Spanish aerospace startup, wants to break free from that constraint … &#8220;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/varo-bank-raises-510m-at-a-2-5b-valuation/">The $510M Series E:</a></strong> Varo Bank just won&#8217;t stop raising money. In June 2020, it raised $241 million, tacking on another $63 million in February 2021 because why not. Now it&#8217;s raised a staggering $510 million in a Series E round that values the company at $2.5 billion. “We didn’t set out to raise this much money. It was coming in fast and furious and we were at like $510 [million] and I finally said, ‘OK, enough,’” says Varo CEO Colin Walsh in a statement we can all totally relate to. Right? Anyone?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/affinity-a-relationship-intelligence-company-raises-80m-to-help-close-deals/">Affinity raises $80M to use machine learning to close deals:</a></strong> Who in your organization is best suited to close that deal? Can machine learning algorithms chew through your company&#8217;s data (past email interactions, calendar availability, etc.) and recommend the right person? That&#8217;s part of what Affinity is working on, and they&#8217;ve raised another $80 million to keep the ball moving and the company growing. Affinity currently has 125 employees, with plans to balloon to over 200 in the next year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Anatomy of a SPAC: Inside Better.com’s ambitious plans</h2>
<p>Online mortgage company Better.com isn&#8217;t waiting to complete its SPAC merger before making big moves: Today, Ryan Lawler reported that it purchased Property Partners, a U.K.-based startup that offers fractional property ownership.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the second company Better bought in recent months: In July, it snapped up digital mortgage brokerage Trussle.</p>
<p>“We aren’t so easily categorized,” said Better CEO Vishal Garg, who told Ryan that the company plans to soon expand into traditional financial services like auto loans and insurance.</p>
<p>Said CFO Kevin Ryan, “A lot of people have their niches in the way they’re attacking this, but we feel like we’re on a path to being full stack where everything’s embedded in the same flow.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-communities/">Twitter communities:</a></strong> Twitter keeps trying new things to make Twitter more approachable for people who don&#8217;t already have 10,000 followers. The latest experiment: Communities, or moderated social hubs, in which you can tweet with others around a shared interest. Twitter is limiting the categories, for now, to topics like dogs, weather, sneakers, skincare and astrology, and presumably hoping to stay way, way, way far away from politics for as long as possible.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/microsoft-acquires-video-creation-and-editing-software-maker-clipchamp/">Microsoft is buying Clipchamp:</a></strong> Ever wished Microsoft&#8217;s 365 tool suite included a video editor? Seems it&#8217;s on the way. Microsoft announced that it&#8217;s buying up Clipchamp, a web-based tool for creating/editing videos. As for when it might be integrated into 365? TBD.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/quicken-one-of-the-first-fintechs-resold-to-another-private-equity-firm/">Quicken gets sold again:</a></strong> Well that was quick(en). Just a few years after being acquired by a private equity firm, Quicken is being sold off to a <em>different</em> private equity firm. Quicken CEO Eric Dunn shared his thoughts on the deal (plus some insights on the company&#8217;s growth as of late) with TC&#8217;s Mary Ann Azevedo.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM unveiled Thursday the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado, a full-sized pickup truck that received a major technology upgrade, including its hands-free Super Cruise advanced driver assistance system and an infotainment system with embedded Google services as well as an overhauled interior. A new flagship trim, the off-road factory-installed lifted ZR2 truck, has also joined the Silverado lineup.</p>
<p>The Silverado refresh comes ahead of GM&#8217;s electric vehicle offensive, which will include Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">GM aims to deliver</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> 30 new electric vehicles to the global market by 2025 and to transition to all-zero-emission by 2035. GM said the new Silverado trims will arrive to dealerships in spring 2022.</span></p>
<p>The exterior of the Chevy Silverado also received a refresh, including new front fascia and daytime running lights that animate when the driver walks up or away from the vehicle. But the real change can be found in the cabin — and the hardware and software guts — of the truck.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200623" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-008.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200623" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2200623 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-008.jpg" alt=" 2022 Chevrolet Silverado ZR2 2022 Chevrolet Silverado ZR2" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-008.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-008.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-008.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-008.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-008.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-008.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2200623" class="wp-caption-text">The 2022 Chevrolet Silverado ZR2 and new headlights. Image credit: GM</p></div></p>
<p>Chevy offers the Silverado in the LT, RST, LT Trail Boss, ZR2, LTZ and High Country trims, all of which come standard with a 2.7-liter turbocharged engine that improves the torque by 20 percent to 420-pound feet and has a maximum trailering rating of 9,500 pounds in a two-wheel drive configuration. GM also made changes to smooth out shifting and give drivers more power on demand.</p>
<p>The automaker also improved its 3.0L Duramax turbocharged diesel engine to enable a max tow rating of 13,300 pounds in a two-wheel drive configuration. Two other powertrains, the 5.3-liter V8 and the 6.2-liter V8 are also offered.</p>
<p>The interior cabin has been revamped to make it feel more spacious and includes 13.4-inch touchscreen and a new 12.3-inch configurable digital instrument cluster standard. Owners will also be able to add a rear camera mirror and a head up display.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2200602" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200602" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2200602 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg" alt="Chevrolet Silverado" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2200602" class="wp-caption-text">The First-Ever 2022 Chevrolet Silverado ZR2. <strong>Image credit</strong>: GM</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, the Silverado interior will be offered in new colors, seat designs and premium materials. For model trims with bucket seats, the new center console incorporates an electronic shift controller.</p>
<p>Alexandre Scartezini, Chevrolet Truck&#8217;s lead interior designer, has described it as more contemporary and refined &#8220;with a hint of Corvette influence in its design DNA.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Everything Google</h2>
<p>Moving in deeper inside the vehicle, aka the infotainment, users will find Google, or more specifically Android Automotive, at the heart of the operating system. This means that Google Assistant, Google Maps and Google Play are all integrated into the the infotainment screen.</p>
<p>Android Automotive OS shouldn&#8217;t be confused with Android Auto, which is a secondary interface that lies on top of an operating system. Android Auto is an app that runs on the user&#8217;s phone and wirelessly communicates with the vehicle&#8217;s infotainment system. Both Android Auto and its Apple CarPlay counterpart will be offered in the new Silverado. GM said the system also works with Amazon Alexa.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Android Automotive OS is modeled after its open-source mobile operating system that runs on Linux. But instead of running smartphones and tablets, Google modified it so automakers could use it in their cars. Google has offered an open-source version of this OS to automakers for sometime. In recent years, automakers have worked with the tech company to natively build in an Android OS that is embedded with all the Google apps and services.</p>
<h2>Hands-free driving</h2>
<p>All of the Silverado trims come standard with six active safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and forward collision alerts, a warning if the vehicle leaves its lane, a following distance indicator, automatic high beams and front pedestrian braking.</p>
<p>The big change is the addition of the automaker&#8217;s Super Cruise hands-free driver-assistance technology, which will be an available option on the High Country trim. Importantly, the system can be used even while trailering. Certain features of Super Cruise like automatic lane changing and lane change on demand will be restricted if the truck is towing.</p>
<p>Super Cruise uses a combination of lidar map data, high-precision GPS, cameras and radar sensors, as well as a driver attention system, which monitors the person behind the wheel to ensure they&#8217;re paying attention. Unlike Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot driver assistance system, users of Super Cruise do not need to have their hands on the wheel. However, their eyes must remain directed straight ahead.</p>
<p>While GM has steadily improved Super Cruise since its introduction in 2017, for years it was limited to its luxury Cadillac brand and restricted to certain divided highways. That began to change in 2019 when GM announced plans to expand it to more models and use cases. The system can be activated on more than 200,000 miles of roads in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>The Silverado will offer other trailer assistance features including one that will alert drivers to vehicles in their blind spot.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">China enacted a sweeping new data privacy law on August 20 that will dramatically impact how tech companies can operate in the country. Officially called the Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China (PIPL), the law is the first national data privacy statute passed in China.</p>
<p>Modeled after the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, the PIPL imposes protections and restrictions on data collection and transfer that companies both inside and outside of China will need to address. It is particularly focused on apps using personal information to target consumers or offer them different prices on products and services, and preventing the transfer of personal information to other countries with fewer protections for security.</p>
<p>The PIPL, slated to take effect on November 1, 2021, does not give companies a lot of time to prepare. Those that already follow GDPR practices, particularly if they&#8217;ve implemented it globally, will have an easier time complying with China&#8217;s new requirements. But firms that have not implemented GDPR practices will need to consider adopting a similar approach. In addition, U.S. companies will need to consider the new restrictions on the transfer of personal information from China to the U.S.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Implementation and compliance with the PIPL is a much more significant task for companies that have not implemented GDPR principles.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a deep dive into the PIPL and what it means for tech firms:</p>
<h2>New data handling requirements<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>The PIPL introduces perhaps the most stringent set of requirements and protections for data privacy in the world (this includes special requirements relating to processing personal information by governmental agencies that will not be addressed here). The law broadly relates to all kinds of information, recorded by electronic or other means, related to identified or identifiable natural persons, but excludes anonymized information.</p>
<p>The following are some of the key new requirements for handling people&#8217;s personal information in China that will affect tech businesses:</p>
<h3>Extra-territorial application of the China law</h3>
<p>Historically, China regulations have only been applied to activities inside the country. The PIPL is similar in applying the law to personal information handling activities within Chinese borders. However, similar to GDPR, it also expands its application to the handling of personal information outside China if the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the purpose is to provide products or services to people inside China.</li>
<li>Where analyzing or assessing activities of people inside China.</li>
<li>Other circumstances provided in laws or administrative regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you are a U.S.-based company selling products to consumers in China, you may be subject to the China data privacy law even if you do not have a facility or operations there.</p>
<h3>Data handling principles</h3>
<p>The PIPL introduces principles of transparency, purpose and data minimization: Companies can only collect personal information for a clear, reasonable and disclosed purpose, and to the smallest scope for realizing the purpose, and retain the data only for the period necessary to fulfill that purpose. Any information handler is also required to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data it handles to avoid any negative impact on personal rights and interests.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Squad Mobility&#8217;s vision of the perfect urban vehicle is a low-cost EV equipped with solar panels, swappable batteries and enough zip and range in its diminutive 6.5-foot package to meet the needs of city drivers.</p>
<p>The early-stage Dutch startup, which recently revealed the final design of its quadricycle, is now assembling working prototypes in Breda, the Netherlands. Squad has said the vehicle will have a base price of €5,750 ($6,790), excluding taxes. That price goes up if buyers want to add features like removable doors, air conditioning, heating and extra batteries.</p>
<p>Squad plans to present the prototypes this fall, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert Hoevers, CEO and co-founder of the company, said in a recent interview. Pre-production is also expected to begin this year with a goal to start </span>delivering the car at the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Squad, like so many other new entrants to the EV car scene, will need more funds to reach its target.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sono Motors plans to license the tech that powers its solar electric car&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/sono-motors-plans-to-license-the-tech-that-powers-its-solar-electric-car/embed/#?secret=tFIdUYEh9I" data-secret="tFIdUYEh9I" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In June, the company </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/squad-mobility-closes-investment-partnership-bloomit-squadmobility/">raised an undisclosed amount from Bloomit Ventures</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. To reach its production goals, Hoevers estimates Squad will need an additional €3.5 million ($4.1 million) for its next round, and then another €8 million ($9.6 million) to be able to deliver the first Squads. The company has not yet announced a round publicly, but says it&#8217;s in talks with various interested parties.</span></p>
<p>Interested customers can go on <a href="https://www.squadmobility.com/">Squad&#8217;s website</a> and pay a €5 reserve fee, but where Squad really sees its path to market is with shared mobility companies. The startup says it is in talks with a range of micromobility and car-sharing operators that might be interested in diversifying their fleets with a compact, smart vehicle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Squad, which is a combination of the words &#8220;solar&#8221; and &#8220;quadricycle,&#8221; seats two, punches up to 30 miles per hour and is fueled by two swappable batteries with a capacity of around 1.6 Kwh each and a collective range of about 62 miles. This is similar to the battery capacity and range of electric mopeds.</p>
<p>For the average European city driver, that should be enough range. Squad also installed a 250-watt solar panel to the vehicle, which the company says adds another 12 miles per day given the amount of sun Europe tends to get.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196065" style="width: 4010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196065" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2196065 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Squad-Charging-Station.jpg" alt="" width="4000" height="2000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Squad-Charging-Station.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Squad-Charging-Station.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Squad-Charging-Station.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Squad-Charging-Station.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Squad-Charging-Station.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Squad-Charging-Station.jpg?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Squad-Charging-Station.jpg?resize=2048,1024 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Squad-Charging-Station.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4000px) 100vw, 4000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196065" class="wp-caption-text">Rendering of a Squad charging station for swappable batteries that can be used by shared mobility operators. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Squad Mobility</p></div></p>
<p>Squad is coming onto the scene at the intersection of new mobility categories and EV charging innovation, which could be appealing to shared mobility operators looking to solve more use cases.</p>
<p>Shared micromobility companies are beginning to add electric mopeds to their fleets of e-scooters and e-bikes. The Squad could appeal to operators that want to appeal to a broader demographic, and one specifically more comfortable in a four-wheeled vehicle.</p>
<p>The potential savings from harnessing the power of the sun could attract operators as well. In the micromobility world, the labor costs associated with swapping batteries or charging vehicles represent a roadblock to profitability. A vehicle that&#8217;s constantly on a bit of a charge, at least during the daylight hours, might help alleviate that pain point.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is not to drive directly on solar,&#8221;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hoevers </span>told TechCrunch. &#8220;The idea is to buffer the batteries with solar and then drive on the batteries. The sun is more or less drip charging the battery throughout the day, which is actually a very healthy way of charging. You don&#8217;t want to top off your batteries to 100%. You want to keep them at around 50% to 60% all the time for a longer battery life.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hoevers</span> said Squad has been in talks with shared micromobility providers to pitch the quadricycle, and has found that most dockless vehicles see about four to five rides per day and drive about 36 to 38 miles per day, numbers that TechCrunch confirmed with a few micromobility operators and that are well within the range of the Squad car.</p>
<p>Squad also intends to equip its vehicles with cameras, sensors and other smart features like remote diagnostics and maintenance, which will make the company more attractive to shared operators looking for a fleet that can be integrated into its management platforms. Hoevers also says he and his co-founder, Chris Klok, have used their collective 40 years of experience in mobility and shared past at long range solar EV company Lightyear to develop a strong CAN bus and drivetrain upon which new features can be added.</p>
<p>Whether Squad ends up selling fleets to micromobility platforms or car-sharing platforms might depend on the category in which the vehicle ends up. With its current speed and weight, the Squad car will be in the L6e category for light four-wheeled vehicles.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are interesting cost and tax benefits in this segment,&#8221; said Hoevers. &#8220;For example, there is no congestion charge, no road tax, no parking fees, low insurance fees and no car driving license needed in most markets.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Hoevers said the company is also considering producing a more powerful L7 that can go top speeds of around 45 miles per hour, which might be better for cities with more hills.</p>
<h2>The competition</h2>
<p>Squad isn&#8217;t the only company that has added solar panels to its electric vehicles. Germany-based startup Sono Motors told TechCrunch that it&#8217;s on track to begin deliveries of its electric Sion vehicle by 2023. The<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/sono-motors-plans-to-license-the-tech-that-powers-its-solar-electric-car/"> vehicle&#8217;s exterior is composed of hundreds of solar cells</a> that have been integrated into polymer instead of glass and can add up to nearly 22 miles of extra battery life per day.</p>
<p>Although the Sion has not yet been released, the Sono app is already inviting owners of the vehicle to engage in a sort of car sharing that&#8217;s reminiscent of Airbnb for Sions in order to make use of vehicles that otherwise sit parked and useless for most of the day. As of Thursday, <a href="https://sonomotors.com/en/press/press-releases/sono-motors-carsharing-service-expansion/">Sono is expanding this vision to allow any car to be shared via the Sono app</a>.</p>
<p>Aptera Motors, a California company that has promised to roll out the &#8220;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/interactive/2021/solar-car/">first mass-produced solar car</a>&#8221; this year, raised $4 million in a <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a34869242/the-aptera-ev-is-back-and-claims-up-to-1000-miles-of-range/">Series A this February</a> that it is using to pay for fiberglass, carbon fiber and batteries for its spaceship-looking tricycle. Aptera says its vehicle, which is available for pre-order and could cost anywhere between $25,900 and $46,900, will be built with 34 square feet of solar cells that can add an additional 40 miles of battery capacity on a clear day.</p>
<p>Each of the players in the solar-powered EV space have differences in tech, path to market and style, but they&#8217;re all potentially finding ways to ease the strain on the electrical grid.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/07/todays-electric-vehicle-market-slow-growth-in-u-s-faster-in-china-europe/#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20about%2064%2C300%20plug,the%20U.S.%20new%2Dcar%20market.">new electric cars make up 25% of total market share</a>, and that number will only increase. It might not be feasible in the long run for all of those vehicles to each plug into the grid to power up, especially when industries across sectors are beginning to electrify.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s clear that the technology isn&#8217;t there yet for vehicles to run purely on solar, Squad and other companies like it are laying the groundwork for future solar technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K. government has announced a consultation on plans to shake up the national data protection regime, as it looks at how to diverge from European Union rules following Brexit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a year since the U.K. published a national data strategy in which said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/uk-wants-pandemic-levels-of-data-sharing-to-be-the-new-normal/">wanted pandemic levels of data sharing</a> to become Britain&#8217;s new normal.</p>
<p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCPS) has today trailed an incoming reform of the information commissioner&#8217;s office &#8212; saying it wants to broaden the ICO&#8217;s remit to &#8220;champion sectors and businesses that are using personal data in new, innovative and responsible ways to benefit people’s lives&#8221;; and promising &#8220;simplified&#8221; rules to encourage the use of data for research which &#8220;benefit&#8217;s people&#8217;s lives&#8221;, such as in the field of healthcare.</p>
<p>It also wants a new structure for the regulator &#8212; including the creation of an independent board and chief executive for the ICO, to mirror the governance structures of other regulators such as the Competition and Markets Authority, Financial Conduct Authority and Ofcom.</p>
<p>Additionally, it said the data reform consultation will consider how the new regime can help mitigate the risks around algorithmic bias &#8212; something the EU is already moving to legislate on, setting out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">a risk-based proposal for regulating applications of AI</a> back in April.</p>
<p>Which means the U.K. risks being left lagging if it&#8217;s only going to concern itself with a narrow focus on &#8220;bias mitigation&#8221;, rather than considering the wider sweep of how AI is intersecting with and influencing its citizens&#8217; lives.</p>
<p>In a press release announcing the consultation, DCMS highlights an artificial intelligence partnership involving Moorfields Eye Hospital and the University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, which kicked off back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/05/deepmind-partners-with-nhs-eye-hospital-to-conduct-ai-research/">2016</a>, as an example of the kinds of beneficial data sharing it wants to encourage. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0867-7">Last year</a> the researchers reported that their AI had been able to predict the development of wet age-related macular degeneration more accurately than clinicians.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The partnership also involved (Google-owned) DeepMind and now Google Health &#8212; although the government&#8217;s PR doesn&#8217;t make mention of the tech giant&#8217;s involvement. It&#8217;s an interesting omission, given that DeepMind&#8217;s name is also attached to a notorious U.K. patient data-sharing scandal, which saw another London-based NHS Trust (the Royal Free) sanctioned by the ICO,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/deepmind-nhs-health-data-deal-had-no-lawful-basis/"> in 2017</a>, for improperly sharing patient data with the Google-owned company during the development phase of a clinician support app (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/google-confirms-its-pulling-the-plug-on-streams-its-uk-clinician-support-app/">Google is now in the process of discontinuing</a>).</p>
<p>DCMS may be keen to avoid spelling out that its goal for the data reforms &#8212; aka to &#8220;remove unnecessary barriers to responsible data use&#8221; &#8212; could end up making it easier for commercial entities like Google to get their hands on U.K. citizens&#8217; medical records.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/aug/22/nhs-data-grab-on-hold-as-millions-opt-out">sizeable public backlash</a> over the most recent government attempt to requisition NHS users&#8217; medical records &#8212; for vaguely defined &#8220;research&#8221; purposes (aka the &#8220;General Practice Data for Planning and Research&#8221;, or GPDPR, scheme) &#8212; suggests that a government-enabled big-health-data-free-for-all might not be so popular with U.K. voters.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government’s data reforms will provide clarity around the rules for the use of personal data for research purposes, laying the groundwork for more scientific and medical breakthroughs,&#8221; is how DCMS&#8217; PR skirts the sensitive health data sharing topic.</p>

<p>Elsewhere there&#8217;s talk of &#8220;reinforc[ing] the responsibility of businesses to keep personal information safe, while empowering them to grow and innovate&#8221; &#8212; so that sounds like a yes to data security but what about individual privacy and control over what happens to your information?</p>
<p>The government seems to be saying that will depend on other aims &#8212; principally economic interests attached to the U.K.&#8217;s ability to conduct data-driven research or secure trade deals with other countries that don&#8217;t have the same (current) high U.K. standards of data protection.</p>
<p>There are some purely populist flourishes here too &#8212; with DCMS couching its ambition for a data regime &#8220;based on common sense, not box ticking&#8221; &#8212; and flagging up plans to beef up penalties for nuisance calls and text messages. Because, sure, who doesn&#8217;t like the sound of a crackdown on spam?</p>
<p>Except spam text messages and nuisance calls are a pretty quaint concern to zero in on in an era of apps and data-driven, democracy-disrupting mass surveillance &#8212; which was something the outgoing information commissioner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/facebook-under-fresh-political-pressure-as-uk-watchdog-calls-for-ethical-pause-of-ad-ops/">raised as a major issue of concern</a> during her tenure at the ICO.</p>
<p>The same populist anti-spam messaging has already been deployed by ministers to attack the need to obtain internet users&#8217; consent for dropping tracking cookies &#8212; which the digital minister Oliver Dowden <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/after-years-of-inaction-against-adtech-uks-ico-calls-for-browser-level-controls-to-fix-cookie-fatigue/">recently suggested</a> he wants to do away with &#8212; for all but &#8220;high risk&#8221; purposes.</p>
<p>Having a system of rights wrapping people&#8217;s data that gives them a say over (and a stake in) how it can be used appears to be being reframed in the government&#8217;s messaging as irresponsible or even non-patriotic &#8212; with DCMS pushing the notion that such rights stand in the way of more important economic or highly generalized &#8220;social&#8221; goals.</p>
<p>Not that it has presented any evidence for that &#8212; or even that the U.K.&#8217;s current data protection regime got in the way of (the very ample) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/uks-covid-19-health-data-contracts-with-google-and-palantir-finally-emerge/">data sharing during COVID-19</a>&#8230; While negative uses of people&#8217;s information are being condensed in DCMS&#8217; messaging to the narrowest possible definition &#8212; of spam that&#8217;s visible to an individual &#8212; never mind how that person got targeted with the nuisance calls/spam texts in the first place.</p>

<p>The government is taking its customary &#8220;cake and eat it&#8221; approach to spinning its reform plan &#8212; claiming it will both &#8220;protect&#8221; people&#8217;s data while also trumpeting the importance of making it really easy for citizens&#8217; information to be handed off to anyone who wants it, so long as they can claim they&#8217;re doing some kind of &#8220;innovation&#8221;, while also larding its PR with canned quotes dubbing the plan &#8220;bold&#8221; and &#8220;ambitious&#8221;.</p>
<p>So while DCMS&#8217; announcement says the reform will &#8220;maintain&#8221; the U.K.&#8217;s (currently) world-leading data protection standards, it directly rows back &#8212; saying the new regime will (merely) &#8220;build on&#8221; a few broad-brush &#8220;key elements&#8221; of the current rules (specifically it says it will keep &#8220;principles around data processing, people’s data rights and mechanisms for supervision and enforcement&#8221;).</p>
<p>Clearly the devil will be in the detail of the proposals which are due to be published tomorrow morning. So expect more analysis to debunk the spin soon.</p>
<p>But in one specific trailed change DCMS says it wants to move away from a &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; approach to data protection compliance &#8212; and &#8220;allow organisations to demonstrate compliance in ways more appropriate to their circumstances, while still protecting citizens’ personal data to a high standard&#8221;.</p>
<p>That implies that smaller data-mining operations &#8212; DCMS&#8217;s PR uses the example of a hairdresser&#8217;s but plenty of startups can employ fewer staff than the average barber&#8217;s shop &#8212; may be able to expect to get a pass to ignore those &#8216;high standards&#8217; in the future.</p>
<p>Which suggests the U.K.&#8217;s &#8220;high standards&#8221; may, under Dowden&#8217;s watch, end up resembling more of a Swiss Cheese&#8230;</p>
<h2>Data protection is a &#8220;how to, not a don&#8217;t do&#8221;&#8230;</h2>
<p>The man who is likely to become the U.K.&#8217;s next information commissioner, New Zealand&#8217;s privacy commissioner John Edwards, was <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/1508ef32-ec1d-4295-a5bf-aa8cd8211e7a">taking questions from a parliamentary committee</a> earlier today, as MPs considered whether to support his appointment to the role.</p>
<p>If he&#8217;s confirmed in the job, Edwards will be responsible for implementing whatever new data regime the government cooks up.</p>
<p>Under questioning, he rejected the notion that the U.K.&#8217;s current data protection regime presents a barrier to data sharing &#8212; arguing that laws like GDPR should rather be seen as a &#8220;how to&#8221; and an &#8220;enabler&#8221; for innovation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would take issue with the dichotomy that you presented [about privacy vs data-sharing],&#8221; he told the committee chair. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that policymakers and businesses and governments are faced with a choice of share or keep faith with data protection. Data protection laws and privacy laws would not be necessary if it wasn&#8217;t necessary to share information. These are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UK DPA [data protection act] and UK GDPR they are a &#8216;how to&#8217; &#8212; not a &#8216;don&#8217;t do&#8217;. And I think the UK and many jurisdictions have really finally learned that lesson through the COVID-19 crisis. It has been absolutely necessary to have good quality information available, minute by minute. And to move across different organizations where it needs to go, without friction. And there are times when data protection laws and privacy laws introduce friction and I think that what you&#8217;ve seen in the UK is that when it needs to things can happen quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also suggested that plenty of economic gains could be achieved for the U.K. with some minor tweaks to current rules, rather than a more radical reboot being necessary. (Though clearly setting the rules won&#8217;t be up to him; his job will be enforcing whatever new regime is decided.)</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can, in the administration of a law which at the moment looks very much like the UK GDPR, that gives great latitude for different regulatory approaches &#8212; if I can turn that dial just a couple of points that can make the difference of billions of pounds to the UK economy and thousands of jobs so we don&#8217;t need to be throwing out the statute book and starting again &#8212; there is plenty of scope to be making improvements under the current regime,&#8221; he told MPs. &#8220;Let alone when we start with a fresh sheet of paper if that&#8217;s what the government chooses to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked another Edwards (no relation) &#8212; Newcastle University&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/lilianedwards">Lilian Edwards</a>, professor of law, innovation and society &#8212; for her thoughts on the government&#8217;s direction of travel, as signalled by DCMS&#8217; pre-proposal-publication spin, and she expressed similar concerns about the logic driving the government to argue it needs to rip up the existing standards.</p>
<p>“The entire scheme of data protection is to balance fundamental rights with the free flow of data. Economic concerns have never been ignored, and the current scheme, which we’ve had in essence since 1998, has struck a good balance. The great things we did with data during COVID-19 were done completely legally &#8212; and with no great difficulty under the existing rules &#8212; so that isn’t a reason to change them,&#8221; she told us.</p>
<p>She also took issue with the plan to reshape the ICO &#8220;as a quango whose primary job is to &#8216;drive economic growth&#8217; &#8221; &#8212; pointing out that DCMS&#8217; PR fails to include any mention of privacy or fundamental rights, and arguing that &#8220;creating an entirely new regulator isn’t likely to do much for the &#8216;public trust&#8217; that’s seen as declining in almost every poll.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also suggested the government is glossing over the real economic damage that would hit the U.K. if the EU decides its &#8220;reformed&#8221; standards are no longer essentially equivalent to the bloc&#8217;s. &#8220;[It&#8217;s] hard to see much concern for adequacy here; which will, for sure, be reviewed, to our detriment &#8212; prejudicing 43% of our trade for a few low value trade deals and some hopeful sell offs of NHS data (again, likely to take a wrecking ball to trust judging by the GPDPR scandal).&#8221;</p>
<p>She described the goal of regulating algorithmic bias as &#8220;applaudable&#8221; &#8212; but also flagged the risk of the U.K. falling behind other jurisdictions which are taking a broader look at how to regulate artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Per DCMS&#8217; press release, the government seems to be intending for an existing advisory body, called the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI), to have a key role in supporting its policymaking in this area &#8212; saying that the body will <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">focus on &#8220;enabling trustworthy use of data and AI in the real-world&#8221;. </span>However it has still not appointed a new CDEI chair to replace Roger Taylor &#8212; with only an interim chair appointment (and some new advisors) announced today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world has moved on since CDEI’s work in this area,&#8221; argued Edwards. &#8220;We realise now that regulating the harmful effects of AI has to be considered in the round with other regulatory tools not just data protection. The proposed EU AI Regulation is not without flaw but goes far further than data protection in mandating better quality training sets, and more transparent systems to be built from scratch. If the UK is serious about regulating it has to look at the global models being floated but right now it looks like its main concerns are insular, short-sighted and populist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patient data privacy advocacy group MedConfidential, which has frequently locked horns with the government over its approach to data protection, also queried DCMS&#8217; continued attachment to the CDEI for shaping policymaking in such a crucial area &#8212; pointing to last year&#8217;s <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2020/08/26/fk-the-algorithm-what-the-world-can-learn-from-the-uks-a-level-grading-fiasco/">biased algorithm exam grading scandal</a>, which happened under Taylor&#8217;s watch.</p>
<p>(NB: Taylor was also the Ofqual chair, and his resignation from that post in December cited a &#8220;difficult summer&#8221;, even as his departure from the CDEI leaves an awkward hole now&#8230; )</p>
<p>“The culture and leadership of CDEI led to the A-Levels algorithm, why should anyone in government have any confidence in what they say next?&#8221; said MedConfidential&#8217;s Sam Smith.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tired of swerving around the same pothole every day but don&#8217;t know how to report it to your city? Already reported it but feel like said report was fired off into the ether, never to be read much less fixed?</p>
<p><a href="http://donotpay.com">DoNotPay</a>, a company that makes annoying processes less annoying through automation, might be able to help. Their &#8220;robot lawyer,&#8221; as the company calls it, started out as a service meant to help people more easily fight parking tickets. Over time it&#8217;s learned a bunch of new tricks, like helping users end tough-to-cancel subscriptions, get refunds they&#8217;re owed and more.</p>
<p>Its latest thing? Helping users report issues like potholes, fallen trees/branches and broken streetlights to their city government — and if said issue damaged your property or cost you money, it&#8217;ll help get you paid back.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200448" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200448" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2200448" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png 2304w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=768,376 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=680,333 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=1536,752 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=2048,1003 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200448" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> DoNotPay</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It just seems so unfair that if an ordinary American is driving down the street with a broken tail light, the government could give them a ticket and charge them money … but if there&#8217;s a pothole in the road, you can&#8217;t get money from the government,&#8221; says DoNotPay founder Joshua Browder. &#8220;So we&#8217;ve decided to create a product that is like a fix-it ticket for the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>When you start the process of reporting a city issue with DoNotPay, you&#8217;re given two options: report the issue or claim compensation. The first finds the correct place to report an issue in your city, then their chatbot gathers all the info it needs and sends it over to the city with your contact info. The second walks you through the small claims court process; their robot lawyer can&#8217;t represent you, but it&#8217;ll generate the documents you need and try to tell you everything you need to know to make your case.</p>
<p>DoNotPay started out as something of a side project but quickly grew into something more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When I was studying at Stanford, I got a bunch of parking tickets,&#8221; Browder tells me. &#8220;I learned … I was a terrible driver. But I also learned that the government issues tickets to make money, not necessarily to punish people. So I created the first version for fun — to help myself and my friends. Within two days of creating it, one of my friends posted it on reddit and it went completely viral internationally. I went from 10 cases on day one to like … 50,000. All this made me realize that this is bigger than just a side project. It really taps into what people hate: being ripped off. So I&#8217;ve decided to devote all my time to pursuing that over the past six years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Browder tells me these new reporting features are live now, currently work in the top 50-or-so biggest US cities, and are included in DoNotPay&#8217;s standard subscription price ($36 for three months.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter today is introducing a new feature that will allow accounts to self-identify as bots by adding a label to their profile. This feature is designed to help people better differentiate between automated accounts &#8212; like bots that retweet the news, public service announcements or other updates &#8212; from those operated by humans. It&#8217;s not, however, designed to help users identify the &#8220;bad bots,&#8221; which are those that pose as people, often to spread misinformation or spam.</p>
<p>The company has been contemplating labeling bots for years.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RbxNRYWSCL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/3-guiding-principles-for-ceos-who-post-on-twitter/">3 guiding principles for CEOs who post on Twitter</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/twitter-is-considering-badging-bots-as-far-as-we-can-detect-them/">Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was asked</a> during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing whether he believed users had a &#8220;right to know&#8221; if they were speaking to a bot or a human on Twitter&#8217;s platform. He agreed that Twitter should add more context to tweets and was considering identifying bots, to the extent that it could. However, Dorsey also pointed out it would be more difficult to identify bots that were using scripting to give the appearance of being a human, compared with those that were leveraging Twitter&#8217;s API.</p>
<p>Last year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-verification-bots-2021/">finally solidified those plans</a>, saying it would later introduce new features that would allow users to be able to distinguish between human-run accounts and those that were automated. When Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/twitter-opens-account-verification-applications-to-the-public-under-new-guidelines/">launched</a> its account verification system in May, it reminded users that it would soon offer other ways to identify different types of accounts beyond the long-coveted blue badge &#8212; such as labels for bots.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200570" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200570" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2200570" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200570" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Today, Twitter says its new &#8220;Automated Account&#8221; label that identifies &#8220;good bots&#8221; will be made available to over 500 Developer Accounts. This group will test the feature and provide feedback before it&#8217;s opened up more broadly to all Twitter developers. As it&#8217;s still a test for the time being, the label won&#8217;t be required.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, when Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/twitter-rewrites-developer-policy-to-better-support-academic-research-and-use-of-good-bots/">updated its Developer Policy</a> last year, it did ask developers to indicate in their account profile or bio whether the account was a bot, what the account is and who&#8217;s behind it. These account labels would allow developers an easier way to comply with that policy rather than having to handwrite this information in their bio.</p>
<p>Twitter tells TechCrunch that based on what it learns during this experiment, it may decide to make adopting the label a requirement for all developers who run automated accounts in the future, once it becomes broadly available.</p>

<p>To be clear, Twitter doesn&#8217;t have any problem with those who run good bots, as it understands how automation can allow accounts to update people with helpful, relevant or, sometimes, just fun information. The company even celebrated a few of its favorite bots when announcing today&#8217;s developer news, including the public service account <a href="https://twitter.com/earthquakesSF" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/earthquakesSF&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5WDq6vi7Y7nVk5ty0x9z5Bg2PwA">@earthquakesSF</a>; a bot offering COVID-19 updates, <a href="https://twitter.com/vax_progress" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/vax_progress&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYvakD6bj-U6vi7AnMeJNzkf0WuA">@vax_progress</a>; a bot that offers an ongoing breakdown of the last 100 bills introduced in Congress, <a href="https://twitter.com/last100bills" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/last100bills&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5V_BHVBuBJqzqui6U6migBp8Elg">@last100bills</a>; an accessibility-focused bot, <a href="https://twitter.com/alttxtreminder" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/alttxtreminder&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQy3thJB3m9OxdwEEf_Nbu4gbPvA">@AltTxtReminder</a>; and others that just add value in their own way, like <a href="https://twitter.com/met_drawings" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/met_drawings&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNELU1MqaEpv-GENvi0GFP3oTDDFFA">@met_drawings</a>, which shares public domain works from The Met’s Drawings &amp; Prints department, or the goofy <a href="https://twitter.com/EmojiMashupBot" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/EmojiMashupBot&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGchDl4BjnSSP1Pt0bbcP4ufPqh3A">@EmojiMashupBot</a>, among others.</p>
<p>All these will be a part of the initial test group.</p>
<p>Twitter is also less concerned with how consumers may use automation to update their own accounts, perhaps by using third-party tools like IFTTT to post links or other content.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are ultimately responsible for the actions taken with your account, or by applications associated with your account,&#8221; Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-automation">policy</a> advises Twitter users. &#8220;Before authorizing a third-party application to access or use your account, make sure you&#8217;ve thoroughly investigated the application and understand what it will do.&#8221; It also adds that Twitter users that adopt automation will still need to adhere to Twitter&#8217;s guidelines.</p>
<p>The company has been on a tear lately in terms of rolling out new features. Just this week, it has launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-communities/">Communities</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/twitter-users-in-turkey-can-now-emoji-react-to-tweets/">tests of emoji reactions</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/twitter-full-width-image-tweets-test/">support for full-width photos and videos</a> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-tests-a-safety-feature-on-web-to-remove-followers-without-blocking-them/">way to &#8220;soft block&#8221; followers</a>, among other things.</p>
<p>Twitter has not said how long the test would run before the Automated Account labels are rolled out more broadly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The JioPhone Next, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/google-and-jio-platforms-announce-worlds-cheapest-smartphone-jiophone-next/">much-awaited smartphone</a> designed by Google and India&#8217;s Jio Platforms to tap hundreds of millions of users in the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market, won&#8217;t launch on Friday, the Indian technology giant said Thursday midnight.</p>
<p>In a statement issued just now, Jio Platforms said it has been testing the smartphone with a &#8220;limited set of users for further refinement&#8221; and is &#8220;actively working to make it available more widely&#8221; around the time of Diwali festival, which is scheduled for early November.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The Indian firm, which operates the largest telecom network with over 400 million subscribers, blamed global semiconductor shortages for the launch delay and said it expects the additional two months &#8220;will&#8221; mitigate that.</p>
<p>The JioPhone Next smartphone, unveiled in June this year, was scheduled to launch on Friday. Neither of the firms had given any indication in recent days that they may have to postpone the launch. &#8220;The companies remain committed to their vision of opening up new possibilities for millions of Indians, especially those who will experience the internet for the very first time,&#8221; the Indian firm said in a press statement.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169666" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169666" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2169666 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="746" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg?resize=300,149 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg?resize=768,382 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg?resize=680,338 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-jiophone-next.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2169666" class="wp-caption-text">Mukesh Ambani, India&#8217;s richest man and the chairman of Reliance Industries, which operates Jio Platforms, unveiling JioPhone Next at an event in June this year <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jio Platforms</p></div></p>
<p>Powered by &#8220;extremely optimized Android” mobile operating system, the JioPhone Next phone is marketed to be an &#8220;ultra-affordable 4G smartphone&#8221; to tap the roughly 300 million users in India who are still on slower networks. The two firms have said that they plan to eventually launch the smartphone in other markets as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At an event in June, the two firms said the JioPhone Next will feature a “fast, high-quality camera” which will support HDR, and will be protected by the latest Android releases and security updates. It will also ship with a range of features, including Read Aloud and Translate Now that will work with any text on the phone screen, including web pages, apps, messages and even photos, the two firms have said.</p>
<p>Analysts have said in recent weeks that the JioPhone Next &#8212; whose price and tech specifications are yet to be revealed &#8212; could disrupt the Indian smartphone market &#8212; the world&#8217;s second largest &#8212; and help the telecom network further solidify its dominance in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;At present, there are 430 million smartphone users, 115 million JioPhone users [Jio&#8217;s &#8220;smart&#8221; featurephone] and 320 million featurephone (2G) users in India. We believe smartphone users with devices priced above $100 are unlikely to opt for a sub $100 device,&#8221; analysts at Jefferies wrote in a report to clients this week. &#8220;That leaves 25% of smartphone users, i.e. 105 million smartphones, 115 million JioPhone users and 320 million featurephone users as the addressable market for JioPhone Next. Assuming replacement cycle of 2 years for smartphones and 3 years for JioPhone/featurephones, the addressable market for JioPhone Next could be 200m devices annually.&#8221;</p>
<p>The smartphone is the latest collaboration between the two firms. Last year, Google invested <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">$4.5 billion in Jio Platforms</a> and that&#8217;s where it first announced the plans to develop cheap smartphones with the Indian telecom operator. Facebook and scores of other firms have also bought stakes in the Indian firm. Jio Platforms operates a number of businesses, including telecom giant Jio Infocomm, which competes with Airtel and Vodafone Idea; and e-commerce firm JioMart, which competes with Tata-owned BigBasket, SoftBank-backed Grofers and Amazon and Walmart&#8217;s Flipkart.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Southeast Asian tech companies are drawing the attention of investors around the world. In 2020, startups in the region raised over $8.2 billion, about four times more than they did in 2015. This trend continued in 2021, with regional M&amp;A hitting a record high of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/asia-ma-bonanza-fuelled-by-southeast-asia-private-equity-deals-2021-07-01/">$124.8 billion</a> in the first half of 2021, up 83% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>This begs the question: Who exactly is investing in Southeast Asia?</p>
<p>Let’s explore the three key types of investors pouring money into and driving the growth of Southeast Asia’s tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Over 229 family offices have been registered in Singapore since 2020, with total assets under management of an estimated $20 billion.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Big tech</h2>
<p>Southeast Asia has become an attractive market for U.S. and Chinese tech firms. Internet penetration here stands at 70%, higher than the global average, and digital adoption in the region remains nascent — it wasn&#8217;t until the pandemic that adoption of digital services such as e-wallets and online shopping took off.</p>
<p>China’s tech giants Tencent and Alibaba were among the first to support early e-commerce growth in Southeast Asia with investments in Sea Limited and Lazada, and have since expanded their footprint into other internet verticals. Alibaba has backed Akulaku, M-Pay (eMonkey), DANA, Wave Money and Mynt (GCash), while Tencent has invested in Voyager Innovations (PayMaya), SHAREit, iflix, Ookbee and Sanook.</p>
<p>U.S. tech firms have also recently entered the scene. In June 2020, Gojek closed a $3 billion Series F round from Google, Facebook, Tencent and Visa. Google, together with Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, invested some $350 million in Tokopedia in October. Meanwhile, Microsoft invested an undisclosed amount in Grab in 2018 and has invested $100 million in Indonesian e-commerce firm Bukalapak.</p>
<h2>Venture capitalists</h2>
<p>In Q1 2021, Southeast Asian startups raised $6 billion, according to DealStreetAsia, positioning 2021 as another record year for VC investment in the region.</p>
<p>The region is also rising in prominence as a destination for investment capital relative to the rest of Asia. Regional VC investment grew 5.2 times to $8.2 billion in 2020 from $1.6 billion in 2015, as we can see in the table below.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200087" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200087" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2200087" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1.-Venture-Capital-Investment-per-Region.jpg" alt="Venture capital investment by region 2015-2020" width="1024" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1.-Venture-Capital-Investment-per-Region.jpg 1132w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1.-Venture-Capital-Investment-per-Region.jpg?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1.-Venture-Capital-Investment-per-Region.jpg?resize=300,112 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1.-Venture-Capital-Investment-per-Region.jpg?resize=768,288 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1.-Venture-Capital-Investment-per-Region.jpg?resize=680,255 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1.-Venture-Capital-Investment-per-Region.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200087" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jungle VC</p></div></p>
<p>Southeast Asia also has many opportunities for VC investment relative to its market size. From 2015 to 2020, China saw VC investment of nearly $300 per person; for Southeast Asia — despite a recent investment boom — this metric sits at just $47.50 per person, or just a sixth of that in China. This implies a substantial opportunity for investments to develop the region’s digital economy.</p>
<p>The region’s rising population and growth prospects are higher due to China’s population growth challenges, alongside the latter’s higher digital economy market saturation and maturity.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A battle between <a href="http://box.com">Box</a> and its majority shareholder <a href="https://www.starboardvalue.com/">Starboard Value</a> over control of the board ended today when the company&#8217;s slate of directors easily defeated Starboard&#8217;s. It culminated months of maneuvering on both sides as they battled for control of the company.</p>
<p>Box, in <a href="https://www.boxinvestorrelations.com/news-and-media/news/press-release-details/2021/Stockholders-Re-Elect-All-Box-Director-Nominees-at-2021-Annual-Meeting/default.aspx">a somewhat generic statement</a>, expressed gratitude for the results:</p>
<blockquote><p>Box appreciates the support and perspectives we have received from our stockholders throughout this process. The Board and management team will remain focused on continuing to transform Box and executing Box’s strategy to grow profitably and deliver significant value to all Box stockholders.</p></blockquote>
<p>Starboard on the other hand, as you might expect, was unhappy with the outcome and didn&#8217;t hide that in <a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/Board+Changes/Starboard+Delivers+Open+Letter+To+Box+%28BOX%29+Stockholders/18922324.html">a letter to shareholders</a> released earlier today.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are certainly disappointed by the results of this election, which were heavily skewed by the voting rights tied to the preferred equity financing and the use of stockholder capital to aggressively repurchase shares ahead of the record date from stockholders likely to support change. At this juncture, the future of Box is in the Board&#8217;s hands, and there is a significant amount of work left to be done. Many commitments have been made, and we hope that Box will finally be able to follow through on its promises to drive improved results, accountability, governance, and compensation practices,&#8221; managing director Peter A. Feld wrote in the letter.</p>
<p>This all began when Starboard Value invested in Box, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starboard-value-takes-7-5-stake-in-box/">taking a 7.5% stake</a>, which would eventually grow to 8.8% in the company. With that stake, it became one of the largest shareholder, but it remained relatively quiet until March of this year. That is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">when public rumblings began</a> that Starboard was unhappy with the direction of the company, a conflict that could have ultimately resulted in the ouster of founder and CEO Aaron Levie or the sale of Box.</p>

<p>The situation took an interesting turn when Box announced it was taking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/">a $500 million investment from KKR,</a> a move that Starboard took great exception to and made clear <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/starboard-value-puts-box-on-notice-that-its-looking-to-take-over-board/">in a letter published</a> at the beginning of May that it wanted significant changes to take place. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/starboard-value-puts-box-on-notice-that-its-looking-to-take-over-board/">we wrote at the time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While they couched the letter in mostly polite language, it’s quite clear Starboard is exasperated with Box. “While we appreciate the dialogue we have had with Box’s management team and Board of Directors (the “Board”) over the past two years, we have grown increasingly frustrated with continued poor results, questionable capital allocation decisions, and subpar shareholder returns,” Starboard wrote in its letter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Less than a week later Starboard <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/activist-investor-starboard-value-makes-official-bid-for-box-board-seats-in-letter/">made a move for board seats</a> and the battle was on for control. Box&#8217;s position was strengthened <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/box-beats-expectations-raises-guidance-as-it-looks-for-a-comeback/">by two decent earnings reports</a> prior to the vote; the company took the unusual move <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/box-reports-earnings-early-to-give-shareholders-time-to-review-financials-ahead-of-board-vote/">of delivering the results early</a> in order to give the voters that information prior to the vote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also made the unusual move of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/box-takes-fight-with-activist-investor-public-in-sec-filing/">filing a document with the SEC</a> that pushed back against Starboard&#8217;s slate of candidates. In the end, Box won the battle. Alan Pelz-Sharpe, founder and principal analyst at Deep Analysis, who has been watching the content management space where Box operates for years, sees this as a victory for Levie and Box.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not a surprise to me that Box won the day. In my opinion, Starboard misread and underestimated the loyalty that Aaron Levie generates. The fact is that to most Box employees and investors, the company is a success story, and they also know that the customer base is pretty engaged and that there is plenty of room for future growth,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Box this vote of confidence will mean that they can (if they want) make some acquisitions and invest more in R&amp;D moving forward, without constantly having an aggressive investor looking over their shoulder,&#8221; Pelz-Sharpe added.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to know what happens next, but Starboard still maintains its shares for now, and it still has some clout in those numbers. Throughout its ownership tenure, Box has performed better, as the recent earnings results have shown, and the firm says that this remains the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we have repeatedly stated, our only goal has been to help Box perform better and adopt best-in-class practices across operating performance, financial results, governance and compensation in order to create long-term value for the benefit of all stockholders. We will continue to monitor progress at Box, and we hope to see the company embrace the changes catalyzed by our involvement and create long-term value,&#8221; Starboard&#8217;s Feld wrote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Houseparty, the social video chat app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/fortnite-maker-epic-acquires-social-video-app-houseparty/">acquired</a> by Fortnite maker Epic Games <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/epic-games-paid-35-million-for-houseparty-in-2019-2020-5">for a reported $35 million</a> back in 2019, is shutting down. The company <a href="https://houseparty.com/blog/saying-goodbye-to-houseparty/">says</a> Houseparty will be discontinued in October when the app will stop functioning for its existing users; it will be pulled from the app stores today, however. Related to this move, Epic Games&#8217; &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/houseparty-adds-fortnite-mode-bringing-video-chat-to-the-popular-game/">Fortnite Mode&#8221; feature</a>, which leveraged Houseparty to bring video chat to Fortnite gamers, will also be discontinued.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, Houseparty offered a way for users to participate in group video chats with friends and even play games, like Uno, trivia, Heads Up and others. Last year, Epic Games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/houseparty-adds-fortnite-mode-bringing-video-chat-to-the-popular-game/">integrated</a> Houseparty with Fortnite, initially to allow gamers to see live feeds from friends while gaming, then later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/fortnite-users-can-now-live-stream-gameplay-to-housepartys-social-video-app/">adding support</a> to livestream gameplay directly into Houseparty. At the time, these integrations appeared to be the end goal that explained why Epic Games had bought the social startup in the first place.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;8 investors discuss social gaming&#8217;s biggest opportunities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/8-investors-discuss-social-gamings-biggest-opportunities/embed/#?secret=tHhmV96iAI" data-secret="tHhmV96iAI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now, just over two years after the acquisition was announced, and less than half a year since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/fortnite-users-can-now-live-stream-gameplay-to-housepartys-social-video-app/">support for livestreaming</a> was added to the app, Houseparty is shutting down.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t offer any solid insight into what, at first glance, feels like an admission of failure to capitalize on its acquisition. But the reality is that Epic Games may have something larger in store beyond just video chat. That said, all Epic Games would say today is that the Houseparty team could no longer give the app the attention it required &#8212; a statement that indicates an executive decision to shift the team&#8217;s focus to other matters.</p>
<p>While none of the Houseparty team members are being let go as a result of this move, we&#8217;re told, they will be joining other teams where they will work on new ways to allow for &#8220;social interactions&#8221; across the Epic Games family of products. The company&#8217;s announcement hinted that those social features would be designed and built at the &#8220;metaverse scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;metaverse&#8221; is an increasingly used buzzword that references a shared virtual environment, like those provided by large-scale online gaming platforms such as Fortnite, Roblox and others. Facebook, too, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/">claims the metaverse</a> is the next big gambit for social networking, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg having described it as an &#8220;embodied internet that you&#8217;re inside of rather than just looking at.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To some extent, Fortnite has begun to embrace the metaverse by offering non-gaming experiences like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/fortnite-hosted-a-psychedelic-travis-scott-concert-and-12-3m-people-watched/">online</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/fortnite-ariana-grande-concert-metaverse/">concerts</a> you attend as your avatar, and other live events. Ahead of its shutdown, Houseparty also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/houseparty-expands-beyond-video-chat-with-co-watching-of-live-events/">toyed with live events</a> that users would co-watch and participate in alongside their friends.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">3/6 The metaverse vision and products we’re working on at <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EpicGames</a> are also about shared experiences, but in a more rich form than 2D video &#8212; one that&#39;s better positioned to shape the next generation of the internet.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>An Epic Games spokesperson tells TechCrunch the Houseparty team has worked on (and continues to work on) a number of other projects that focus on social. But some of the &#8220;multiple, larger projects&#8221; Epic Games has in the works remain undisclosed, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>In terms of social products, Houseparty&#8217;s technology now underpins all of Fortnite voice chat and the features they built are widely available for free to developers through <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-online-services-launches-free-in-game-voice-and-easy-anti-cheat">Epic Games Services</a>. They also worked on building out new social experiences, which have ranged from the social RSVP functions for Fortnite&#8217;s global events, like the recent Ariana Grande concert, to the upcoming <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/prepare-for-the-end-of-chapter-2-season-7-in-the-finale-event-operation-sky-fire">&#8220;Operation: Sky Fire&#8221; event</a> for collaborating quests and other game mechanics. More social functionality and new experiences are also being built into Fortnite&#8217;s user-generated content platform, Create Mode.</p>
<p>While it may seem odd to close an app that only last year experienced a boost in usage due to the pandemic, it appears the COVID bump didn&#8217;t have staying power.</p>
<p>At the height of lockdowns, Houseparty had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/houseparty-reports-50m-sign-ups-in-past-month-amid-covid-19-lockdowns/">reported it had gained 50 million new sign-ups</a> in a month&#8217;s time as users looked to video apps to connect with family and friends while the world was shut down. But as the pandemic wore on, other video chat experiences gained more ground. Zoom, which had established itself as an essential tool for remote work, became a tool for<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/covid-s-remote-parties-allowed-us-celebrate-all-our-dearest-ncna1263552"> hanging out with friends</a> after-hours, as well. Facebook also started to eat Houseparty&#8217;s lunch with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/faceboo-launches-drop-in-video-chat-rooms-to-rival-houseparty/">its debut of drop-in video chat &#8220;Rooms&#8221; last year,</a> which offered a similar group video experience. And bored users shifted to audio-based social networking on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/">apps like Clubhouse</a> or Twitter Spaces.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200392" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200392" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2200392" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Houseparty-quarterly-downloads.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="481" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Houseparty-quarterly-downloads.png 1150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Houseparty-quarterly-downloads.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Houseparty-quarterly-downloads.png?resize=300,212 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Houseparty-quarterly-downloads.png?resize=768,543 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Houseparty-quarterly-downloads.png?resize=680,481 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Houseparty-quarterly-downloads.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200392" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apptopia</p></div></p>
<p>According to data from <a href="https://apptopia.com/">Apptopia</a>, Houseparty has been continually declining since the pandemic bump. To date, its app has seen a total of 111 million downloads across iOS and Android, with the majority (63 million) on iOS. The U.S. was Houseparty&#8217;s largest market, accounting for 43.4% of downloads, followed by the U.K. (9.8%), then Germany (5.6%).</p>
<p>Epic Games, meanwhile, said the app served &#8220;tens of millions&#8221; of users worldwide. It insists the closure wasn&#8217;t decided lightly, nor was the decision to shutter &#8220;Fortnite Mode&#8221; made due to lack of adoption.</p>
<p>Houseparty will alert users to the shutdown via in-app notifications ahead of its final closure in October. At that point, Fortnite Mode will also no longer be available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, as part of a private event, this editor was afforded the opportunity to talk with some of the biggest names in the world of private equity, including Carlyle co-founder David Rubenstein; Bain Capital co-chair Steve Pagliuca; Jean Salata, the CEO and founding partner of Baring Private Equity Asia; and Sheila Patel, the vice chairman of B Capital Group AGM and formerly the chair of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.</p>
<p>We covered a lot of ground, from how interested Carlyle and the other firms are in blockchain technologies (the feedback here was a little mixed), to how focused they are on sustainable and socially responsible investing. On this front, Rubenstein claimed that &#8220;private equity people are very focused on it,&#8221; and predicted that when a financial metric emerges to better assess companies on this front &#8220;within the next five years,&#8221; it will become a routine factor in evaluating companies.</p>
<p>Patel &#8212; who previously served on Goldman&#8217;s inclusion and diversity committee &#8212; agreed, noting upward of one-third of investors right now find it impossible to measure so-called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-criteria.asp">ESG </a>criteria (though she expects this to change quickly).</p>
<p>Naturally, too, we discussed the current market, including how the investors differentiate their firms&#8217; offerings when everyone these days has a money cannon &#8212; and how long they expect to be operating at hyperspeed. In feedback that might surprise some readers and will seem obvious to others, the PE execs suggested that this go-go market could easily continue into 2023, if not beyond.</p>
<p>Only attendees of the event will have access to the full interview, but some notes from this last part of our discussion follow:</p>
<h3><strong>Steve</strong> Pagliuca:</h3>
<p>[P]art of the reason we&#8217;re doing so well has been massive government intervention, which I think was warranted. As that starts to wane, we may see an effect from that. The unemployment rate right now is just over 5.2%, which is, to me, astounding in the middle of a pandemic, and it looks like there are lots of jobs out there still unfilled. Part of that is because the [government] payments came out, and less workers were looking for work, so we might see unemployment continue to go down as those payments stop, and the impact of that is going to be a key issue.</p>
<h3><strong>David</strong> Rubenstein:</h3>
<p>They say this is the best of times and the worst of times. It&#8217;s the best of times for investors, because if you&#8217;re in the tech world, if you&#8217;re in the investing world and you&#8217;re investing in India, China and the United States, you&#8217;ve made a lot of money and you&#8217;re beginning to think you&#8217;re a genius because you made so much money, and you just don&#8217;t realize that it&#8217;s the worst of times for people that don&#8217;t have internet access, [or who] work with their hands and not with their minds as much, [or who] aren&#8217;t educated [or] have childcare [needs]. Really, in the United States and probably other parts of the world, we are further and further creating [an] economic divide unfortunately and greater income inequality and a lack of social mobility, and that&#8217;s a real problem.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For those for whom it&#8217;s been the best of times, eventually something will end. At some point, the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates &#8212;  probably not until 2023, but maybe before &#8212; and at some point, people begin to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m taking more of my chips off the table. I&#8217;m not going to invest as much at these valuations.&#8221; I just got off a call this morning [regarding] a small deal in Asia where people want to pay things like 25 times projected revenues.</p>
<h3><strong> Jean</strong> Salata:</h3>
<p>You cannot separate the context of where we are with interest rates from where valuations are. At some point, interest rates are going to go up, but at the moment, what we have is a Fed that has bought something like $4 trillion worth of bonds over the last 18 months. I think right now, $120 billion a month is going into the system, which is depressing rates. [Meanwhile] people need to find a home for their investments to generate some kind of return, [meaning] pension funds, endowments, individual investors.</p>
<p>If you look at valuations today, they&#8217;re probably in the 99th percentile or near the peak as far as multiples go. But if you look at them relative to the rates and earnings yield, less the say the 10-year [Treasury] rate, I think that&#8217;s probably only in the 20th or the 30th percentile &#8212;  it&#8217;s something like that. And as I look back to 1999 and 2000, which I lived through and barely survived, the difference today is that although valuations are similar in terms of the frothiness, in terms of multiples, [that] interest rates back then were about 5% or 6%, and today, they&#8217;re 1%. That is a big difference.</p>
<p>There are also structural things going on, and it comes back to this point about income inequality, which is a big issue everywhere in the world, including in China, by the way, and is self-perpetuating. People with financial assets are benefiting from what&#8217;s going on with [the Federal Reserve&#8217;s bond purchases]. Valuations are rising, and then the people who have all that money save more, so savings rates are going up, and as you save more because you don&#8217;t need to spend that much money, [that cycle] depresses rates even further. [So] I believe that even when the Fed starts to taper off and starts reducing [how much it&#8217;s spending on bonds], you&#8217;ll see rates staying lower than they have been in the past, which could support higher valuations levels for quite some time.</p>
<h3><strong>Steve</strong> Pagliuca:</h3>
<p>If you look at the ballooning national debt, if you applied a 5.5% interest rate to that, the interest that the government would be paying would be close to half the budget. So I just don&#8217;t see the politicians saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to [raise interest] rates really high.&#8221; Instead, they&#8217;re going to keep them down as long as they can, because the taxes will go up enormously if rates go back to historic [levels]. They can handle the spending because rates are so low, so you&#8217;re going to [continue to] see low interest rate trends, which props up these valuations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The aviation industry is notoriously difficult to decarbonize, in part because airplanes use a petroleum-based fuel to fly.</p>
<p>Alder Fuels wants to change that. The new clean tech company, headed by Bryan Sherbacow, is developing a low-carbon jet fuel that can be used as a 100% drop-in replacement for petroleum fuel, without needing to adapt existing aircraft or engines. That&#8217;s notable because the only commercially available sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) still requires a 50-50 blend with conventional fuel.</p>
<p>The technology has piqued the interest of the aviation industry. Alder Fuels said Thursday it has inked a multimillion dollar investment from aviation giants United and Honeywell — as well as a purchase agreement from United for 1.5 billion gallons of fuel, the largest known agreement for SAF in aviation history.</p>
<p>United consumes around 4 billion gallons of fuel per year, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch, so the purchase agreement would account for nearly 40% of the airline&#8217;s overall annual fuel consumption.</p>
<p>Before the fuel starts powering United airplanes, it must meet specifications outlined by ASTM International, an international organization that sets the standards for a wide range of materials and products. From there, Alder and Honeywell expect to commercialize the technology by 2025.</p>
<p>Alder Fuels was formally launched earlier this year, but Sherbacow has been assessing the technology for around five years, he said in a recent interview with TechCrunch. It became clear through his previous work that the technology behind the low-carbon fuel — and especially the raw materials — needed to be scalable and widely available.</p>
<p>“What we&#8217;re all looking for is [ … ] how do you access these carbon oil precursors and efficiently convert them into something that works within the existing refining infrastructure?” Sherbacow said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To solve that problem, he’s turned to carbon-rich woody biomass, like agricultural waste, which is turned into crude oil that can be used to make aviation fuel. The company uses a pyrolysis-based technology that transforms the biomass into a liquid and treats it in such a way that it can be put into existing refineries. Alder Fuels will initially use Honeywell’s proprietary “Ecofining” hydroprocessing technology. The ultimate aim is to make the new fuel compatible with all refining assets.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s significant amount of [woody biomass] that&#8217;s already industrially aggregated but has either no or very low economic value today,” Sherbacow explained. “But it’s a great opportunity for us because it&#8217;s a store of carbon that we can utilize.” It could even open up new markets for companies in forestry, agriculture and even the paper industry, which are already generating plenty of biowaste.</p>
<p>Alder Fuels&#8217; research is supported by the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency and the Department of Energy, and Sherbacow stressed the importance of public-private partnerships to decarbonizing the aviation industry. Climate change has been of particular interest to President Joe Biden’s administration, and incentives for sustainable aviation fuel will likely end up in the $3.5 trillion spending bill currently being debated by Congress.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s one of the roles of government … to help the transition,” he said. “You need to incentivize the incumbents to change their behavior, or they&#8217;re going to resist a disruptive change.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM has extended a shutdown at its Orion Assembly Plant another two weeks due to a battery pack shortage related to the widespread Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV safety recall.</p>
<p>GM said the extended downtime at the Orion plant will last through September 20. Orion Assembly Plant in Michigan has been shut down since August 23.</p>
<p>The recall, which now includes all Chevy Bolt EV and EUV models made since 2017, was issued after the automaker discovered two manufacturing defects in the battery cell that could increase the risk of fire. The possible fire risk prompted GM to recommend Bolt owners set the vehicle to a 90% state of charge limitation and avoid depleting the battery below 70 miles of range. The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/nhtsa-urges-some-chevy-bolt-owners-to-park-their-car-away-from-home-citing-fire-risk/">recommends</a> Bolt drivers park their vehicles away from their homes to reduce fire risk.</p>
<p>The automaker said it is working with its supplier LG Chem to &#8220;update manufacturing processes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orion was initially shuttered in August because of a shortage of semiconductor chips. GM later notified employees that the plant would continue to be down because of a shortage of batteries related to the recall.</p>
<p>The recall is expected to cost GM $1.8 billion. A GM spokesperson did not provide an update on whether this extended downtime would push that number higher. The automaker has said it will seek reimbursement from LG Chem.</p>
<h2>Chip shortages</h2>
<p>While the global shortage of semiconductor chips has persisted, GM said it will be able to resume production at several of its plants over the next two weeks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Full production will begin at its Fort Wayne Assembly and Silao Assembly plants, which produces the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 models, beginning September 13 after being briefly impacted by the global semiconductor shortage, GM said.</p>
<p>All of GM’s full-size truck and full-size SUV plants in North American will be running full production next week.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee will resume production of the GMC Acadia and Cadillac XT5 and XT6 on September 20, after being shuttered since mid-July. That plant will be shut down again as part of a previously scheduled extended downtime beginning the week of September 27 through the week of November 22 for new-model tooling installation.</p>
<p>Cadillac XT4 production, which has been down since February 8, will resume at the Fairfax Assembly in Kansas. GM said production of the Chevrolet Malibu, which is also at Fairfax, will remain down.</p>
<p>The company extended downtimes by one week at Lansing Delta Township and Wentzville, along with an additional week of Chevrolet Blazer production downtime at its Ramos facility.</p>

		<a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/siegfried-glenzer">Siegfried Glenzer</a>, a recipient of the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, is a professor and high-energy-density division director at Stanford’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and a science adviser for nuclear fusion company <a href="https://marvelfusion.com/">Marvel Fusion</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The quest to make fusion power a reality recently took a massive step forward. <a href="https://www.powermag.com/breakthrough-laser-powered-fusion-experiment-nears-ignition/">The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory announced the results</a> of an experiment with an unprecedented high fusion yield. A single laser shot initiated reactions that released 1.3 megajoules of fusion yield energy with signatures of propagating nuclear burn.</p>
<p>Reaching this milestone indicates just how close fusion actually is to achieving power production. The latest results demonstrate the rapid pace of progress — especially as lasers are evolving at breathtaking speed.</p>
<p>Indeed, the laser is one of the most impactful technological inventions since the end of World War II. Finding widespread use in an incredibly diverse range of applications — including machining, precision surgery and consumer electronics — lasers are an essential part of everyday life. Few know, however, that lasers are also heralding an exciting and entirely new chapter in physics: enabling controlled nuclear fusion with positive energy gain.</p>
<p>After six decades of innovation, lasers are now assisting us in the urgent process of developing clean, dense and efficient fuels, which, in turn, are needed to help solve the world’s energy crisis through large-scale decarbonized energy production. The peak power attainable in a laser pulse has increased every decade by a factor of 1,000.</p>
<p>Physicists recently conducted a fusion experiment that produced 1,500 terawatts of power. For a short period of time, this generated four to five times more energy than what the whole world consumes at a given moment. In other words, we are already able to produce vast amounts of power. Now we also need to produce vast amounts of energy so as to offset the energy expended to drive the igniting lasers.</p>
<p>Beyond lasers, there are also considerable advances on the target side. The recent use of nanostructure targets allows for more efficient absorption of laser energies and ignition of the fuel. This has only been possible for a few years, but here, too, technological innovation is on a steep incline with tremendous advancement from year to year.</p>
<p>In the face of such progress, you may wonder what is still holding us back from making commercial fusion a reality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There remain two significant challenges: First, we need to bring the pieces together and create an integrated process that satisfies all the physical and technoeconomic requirements. Second, we require sustainable levels of investment from private and public sources to do so. Generally speaking, the field of fusion is woefully underfunded. This is shocking given the potential of fusion, especially in comparison to other energy technologies.</p>
<p>Investments in clean energy amounted to more than <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/energy-transition-investment-hit-500-billion-in-2020-for-first-time/">$500 billion in 2020</a>. The funds that go into fusion research and development are only a fraction of that. There are countless brilliant scientists working in the sector already, as well as eager students wishing to enter the field. And, of course, we have excellent government research labs. Collectively, researchers and students believe in the power and potential of controlled nuclear fusion. We should ensure financial support for their work to make this vision a reality.</p>
<p>What we need now is an expansion of public and private investment that does justice to the opportunity at hand. Such investments may have a longer time horizon, but their eventual impact is without parallel. I believe that net-energy gain is within reach in the next decade; commercialization, based on early prototypes, will follow in very short order.</p>
<p>But such timelines are heavily dependent on funding and the availability of resources. Considerable investment is being allocated to alternative energy sources — wind, solar, etc. — but fusion must have a place in the global energy equation. This is especially true as we approach the critical breakthrough moment.</p>
<p>If laser-driven nuclear fusion is perfected and commercialized, it has the potential to become the energy source of choice, displacing the many existing, less ideal energy sources. This is because fusion, if done correctly, offers energy that is in equal parts clean, safe and affordable. I am convinced that fusion power plants will eventually replace most conventional power plants and related large-scale energy infrastructure that are still so dominant today. There will be no need for coal or gas.</p>
<p>The ongoing optimization of the fusion process, which results in higher yields and lower costs, promises energy production at much below the current price point. At the limit, this corresponds to a source of unlimited energy. If you have unlimited energy, then you also have unlimited possibilities. What can you do with it? I foresee reversing climate change by taking out the carbon dioxide we have put into the atmosphere over the last 150 years.</p>
<p>With a future empowered by fusion technology, you would also be able to use energy to desalinate water, creating unlimited water resources that would have an enormous impact in arid and desert regions. All in all, fusion enables better societies, keeping them sustainable and clean rather than dependent on destructive, dirty energy sources and related infrastructures.</p>
<p>Through years of dedicated research at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the National Ignition Facility, I was privileged to witness and lead the first inertial confinement fusion experiments. I saw the seed of something remarkable being planted and taking root. I have never been more excited than I am now to see the fruits of laser technology harvested for the empowerment and advancement of humankind.</p>
<p>My fellow scientists and students are committed to moving fusion from the realm of tangibility into that of reality, but this will require a level of trust and help. A small investment today will have a big impact toward providing a much needed, more welcome energy alternative in the global arena.</p>
<p>I am betting on the side of optimism and science, and I hope that others will have the courage to do so, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://supabase.io">Supabase</a>, the backend-as-a-service startup, announced this week that it raised a $30 million Series A.</p>
<p>Supabase is often described as an open source alternative to Google&#8217;s Firebase &#8230; which is a pretty good way to put it for those who know what Firebase is. For those who don&#8217;t: Supabase is a collection of tools that helps developers build projects more quickly by automatically handling a whole lot of the behind-the-scenes work and wiring.</p>
<p>Create a project, and Supabase will give you a Postgres database; an API for interacting with said database that automatically evolves (and documents itself!) as your database changes; a user authentication system that plays friendly with the popular login providers (Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, etc.); a storage system for handling things like image and video uploads; and a UI for overseeing and managing it all. It takes a bunch of work you&#8217;d need to do to build just about any modern app or service and waves it away with a couple of clicks.</p>
<p>Supabase is free for hobby projects (or when you just want to tinker with it). Once you start needing bigger databases or data backups, the price scales starting at $25 per project per month. Alternatively, you can <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/guides/self-hosting">deploy it yourself</a>, though that&#8217;s a bit tougher and currently means losing the management UI.</p>
<p>This Series A comes pretty quickly following the company&#8217;s last raise — a $6 million round announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/supabase-raises-6m-for-its-open-source-firebase-alternative/">in December 2020</a>. I&#8217;m told this round was funded predominantly by Coatue, with some of it reserved for a few new key angel investors, including GitHub co-founder Tom Preston-Werner, PagerDuty co-founder Alex Solomon and Docker co-founder Solomon Hykes.</p>
<p>Supabase co-founder Paul Copplestone tells me that the team is now made up of 24 people, distributed all over the world. &#8220;We were born remote,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This reasoning is twofold: The company started growing just as the pandemic began to spread, and it&#8217;s largely hiring people who are already working on and contributing to the tools that make Supabase possible. Why make them move around the world when they&#8217;re already doing a good job?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We use, I think, six different tools,&#8221; Copplestone said. &#8220;And we employ lead maintainers of several of those tools. We employ open source contributors, anyone who&#8217;s contributing, no matter where they live.&#8221;</p>
<p>Supabase was part of Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2020 class, the accelerator&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">first cohort to be entirely remote.</a> Meanwhile, YC classes are growing increasingly large; the S20 batch, for example, came in at over 200 companies. It can be hard to stand out in a group like that, but Supabase seemed to do it — I was hearing chatter about them early and often.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what it looks like to fire up a Supabase backend:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Plentywaka, a combination of English and Nigerian that means “plenty movement," has big plans to ameliorate the public transport infrastructure in Africa and beyond. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Plentywaka wants to change the way Africans move. It&#8217;s starting with one of the busiest cities on the continent.</p>
<p>The startup, a ride-share and bus-booking platform, is based in Lagos, the Nigerian city where 20 million people and <a href="https://www.afd.fr/en/carte-des-projets/improve-public-transport-lagos-metropolitan-area">45% of the country&#8217;s skilled workforce</a> live. The public transportation system strains under the weight of 14 million commuters who use it daily.</p>
<p>Relying on the public bus can be more than unpredictable — it also can be dangerous, according to Onyeka Akumah, co-founder and CEO of Plentywaka. The buses are often old, in disrepair and packed beyond safe limits; traffic congestion turns what should be a 30-minute commute into a three-hour journey.</p>
<p>Plentywaka, a combination of English and Nigerian that means “plenty movement,&#8221; was founded in 2019. While it&#8217;s still young, the startup has big plans to ameliorate the public transport infrastructure in Africa and beyond.</p>
<p>Plentywaka has two models. “Daily Waka” offers riders in a city fixed daily routes from bus stop to bus stop. Riders can view the schedule of buses, how many seats are available and reserve seats via the app, which tracks the movements of SUVs, minivans, vans and buses driven by gig workers, also known as “heroes.” When the bus arrives, riders can check in with a QR code, and when they hop off, the app automatically charges the rider via a wallet system.</p>
<p>&#8220;Travel Waka&#8221; is a newer model that offers interstate travel. It basically serves as a booking engine for other bus companies that offer city-to-city services.</p>
<p>In March this year, Plentywaka was accepted into the Techstars Toronto accelerator program, securing funding as it looks toward global expansion across Africa and into Canada. Just this month, the company also announced expansion plans into Ghana via an acquisition of Star Bus.</p>
<p>Akumah talks us through what the TechStars funding means to Plentywaka, the startup landscape in Africa and tips for African startups looking for investors.</p>
<p><i>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p>
<p><strong>Before founding Plentywaka, you were the CEO of Farmcrowdy, another startup that connected investors to farmers via a digital platform. What was the impetus for starting a second business? Are you a serial entrepreneur, or do you plan on sticking with this one?</strong></p>
<p>I was the CEO of Farmcrowdy until the end of May this year, but I&#8217;ve handed it over to my other co-founder who is now the CEO, so I&#8217;m fully focused on Plentywaka now. We started Plentywaka in January 2019. I was flying back from Qatar, where I spoke at an event, and landed in Lagos around 8:15 a.m. that day. I had to be at a meeting by 10 a.m., and going through traffic in Lagos is a pain. The state has 20 million people and everybody&#8217;s rushing to work, so I had to abandon my car and take two bikes to make that meeting. When that was done, to make another meeting, I had to take a boat ride across the lagoon. I tweeted about it saying, &#8220;Today, I have flown, I have used two bikes and now I&#8217;m on a boat ride. This is the life of an entrepreneur in Lagos.&#8221;</p>
<p>What I wasn&#8217;t prepared for was the shock my colleagues gave me when they said we should experiment with taking the bus. I hadn&#8217;t taken the bus in about 15 years, and I took that trip and had a panic attack. I never knew how frightened I would be getting on a 30-year-old bus with torn-out parts and worn-out chairs. I literally had to hold one of the doors throughout the trip from falling off. That was the day the concept of Plentywaka started.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku&#8217;s expansion into original content continues with news that the streaming platform and device maker will debut its first original feature-length film during the 2021 holiday season. In partnership with Lionsgate, Roku announced it will introduce a movie based on the Emmy-winning TV series &#8220;Zoey&#8217;s Extraordinary Playlist,&#8221; which will air on its free streaming hub, The Roku Channel, later this year.</p>
<p>The new movie, &#8220;Zoey&#8217;s Extraordinary Christmas,&#8221; will continue where the series left off following its season 2 finale and series cancellation, which <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2569985/zoeys-extraordinary-playlist-cast-options-expired-fans-upset-jane-levy">had upset fans</a> who had taken to social media in hopes of saving the show by finding it a new home. Roku, as it turns out, is that home &#8212; not only will it air the new film, it will also make all 25 episodes of the series available to stream for free on The Roku Channel in the U.S. later this fall.</p>
<p>The feature film, meanwhile, begins production this month in Vancouver and will see a number of actors reprising their roles, including Jane Levy, Skylar Astin, Alex Newell, John Clarence Stewart, Andrew Leeds, Alice Lee, Michael Thomas Grant, Kapil Talwalkar, David St. Louis, Mary Steenburgen, Peter Gallagher and Bernadette Peters. Details of the film&#8217;s plot are still limited, however, noting only that it will be a continuation of Zoey&#8217;s journey as she &#8220;navigates work, family, love and everything in between.&#8221;</p>
<p>While a significant move for fans who simply wanted more of their favorite show, it&#8217;s a bigger step forward for Roku and its original content strategy. The company had already tested consumers&#8217; appetite for original series by acquiring the content catalog from the short-lived streaming service Quibi earlier this year, whose shows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/roku-launches-an-original-programming-lineup-fueled-by-quibis-content/">then launched to The Roku Channel</a> as the company&#8217;s first set of Roku Originals. The debut lineup included 30 titles, but Roku is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/quibis-content-is-coming-to-roku-as-roku-originals-will-kick-off-rokus-investment-in-original-content/">continuing</a> to roll out more shows as the year progresses. Last month, for instance, it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/09/roku-adds-23-more-quibi-shows-as-it-pursues-original-content-strategy.html">released</a> 23 more of those shows to its collection.  The company also recently decided to reinvest in at least one previously Quibi-owned series by greenlighting a <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/roku-most-dangerous-game-renewed-season-2-1235000929/">second season of &#8220;Most Dangerous Game.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>But until now, Roku has not invested in full-length movies.</p>
<p>Movies make a good fit for The Roku Channel, of course, as the free streaming is supported by advertising &#8212; and movies, due to their length, offer more ad slots to be filled. In fact, The Roku Channel got its start as a free movies hub, before later expanding to include TV shows and other types of content, like news and sports.</p>
<p>So far, Roku&#8217;s original programming seems to be connecting with viewers. The company says its top 5 streamed TV shows this summer (May 20-July 18) were all Roku Originals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new film is produced by Lionsgate in association with the Tannenbaum Company, Feigco Entertainment and Universal Music Group’s Polygram Entertainment and Zihuatenejo Productions. The series creator Austin Winsberg will write and executive produce. Richard Shepard, who filmed the show&#8217;s pilot, will direct. Kim Tannenbaum, Eric Tannenbaum, Paul Feig, David Blackman and Daniel Inkeles will also serve as executive producers.</p>
<p>The movie will air on The Roku Channel during the holidays in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford has hired six senior-level executives to its newly minted commercial vehicles and services business unit as the automaker prepares to bring to market the E-Transit cargo van and the F-150 Lightning Pro pickup truck  — two electric vehicles it&#8217;s betting will become commercial customers&#8217; new workhorses.</p>
<p>Ford pulled from within its ranks and outside the company to fill out the leadership team for the new business unit, Ford Pro. Among the new hires is Muffi Ghadiali, the CEO of Electriphi, the battery management and fleet monitoring software startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/ford-acquires-electriphi-as-it-prepares-to-woo-ev-fleet-customers/">Ford acquired in June</a>. Ghadiali will continue to serve in his role with Electriphi and head up Ford Pro&#8217;s charging department.</p>
<p>Ford also hired Tim Baughman, Ford&#8217;s former controller for U.S. marketing, sales and service, to be the general manager of Ford Pro North America. Ford Pro&#8217;s new CFO will be Navin Kumar, who was previously at Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC.</p>
<p>Tracey Pass, who comes from The Walt Disney Company, has been hired as the chief human resources officer, and Rahul Singh, who was head of software development for Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC, is the unit&#8217;s CTO. Wanda Young, chief marketing officer of Samsung Electronics America, has taken a similar position at Ford Pro.</p>
<p>Ford previously announced that Hans Schep will be the general manager of Ford Pro Europe.</p>
<p>Ford Pro is focused on more than just commercial vans. The division, led by Ted Cannis, aims to sell fleet management, maintenance and charging services to commercial clients as well. Ford Pro has said it expects to<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> generate $45 billion in revenue from hardware and adjacent and new services by 2025 — up from $27 billion in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">That&#8217;s a hefty hike in revenue and a target that Ford plans to meet by selling a mix of combustion-engine, hybrid, and soon all-electric versions of its vans and </span>full-size pickup trucks; and offering depot and home charging for the EVs, digital services for customers to manage and maintain their fleets, a network of service centers, and, of course, financing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ford&#8217;s commercial vehicle business has a head start in Europe, where it has been the leading commercial vehicle brand for six consecutive years. In North America, Ford&#8217;s share of Class 1 through Class 7 full-size commercial trucks and vans exceeds 40%, according to the company.</p>
<p>A new opportunity to grab more market share has opened up as governments, particularly in Europe, place stricter emissions regulations in urban areas. The E-Transit cargo van, which is expected to ship to customers later this year, and the commercial variant of the F-150 Lightning Pro play a critical role in Ford Pro&#8217;s plans. The Lightning pickup truck is expected to come to market in spring 2022.</p>
