										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the same way that PayPal and Stripe radically changed online payments by allowing any online service to embed payments, the race is on to have the same impact on crypto assets. To this end, players such as <a href="https://www.sendwyre.com/">Wyre</a> (raised $29.1M) and <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/">MoonPay</a> (raised $555M) have risen to the fore. But in the Summer of this year, a similar, UK-based startup called Ramp (not to be confused with US ‘trad-fi’ startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">Ramp</a>) de-cloaked like a Klingon battleship in space, with a $10.1 million <a href="https://www.uktech.news/news/london-based-startup-ramp-raises-7-1m-to-become-the-paypal-for-crypto-20210615">seed round</a>, and even had hard-won approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under its belt.</p>
<p>The company is now clearly on a roll.</p>
<p>Ramp has now raised a $52.7 million Series A round led by Balderton Capital. Existing investors NFX, Galaxy Digital, Seedcamp, Firstminute Capital also participated, alongside angel investors including Taavet Hinrikus (Wise) and Francesco Simonesci (TrueLayer), and the investment will see Balderton’s General Partner, Rana Yared, join the Ramp board. The startup has now raised a total of $63 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247943" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founded in 2017 by Szymon Sypniewicz (CEO) and Przemek Kowalczyk (CTO, CPO), Ramp has a non-custodial, full-stack payment infrastructure. The idea here is to open up digital assets to more businesses and users by making it possible to send or receive crypto without having to go through an exchange like Coinbase, for instance.</p>
<p>Ramp allows anyone that wants to offer crypto-enabled services to do so via its SDK in a few hours, without the need to set up their own on-ramping stack to an exchange, an extremely time-consuming and potentially costly business.</p>
<p>This is, of course, very advantageous to Ramp, because it forces users to move between Ramp-powered services without having to jump through multiple verification hoops. Faster for the users, but also great for Ramp.</p>
<p>In part because of this ease of use, it’s managed to partner up with more than 400 developers, including Mozilla, Browser, Dapper Labs, and DeFi apps like Aave, Argent, Trust Wallet, and Zerion. It is also the exclusive on-ramping partner for Sorare, the blockchain-based, global sports video game, and Flow, the blockchain which specializes in NFT marketplaces and digital assets.  </p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Furthermore, users of the Opera browser can top-up crypto wallets from within the app, or Sorare NFT game players can buy and sell virtual players via Ethereum. In addition, the NFT-based game Axie Infinity used Ramp to shorten its onboarding process from two hours to minutes.</p>
<p>The ultimate vision is to facilitate crypto transactions for banks’ or other financial institutions’ end-users within their banking apps. This would be where TradFi meets DeFi.</p>
<p>Ramp has also recently received regulatory approval from US FinCen &#8211; the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which enables the company to operate legally in the US. And in Poland, it has become the first on-ramping company to <a href="https://medium.com/rampnetwork/ramp-got-open-banking-license-60be108a9df2">receive</a> an open banking license from The Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) in 2020.</p>
<p>Szymon Sypniewicz, Ramp co-founder and CEO, said: “There is so much potential in unlocking cryptocurrency and digital assets beyond today’s narrow and restrictive use cases. We’re on a mission to provide instant access to cryptocurrencies through a provider they can trust.”  </p>
<p>On its competitive position against Wyre and MoonPay, a spokesperson said Ramp is focusing on transaction transparency and regulatory approval, hence the FCA and FinCen stuff: “While several competitors prefer to embed some of their fees in conversion rates, Ramp prides itself on showing its fees up-front so that consumers know exactly what they are paying for.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Put simply: If the tech companies with the richest valuations were dragged closer to a 20x multiple, it would slash the worth of nearly every tech company, period.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An analyst note from JP Morgan has thrown a wrench into the valuations market for technology shares. And while the impact of the missive is being felt most sharply among public companies, its impacts could show up in the valuations of yet-private technology firms as well.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The note changed the bank&#8217;s valuation perspective regarding a number of technology companies. In response to what <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/cloud-stocks-adobe-cloudflare-zscaler-plunge-on-jpmorgan-downgrades.html">CNBC described</a> as a &#8220;wave of downgrades&#8221; from JP Morgan, investors pulled the rug on a few notable tech companies. Here&#8217;s a partial list of the damage from yesterday&#8217;s trading, after the downgrades were made public:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zscaler: -7.84%</li>
<li>Datadog: -6.54%</li>
<li>Cloudflare: -8.98%</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2229732 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>You get the picture.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s more important is that the note connected rising interest rates to an anticipated decline in the value of various technology shares. To wit: &#8220;With rates climbing, this adds risk to higher multiple software stocks trading over 20 times revenue,&#8221; <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/cloud-stocks-adobe-cloudflare-zscaler-plunge-on-jpmorgan-downgrades.html">per a CNBC quote</a> of the note. (A longer list of upgrades and downgrades from the communiqué can be found <a href="https://247wallst.com/apps-software/2021/12/14/jp-morgan-makes-big-changes-to-software-stock-ratings/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>If tech companies valued at more than 20x revenues see their valuations decline as rates rise, it would create a downward compression effect on tech valuations more generally. Put simply: If the tech companies with the richest valuations were dragged closer to a 20x multiple, it would slash the worth of nearly every tech company, period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disney+ is the latest streaming app to add support for Apple&#8217;s SharePlay, the iOS 15 feature that offers a co-viewing experience over FaceTime video calls on iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV devices. First <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-introduces-shareplay-for-co-watching-streaming-and-screen-sharing-over-facetime/">announced</a> during Apple&#8217;s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June, SharePlay rolled out with the iOS 15.1 update, soon offering co-viewing experiences <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/shareplay-powers-new-ways-to-stay-connected-and-share-experiences-in-facetime/">across a variety of apps</a>, including NBA, <a href="https://www.imore.com/tiktok-latest-get-shareplay-update-adds-new-us-page-during-facetime-calls">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-shareplay-iphone-ipad-facetime-192948698.html">Twitch</a>, Paramount+, and Showtime, as well as Apple&#8217;s own apps like Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Fitness, among others.</p>
<p>Disney+, however, has been a long-awaited addition to this lineup, as Apple had announced during WWDC that the streaming service would be among those supporting the new feature.</p>
<p>Today, the companies are making good on that promise with the release of a Disney+ app update that will allow subscribers to use the SharePlay feature on Apple&#8217;s iOS, iPadOS and tvOS devices. Disney says the feature will be compatible globally across the entire Disney+ catalog from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic. This includes its new titles like Marvel Studios&#8217; &#8220;Hawkeye,&#8221; &#8220;Welcome to Earth,&#8221; and its upcoming Disney+ premieres, like &#8220;Encanto&#8221; which arrives on Christmas Eve (Dec. 24), and the &#8220;The Book of Boba Fett,&#8221; which becomes available starting on Dec. 29.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247906" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2247941" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247941" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2247941" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg 2160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg?resize=768,376 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg?resize=680,333 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg?resize=1536,752 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg?resize=2048,1003 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247941" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Disney</p></div></p>
<p>Once updated, users will be able to host and attend SharePlay sessions that allow up to 32 people to co-watch Disney+ together. This could make for an easy way for a family who can&#8217;t be together for the holidays to have a Disney movie night, for example, or a way to entertain the kids by having them stream Disney+ with friends back home while out of town for a holiday trip, among other things.</p>
<p>The SharePlay feature itself is relatively easy to use as it&#8217;s built into the FaceTime app. To use the feature, you&#8217;ll first start the FaceTime call, then open the Disney+ app. A notice will appear at the top of the screen alerting you that SharePlay is available. You&#8217;ll tap play on the content you want to watch and begin watching with everyone else on the call. The playback controls are available to everyone else on the SharePlay session, allowing each user to press play, pause, rewind or fast forward.</p>
<p>Disney notes that each participant can choose the audio and subtitles in the language of their choice when streaming on their device. The feature also offers multiple viewing options for viewers, allowing people to watch the streaming content on their Apple TV while still FaceTiming with friends and family on their iPhone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SharePlay has been one of the more interesting features in the iOS 15 release, as it seems like a natural next direction for the FaceTime software in an age where social distancing and remote work have become the norm, and apps like Zoom have crossed into consumer territory. In addition to supporting co-watching, users can also screen share over SharePlay, even launching apps and browsing together &#8212; great for anything from online shopping to offering aging family members remote tech support.</p>
<p>To use SharePlay to stream Disney+, all participants must be running at least iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, and tvOS 15.1, and they&#8217;ll need to be a Disney+ subscriber.</p>
<p>Though Disney is embracing SharePlay, its own in-app co-viewing feature, <a href="https://dmedmedia.disney.com/news/disney-plus-introduces-group-watch">called GroupWatch</a>, will continue to be available to all subscribers in the same country across compatible devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re very excited to launch SharePlay on Disney+ for Apple users in time for the holidays and ahead of several highly-<br />
anticipated premieres,&#8221; said Jerrell Jimerson, EVP of Product &amp; Design, Disney Streaming, in a statement. &#8220;With thousands of movies and shows and a growing content catalog of new titles and originals, SharePlay provides another opportunity for personal friends and family around the world to come together and create new memories with their favorite stories on Disney+,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gothelist.com/gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The List</a> joins the social commerce movement with a new app connecting consumers with global luxury brands and retailers to offer a personalized discovery and shopping experience.</p>
<p>Focused on sourcing hard-to-find items, the app launch is buoyed by $3.5 million in seed funding backed by a group including American Designer and Rachel Zoe, who is both an investor and advisor to the New York-based company.</p>
<p>The List, with offices in Dubai and Lisbon, was founded in 2016 as an e-commerce marketplace and works with authorized, professional sellers. Its new app is an extension of the marketplace, merging content, social networking and live commerce.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247603" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The foundation of our business is to help retail stores and brands join the e-commerce wave that is happening,” The List founder and CEO Andreas Skorski told TechCrunch. “We built machine learning and computer vision into the supply chain so they can plug and play into a store. We also have multiple APIs to sync and digitalize inventory to create a product catalogue.”</p>
<p>App features include the ability to livestream with a retailer, brand or personal shopper, ask questions in real time and receive recommendations or in-store presentations. Shoppers can follow their favorite brands and stores and engage when images or videos are shoppable. They can also upload a photo of an item to the seller network and get its sourced fast and at the best possible price.</p>
<p>On the seller side of the app, you can set up a digital store in minutes and determine how their brand and products will be presented and promoted. The List takes care of the entire fulfilment process, including insurance, taxes and duties, as well as store-to-door express delivery to 190 countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For years, <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1280/social-commerce/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China led in social commerce</a>, but it became a more popular concept in the United States during the global pandemic.  As such, Grand View Research reported earlier this year that the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/social-commerce-market-size-worth-3-369-8-billion-by-2028--cagr-28-4-grand-view-research-inc-301207167.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global social commerce market</a> was forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion by 2028 from growing annually by over 28% between now and then.</p>
<p>Social commerce is also proving to be global, with companies across the world finding success is this sector and attracting venture capital to back it up. For example, in November, Facily, a Brazil-based social commerce marketplace, closed on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/brazilian-social-commerce-marketplace-facily-quietly-raises-366m-in-less-than-a-year-now-valued-at-850m/">$250 million Series D round</a>. Prior to that, Evermos an Indonesian social commerce startup, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/indonesian-social-commerce-startup-evermos-lands-30m-series-b/">$30 million in Series B funding</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The List works with over 150 retail partners around the world, and while the U.S. is The List’s largest market, the app launch will help it grow into additional markets and offer products in different languages.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to grow aggressively and add to its 55-person workforce. Over the past year, The List saw growth on both sides of its business model, with several hundred people joining the supply side, and on the consumer side, revenue jumped by a couple thousand percent, Skorski said. In fact, this year’s Black Friday in November contributed to the best month ever in company history, he added.</p>
<p>“Digital sales has taken a dominant role, much like how restaurants have iPads at tables,” Skorski said. “The same will happen in the retail space, and it will be a matter of who gets there faster. We are creating this world to enable true storytelling in its best form.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When we last checked in with <a href="https://www.cequence.ai/">Cequence Security</a> in February 2019, the company had just closed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/cequence-security-hauls-in-17m-series-b-investment-to-help-protect-applications/">a $17 million Series B</a> and was concentrating on security to protect business logic. While it still does that, it has shifted focus to API security, and today it announced a $60 million Series C.</p>
<p>Menlo Ventures led the latest round with participation from new investors Icon Ventures, Telstra Ventures and HarbourVest Partners along with existing investors Shasta Ventures, Dell Technologies Capital and T-Mobile Ventures. The company said it has now raised $100 million.</p>
<p>CEO Larry Link said that the startup was seeing more vulnerabilities through APIs with customers, and they began to shift the focus of the Cequence analytics engine to find those kinds of vulnerabilities.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247897" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We now will discover what your API footprint looks like. [Without having] to instrument it, we&#8217;re finding things, and then we detect [any] abuse that&#8217;s going on on those API endpoints, and then we can mitigate that. So that&#8217;s how the product has evolved,&#8221; Link told me.</p>
<p>He said that Cequence looks at approximately 150 data points to determine if the activity is something to worry about.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we look at individual requests first, and then we look at clustering of requests second, and then we look at the intent of those requests third, and that&#8217;s where we tease things out like, &#8216;Hey, this is an account takeover attack, or this is a credential stuffing attack, or this is an inventory manipulation attack,'&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Link said the company grew 2.5x over the last year and that there is a lot of room for growth. &#8220;We&#8217;re not releasing our revenue numbers, but it&#8217;s a very healthy growth rate and pretty high ARR for this kind of the business, and that&#8217;s why we wanted to raise this Series C, because we have a lot of opportunity. We need to fuel that,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup has just over 100 employees today and could reach as high as 250 by the end of 2022, depending on how the business goes. Link said that as the company expanded over the last year and moved at least partly remote, the workforce has grown more diverse.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re big believers in the value of a diverse workforce. We think it gives us better insight and is a better platform to grow and expand the company. So the recent change in the last year and a half where some jobs need to be HQ-based, but most of our jobs can be working from anywhere. And this is kind of a new transition that we&#8217;ve seen, and it&#8217;s enabling us to get, I think, a better quality workforce and also a more diverse workforce,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This is Link&#8217;s fifth startup. His previous job before joining Cequence was VP of Sales at Palo Alto Networks. The founders hired him after starting the company to add an experienced industry veteran to run the show.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has quietly removed all references to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">its child sexual abuse scanning feature</a> from its website, months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">announcing that the new technology</a> would be baked into iOS 15 and macOS Monterey.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">Back in August</a>, Apple announced that it would introduce the feature to allow the company to detect and report known child sexual abuse material, known as CSAM, to law enforcement. At the time, Apple claimed — unlike cloud providers that already offered blanket scanning to check for potentially illegal content — it could detect known illegal imagery while preserving user privacy, because the technology could identify known CSAM on a user’s device without having to possess the image or device, or knowing its contents.</p>
<p>Apple faced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">a monumental backlash</a> in response. Security experts and privacy advocates expressed concern that the system <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life">could be abused</a> by highly resourced actors, like governments, to implicate innocent victims or to manipulate the system, while others ridiculed being ineffective at identifying images of child sexual abuse.This led to dozens of civil liberties groups calling on Apple to abandon plans to roll out the controversial feature.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247882" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Despite a publicity blitz that followed in an effort to assuage fears, Apple relented, announcing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/apple-csam-detection-delayed/">delay to the rollout of the CSAM scanning feature</a>. The company said &#8220;based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now it looks like the feature might have been scrapped altogether.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/15/apple-nixes-csam-references-website/">MacRumours</a> first noticed that all mentions of CSAM have been quietly scrubbed from <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/">Apple’s Child Safety webpage.</a> Up until December 10, this page included a detailed overview of CSAM detection and a promise that the controversial feature would be &#8220;coming later this year in updates to iOS 15, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, and macOS Monterey.&#8221; The updated version of the page removes not only the section on CSAM detection but also scrubs all references to the technology and a section offering links to documents explaining and assessing the CSAM process. Now, Apple&#8217;s Child Safety page only contains <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-safety-feature-messages/">a reference to Communication safety in Messages</a> and expanded guidance for Siri, Spotlight and Safari Search, the former having debuted on iOS 15 earlier this week.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Apple did not immediately respond when reached for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/iot-data-collector-samsaras-ipo-will-be-fun-to-watch/">final IPO that TechCrunch is tracking in 2021</a> had a solid run-up to its first day&#8217;s trading. Samsara, an IoT platform company, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/samsara-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering-301445145.html">priced</a> its public offering last night at $23 per share, the top end of its range.</p>

<p>In selling 35 million shares, the company had gross initial proceeds of $805 million from its IPO. That number could scale by 5.25 million shares, or $120.75 million in gross value, if the company&#8217;s underwriting banks purchase shares that they have the option to.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s Samsara worth at $23 per share?</h2>
<p>There are two valuations that we care about regarding Samsara&#8217;s IPO. We want its simple, or non-diluted, valuation. And we want its fully diluted valuation. The latter number will include more total shares, adding equity that has been vested through options and the like, but not yet exercised.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/samsara-could-become-a-decacorn-in-upcoming-iot-themed-ipo/">our prior calculations</a>, here&#8217;s where the numbers sit for the now-public entity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Samsara simple IPO valuation $23 per share: $11.6 billion</li>
<li>Samsara fully diluted IPO valuation at $23 per share: $12.4 billion</li>
</ul>
<p>Our math also indicated that Samsara is worth around 27x its most recent run rate at the latter valuation. That&#8217;s a multiple that many companies would have killed for in the past, but compared to recent norms it feels a bit, well, small?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">API security is all the rage these days, pushed into the limelight following a spate of high profile security incidents that saw reams of user data exposed or exfiltrated. Peloton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">spilled</a> users&#8217; private account information; Experian <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/experian-api-exposed-credit-scores-of-most-americans/">exposed</a> the financial histories of millions of Americans; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/facebook-sues-two-companies-engaged-in-data-scraping-operations/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/supreme-court-revives-linkedin-bid-to-protect-user-data-from-web-scrapers/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/10/this-week-in-apps-facebooks-other-clubhouse-rival-apple-details-att-app-store-trial-nears/">Clubhouse</a> all had user data scraped <i>en masse</i> because of their poorly secured APIs.</p>
<p>For companies like Noname Security that aim to solve API security problems, business is booming. The Palo Alto-headquartered company today announced it&#8217;s raised $135 million in Series C funding, pushing the startup over the $1 billion valuation mark, making it the latest startup to join the cybersecurity unicorn club.</p>
<p>The round was led by Georgian and Lightspeed, with participation from Insight Partners, Forgepoint, and others. The funding comes just six months after Noname closed a $60 million round of funding at Series B, less than a year after raising $25 million at Series A after emerging from stealth last December. For those keeping count, that&#8217;s $220 million raised by the company to date.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247286" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Noname helps companies proactively discover and remediate API security issues by analyzing configuration settings, network traffic, and code to prevent misuse. APIs, in simple terms, allow two or more things to talk to each other over the internet, including hardware and software. APIs are pretty much everywhere, even if you can&#8217;t see them. But without controls in place, APIs can be abused to siphon off tons of sensitive or private internal data from a company&#8217;s servers.</p>
<p>The startup said it plans to use the new investment to expand its research and development, and improve its go-to-market strategy. Noname now claims to support one-fifth of Fortune 500 companies, and has tripled its headcount in the past six months to more than 200 employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2018, <a href="http://Forethought.ai">Forethought</a>, a startup looking to put AI to work across customer service,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/07/forethought-wins-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-sf-2018/"> won the TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield</a> and soon after landed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/04/forethought-snares-9m-series-a-in-wake-of-battlefield-win/">a $9 million Series A</a>. Well, three years later that company just landed a $65 million Series C, and it&#8217;s rolling along.</p>
<p>Steadfast Capital led the latest round with participation from existing investor NEA and new investors Sound Ventures and K9 Ventures along with individual investors including actress Gwyneth Paltrow and former NBA player Baron Davis. The company has now raised $92 million.</p>
<p>Company CEO and co-founder Deon Nicholas says that like many companies, his benefited as the pandemic forced companies to digitally transform faster than they might have, and this was particularly true in the customer service market where Forethought&#8217;s products are aimed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247623" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;This explosion in digital transformation, as well as I would say just the loss of human productivity [during the early part of the pandemic] led to a lot of businesses to turn to artificial intelligence, and obviously to Forethought, to help with this digital transformation,&#8221; Nicholas told me.</p>
<p>He says that the new money should help take advantage of the rapid growth the company has been experiencing. In the last year, they have seen ARR grow 5x, while tripling the number of customers.</p>
<p>The company now has three main customer service products. First it has the Assist, which helps CSA&#8217;s find the information they need to solve a problem quickly, Solve is a chatbot to help answer simple questions and route the more complex ones to human CSAs and Triage uses AI to route the call to the most knowledgeable CSA to get the call answered most efficiently.</p>
<p>He says the goal is to help humans perform better using AI. &#8220;One of the things that we&#8217;ve focused on is being a human-centered AI platform. And that&#8217;s what has really come through&#8230;with our mission, and really our mission is to unlock human potential through artificial intelligence,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As a Black co-founder Nicholas is keenly aware of the numbers out there when it comes to funding for Black founders. In fact, in the first half of 2021, just 1.2 percent of venture money went to startups with a Black founder, according to<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/something-ventured-funding-to-black-startup-founders-quadrupled-in-past-year-but-remains-elusive/"> data from Crunchbase</a>. And that was a big improvement over last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;In many ways, investors are making these gut decisions that they think are based on the company or the metrics or whatever, but oftentimes it&#8217;s based on their [idea] of what they think a founder should look like. And often if you don&#8217;t fit that mold, whether that&#8217;s because of your appearance, your skin color or your particular background, it can be tough because you&#8217;re battling these implicit judgment biases,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>One of the outcomes he hopes for from his startup&#8217;s journey, is that his story inspires young people of color looking to start a company. &#8220;One of my hopes is that my personal story becomes one that can help the next generation of entrepreneurs see that there are examples of that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Today, the company is up to 145 employees and with the new cash, Nicholas expects to reach around 250 by the end of next year. He recognizes the need for diversity, especially in a business that caters to customer service agents.</p>
<p>&#8220;We care about building an organization that is not only representative, but as you know, more diverse organizations lead to better decision making and just better products. Not to mention that when we think about the industry we serve, customer service…it&#8217;s global. It&#8217;s broad,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So for the people we serve, it&#8217;s very important that the people building the technology, as well AI and things like that, it&#8217;s very important that we understand and are representative of the people we serve,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company could move beyond customer service over time, with Nicholas saying the company is looking at adjacent areas like sales. With $65 million, the company can afford to put some R&amp;D resources into other areas, while still contributing to AI research and refining and building on the current customer service focus.</p>

To combat this, railway companies demand more robust cyber solutions and lawmakers across the globe <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-issues-cybersecurity-directives-for-freight-and-passenger-rail-11638471602">call for more effective cybersecurity regulations</a>.</span></p>

Cylus’ solution offers continuous monitoring and 360-degree real-time protection for all rail systems, regardless of size and geography, enabling real-time threat detection, advanced forensics and mitigation, simplified security operations and more. CylusOne takes just a few hours to install, requiring zero downtime, fully integrating with new and legacy systems with no changes to the network architecture required, providing full visibility within seconds. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Israel-based company announced today it has closed $30 million in a Series B round to help protect trains and metros. The latest capital brings its total funding to over $57 million.

Israeli serial entrepreneur Zohar Zisapel, a member of Cylus’ board, also joined the round. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With rising government investment in critical infrastructure and growing cybersecurity regulations in the U.S., Cylus will use the current funding to fuel its growth globally in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific. The company also plans to continuously update its rail cybersecurity platform by adding more specialists in cybersecurity, traffic management and onboard/trackside systems and strengthening its AI and machine learning capabilities, chief executive officer and co-founder of Cylus <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amir-levintal/">Amir Levintal</a> told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The railways are such an essential part of our critical infrastructure, and really, of our everyday lives, that it is crucial that this industry gets the level of cyber protection it demands and needs,” Levintal said. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cylus enables maximum interoperability (train-track coupling) while protecting stationary and moving systems in trains, Levintal continued. He also said that its integrated platform approach allows clients to engage with a single rail cybersecurity solution provider instead of multiple vendors. Other competitors offer only a partial solution for rail cybersecurity, such as those designed solely for onboard systems without signaling protection (or vice versa), Levintal added. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Earlier this week, the company <a href="https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2021/12/alstom-and-cylus-roll-out-advanced-rail-cybersecurity-solution-protect">also announced its strategic partnership</a> with France-based </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.alstom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Alstom</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to roll out an advanced rail cybersecurity solution that can protect the Tel-Aviv red line’s signaling and train control systems.  </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We have seen a massive wave of digitization in the railway industry over the last few years. Despite this being a very positive trend, it has also entailed an exponential expansion of the surface area hackers can access to penetrate railway networks – which could lead to serious outcomes in one of the most core modes of transportation and critical infrastructure,” said Gal Gitter, partner and managing director of Ibex Investors, who will now become a Cylus board member. “Cylus changes all of that by providing the most advanced and holistic cybersecurity platform for railway networks and operators. Cylus’ platform is already in place across many of the world’s leading railway operators, and we believe it will become the ubiquitous platform used across the industry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Cylus provides an essential element of protection to critical infrastructure that will enhance the safety and performance of train systems,” said Tam Hock Chuan, managing director of Vertex Growth Fund. “Vertex Growth is proud to help back Cylus’ technology, which we believe offers the most comprehensive solution for rail cybersecurity on the market today.” </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company has since seen a trend of owning fewer items, but of those that are purchased, they are of higher quality, made better, longer lasting and retain some resale value.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.rebag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebag</a>, which buys, sells and trades luxury items like handbags and accessories, raised a $33 million Series E round following a year of technology development and category expansion.</p>
<p>We profiled Rebag back in 2015, when its name included two “g&#8217;s,” (gotta love URL availability) and had raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/06/online-designer-bag-reseller-rebagg-gains-4-million-in-seed/">$4 million in seed funding</a> to go after incumbents like The RealReal.</p>
<p>Novator led the latest round, with participation from existing investors, including General Catalyst, to bring the company’s total funding to date to $101 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247503" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Charles Gorra, founder and CEO of Rebag, declined to talk about valuation, but did say it was “a steep evolution from the last time.” The “last time” was a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/rebag-series-d--0cd9e9c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$15 million Series D round</a> in 2020, also led by Novator.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Online Designer Bag Reseller Rebagg Gains $4 Million In Seed Funding To Take On TheRealReal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/06/online-designer-bag-reseller-rebagg-gains-4-million-in-seed/embed/#?secret=8Vzc5reJKz" data-secret="8Vzc5reJKz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At that time, Rebag’s path was uncertain, with the global pandemic, Gorra explained. He took the $15 million to have some buffer as the company weighed its options. What happened was that the company ended up with two strong years of revenue growth — 50% in 2020 and 70% estimation for 2021 — basically close to triple the amount of growth over the two-year period, he said.</p>
<p>“It was a function of COVID generating digitization of underpenetrated industries, in particular luxury,” Gorra added. “Before COVID, purchases of luxury goods was 8% in the U.S. and now it is closer to 20%. Luxury stores can be uncomfortable, so our goal was how to make that experience more approachable.”</p>
<p>The company has since seen a trend of owning fewer items, but of those that are purchased, they are of higher quality, are made better, are longer lasting and retain some resale value. That’s important in the luxury space because Rebag’s average ticket is $2,000, so when you spend that kind of money, you want to build trust, Gorra said.</p>
<p>In the past 12 months, new categories, like fine jewelry and watches, grew four times. Gorra cites the company’s ability to triple its sourcing capabilities after launching its Clair AI and Clair Trade technology in 2020. The marketplace now has more than 30,000 items.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rebag’s Clair technology suite includes proprietary software that can instantly recognize and price bags from the top 50 luxury brands, through an app or by uploading an image, and an offer from Rebag to buy it. The other software tool is an instant trade-in program for the buying and selling of items in one transaction.</p>
<p>Gorra intends to use the new capital to continue technology development on those tools, to add to Rebag’s workforce of 150 people and expand its marketing. The company currently has seven brick-and-mortar stores across New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Beverly Hills and Greenwich, Connecticut, with plans to add more in 2022.</p>
<p>“The market for venture capital is active and favorable, and we seized on that opportunity to accelerate funding,” he added. “There is a massive opportunity for the resale market — it is booming, and we believe we have created something special.”</p>
<p>Also over the past year, the company modified its retail model, adding high-tech touch points throughout the store, including the “Clair Corner,” a self-service kiosk where customers can receive an instant price quote on the item they are selling. In addition, its “Rebag Bar” in New York offers a personalized digital shopping experience, including being able to purchase and pay for resale items within an hour.</p>

<p>Though Gorra believes the luxury goods resale market is still in its infancy, citing that one out of 10 luxury items are transacted in the resale market, there are dozens of secondhand marketplaces for handbags and other items, also those not necessarily luxury goods.</p>
<p>The secondhand market is expected to double and reach $77 billion by 2025, <a href="https://www.thredup.com/resale/#size-and-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to ThredUp</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/unraveling-thredups-ipo-filing-slow-growth-but-a-shifting-business-model/">went public earlier this year</a> after raising over $300 million in venture-backed funding.</p>
<p>Gorra sees The RealReal and Poshmark being the closest competitors to Rebag. Even so, he says that the average ticket purchases are vastly different: The RealReal is $500 and Poshmark is $30 compared to Rebag’s $2,000, he noted.</p>
<p>Another differentiator is that Rebag controls the purchases and sales versus some of the other platforms that are peer-to-peer sales, sometimes causing those transactions to take days as each party manages their own sides.</p>
<p>“We believe our value prop is on the high-end goods market and want to be the trusted place for premium resale,” Gorra said. “We want to be a leader in this space, where we believe there will eventually be a large resale ecosystem, and we want to be a part of it.”</p>
<p><em>Update 12/15, 8:42 a.m.: The company amended its funding round size to $33 million from $35 million</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For decades, Brazil has had a huge credit problem. It is Latin America’s largest country and has one of the highest interest rate spreads in the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To give you an idea of just how bad it is, reports indicated that in 2019, credit card interest rates neared </span><a href="https://www.riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/brazil/credit-card-interest-rate-nears-300-percent-per-year-in-brazil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a staggering </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">300%</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Brazil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the reasons you’re seeing so many fintechs emerge in Latin America. Interest rates this high make it very difficult for the economically challenged to ever not be economically challenged. In another example of how startups in the region are working to boost inclusion as much as innovation, <a href="https://open-co.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Co</a>, a São Paulo-based consumer credit company, announced today that it has raised $115 million in a round led by SoftBank Latin America Fund.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247688" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Raiz Investimentos, IFC and LTS also put money in the round. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.open-co.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Co</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was created earlier this year by the merger of Geru, an eight-year-old o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nline lender, and Rebel, a four-year-old startup using AI and bank account data to underwrite risk and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">assess clients’ financial health. Its aim is to “finance consumption for Brazilians in a healthy way.” It plans to do this in a few ways, but for starters, by not charging 300% interest rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Access to good quality credit at the point and time of need is the single most important obstacle for Brazilians to achieve financial wellness, increase consumption and create wealth,” said Sandro Reiss, Open Co’s co-founder. &#8220;It&#8217;s a huge market that is still controlled by incumbents charging extremely high interest rates, which makes it difficult for people to pay back their loans. It is a vicious cycle; delinquencies are high and interest rates even higher. Our mission is to change that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Co provides clients with access to credit and access to tools that are designed to improve their financial lives, not make them worse. The process is 100% digital, with no bureaucracy involved; it claims to be fast, and the rates are lower than those of traditional banks.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, the need is there. An estimated 52% of the population use credit to pay for basic expenses, creating an unsecured consumer credit market of about $200 billion, of which about 70% is in revolving credit. As a result, 62 million Brazilians have overdue accounts or missed payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Co wants to give Brazilian people more options, and so far, the people seem to be welcoming those options with well, open arms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a lot of buzz around “buy now, pay later” nowadays, but the truth is &#8212; its execs point out &#8212; that it has always existed in Brazil, a country where people usually buy things in installments with their credit cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the Open Co team is refreshingly transparent regarding financials. To get even more specific, the team is projecting to reach nearly $196 million in revenues in 2022, a “3x” growth compared to 2021. It also aims to allow its customers to access over $616 million in financing in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Execs say that its</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> business is profitable, but it is still heavily investing in growth and building better products and technology, which causes its cash requirements to be above the cash produced by operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining the results of its two predecessors, Open Co says it has helped consumers save more than $500 million in interest expenses over the years and has been increasingly establishing partnerships with merchants, retailers and service providers to be closer to its clients’ point of need when requesting credit. Overall, it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">provided nearly $405 million in credit to more than 200,000 people so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The consumer lending market in Brazil is massive,” Reiss told TechCrunch. “However, it is mispriced and dysfunctional for the consumers, with Brazilians being forced into paying the second-highest interest rate spread in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few factors are working in Open Co’s favor, its team believes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a huge market with complacent incumbents, a population that adopts technologies early on and a supportive regulatory agenda. Last year we saw the creation of Pix, an instant payments system that allows people to transfer money in a few seconds, for free; and this year the implementation of open banking, which will reduce information asymmetry between incumbents and fintechs, started as well,” said Open Co co-founder </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rafael Pereira.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital toward its expansion plans, with “significant investments” in technology and product development. Naturally, it will also be doing some hiring. The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently has 230 employees, more than 50% of whom work in tech and product.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When it comes to plans for the future, we can say that we want to give credit to people who have overdue accounts,” Pereira added. “But we don’t want to do the traditional way, with high interest rates that make it difficult for people to pay. Our mission is to break this vicious cycle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felipe Fujiwara, investment leader of SoftBank Latin America Fund, said that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank is most excited about Open Co’s “large” opportunity to improve the quality of Brazilians&#8217; financial lives through credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Difficulty in accessing credit is one of the biggest social issues in Brazil. More than half of Brazilians are obliged to ask for credit to pay their basic expenses, and the result of the combination of demand and high interest results in 62 million people being denied credit,” Fujiwara wrote via email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, he added, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has a track record in underwriting personal loans and in raising debt funding to provide better credit alternatives to consumers. At the same time, it offers merchants “the ability to meaningfully increase traffic, order value, conversion and GMV.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Besides that, it was the first fintech to use artificial intelligence to analyze customers, helping to solve the country&#8217;s credit problem, which has one of the highest spreads in the world,” Fujiwara added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Innovaccer has raised a new financing round and more than doubled its valuation to $3.2 billion from $1.3 billion in February this year as a growing number of healthcare organizations move to use the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/innovaccer-wants-to-be-the-service-that-unifies-all-healthcare-data/">San Francisco-headquartered firm&#8217;s platform</a> to put their troves of data to better use.</p>
<p>Mubadala Capital led the $150 million Series E round, pushing the startup’s all-time raise to over $375 million. Whale Rock Capital, Avidity Partners, and Schonfeld Strategic Advisors as well as existing investors including Tiger Global, B Capital Group, Microsoft’s M12 fund, and Steadview Capital also participated in the round.</p>
<p>In the past two decades, most industries have adopted technology to bring efficiencies to their businesses and accelerate their growth. Healthcare industry, in comparison, has been the last frontier to adopt technology in many ways, said Abhinav Shashank, co-founder and chief executive of Innovaccer, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247857" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We haven’t been able to drive that kind of transformation. Moreover, most systems that have been built for this space are non-cloud,” he said, adding that this has resulted in troves of data sitting in siloed systems.</p>
<p>That’s where <a href="https://innovaccer.com">Innovaccer</a> comes into the play.</p>
<p>The startup, which began its journey in India, has developed a cloud software layer that works on top of the existing systems employed by healthcare facilities and enables patients’ data to be fetched and perform analysis on.</p>
<p>Healthcare facilities “don’t need to replace their existing systems. Our cloud layer connects with a number of their existing electronic health record systems,” said Shashank.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Getting better access enables patients to supply and make use of even more data &#8212; such as insurance or medical data generated by fitness trackers &#8212; they have on themselves. “This creates a 360-degree view of the patient.” Moreover, this allows doctors to get deeper and real-time visibility into the patient’s health status.</p>
<p>The business-to-business focused startup has amassed over 50 customers including Banner Health, and Roche in the U.S. and some in Europe. Some of its recently signed customers include One Medical, CommonSpirit, Sentara, Adventist Health, Children’s Health Alliance, Florence Health, and Zus Health.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2247870" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247870" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2247870 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Innovaccer-co-founders.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="349" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Innovaccer-co-founders.png 1539w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Innovaccer-co-founders.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Innovaccer-co-founders.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Innovaccer-co-founders.png?resize=768,394 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Innovaccer-co-founders.png?resize=680,349 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Innovaccer-co-founders.png?resize=1536,787 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Innovaccer-co-founders.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247870" class="wp-caption-text">Innovaccer founders Kanav Hasija (left), Abhinav Shashank, and Sandeep Gupta.

<p>As things stand today, when a hospital or any other health facility works with Innovaccer, its patients’ data remains with that facility. Other healthcare providers don’t get access to that data. This is one of the challenges that many entrepreneurs are hoping to solve.</p>
<p>Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, for instance, is hoping that his blockchain network will become a universal standard to a point that any patient anywhere in the world will be able to quickly grant permission to a doctor to view his or her records in an event of an emergency. But we are not there yet. Shashank suggested that in the coming years, as healthcare providers begin to open up, they may agree to a universal protocol and such an interoperable system would then work.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why he is optimistic is the growing interest of big tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple in the healthtech space. “They want us to succeed and we are building systems that run on top of their clouds. So there&#8217;s massive synergies in how we are all approaching the market,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup, which signed its first customer in 2016, has grown rapidly in recent years, he said. “Our focus has been the U.S. market. At some point, we will expand internationally as well. But given the size of the problem we have on our hands in the U.S. itself, we will remain largely focused here for the near term.”</p>
<p>The growth of Innovaccer is one of the biggest Indian SaaS success stories. Shashank, pointing to the success of many SaaS startups that began their journey in India, Australia or Southeast Asia, said for SaaS entrepreneurs, the “world has never been flatter as the delivery model is on the cloud. I don’t think it has ever been easier for entrepreneurs to build a global software company of significant size and scale,” he said.</p>
<p>Innovaccer will deploy the fresh funds to supercharge its research and development work and also hire more talent across product, engineering and customer experience roles.</p>
<p>“We have been investors in Innovaccer since 2019, and believe that the company has all the necessary pillars to define the new gold standard of how the Health Cloud should be implemented by providers, payers, and life science companies,” said Alaa Halawa, Partner and Head of the US Ventures business at Mubadala Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of tech companies have tried to create a common data framework to connect the healthcare industry, but they all fell short due to extreme industry complexities or technology challenges. But in five short years, Innovaccer has built the most successful data activation platform in the healthcare industry as proven by record rates of industry adoption. Innovaccer is likely the first and only company since the invention of the electronic health record (EHR) that has the opportunity to unify the healthcare ecosystem.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Israeli SaaS security startup Atmosec raised a $6 million seed round led by Israeli VC firm Glilot Capital Partners and American fund Battery Ventures.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli SaaS security startup <a href="https://www.atmosec.com/">Atmosec</a> today announced having raised a $6 million seed round led by Israeli VC firm <a href="https://glilotcapital.com/">Glilot Capital Partners</a> and American fund <a href="https://www.battery.com/">Battery Ventures</a>. Its team had previously participated in <a href="https://nocamels.com/2021/04/intel-ignite-4th-cohort-10-israeli-startups/">Intel Ignite&#8217;s fourth Tel Aviv startup acceleration cohort</a>.</p>
<p>Now out of stealth mode, Atmosec wants to make it more secure for companies to use a flurry of cloud SaaS solutions, from Slack to ServiceNow. Its solution focuses on anomaly detection based on automatic monitoring to notify clients of potential issues and prevent attacks.</p>
<p>Quoting <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1233538/average-number-saas-apps-yearly/">data from Statista</a>, Atmosec points out that the number of SaaS apps used by organizations is on the rise, with an average of 110 in 2021. This makes sense, but also poses security challenges, as many of them &#8220;have inadequate systems to manage third-party risk,&#8221; said Adi Dangot Zukovsky, of Battery Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247403" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This is where Atmosec comes in, Dangot Zukovsky explained, &#8220;with new technology that provides cloud-native enterprises with greater visibility into their existing systems and helps them lower the risk of outsiders exploiting their third-party business applications and app-to-app connectivity paths.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Atmosec&#8217;s seed round counted with participation from other Israeli entrepreneurs in the security space, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/wiz-unveils-new-security-tool-to-protect-code-in-development-pipeline/">Wiz</a>&#8216;s CEO Assaf Rappaport, Talon Cyber&#8217;s CEO Ofer Ben-Noon, and Armis&#8217; co-founders Yevgeny Dibrov and Nadir Izrael. Co-founders Aner Gelman, Misha Seltzer, and Shaked Gitelman are themselves former executives at Armis, which recently raised <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/29/armis-expands-past-iot-with-300m-for-comprehensive-asset-security/">$300 million to expand beyond IoT</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s additional connection between the two startups, Gelman said: &#8220;We’re leveraging some of the technologies and concepts that we helped build out at Armis, and without giving away too many trade secrets, we&#8217;re utilizing continuous machine learning with baseline analysis that identifies anomalies in connections based on actual and potential behavior, not just configurations.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Gelman and his two co-founders all being army intelligence veterans, it is not too surprising that there&#8217;s a bit of secrecy involved. The TL;DR is that understanding the behavior helps Atmosec detect anomalies its clients need to address. But now that the company is out of stealth, it is likely that it will start sharing a bit more with its potential users on how it differentiates from competitors.</p>
<p>Having recently learned that fellow Israeli SaaS security startups Grip Security and Adaptive Shield had respectively raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/grip-security-raises-25m-series-a-for-its-saas-security-platform/">$19 million</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/adaptive-shield-lands-30m-series-a-to-build-out-its-saas-security-platform/">$30 million</a> Series A rounds, this is definitely a hot space we are keen to learn more about.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paying bills is hardly a fun thing. So I think it’s safe to say that any technology that can make the process easier is welcome by all.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://papayapay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Papaya</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a Los Angeles-based startup with a mission to do just that. It has developed technology to give people a way to pay bills outside of traditional methods, such as through the mail, over the phone or via a Web portal. The company’s mobile application lets users take a photo of any bill and then its artificial intelligence-powered “bill-understanding technology” makes sure it gets paid (after a user has provided payment details, of course).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prove the point, CEO and co-founder Patrick Kann demonstrated for me via Zoom how even after tearing up a bill into a few pieces, Papaya’s app was able to scan the pertinent parts of the invoice to make sure it was paid.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247666" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As long as a biller has an electronic payment method, anyone can submit payments through our app,” Kann said. “It’s a true universal payment method.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kann was inspired to start Papaya after growing up in Brazil, where a similar payment technology already exists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People back home were surprised to find out we didn’t have the same capabilities here,” Kann said. “In this respect, the U.S. has been an anomaly, with only 3% of bills being paid by a mobile device. We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">saw a huge business opportunity with mobile bill payments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kann teamed up with computer vision scientist Jason Meltzer, who led development for the computer vision technology behind the Roomba at iRobot, to build Papaya.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of the company is simple: minimize Americans’ bill pay stress by making it easy to pay any bill with their mobile device. It also claims to help businesses of all sizes in all industries as well as governments and municipalities get paid faster and more often.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Papaya is announcing it has raised $50 million in a Series B round of funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from Sequoia Capital, Acrew Capital, 01 Advisors, Mucker Capital, Fika Ventures, F-Prime and Sound Ventures. The financing brings the previously under-the-radar company’s total raised to $65 million since its 2016 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Papaya currently facilitates payments for “hundreds of thousands” of businesses and organizations and millions of users in the U.S. Beyond the mobile app, the company integrates with partners’ billing processes through embedded widget technologies and paper statements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hoping to build on its existing technology with an extensive product roadmap.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2247672" style="width: 233px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247672" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2247672 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ios-onboarding.jpg?w=139" alt="" width="223" height="481" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ios-onboarding.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ios-onboarding.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ios-onboarding.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247672" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Papaya</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Papaya has already come a long way. In its early days, Kann promoted the app by putting stickers with Papaya&#8217;s QR code on people&#8217;s windshields after they got a parking ticket in Las Vegas. Over time, the city added it to their paper notices. Then, the company began working with doctor&#8217;s offices to offer the option to their patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kann prides himself on an 80-person staff that is made up 60% of underrepresented minorities, and a product engineering team that is 45% female. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, its growth has been “completely organic,” with no marketing team, according to the CEO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our cost of customer acquisition is very low relative to a lot of fintechs,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, part of its capital will go toward building awareness and growing its headcount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Kann declined to reveal revenue specifics, he did say Papaya “is on track to acquiring 1 million new active users per year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of revenue, the company’s model is interesting. The app is free for users, and Papaya doesn’t ask for anything “extra” from merchants. Rather, it earns a percentage of revenue from interchange fees that merchants have to pay when they process credit cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bessemer Venture Partners’ Charles Birnbaum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says his firm has been following the Papaya team since it first used its “magical” bill pay app for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s incredibly rare to come across a business that is not only positively impacting millions of consumers by making something painful more seamless but also solving a critical pain point for businesses within several different verticals spanning from healthcare to utilities,” he said. “We have no doubt that the Papaya bill pay experience will become table stakes throughout the consumer financial services landscape in the years to come.&#8221;</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Grindr, a hook-up app for gay, bi, trans and queer people, has been fined around $7.1 million (65M NOK) by Norway&#8217;s data protection authority for passing user data to advertisers without consent &#8212; including highly sensitive information related to users&#8217; sexual orientation.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Grindr, a hook-up app for gay, bi, trans and queer people, has been fined around $7.1 million (65M NOK) by Norway&#8217;s data protection authority for passing user data to advertisers without consent &#8212; including highly sensitive information related to users&#8217; sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Specifically, the <a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/regulations-and-tools/regulations/avgjorelser-fra-datatilsynet/2021/gebyr-til-grindr/">DPA found</a> that Grindr breached Articles 6(1) and 9(1) of Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>The complaint adds to the behavioral advertising industry&#8217;s legal woes &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">continue to pile up in the region</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247806" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The final size of the penalty Grindr has been hit with is a little reduced vs the 100M NOK/$12.1M that the gay dating app was facing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/grindr-on-the-hook-for-e10m-over-gdpr-consent-violations/">back in January</a> &#8212; when the Datatilsynet issued a preliminary decision on the case.</p>
<p>The authority told TechCrunch the smaller sanction takes account of the company having lower turnover in reality than the &#8220;rough estimate&#8221; it had relied upon in January when issuing the preliminary fine,</p>
<p>It also said the reduction takes account of measures Grindr implemented since the complaint was filed with the aim of bringing its processing of personal data in line with GDPR&#8217;s requirements.</p>
<p>The DPA&#8217;s decision notes that the final fine is approximately 32% of the maximum amount possible. And since GDPR allows for fines of up to €20M or up to 4% of an entity&#8217;s total global turnover in the preceding year, whichever is higher, it suggests the US-based app&#8217;s annual revenue does not exceed €20M/$22.5M.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The DPA describes the size of the fine as &#8220;proportionate both to the severity of the infringement and to Grindr’s financial situation&#8221;, asserting that it &#8220;does not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives pursued by the GDPR in the present case&#8221;.</p>
<p>The complaint has taken almost a year to arrive at a final decision owing &#8212; at least in part &#8212; to Grindr requesting extensions to deadlines on a number of occasions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that this investigation was limited to the process Grindr used to obtain consent at the time of the complaint &#8212; in 2019 and up to April 2020 (when it switched to a different method).</p>
<p>So the lawfulness of Grindr&#8217;s current method for obtaining consent has not been investigated.</p>
<p>While the decision does not include any requirements that Grindr (or its ad partners) delete unlawfully obtained user data the DPA told us that that could change in future.</p>
<p>It also confirmed that its investigation against Grindr&#8217;s ad partners (who it sent user data to) is ongoing.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span lang="EN-US">Our decision does not include any erasure requirements at this time but we have also made it clear that further decisions may come at a later date if we deem it necessary,&#8221; said Tobias Judin, director for international issues at Datatilsynet. &#8220;In other words: We are not ruling out any possibilities for further enforcement at this stage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;Now that we have a final decision in the Grindr case, this decision will also inform those investigations,&#8221; he further confirmed of the ad partner probes. </span></p>
<p>The penalty for Grindr tracking users without consent comes at a time when some<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/"> EU lawmakers continue pressing for a ban on surveillance-based advertising</a> &#8212; although a committee vote in the European Parliament this week did not back amending the Digital Services Act to include an outright ban on surveillance-based advertising, as some MEPs have been pressing for.</p>
<p>The committee did back a prohibition on dark patterns to manipulate consent, though. So legal requirements look set to continue to tighten around how adtech can operate in the EU &#8212; and reform of manipulative defaults is being enforced.</p>
<p>See also: The UK&#8217;s data watchdog&#8217;s recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/ico-adtech-reform-opinion/">warned to the industry that the end of tracking is nigh</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement welcoming Norway&#8217;s GDPR slap-down of Grindr, the deputy DG of the European Consumer Organisation, BEUC, Ursula Pachl, said: “Grindr illegally exploited and shared its users’ information for targeted advertising, including sensitive information about their sexual orientation. It is high time the behavioural advertising industry stops tracking and profiling consumers 24/7. It is a business model which clearly breaches the EU’s data protection rules and harms consumers. Let’s now hope this is the first domino to fall and that authorities start imposing fines on other companies as the infringements identified in this decision are standard surveillance ad-tech industry practices.”</p>

<h2>Consent breaches</h2>
<p>Datatilsynet opened the investigation into Grindr after receiving complaints from Norway&#8217;s Consumer Council (NCC) and the European privacy campaign group, noyb, acting on behalf an individual complainant.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/dating-and-fertility-apps-among-those-snitching-to-out-of-control-adtech-report-finds/">Last year</a> the NCC published an analysis of data flows from a number of popular apps (including Grindr but also a number of others) showing how they share data with &#8220;unexpected third parties&#8221;, including entities in the behavioral ad industry to highlight the extent of adtech&#8217;s lawfulness problem.</p>
<p>In its response to the data protection watchdog&#8217;s investigation, Grindr had claimed it had users&#8217; consent to share their data with its advertising partners &#8212; which included Twitter-owned MoPub, Xandr (previously AppNexus), OpenX, AdColony and Smaato.</p>
<p>However the app did not offer users a free choice over whether to agree to its terms or not. If a Grindr user declined to accept its privacy policy during onboarding they were unable to proceed to use the app.</p>
<p>And while Grindr went on to change how it gathers consent &#8212; implementing a consent management platform provided by the third party OneTrust in April 2020 &#8212; as noted above this complaint focuses on how the app was obtaining consent prior to that switch.</p>
<p>The GDPR states that for consent to be a valid legal basis to process personal data it must be informed, specific and <em>freely given </em>(emphasis ours). So the lack of a choice offered to users looks like a very flagrant breach of the rules.</p>
<p>In seeking to avoid a sanction, Grindr also sought to argue that it did not pass information on individual users&#8217; sexuality to advertisers &#8212; claiming it only sent generic keywords (such as &#8220;gay&#8221;, &#8220;bi&#8221; and &#8220;bi-curious&#8221;).</p>
<p>This is important because GDPR has specific rules for so-called &#8220;special category data&#8221; &#8212; requiring an even higher bar of explicit consent from a user if that&#8217;s the legal basis you&#8217;re claiming for processing information such as a person&#8217;s sexual orientation.</p>
<p>In reaching its final decision on the complaint, the Datatilsynet concluded that protections contained in Article 9 of the GDPR (which concerns &#8220;special category data&#8221;) should not be so narrowly interpreted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a Grindr user strongly indicates, and appears in most cases to accurately reflect, that the data subject belongs to a sexual minority. Furthermore, the fact that a data subject belongs to a sexual minority may lead to prejudice and discrimination even without revealing their specific sexual orientation,&#8221; it writes, adding: &#8220;The wording of Article 9 does not require a revealing of a particular &#8216;sexual orientation&#8217;, and the purpose behind Article 9 discourages a narrow interpretation.</p>
<p>&#8220;For these reasons, we find that information that a data subject is a Grindr user is data &#8216;concerning&#8217; the data subject’s &#8216;sexual orientation&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grindr had also sought to suggest that advertisers were unlikely to use categories of special category data for profiling and ad targeting &#8212; telling the DPA it would be surprised if that were the case.</p>
<p>Which is &#8212; to put it mildly &#8212; a surprising argument to try to make, given ample evidence from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/irelands-data-watchdog-slammed-for-letting-adtech-carry-on-biggest-breach-of-all-time/">other GDPR complaints of the highly invasive profiling being carried out by the behavioral ad industry</a>.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that a flagship industry framework that&#8217;s widely used to claim consent to process people&#8217;s data for ad targeting is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">facing a GDPR breach finding itself</a>. As is the online advertising body that controls it.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IAB Europe says it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of GDPR&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/embed/#?secret=Qk2SsAIQ1y" data-secret="Qk2SsAIQ1y" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In any case, Datatilsynet rejected Grindr&#8217;s dodge &#8212; pointing out that it&#8217;s irrelevant how such sensitive data might be further processed, since &#8212; under GDPR &#8212; &#8220;the sharing of personal data concerning a natural person’s &#8216;sexual orientation&#8217; to advertising partners is sufficient to trigger Article 9&#8221;. (Its decision also makes it explicit that it does &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">not agree with the claim that a data subject&#8217;s &#8216;sexual orientation&#8217; is not a category of data that could potentially be used by advertisers to target ads&#8221;.)</span></p>
<p>In another attempt to wiggle out of a GDPR slap-down, Grindr had also sought to argue that even if its advertisers &#8212; theoretically &#8212; received any sensitive personal data they must &#8220;blind&#8221; themselves to, per commitments in its contracts with advertisers.</p>
<p>Moreover it claimed many adtech companies operating in the EU have spent the last decade or so devising so-called &#8220;blinding methods&#8221; which it said obfuscate which app an ad call is coming from.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grindr holds that participants in the ad tech ecosystem would likely only receive a &#8216;blinded&#8217; app-ID and not the corresponding app name,&#8221; the DPA explains in the decision. &#8220;According to Grindr, it is a common practice in the EU for ad networks to nullify the app name and use a random App ID in the ad call so that downstream bidders are &#8216;blind&#8217; to the actual name of the app where the ad is to be served.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, once again, the DPA points out this is irrelevant &#8212; given sensitive data being passed is enough to trigger Article 9 provisions.</p>
<p>The Datatilsynet&#8217;s decision also cites a technical report, by Mnemonic, which showed Grindr&#8217;s app name being shared with MoPub &#8212; &#8220;who further shared this within their mediation network&#8221;. And further notes that Mnemonic&#8217;s report also showed the app name was shared from Grindr to &#8220;multiple other advertising partners&#8221;.</p>
<p>As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, Datatilsynet further points out that Grindr&#8217;s own privacy policy &#8220;explicitly states that &#8216;[o]ur advertising partners are aware that such data is being transmitted from Grindr&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, er,&#8230;. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f974.png" alt="🥴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>(NB: In a further demolition of the self-serving notion of &#8216;blinded&#8217; app-IDs, the DPA goes on to make the point that even if this were happening as claimed by the adtech industry it still wouldn&#8217;t comply with other requirements in the GDPR, noting: &#8220;Even if some advertising partners or other participants in the ad tech ecosystem would &#8216;blind&#8217; themselves or only receive an obfuscated app ID, this is not line with the principle of accountability in Article 5(2) GDPR. Grindr would have to rely on the action of advertising partners or other participants in the ad tech ecosystem to halt its sharing of the data in question.&#8221;)</p>
<p>The DPA&#8217;s analysis goes further in unpicking adtech&#8217;s obfuscating claims vs what&#8217;s really being done with people&#8217;s data vs what EU law <em>actually</em> requires. (So it&#8217;s well worth <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2021-12/Administrative%20fine%20-%20Grindr%20LLC_Public%20version.pdf">reading in full if you&#8217;re interested in devilish detail</a>.)</p>
<p>The long and short of it is that Datatilsynet found Grindr <em>did</em> process users&#8217; sexual orientation data, as set out in <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Article 9(1) &#8212; by &#8220;sharing personal data on a specific user alongside app name or app ID to advertising partners&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>And while the GDPR can allow for consent-based processing of special category data a higher bar of &#8220;explicit&#8221; consent is required for that type of processing to be lawful, again, the DPA found that Grindr had not obtained the required legal standard of permission from users.</p>
<p>Its decision further concludes that Grindr users had not &#8220;manifestly made public&#8221; information about their sexual orientation simply by merit of using the app, as the app had sought to argue (noting, for example, that it allows for an anonymous approach, letting users select a nickname and choose whether or not to upload a selfie).</p>
<p>&#8220;At any rate, it goes beyond the reasonable expectations of the data subject that Grindr would disclose information concerning their sexual orientation to advertising partners. Though information about someone merely being a Grindr user must be considered a special category of personal data under Article 9(1), becoming a Grindr user is not an affirmative act by the data subject to make the information public,&#8221; Datatilsynet adds.</p>
<p>Grindr has been contacted for comment on the sanction.</p>
<p>It has three weeks to lodge an appeal against the decision &#8212; if it wishes to do so.</p>
<p>Datatilsynet&#8217;s order is careful to specify that there may be additional issues related to Grindr&#8217;s prior or current consent mechanism since this investigation was limited to the scope of the complaints which were focused on the lawfulness of its previous consent management platform in the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that potential issues have fallen outside the scope of our investigation does not preclude those issues from being investigated in the future,&#8221; its decision notes.</p>
<p>In a statement commenting on the decision, Ala Krinickytė, a data protection lawyer at noyb, described it as &#8220;astonishing that the DPA has to convince Grindr that its users are LGBT+ and that this fact is not a commodity to be bartered&#8221;.</p>
<p>Krinickytė further summarized the Datatilsynet order thusly: &#8220;You cannot share personal data with a potentially unlimited number of partners without being able to control what happens to that data.”</p>
<p>And that is really the crux of the problem for surveillance-based advertising which relies upon pervasive tracking of Internet users to individually target marketing.</p>
<p>Even setting aside the existential problem of a lack of consent for tracking, the adtech industry does not have processes in place to control what happens to data once it&#8217;s grabbed and &#8216;shared&#8217; with scores of faceless adtech entities involved in the high velocity programmatic auction process known as real-time bidding (RTB).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/gdpr-adtech-complaints-keep-stacking-up-in-europe/">GPDR complaints targeting RTB&#8217;s failure</a> to adequately protect people&#8217;s data have been sitting, unenforced, on EU regulators&#8217; desks for years &#8212; but there are signs that the enforcement blockage is starting to shift, not least as a result of smart, smaller-scale actions such as Norway going after Grindr.</p>
<p>The web of adtech data flows is such a tangled one that even a relative bit player can draw in and implicate scores of others.</p>
<p>The adtech industry&#8217;s workaround for people&#8217;s general distaste at being stalked and creeped on through their devices and digital activity, meanwhile, has been to not <em>actually</em> ask for permission to track and profile them in the first place.</p>
<p>But &#8212; in Europe at least &#8212; that mocking &#8216;consent&#8217; pantomime is finally headed for its end-game.</p>
<p>Whether the alternative targeting processes the industry devises will be just as cynical, manipulative and exploitative as what they&#8217;ve been doing for the past decade+ will largely depend upon regulators and lawmakers driving proper oversight of a sector that&#8217;s been allowed to flourish in the dark, rife with dark patterns and defined by its dark arts.</p>
<p>One negative signal is how the <a href="https://twitter.com/IABEurope/status/1470756093454430216">IAB Europe</a> continues to try to confuse the issue by conflating ad targeting with invasive tracking &#8212; in a bid to lobby MEPs not to outlaw surveillance-based adtech.</p>
<p>In reality, privacy-safe <em>targeting</em> alternatives already exist (such as contextual ads) and have been profitable for years for companies like DuckDuckGo.</p>
<p>The behavioral advertising industry&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">lawfulness problem</a> is in fact directly chainlinked to its mass surveillance of Internet users.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Datatilsynet&#8217;s decision against Grindr in a statement, Finn Myrstad, director of digital policy in the NCC, warned: “This sends a strong signal to all companies involved in commercial surveillance. There are serious repercussions to sharing personal data without a legal basis. We call for the digital advertising industry to make fundamental changes to respect consumers’ rights.”</p>
<p><em>NB: While Norway is not an EU Member it is part of the European Economic Area and it transposed the GDPR into national law in 2018. Additionally, Grindr being a US company without a defined legal entity in the EU opens its business to regulatory oversight by DPAs in any part of the bloc which have concerns (and where it offers a service), rather than oversight being funnelled via gatekeepers like Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission, as has happened with complaints against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">Google&#8217;s adtech</a> for example</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of creating a marketplace for underutilized assets that can turn into a meaningful business for hosts is not a new one. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there is no higher profile of how successful that model can be than Airbnb. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it’s no surprise that one of Airbnb’s most prominent investors, GGV Capital, is now backing another startup with a similar model. But rather than putting properties on a marketplace, <a href="http://swimply.com">Swimply</a> came up with the idea of pairing homeowners with pools with people who want private access to them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so far, business is going swimmingly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep things flowing (couldn’t resist), the startup has just raised $40 million in a funding round led by Mayfield – just seven months after announcing a $10 million financing. Besides Mayfield and GGV, other backers include Colin Shang at Ensemble Ventures and a high-profile list of validating angel investors including Airbnb co-founder Nate Blecharczyk; Casey Winters, formely of Pinterest and Grubhub; Lime co-founder Brad Bao; Rob Chestnut, former chief ethics officer at Airbnb and eBay; Instacart CEO Fidji Simo and Shef&#8217;s Alvin Salehi. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way it works is pretty straightforward. Swimply connects homeowners that have underutilized backyard spaces and pools with people seeking a way to gather, cool off or exercise, for example. People or families can rent pools by the hour at an average price of $45 of $65 per hour depending on the amenities. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247547" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, co-founder Bunim Laskin had told TechCrunch that Swimply was seeing “seven digits a month in revenue” and 15,000 to 20,000 reservations a month.  Over the past six months alone, Swimply has seen 3x growth. In the last year, its site facilitated 250,000 bookings, up from 40,000 all of last year &#8212; up more than 6 times. In 2021, it put 1 million people in 15,000 pools across 103 cities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So while the company declined to reveal its revenues, if it gets a cut of each of those bookings, well, that’s not insignificant. (It charges a 10% guest service fee that it says helps cover insurance support as well as a 15% commission fee from the owner).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surge in demand surprised even co-founders Laskin (who came up with the idea for the company when he was just 20) and Asher Weinberger.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2247730" style="width: 361px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247730" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2247730 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-14-at-8.29.44-PM.png?w=300" alt="" width="351" height="220" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-14-at-8.29.44-PM.png 746w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-14-at-8.29.44-PM.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-14-at-8.29.44-PM.png?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-14-at-8.29.44-PM.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-14-at-8.29.44-PM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247730" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Swimply</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2020, we booked a lot of smaller groups. But this year, with people getting vaccinated [against COVID], we saw more birthday parties being celebrated, swimming lessons coming back and people getting together again for the first time in a while,” Laskin told TechCrunch.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the company is looking to expand beyond pools to outdoor spaces in general. In 2022, it plans to match people up with other “passion” spaces such as underutilized hot tubs, tennis courts, large backyard spaces, rooftops and even one day…indoor gyms. This leads to an indirect sustainability component in that actually using underutilized spaces instead of building new ones that comes with discouraging new construction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swimply is also proud of the fact that it is spawning entrepreneurs. Like Airbnb, Swimply’s hosts have the potential to make big bucks, according to Laskin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the highest-earning host earned a little over $20,000. This year, there were hosts that earned over six figures. In fact, the top 20% of hosts earned around $5,000 per month, Laskin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is turning a lot of people into solopreneurs,” Laskin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s part of the reason Swimply is using some of its new capital to build new tools for its hosts to help them better manage their businesses. As proof of that, some hosts are taking things a step further and doing things like installing vending machines on their properties or offering chef’s services to their guests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also plans to scale up support, insurance and as mentioned previously launch new verticals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some fun stats about the business we found interesting: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty percent of Swimply’s revenue comes from the Los Angeles market. Next up of popular markets are: Austin, Texas; Portland, Oregon; New York City and Maryland. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sixty percent of the bookings are made by families. The average reservation is two hours long.  Repeat reservations make up about 72% of bookings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayfield Managing Director Navin Chaddha notes that his team are “big believers in the sharing economy,” as evidenced not only by its leading this round, but by the firm’s investments another sharing economy startups such as Lyft and Poshmark. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pool market, in particular, is appealing because swimming is one of the top activities for families but very few people have access to pools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Swimply’s mission is to democratize ownership of recreational spaces and to allow hosts to share underutilized assets for their local communities, starting with swimming pools,” he said. “I&#8217;m very, very excited about partnering with Swimply and helping the world get equalized, and not only the rich having access to these amenities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combination of the market opportunity with mission-oriented founders was a big draw for Chaddha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Swimply has seen exploding growth, and we believe the market is much bigger than swimming pools, which in and of itself is a $52 billion market,” he told TechCrunch. “They have the potential to do with Airbnb, Lyft and Poshmark for this constituency. It was a no-brainer to lead a $40 million round for this company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GGV Managing Partner Hans Tung and Principal Robin Li were drawn to Swimply for many of the same reasons that Mayfield was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Li, the prospect of giving people easier and more private access to outdoor spaces is huge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the country club reinvented and even revolutionizing what the YMCA will be like in the future,” she said. “At most of these places, there are so many restrictions on what you can wear, and what you can do. There are so many hurdles to book a place, even in your local neighborhood.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Swimply has so many repeat users is evidence of how easy the experience is, in her view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tung sees a number of parallels between Airbnb and Swimply’s models. But one big difference, he points out, is the frequency at which people travel compared to going swimming or merely spending time outdoors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Swimming is more everyday use and a higher frequency of usage, which makes the platform extremely interesting,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For hosts too, this can be more lucrative, since you are able to rent the same space more than once a day, multiple times a week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Frequency usage is a lot higher than any travel site,” he said. “So like TikTok and Poshmark, Swimply is allowing more everyday people to monetize, and empowering more merchants.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.signal-ai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signal AI</a>, an artificial intelligence startup that trawls the vast sea of internet and other publicly available data to provide organizations with sentiment insights and other information to make better business decisions, has raised $50 million. It plans to use the funds to continue building out its AI platform to bring in more diversified data sources, in order to extract insights across an ever-wider range of business questions that a person might ask.</p>
<p class="p7">&#8220;Organizations still don’t have an effective radar to get ahead of threats and opportunities, and turning challenges into opportunities,&#8221; said David Benigson, the startup&#8217;s CEO, in an interview. The aggregate hundreds of sources of data &#8212; from social and news media through to 25,000 podcasts, regulatory filings and other public records &#8212; into a single platform.</p>
<p class="p7">It then applies machine learning and other AI techniques to extract insights from it all based on natural language questions posed by Signal AI customers. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been diversifying the data that we inject in the platform,&#8221; he added. Signal AI currently works across some 100 languages.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247809" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The funding is coming in the form of a Series D, and it is being led by Highland Europe, with new backer abrdn plus previous backers Redline (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/signal-ai-taps-25m-for-public-data-based-market-intelligence-that-spots-trends-and-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led Signal AI&#8217;s Series C in 2019</a>), MMC, and strategic backers Hearst and Guardian Media Group Ventures also participating. London-based Signal AI has now raised $100 million. It is not disclosing its valuation, but Benigson &#8212; who co-founded the company with Miguel Martinez, the company&#8217;s chief data scientist &#8212; said it grew 100% over the last round.</p>
<p><a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/103080-70/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PItchBook estimates</a> that valuation was around $100 million at that point (in 2019), which would put it at $200 million now, if that figure is accurate. In any case, Signal AI itself has definitely grown. Benigson said that the startup now works with 40% of the Fortune 500, with its customer base including Deloitte, Bank of America and Google.</p>
<p>The challenge that Signal has identified and is building to fix is one that we all encounter every day, but feels particularly acute when it involves businesses navigating tricky issues with potentially billions of dollars of investment at stake if they take the wrong turn.</p>
<p>The internet has equipped us with a vast trove of information, but not always the best keys and maps for unlocking and getting around it, especially when the answers we are looking for are not straightforward, as they are in the case of more fluffy questions around sentiment analysis, or &#8220;answers&#8221; that are actually a collation of information from a number of sources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are a number of companies that have also identified this gap and are building to solve it, including Dataminr (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/dataminr-raises-475m-on-a-4-1b-valuation-for-real-time-insights-based-on-100k-sources-of-public-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a huge round this year at $4.1 billion valuation</a>), Meltwater (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MWTR.OL?p=MWTR.OL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly traded</a> and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/meltwater-has-acquired-datasift-to-double-down-on-social-media-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring businesses</a> to build out its technology muscle), and Cision (now privately held and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/brandwatch-is-acquired-by-cision-for-450m-creating-a-pr-marketing-and-social-listening-giant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making big acquisitions to grow</a>).</p>
<p>Much of the emphasis and impetus for these companies started and still sits squarely in the area of media monitoring &#8212; a huge business tapped not just by other media sources but by companies themselves. Indeed, Signal AI itself used to be called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/ai-fueled-market-intelligence-firm-signal-media-takes-16m-to-tackle-more-targets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signal Media</a> and focused mainly on this area as well.</p>
<p>That in itself is still a big market that is worth disrupting &#8212; the old school way of approaching this was to collate media clippings, provided to clients; the new approach is not just to collate mentions but to deliver more summarized information and insights gleaned from those clips. The more the internet grows, the more clips there will be, and so in fact simply getting a pile of them becomes untenable for even the most enthusiastic teams of communications specialists.</p>
<p>Even so, that model set up for more intelligent media monitoring also paves the way for applying the same format and algorithms to a much wider set of use cases, which is the premise Signal AI has been building upon.</p>
<p>A large part of its work, thus, still remains focused on providing insights to people working around communications strategy, but it&#8217;s deepening the types of information it can provide to them by way of its AIQ platform (as Signal calls it).</p>
<p>Benigson notes that this now includes, for example, more information and &#8220;insights&#8221; for a company on potential business partners; getting up to speed on an aspect of diversity and inclusion and how it&#8217;s being approached by others; a pending decision on environmental strategy; and data to inform a company&#8217;s strategy on regulatory compliance in areas like taxes or data protection.</p>
<p>While comparisons to companies like Dataminr are fair, Benigson said, Signal AI differs from these as it provides more context both in the kinds of queries that can be asked by users, and in the responses that are given. Alongside its business growth, that richer experience is another reason why investors are interested in seeing how the startup will grow.</p>
<p>“Signal AI is a stand out category defining business” said Tony Zappalà, a partner at Highland Europe, in a statement. “We are excited to be involved with the next chapter of the company’s innovative growth. David and the leadership team have a clear vision for the decision augmentation category they are helping to define and as Gartner’s research has shown, the opportunity is huge.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/crypto-company-anchorage-raises-80-million-after-getting-federal-banking-charter/">raising</a> an $80 million Series C round, <a href="https://www.anchorage.com">Anchorage</a> is announcing that it has raised a $350 million Series D round. With today’s funding round, the company has reached a valuation of more than $3 billion.</p>
<p>Anchorage offers a custody solution for big institutions, such as publicly traded companies or funds. On top of that, Anchorage lets you trade crypto assets, stake assets to earn returns and participate in protocol governance if you own a lot of tokens for a specific protocol.</p>
<p>For instance, one transaction has been particularly commented. Back in August, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/8/visa-enters-nfts-cryptopunk-7610-acquisition-interview">Visa acquired a CryptoPunk</a> for 49.5 ETH. At the time, it represented around $150,000. Behind the scenes, Anchorage handled the transaction for Visa.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247434" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>KKR is leading the round, with many, many different investors also participating. So take a deep breath and try to read this sentence out loud in one try: Goldman Sachs, Alameda Research, Andreessen Horowitz, Apollo credit funds, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Blockchain Capital, Delta Blockchain Fund, Elad Gil, GIC, GoldenTree Asset Management, Innovius Capital, Kraken, Lux Capital, PayPal Ventures, Senator Investment Group, Standard Investments, Thoma Bravo and Wellington Management</p>
<p>You may wonder why such a big group of investors want to put some money in Anchorage. That’s because Anchorage received a federal banking charter, turning it into a digital asset bank. It differentiates Anchorage from many custodian products out there.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to improve its product, especially for global financial firms and other fintech companies. Customers can also expect more features with more integrations with DeFi products.</p>
<p>“As a pioneer in enabling institutional investors to access digital assets, Anchorage has built a best in class, institutional grade digital asset platform that combines the best practices of both modern security and usability. We are thrilled to lead this Series D round and work with Diogo, Nathan and their talented team as they continue to support the institutional adoption of digital assets through their differentiated, regulated and integrated suite of solutions,” KKR’s Technology Growth Equity senior leader Ben Pederson said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the past year, Anchorage has increased its number of clients by 96%. The company’s headcount has also increased by quite a lot with a 175% jump compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>With its federal banking charter, Anchorage has a good barrier to entry in case other companies want to compete in the same space. As companies realize that crypto assets are more than a fad, they’ll increasingly look for trustworthy partners to interact with the crypto ecosystem. And some of them will certainly end up working with Anchorage.</p>
