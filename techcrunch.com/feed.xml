										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Latin America’s startup scene has attracted troves of venture investment, lifting highly-valued companies such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/softbank-makes-a-huge-bet-on-latin-america/">Rappi</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/fintech-decacorn-nubank-raises-400m-led-by-tcv/"> NuBank</a> into behemoth businesses. Now that the spotlight has arrived, those same startups need more talent than ever before to meet demand.</p>
<p>That’s where one seed-stage Buenos-Aires startup wants to help. <a href="https://www.soyhenry.com/">Henry </a>has created an online computer science school that trains software developers from low-income backgrounds to understand technical skills and get employed. The company was founded by brother-sister duo <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luzborchardt/">Luz</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-borchardt?originalSubdomain=ar">Martin Borchardt</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbarnaferres/">Manuel Barna Ferrés</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoniotralice/">Antonio Tralice</a>, and Leonardo Maglia.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2082887" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082887" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2082887 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HENRY-TEAM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HENRY-TEAM.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HENRY-TEAM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HENRY-TEAM.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HENRY-TEAM.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HENRY-TEAM.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HENRY-TEAM.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HENRY-TEAM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082887" class="wp-caption-text">The Henry team.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company claims that there’s an estimated 1 million software engineering job openings in Latin America, but less than 100,000 professionals that have training suitable for those roles.</p>
<p>“Higher education is only for 13 percent of the population in Latin America,” says Martin Borchardt, CEO and co-founder of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/henry-18a0" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="henry-18a0">Henry <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. “It’s very exclusive, very expensive, and has very low impact skills. So we’re giving these people an opportunity.”</p>
<p>With 90% of graduates coming from no formal higher education background, Henry seeks to help bring more back-end junior developers and full-stack developers into startups. Henry offers a five-month long course that goes from Monday to Friday, 9 a.m to 6 p.m., which focuses on software developer skills. Beyond technical training, Henry gives participants job coaching, resume workshops, and up-skilling opportunities post-graduation.</p>
<p>To make the school more affordable, Henry looks to take on the same strategy used by Lambda School, a YC-graduate that has raised over $122 million in known funding: income-share agreements. The set-up would allow for boot camp participants to join the program at 0 upfront costs, and then only pay once they get hired at a job.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As edtech grows cash rich, some lessons for early stage&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/as-edtech-grows-cash-rich-some-lessons-for-early-stage/embed/#?secret=19wBVWdInO" data-secret="19wBVWdInO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lambda School’s ISA terms ask students to pay 17% of their monthly salary for 24 months once they earn $4,167 monthly. The students pay a maximum of $30,000. Henry takes a much smaller slice of the pie, partly because salaries are lower in Latin American than in the United States. Henry asks students to pay 15% of their monthly salary for 24 months once students earn $500 a month.</p>
<p>If a Henry student doesn&#8217;t get employed in a job that allows them to make $500 a month within 5 years after the program completes, they are off the hook for paying the bootcamp back.</p>
<p>Henry is also focused is helping more women get into the field of software development. Internally, Henry&#8217;s remote team is 20% women, 64% men. The current students reflect the same break down.</p>
<p>One issue with coding bootcamps is that while it might help a student go from unemployed to employed, the lack of credential and degree might limit career mobility past that first job. For that reason, Henry has created a database of alumni resources, including up-skilling and reskilling opportunities in the latest skill that will be free of charge for graduates.</p>
<p>Henry needs to execute on job placement to be successful in its field. Currently, over 80% of students in Henry’s first cohort have found jobs, but it’s too soon in the startups’ trajectory to get a stronger metric on that front. About 4 Henry graduates have been employed by the startup.</p>
<p>The need for more talent in emerging countries has not gone unnoticed. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/investors-bet-millions-on-microverse-a-lambda-school-for-the-developing-world/">Microverse</a>, also funded by Y Combinator, is similarly using income-sharing agreements to bring education to the masses in developing countries, including spaces in Latin America. Henry thinks the competitor is approaching the dynamic too broadly.</p>
<p>“They’re focusing on all emerging markets and don’t teach to Spanish speakers,” Borchardt said. Henry, alternatively, focuses on Spanish speakers, over 60% of its market in Latin America.</p>
<p>What if Lambda School, the source of Henry&#8217;s inspiration, was to break into Latin America? The founder added that the richly-funded company has tried, and failed, to expand into international geographies including China and Europe due to fragmentation.</p>
<p>Currently, Henry has graduated 200 students and is working with 600 students across Colombia, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina. It plans to expand into Mexico and bring on Portuguese instruction.</p>
<p>Now, VCs are giving Henry some cash to do so. After going through Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer batch, Henry announced today that it has raised $1.5 million in seed funding in a round led by Accion Venture Lab. Emles Venture Partners, Noveus VC. There were also a number of edtech angel investors from Latin American who participated in the round.</p>
<p>“I love the human interaction within instructors and our staff and students,” Borchardt said. “That is something very powerful of Henry compared to a MOOC. The biggest challenge is how do you scale maintaining those assets that bring you that?”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://esportsone.com/">Esports One</a>, a startup bringing the fantasy approach to esports, is announcing that it has raised an additional $4 million in funding.</p>
<p>When I first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/esports-one-launches-its-fantasy-esports-platform/">wrote about Esports One in April</a>, co-founder and COO Sharon Winter described it as the first &#8220;all-in-one fantasy platform&#8221; in the esports world, allowing you to research players, create fantasy teams and watch games, with an initial focus on the North American and European divisions of League of Legends.</p>
<p>According to the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/esports-one" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="esports-one">Esports One <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> team, creating this platform required building out a set of data and analytics products, as well as using computer vision technology that can track game activity (and update player stats) without relying on a publisher&#8217;s API.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup says its user base has been growing by more than 25% month-over-month. It may also have benefited from the pause in professional sports earlier this year, while CEO and co-founder Matt Gunnin told me recently that he also sees fantasy as a way to make video games accessible to a broader audience — he recalled one Esports One user who introduce his sister to League of Legends using the fantasy platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;I use the example of growing up and sitting there with my dad, watching a baseball game, he&#8217;s telling me everything that’s happening,&#8221; Gunnin said. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s the opposite — parents are sitting and watching their kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many parents, he suggested, are &#8220;never going to pick up a mouse and keyboard and play League of Legends,&#8221; but they might play the fantasy version: &#8220;That’s an entry point &#8230; if we can make it easily accessible to individuals both that are hardcore gamers playing video games and watching League of Legends their entire life, as well as someone who has no idea what’s going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new funding was led led by XSeed Capital, Eniac Ventures, and Chestnut Street Ventures, bringing Esports One to a total of $7.3 million raised. The company also recently signed a partnership deal with lifestyle company <a href="https://www.eslgaming.com">ESL Gaming</a>.</p>
<p>Gunin said the money will allow the company to grow its Bytes virtual currency, which players use to enter contests and buy customizations — starting next year, players will be able to spend real money to purchase Bytes. In addition, it&#8217;s working on native iOS and Android apps (Esports One is currently accessible via desktop and mobile web).</p>
<p>Gunnin and his team also plan to develop fantasy competitions for Rainbow Six: Siege, Rocket League, Valorant and Fortnite.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a fairly new player in the esports world, we’ve seen immense determination and grit from Matt, Sharon, and the whole Esports One team to grow into a household name, ” said XSeed&#8217;s Damon Cronkey in a statement. “I’m excited to be partnering with a company that will deliver new perspectives and features to an evolving industry. We’re eager to see how Esports One grows in 2021.”</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Like many things in life, building great businesses is all about timing. We’ve seen multibillion dollar failures from the dot-com era such as Pets.com and Webvan be reincarnated a decade later as Chewy and Instacart &#8212; this time as runaway successes.</p>
<p>The same could be said about real estate technology companies, but startups in this category have not gotten the same opportunity and attention as their peers in other sectors.</p>
<p>For decades, proptech has received the short end of the stick. Real estate is the world&#8217;s largest asset class worth $277 trillion, three times the total value of all publicly traded companies. Still, fintech companies have received seven times more VC funding than real estate companies.</p>
<p>These lower levels of investment were previously attributed to the slow rate of technology adoption and digitalization within the real estate industry, but this is no longer the case. Companies in real estate are adopting innovation faster than ever. Now, 81% of real estate organizations plan to use new digital technologies in traditional business processes and spending on tech and software is growing at over 11% per year. Technological adoption has even accelerated throughout the pandemic as enterprises were forced to quickly adapt.</p>
<p>Historically, the strength or weakness of the broader economy and the real estate industry have been tightly coupled and correlated. While some may point to COVID-19&#8217;s negative impact on certain parts of real estate as evidence that proptech can only thrive in boom times, I believe building a successful proptech company is less about anticipating economic upswings and markets and more about timing and taking advantage of the right technological trends. In short, this is as good of a time as any to start a proptech company if you know where to look.</p>
<p>History is littered with examples of companies that have done just this. Let’s take a look at three:</p>
<h2>Procore</h2>
<ul>
<li>Founded: 2002.</li>
<li>Early traction: Used by celebrity housing projects in California.</li>
<li>Inflection point: 2012 (people start using iPads and smartphones on job sites).</li>
<li>Today: $5 billion valuation as of May 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/procore-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="procore-technologies">Procore <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was founded in 2002 in the aftermath of the dot-com bust, well before widespread WiFi and five years before the iPhone. The company saw the capability for software and technology to transform the construction industry long before practitioners did. Its team faithfully and stubbornly kept at it through the financial crisis, but only had $5 million in revenue by 2012. Here’s where the timing kicks in: At this time, iPads and smartphones had become more common on worksites, enabling widespread adoption.</p>
<p>Realizing this change in-market and adapting to it, Procore strategically priced its product as a subscription, rather than based on headcount, as was typical in the industry. In this way, early customers like Wieland and Mortenson got their subcontractors and temp employees to use the product, which then created a flywheel effect that spread Procore to other projects and clients. Fast forward to today, Procore now has more than $290 million in ARR and is valued over $5 billion.</p>
<p>Procore&#8217;s persistence and agility ultimately enabled it to capitalize on the right technological trends and shifts, despite what initially seemed like a poorly timed decision to start a software company in a recession. Procore is now on a venture exit path as it continues to acquire new-age proptech companies like Avata Technologies, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/honest-buildings" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="honest-buildings">Honest Buildings <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and BIMAnywhere.</p>
<h2>Zillow</h2>
<ul>
<li>Founded: 2006.</li>
<li>Early traction: Launched with 1 million website visits.</li>
<li>Inflection point: 2009 (financial crisis mindset).</li>
<li>Today: Public — $27 billion market capitalization.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zillow" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zillow">Zillow <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was founded by the co-founders of Hotwire and Expedia. While that might not seem relevant, the vision to bring transparency to consumers is the connecting line, the mission being to provide access to siloed data and knowledge to previously convoluted industries. Before Zillow, homeowners did not know how much their house was worth. With Zillow’s Zestimate, consumers can put a price tag on every roof across North America.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<li>Once the program kicks in after December 31, participating developers won&#8217;t be able to transfer apps to/from other accounts — presumably so that people don&#8217;t go &#8220;Oh, this app is making too much money. Quick, switch it to another account!&#8221;. &#8220;If you initiate an app transfer after December 31, 2020, or accept a transfer of an app that was initiated after December 31, 2020,&#8221; Apple writes, &#8220;you will no longer be eligible to participate in program.&#8221;</li>
<li>If you oversee multiple developer accounts, Apple wants you to identify them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple says that if you enroll by December 18, reduced fees should be active by January 1 of 2021. Existing developers can still enroll after that cutoff, but things get a bit more complicated, with reduced fees generally kicking in midway through the next fiscal calendar month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> has announced an ambitious new product today called <a href="https://stripe.com/treasury">Stripe Treasury</a>. The company is partnering with banks to offer a banking-as-a-service API. In other words, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stripe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stripe">Stripe <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> clients will be able to provide bank accounts to their customers — the service is invite-only for now.</p>
<p>This is part of a bigger trend called embedded finance. Essentially, instead of separating banking services from other services that you use, embedded finance products provide financial services as close as possible to the end customer in the services that they already use.</p>
<p>Other companies have been working on embedded business banking products, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/wise-raises-another-12-million-to-double-down-on-embedded-business-banking/">Wise</a>. Stripe could take advantage of its existing user base to convince them to use Stripe Treasury for new banking products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shopify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shopify">Shopify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will use Stripe Treasury for <a href="https://www.shopify.com/balance">Shopify Balance</a>. If a Shopify merchant wants to hold money, pay bills and spend money from their Shopify account, they can open a bank account in Shopify Balance directly. This way, they can skip the traditional bank account. Behind the scenes, Stripe Treasury powers that feature.</p>
<p>And yet, Stripe doesn’t want to become a bank. As usual, the company is focused on infrastructure and payments. It partners with banks, such as Evolve Bank and Goldman Sachs in the U.S. Eventually, Stripe also plans to launch Stripe Treasury in other countries thanks to partnerships with Citibank and Barclays.</p>
<p>Stripe turns everything into API calls. An API is a programming interface that lets you interact with third-party services using simple instructions. For instance, a developer can take advantage of Stripe Treasury to open bank accounts directly from their service by triggering Stripe’s API.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can move money or pay bills using API calls. Combined with <a href="https://stripe.com/issuing">Stripe Issuing</a>, you can also issue a virtual or physical card and connect it to a bank account. Slowly, Stripe is building products that cover a bigger chunk of the payment chain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Advancements in the tech and the cyber threat landscape are creating vast job opportunities. The global cyber security market is projected to reach £210 billion by 2026. But in the UK, out of 952,000 working aged (16-64) UK military veterans and 15,000 service leavers a year, only 4% of them are working in tech and cyber. This is 20% lower than the non-veteran population. The cost to the UK economy of underemployed or unemployed veterans has been estimated at £1.5 billion over 5 years. This means all this talent &#8211; talent which has literally been trained to adapt to fast-moving situations like the one the world finds itself in now &#8211; is going to waste, just when the era of massive digitization of business and society is upon us.</p>
<p>So it’s significant that the UK’s <a href="https://www.rfea.org.uk/">RFEA</a>, the Forces Employment charity, is launching a new partnership with <a href="http://TechVets.co">TechVets</a>, the non-profit set up to build a bridge for veterans into cyber security and the technology sector.</p>
<p>With the RFEA’s support, TechVets will create extensive new free upskilling and job opportunities for ‘tech-curious’ service leavers and veterans, through its offering of networking, mentoring, signposting and training services, via its new TechVets Academy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The initiative is timely. It’s estimated that over 173,000 UK military veterans are at risk due to the economic impact of COVID and the ending of the government&#8217;s furlough scheme in March 2021.</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2018, TechVets has grown to a community of over 6,000 members and several ‘chapters’ around the UK.</p>
<p>TechVets uses a blend of open-source resources, partner training, and community support, to empower those new to cyber/tech to choose the pathway that is best for them. And it’s all free to veterans and service leavers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/thumbnail_James-Murphy-BW-3-Copy-1.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="535" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2082757" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/thumbnail_James-Murphy-BW-3-Copy-1.jpg 520w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/thumbnail_James-Murphy-BW-3-Copy-1.jpg?resize=146,150 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/thumbnail_James-Murphy-BW-3-Copy-1.jpg?resize=292,300 292w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/thumbnail_James-Murphy-BW-3-Copy-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/thumbnail_James-Murphy-BW-3-Copy-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></p>
<p>TechVets Programme Director, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-m-062/">James Murphy</a> (pictured), is an Army Veteran of 19 years. He joined the 1st Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment in 2000, before transferring to the Intelligence Corps in 2013 after sustaining life-long injuries in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In a statement, he said: “Anyone who has held a role in the Forces comes armed with an understanding of the sensitivities of working in security. Ex-Services also possess an innate ability to learn new skills and are natural problem solvers, who can work quickly and fit into a team with ease. Ex-military personnel are also the kind of people who thrive in pressurized, or time-sensitive, situations. These soft skills are incredible assets in the security and technology industries, which can be used to fill the current skills shortage in this area.”</p>
<p>RFEA’s Chief Executive Officer, Alistair Halliday, added: “The TechVets Programme is a fantastic new addition to RFEA’s services that will, no doubt, encourage talented veterans to consider tech and security-based roles that may have otherwise overlooked. It will also help veterans to upskill digitally to help them get into wider roles too.”</p>
<p>TechVets member Gareth Paterson, joined the Army in 1994. He started out as a Tank crewman and then transferred to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers as an instructor in 2001. He left in 2018, having completed operational tours of Northern Ireland, Former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan. He says his life has been changed by TechVets: “I left the Army as I was at the end of my 24-year career… I did not have a clue what career to move into, then I was introduced to offensive cybersecurity and penetration testing. I joined TechVets and it gave me my first insight into the tools and techniques of penetration testing. After that, I was hooked! The support of everyone at TechVets, and its community, has helped me to gain confidence and push harder. I was able to gain qualifications in penetration testing which improved my job prospects in the sector. By November 2018 I started working as a cybersecurity consultant.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334545842972332032">shutting down</a> its experimental app twttr, which the company had used publicly prototype new features back in 2019. The app was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/13/a-first-look-at-twitters-new-beta-app-and-its-bid-to-remain-valuable-and-relevant/">introduced</a> at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2019, then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/twitters-new-prototype-app-twttr-launches-today/">launched</a> to testers that March. Its primary focus had been on trying out new designs for threaded conversations, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/twitter-rolls-out-changes-to-threaded-conversations-following-tests-in-its-prototype-app-twttr/">things</a> like how to branch replies, apply labels and color-code responses, among other things. Some of those tests <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/twitter-rolls-out-changes-to-threaded-conversations-following-tests-in-its-prototype-app-twttr/">eventually turned into Twitter features</a> and the twttr app was no longer being used.</p>
<p>The idea to design in public was an interesting experiment by Twitter.</p>
<p>Most companies roll out internal beta tests, followed by smaller-scale A/B tests to a percentage of their public user base to get feedback about new ideas. But with twttr, the company actually invited its users to be a part of the much earlier stage development process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The concept for twttr had been spearheaded by Twitter&#8217;s then Director of Product Management, <a href="https://twitter.com/pandemona">Sara Beykpour</a> (then Sara Haider &#8212; she and Twitter Product Lead Kayvon Beykpour have since <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz">married</a>). But Sara announced last year she would be stepping into a new role at the company and Twitter&#8217;s new product director in charge of conversations would be Suzanne Xie, who had joined by way of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/twitter-picks-up-team-from-narrative-app-lightwell-in-its-latest-effort-to-improve-conversations/">Twitter&#8217;s acquisition of Lightwell</a>.</p>
<p>Work on twttr appeared to stop around the time Xie stepped in, as no other significant updates were released to twttr&#8217;s TestFlight user base. And <a href="https://twitter.com/suzannexie/status/1315707645257420805">Xie left Twitter this fall</a> for Stripe.</p>
<p>Now, it seems that maintaining the largely unused app no longer makes sense for the company.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We appreciate the feedback you gave us through this run of our prototype app twttr. For now we’re turning it off so we can work on new tests to improve the conversation experience on Twitter.</p>
<p>If you’re using twttr, switch to the main Twitter app to keep up with what’s happening. <a href="https://t.co/xq4emx9HeH">https://t.co/xq4emx9HeH</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334545842972332032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334545842972332032">announced</a> its plans to formally shut down twttr today, saying it was turning off the app in order to work on new tests related to the conversation taking place on Twitter itself. The shutdown appears to be immediate. Though the app may still function for those who have it installed, when the TestFlight build expires in 26 days, that may no longer be the case.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not likely that twttr had many dedicated users at this point, especially as the app lacked Twitter&#8217;s newer features like Topics and Fleets, for example, and was no longer offering new experiments to test.</p>
<p>Twitter is not ruling out using twttr again at some point in the future, though. A spokesperson said the company is &#8220;exploring potential next steps for twttr&#8221; as it develops its future plans to test new products.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[With automation and intent data, brands can more easily connect with leads, prospects, and customers at a personal, intimate level.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coronavirus is causing large and small businesses to drastically cut marketing budgets. In Forrester’s self-described “most optimistic scenario,” the analysts project a <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/The+2020+COVID19+Crisis+Will+Stun+US+Marketing/-/E-RES160724">28% drop</a> in U.S. marketing spend by the end of 2021. Even Google is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2020/04/29/google-slashes-its-marketing-budget-what-does-this-mean/#362198806aa5">cutting its marketing budget in half</a>. As marketers move forward, <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/The+2020+COVID19+Crisis+Will+Stun+US+Marketing/-/E-RES160724">Forrester predicts marketing automation platforms</a> will grow despite an overall decline in marketing technology investment.</p>
<p>Automation platforms help marketers scale their communications. However, scaling communications is not a substitute for intimacy, which all humans crave. Because of the pandemic, it is harder than ever to get attention, let alone make a connection. More mass email blasts from your marketing automation platform are not going to get you the connections with prospects you crave. So how should marketers proceed? Direct mail captures 100% of your audience&#8217;s attention. It provides a sensory experience for your prospects and customers, and that helps establish an <a href="https://twosidesna.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2018/05/Using_Neuroscience_To_Understand_The_Role_Of_Direct_Mail.pdf">emotional connection</a>.</p>
<p>Winning marketers are strategically merging automation and digital data with the more intimate channel of direct mail. We call this <a href="http://pfl.com">tactile marketing automation</a> (TMA).</p>
<p>TMA is the integration of direct mail or personalized swag with a marketing automation platform. With TMA, a marketer doesn’t have to think about creating direct mail campaigns outside of digital campaigns. Rather, direct mail experiences are already fully integrated into the pre-built customer journey.</p>
<p>TMA uses intent data to inform content, messaging and the timing of direct mail touchpoints that maximize relevancy and scalability. Multichannel campaigns including direct mail report an ROI <a href="https://www.pfl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PFL_State_of_Multichannel_v5.pdf">18 percentage points higher</a> than those without direct mail. Plus, 84% of marketers state direct mail improves multichannel campaign performance.</p>
<p>Read on to see how you can merge digital communications and direct mail to deliver remarkable experiences that spark a connection.</p>
<h2>Incorporate intent data</h2>
<p>Personalization is a key ingredient of a remarkable experience. Many marketers automate processes by introducing marketing software and then call it personalization. But, oftentimes it’s just quicker batching and blasting. Brands can’t just change the first name on a piece of content and call it “personalized.” <em>Real</em> personalization is necessary and vital for <em>real </em>results. Our consumers expect more. The best way to introduce <em>real</em> personalization within a marketing mix is to use intent data and trigger-driven campaigns.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>That includes movies like &#8220;Godzilla vs. Kong,&#8221; &#8220;Mortal Kombat,&#8221; &#8220;In The Heights,&#8221; &#8220;Space Jam: A New Legacy&#8221; &#8220;The Suicide Squad,&#8221; &#8220;Dune,&#8221; the &#8220;Sopranos&#8221; prequel &#8220;The Many Saints of Newark&#8221; and &#8220;The Matrix 4.&#8221; (The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/warnermedia" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="warnermedia">WarnerMedia <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announcement notes that release dates could change, which might move some of these titles out of the scope of today&#8217;s announcement.)</p>
<p>These movies will be available on HBO Max for one month, in 4K Ultra HD and HDR, at no additional charge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this year, Hollywood studios responded to widespread theatrical closures by bringing some films straight to streaming while delaying their big releases. The disappointing box office performance of &#8220;Tenet&#8221; (also from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/warner-bros" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="warner-bros">Warner Bros.) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/media-roundup-google-to-cut-big-checks-for-news-publishers-substack-continues-to-draw-top-creators-more/">prompted additional delays</a> — but as the pandemic stretched on, there was a growing sense that studios couldn&#8217;t afford to delay things forever.</p>
<p>For example, Universal had already <a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/amc-universal-deal-entertainment-industry-future-1234718942/">reached a deal with AMC</a> and other major chains to release movies on premium video on demand just three weeks after they launch in theaters, with the revenue split with theatrical partners.</p>
<p>But WarnerMedia&#8217;s announcement seems like an even more dramatic shift — and while it only covers 2021, it could signal potentially long-lasting changes to theaters&#8217; exclusive release window.</p>
<p>This also comes after former Hulu CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/warnermedias-new-boss-is-former-hulu-ceo-jason-kilar/">Jason Kilar took over as WarnerMedia&#8217;s chief executive</a> in April, a move (followed by <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2020-11-10/att-warnermedia-begins-new-round-of-layoffs-amid-reorganization">multiple rounds of layoffs</a>) that seemed to put streaming front-and-center in the company&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>In a statement, Kilar said:</p>
<blockquote><p>After considering all available options and the projected state of moviegoing throughout 2021, we came to the conclusion that this was the best way for WarnerMedia’s motion picture business to navigate the next 12 months. More importantly, we are planning to bring consumers 17 remarkable movies throughout the year, giving them the choice and the power to decide how they want to enjoy these films. Our content is extremely valuable, unless it’s sitting on a shelf not being seen by anyone. We believe this approach serves our fans, supports exhibitors and filmmakers, and enhances the HBO Max experience, creating value for all.</p></blockquote>

<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/bill-gates" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="bill-gates">Bill Gates, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the co-founder of Microsoft and one of the world&#8217;s richest men and most prolific philanthropists, has just released a broad new plan on <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/How-the-US-can-lead-on-climate-change-innovation">how the U.S. could take the lead in the fight against climate change</a>.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;[We] need to revolutionize the world’s physical economy—and that will take, among other things, a dramatic infusion of ingenuity, funding, and focus from the federal government. No one else has the resources to drive the research we need,&#8221; Gates writes. </span></p>
<p>With a new Biden administration set to take over the reins of government, the timing for Gates&#8217; suggestions couldn&#8217;t be better. The outgoing Trump Administration was singularly opposed to combating climate change, rolling back regulations,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/if-elected-biden-commits-to-rejoin-climate-accord-u-s-just-abandoned/"> withdrawing from international agreements on climate change mitigation</a> and sweeping aside science in favor of specious arguments from the industries that had the most to lose from a recognition of the threats of anthropogenic climate change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rjQFUa6s1Y"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/if-elected-biden-commits-to-rejoin-climate-accord-u-s-just-abandoned/">If elected, Biden commits to rejoin climate accord US just abandoned</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;If elected, Biden commits to rejoin climate accord US just abandoned&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/if-elected-biden-commits-to-rejoin-climate-accord-u-s-just-abandoned/embed/#?secret=rjQFUa6s1Y" data-secret="rjQFUa6s1Y" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Gates calls for a dramatic $25 billion boost in spending that would bring clean energy research spending to $35 billion a year (in line with medical spending from the government). Gates notes that this could lead to the <a href="https://www.breakthroughenergy.org/reports/energy-randd-impact">creation of more than 370,000 jobs</a> while boosting a clean-energy agenda.</p>
<p>Gates noted that Americans spend more on gasoline in a single month than the government spends on climate-related research.</p>
<p>Beyond simply spending more money on research, the Microsoft-made billionaire called for the creation of a network of &#8220;National Institutes of Energy Innovation.&#8221;</p>
<div class="TGN_Article_ReadTimeSection">
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;This is the most important thing the U.S. can do to lead the world in innovations that will solve climate change,&#8221; Gates wrote.</span></p>
<p>Modeled on the National Institutes of Health, the largest financier for biomedical research in the world, Gates called for the Energy Innovation Institutes to comprise separate institutions focusing on specific areas. One would be an Institute of Transportation Decarbonization while others could focus on energy storage, renewables or carbon capture and management, Gates wrote.</p>
<p>Gates also suggested that each organization should be tasked with the commercialization for innovations that come out of the lab. &#8220;It&#8217;s not enough to develop a new way to store electricity that works in the lab &#8212; to have any imapact, it has to be practical and affordable in real-world settings. The best way to ensure that is to encourage scientists to start their research with an end-use in mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, Gates called for the institutes to be located around the country &#8212; just like the Department of Energy or the NASA have laboratories and research facilities spread around the country.</p>
<p>In addition to the research facilities and spending boosts, Gates called for a program of tax incentives and energy standards that could make markets for more clean-energy tools.</p>
<p><span class="normaltextrun">There are already pieces of legislation making their way through Congress like the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4447" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Clean Energy Innovation and Jobs Act</a><span class="normaltextrun"> and </span><a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/american-energy-innovation-act-aeia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the American Energy Innovation Act</a><span class="normaltextrun"> that could help the federal government move toward a more nimble and focused setup, Gates acknowledged. But both of these laws have stalled. </span></p>
</div>
<p>Gates&#8217; climate plan <a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/top-companies-call-for-ambitious-us-climate-policy/">comes as more than 40 major U.S. companies penned an open letter to the incoming Biden Administration</a> to do more to address climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our communities and our economy are enduring not only a devastating pandemic but also the rising costs of climate change,&#8221; the companies wrote. &#8220;Record wildfires, flooding, hurricanes and other extreme weather are upending lives and livelihoods. And science makes clear that future generations will face far greater environmental, economic and health impacts unless we act now.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yesterday, the medical journal <em>Lancet<a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32290-X/fulltext"> </a></em><a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32290-X/fulltext">released a sweeping survey</a> documenting the health impacts associated with environmental catastrophes, pollution and climate change.</p>
<p>Heat waves, air pollution and extreme weather increasingly damage human health, the report said. <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/02/940790818/we-dont-have-to-live-this-way-doctors-call-for-climate-action">As National Public Radio reported</a>, the report<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> makes an explicit connection between death, disease and burning fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Many carbon-intensive practices and policies lead to poor air quality, poor food quality, and poor housing quality, which disproportionately harm the health of disadvantaged populations,&#8221; the authors of <em>The Lancet</em> analysis wrote.</p>
<p>Even in a divided government, there&#8217;s much the Biden administration can do to make a significant dent in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/a-biden-presidency-doesnt-need-a-green-new-deal-to-make-progress-on-climate-change/">TechCrunch reported</a>, a large portion of any infrastructure-related stimulus could contain significant spending on climate change mitigation-related technologies.</p>
<p>“A lot of the really consequential climate-related stuff that’s going to come out in the [near term] … won’t actually be related to renewables,” an advisor to the President-elect said.</p>
<p>However, if the Democrats manage to wrest control of the Senate from Republican leadership in the aftermath of the January 2021 runoff elections in Georgia, then the possibility of a more muscular climate agenda &#8212; one that could incorporate Gates&#8217; suggestions &#8212; could be on the table.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nasa" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nasa">NASA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has selected the winning candidates that they&#8217;ve decided to tap to collect lunar resources for eventual Earth return, from a number of commercial companies who applied. The four companies all have rides booked on future commercial lunar lander missions, and the agency is using this as a demonstration of what kinds of efficiencies it can realize by piggybacking on private industry for serving its needs – and a precedent-setting event for NASA paying private companies to retrieve materials that they retrieved and owned privately for their own purposes prior to transferring ownership to the agency.</p>
<p>The winning bids were evaluated based on two simple criteria: Basically, were they technically feasible, and how much did they cost. There were four winners, each with a different ride out, which will seek to satisfy the conditions of NASA&#8217;s request, which is basically to collect a lunar regolith (essentially what we call &#8216;soil&#8217; on the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/moon-ba85" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="moon-ba85">Moon) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in an amount ranging from between 50 grams or 500 grams, with retrieval to be handled separately by NASA at a later date. The samples had to be collected before 2024 as part of the request, which sets them up for potential retrieval via NASA&#8217;s Artemis mission series, though the agency isn&#8217;t necessarily going to actually pick up the samples, though it reserves the option to do so.</p>
<p>The four companies selected are:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>Lunar Outpost, from Golden, Colorado, which bid to complete the contract for just $1, following the arrival of the Blue Origin lunar lander in 2023.</li>
<li>ispace Japan, which asked for $5,000 for a retrieval via the landing of its Hakuto-R lander during its first mission currently set for 2022.</li>
<li>ispace Europe, a part of ispace Japan&#8217;s global corporate footprint, which bid for $5,000 and an arrival in 2023 on the second Hakuto-R mission.</li>
<li>Masten Space Systems, which asked for $15,000, with an arrival in 2023 using its Masten XL lander</li>
</ul>
<p>The agency received 22 proposals in total, between 16 and 17 companies. This was intentionally designed to help NASA demonstrate the advantages of its public-private partnerships approach, and to set precedents about how resource material collection can happen on extra-terrestrial bodies like the Moon.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the commercial partnerships, this is setting a precedent internally as well as externally, relative to NASA continuing that paradigm,&#8221; said NASA’s Acting Associate Administrator for International and Interagency Relations Mike <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gold" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gold">Gold <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. &#8220;Rather than pay for the development of the systems themselves, NASA is playing the role is customer.&#8221;</p>
<p>More specifically, these contracts also set precedents in terms of what private companies can do in terms of collecting material from the Moon, and who has ownership of that material once collected.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve often said that the rocket science part, the engineering, sometimes that seems like the easy aspect when it comes to all of the policy issues, legal, or financial challenges that we have,&#8221; Gold said. &#8220;It&#8217;s very important that we resolve any legal or regulatory questions in advance because we never want policy, or regulations to slow down or hinder incredible innovations in development that we&#8217;re seeing from both the public and the private sector. So we think it&#8217;s very important to establish the precedent that the private sector entities can extract can take these resources that NASA can purchase, and utilize them to fuel, not only NASA&#8217;s activities, but a whole new dynamic era of public and private development and exploration on the Moon, and then eventually to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mars" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mars">Mars <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Basically, NASA wants this to set a precedent that private companies can go to the Moon, and eventually Mars, and mine material and retain ownership of said material for later distribution to both public and other private customers.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s part of the reason these bids are so low – companies like ispace and Lunar Outpost have future business models that involve significant potential planetary body mining components. The other is that these lunar lander missions were already planned, and as NASA explicitly laid out in their request for proposals for this bid, the agency did not want to pay for any development costs for the mission of getting to the Moon itself – just the actual collection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.thomabravo.com/">Thoma Bravo</a> must really like <a href="https://www.flexera.com/">Flexera</a>, an IT asset management company out of Chicago. The private equity firm bought the company for the second time today. Sources told TechCrunch the price was $2.85 billion.</p>
<p>Technically, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/thoma-bravo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="thoma-bravo">Thoma Bravo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is getting a majority stake in the company, buying it from previous owners TA Associates and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board. The firm <a href="https://www.revenera.com/about-us/press-center/thoma-bravo-completes-acquisition-macrovision-software-business.html">originally bought Flexera in 2008</a> from Macrovision for just $200 million. It turned it around just three years later in 2011 for $1 billion profit, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2019/10/02/meet-wall-streets-best-dealmaker-new-billionaire-orlando-bravo/?sh=2ed3a34442ec">according to reports</a>.</p>
<p>While reports last year had the company&#8217;s investors <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-06/flexera-owners-are-said-to-pursue-sale-for-as-much-as-3-billion">looking for $3 billion</a>, they didn&#8217;t quite reach that mark, but it&#8217;s still a hefty profit as the company continues to change hands, giving each of its owners a substantial return on investment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">At $2.85 billion, Thoma Bravo will have a bigger challenge on its hands to make that same kind of return, but it sees a company it liked before and it still likes it, especially the management team, which to some degree at least remains intact.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Decentralized exchange protocols that allow crypto traders and investors to trade across different blockсhains have been in development for a while. A significant new development now comes with the launch of the ‘Testnet’ from <a href="https://injectiveprotocol.com/">Injective Protocol</a>. Injective has been backed by Binance, one of the biggest centralized exchanges in the Crypto world.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/injective-protocol" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="injective-protocol">Injective Protocol <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is one of the first universal ‘DeFi’ (Decentralised Finance) protocols for cross-chain derivatives trading, so the launch of the testnet is an important milestone. Injective&#8217;s main competitors (centralized and decentralized exchanges) include CME Group, BitMEX, LedgerX and OKEx among others.</p>
<p>As well as being incubated by Binance Labs, Injective Protocol is also backed with $3M in funding from noted blockchain investors Pantera, Hashed, and others. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pantera-capital">Pantera</a> has had some successful exits including Kik, Bitstampt and Blockfolio.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paul Veradittakit, Partner at Pantera Capital, said in a statement: “Injective’s Solstice testnet trades and feels like a state of the art derivatives exchange but it’s actually entirely supported by a fully decentralized infrastructure. With a 1 second blocktime, instant finality, and full EVM support, I’m confident that Injective will be able to pioneer the next wave of decentralized derivatives trading”</p>
<p>Injective&#8217;s team emerged from Stanford University and has been building and testing its platform privately since 2018, while validating it with several large largest funds, market makers, and institutional traders. Prior to Injective, Eric Chen, CEO and сo-founder, was working at hedge funds and worked in cryptographic research at a blockchain-focused fund.</p>
<p>Injective has been working towards a mainnet and has already announced partnerships with top blockchain companies such as Elrond, Ramp DeFi, Findora, and Frontier. Its layer-2 decentralized exchange protocol lets traders trade across Ethereum, Cosmos, and others, using Tendermint-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to facilitate cross-chain derivatives trading.</p>
<p>Centralized exchanges have been known for operational failures like front running, exit scams, and exchange hacks. At the same time, existing DEXs are still facing problems such as high transaction fees, low liquidity, inconvenient UI/UX, and slow speeds. But the trading volume of decentralized exchanges reportedly grew 70% in the middle of 2020, setting a recent record high of $1.52 billion. So there&#8217;s clearly an appetite for this approach.</p>
<p>The advantage of the approach used by Injective combines the advantages of decentralized exchanges: resistance to front running, scams, and hacks, with the speed, low transaction fees and no gas fees, only previously available with centralized platforms. Developers can also create their own derivatives and markets to trade.</p>
<p>With Bitcoin reaching an all-time-high at around $18k, the blockchain and crypto world is once again taking off.</p>
<p>Paypal <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-bought-70-of-all-newly-mined-bitcoin-last-month-as-demand-rockets/">bought</a> up to 70% of all the newly mined bitcoin since the payments giant started offering cryptocurrency services.  And Guggenheim Funds Trust <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/guggenheim-fund-files-to-be-able-to-invest-up-to-almost-500m-in-bitcoin-through-gbtc">filed</a> an amendment with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to allow its $5 billion Macro Opportunities Fund gain exposure to bitcoin by investing up to 10% of the fund’s net asset value in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/youtube" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="youtube">YouTube <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today announced it&#8217;s launching a new feature that will push commenters to reconsider their hateful and offensive remarks before posting. It will also begin testing a filter that allows creators to avoid having to read some of the hurtful comments on their channel that had been automatically held for review. The new features are meant to address longstanding issues with the quality of comments on YouTube&#8217;s platform &#8212; a problem creators have complained about for years.</p>
<p>The company said it will also soon run a survey aimed at giving equal opportunity to creators, and whose data can help the company to better understand how some creators are more disproportionately impacted by online hate and harassment.</p>
<p>The new commenting feature, rolling out today, is a significant change for YouTube.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The feature appears when users are about to post something offensive in a video&#8217;s comments section and warns to &#8220;Keep comments respectful.&#8221; The message also tells users to check the site&#8217;s Community Guidelines if they&#8217;re not sure if a comment is appropriate.</p>
<p>The pop-up then nudges users to click the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button and revise their comment by making &#8220;Edit&#8221; the more prominent choice on the screen that appears.</p>
<p>The feature will not actually prevent a user from posting their comment, however. If they want to proceed, they can click the &#8220;Post Anyway&#8221; option instead.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2082631" style="width: 664px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082631" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2082631" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?w=654" alt="" width="654" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=144,150 144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=288,300 288w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=768,799 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=654,680 654w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reminder_screen.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082631" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>The idea to put up roadblocks to give users time to pause and reconsider their words and actions is something several social media platforms are now doing.</p>
<p>For instance, Instagram last year launched a feature that would<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/instagram-anti-bullying-features/"> flag offensive comments</a> before they were posted. It later expanded that to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/instagram-to-now-flag-potentially-offensive-captions-in-addition-to-comments/"> include offensive captions</a>. Without providing data, the company claimed that these &#8220;nudges&#8221; were helping to reduce online bullying. Meanwhile, Twitter this year began to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/twitter-read-before-retweet/">push users to read the article linked in tweets</a> they were about to share before tweeting their reaction, and it stopped users from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/twitter-retweet-changes-quote-tweet-election-misinformation/">being able to retweet with just one click</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ids1j2kz8s"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/twitter-retweet-changes-quote-tweet-election-misinformation/">Changing how retweets work, Twitter seeks to slow down election misinformation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Changing how retweets work, Twitter seeks to slow down election misinformation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/twitter-retweet-changes-quote-tweet-election-misinformation/embed/#?secret=ids1j2kz8s" data-secret="ids1j2kz8s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>These intentional pauses built into the social platforms are designed to stop people from reacting to content with heightened emotion and anger, and instead push users to be more thoughtful in what they say and do. User interface changes like this leverage basic human psychology to work, and may even prove effective in some percentage of cases. But platforms have been hesitant to roll out such tweaks as they can stifle user engagement.</p>
<p>In YouTube&#8217;s case, the company tells TechCrunch its systems will learn what&#8217;s considered offensive based on what content gets repeatedly flagged by users. Over time, this AI-powered system should be able to improve as the technology gets better at detection and the system itself is further developed.</p>
<p>Users on Android in the English language will see the new prompts first, starting today, Google says. The rollout will complete over the next couple of days. The company did not offer a time frame for the feature&#8217;s support for other platforms and languages or even a firm commitment that such support would arrive in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, YouTube said it will also now begin testing a feature for creators who use YouTube Studio to manage their channel.</p>
<p>Creators will be able to try out a new filter that will hide the offensive and hurtful comments that have automatically been held for review.</p>
<p>Today, YouTube Studio users can choose to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/8829345?hl=en">auto-moderate potentially inappropriate comments,</a> which they can then manually review and choose to approve, hide or report. While it&#8217;s helpful to have these held, it&#8217;s still often difficult for creators to have to deal with these comments at all, as online trolls can be unbelievably cruel. With the filter, creators can avoid these potentially offensive comments entirely.</p>
<p>YouTube says it will also streamline its moderation tools to make the review process easier going forward.</p>
<p>The changes follow a year during which YouTube has been heavily criticized for not doing enough to combat <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/dennis-prager/youtube-removed-anti-trans-prageru-videos-violating-hate-speech-policies">hate speech</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562910/youtube-2020-election-trump-misinformation-fake-news-recommendations">misinformation</a> on its platform. The video platform&#8217;s &#8220;strikes&#8221; system for rule violations means that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/steve-bannons-show-pulled-off-twitter-and-youtube-over-calls-for-violence/"> videos may be individually removed</a> but a channel itself can stay online unless it collects enough strikes to be taken down. In practice, that means a YouTube creator could be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/steve-bannons-show-pulled-off-twitter-and-youtube-over-calls-for-violence/">as violent as</a> calling for government officials to be beheaded and still continue to use YouTube. (By comparison, that same threat led to an account ban on Twitter.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Qj4MTN76EC"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/steve-bannons-show-pulled-off-twitter-and-youtube-over-calls-for-violence/">Steve Bannon&#8217;s show pulled off Twitter and YouTube over calls for violence</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Steve Bannon&#8217;s show pulled off Twitter and YouTube over calls for violence&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/steve-bannons-show-pulled-off-twitter-and-youtube-over-calls-for-violence/embed/#?secret=Qj4MTN76EC" data-secret="Qj4MTN76EC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>YouTube claims it has increased the number of daily hate speech comment removals by 46x since early 2019. And in the last quarter, of the more than 1.8 million channels it terminated for violating policies, more than 54,000 terminations were for hate speech. That indicates a growing problem with online discourse that likely influenced these new measures. Some would argue the platforms have a responsibility to do even more, but it&#8217;s a difficult balance.</p>
<p>In a separate move, YouTube said it&#8217;s soon introducing a new survey that will ask creators to voluntarily share with YouTube information about their gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity. Using the data collected, YouTube claims it will be able to better examine how content from different communities is treated in search, discovery and monetization systems.</p>
<p>It will also look for possible patterns of hate, harassment and discrimination that could affect some communities more than others, the company explains. And the survey will give creators the option to participate in other initiatives that YouTube hosts, like #YouTubeBlack creator gatherings or FanFest, for instance.</p>
<p>This survey will begin in 2021 and was designed in consultation with input from creators and civil and human rights experts. YouTube says the collected data will not be used for advertising purposes, and creators will have the ability to opt-out and delete their information entirely at any time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Timnit Gebru, a leading researcher and voice in the field of ethics and artificial intelligence, says Google fired her for an email she sent to her direct reports. According to Gebru, Google fired her because of an email she sent to subordinates that the company said reflected &#8220;behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gebru, the co-leader of Google Ethical Artificial Intelligence team, took to Twitter last night, shortly after the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-nlrb-labor-complaint/">Google alleging surveillance of employees and unlawful firing of employees</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was fired by <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffDean?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JeffDean</a> for my email to Brain women and Allies. My corp account has been cutoff. So I&#39;ve been immediately fired :-)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Timnit Gebru (@timnitGebru) <a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1334352694664957952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Gebru says no one explicitly told her she was fired, but that she received an email from one of her boss&#8217;s reports, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for making your conditions clear. We cannot agree to #1 and #2 as you are requesting. We respect your decision to leave Google as a result, and we are accepting your resignation.&#8221;</p>
<p>That email, according to Gebru, went on to say that &#8220;certain aspects of the email you sent last night to non-management employees in the brain group reflect behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I said here are the conditions. If you can meet them great I’ll take my name off this paper, if not then I can work on a last date. Then she sent an email to my direct reports saying she has accepted my resignation. So that is google for you folks. You saw it happen right here.</p>
<p>&mdash; Timnit Gebru (@timnitGebru) <a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1334343577044979712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The email in question, <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical">obtained by Casey Newton</a>, discussed how Gebru was disappointed in how her organization had, &#8220;After all this talk,&#8221; only hired 14% or so women this year, she wrote. She pointed to how Samy Bengio, who leads a group of researchers inside the Google Brain team, hired 39% women but that there is no incentive for him to do so. She added:</p>
<blockquote><p>What I want to say is stop writing your documents because it doesn’t make a difference. The DEI OKRs that we don’t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the “we need more mentorship” rather than “we need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing” the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don’t matter. Because there is zero accountability. There is no incentive to hire 39% women: your life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset when they don’t want to give you good ratings during calibration. There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything. We just had a Black research all hands with such an emotional show of exasperation. Do you know what happened since? Silencing in the most fundamental way possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gebru&#8217;s email also discussed issues with silencing marginalized voices, how her expertise has been dismissed and how she&#8217;s felt gaslighted by Google.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to both Gebru and Google for comment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/google-s-co-head-of-ethical-ai-says-she-was-fired-over-email">As Bloomberg reported</a>, Gebru has been outspoken about the lack of diversity in tech as well as the injustices Black people in tech face. According to Bloomberg, Gebru believes Google let her go to signal to other workers that it&#8217;s not ok to speak up.</p>
<p>Gebru is a leading voice in the field of ethics and artificial intelligence. In 2018, Gebru collaborated with Joy Buolamwini, founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, to study biases in facial recognition systems. <a href="http://gendershades.org/overview.html">They found</a> high disparities in error rates between lighter males and darker females, which led to the conclusion that those systems didn&#8217;t work well for people with darker skin.</p>
<p>Since Gebru&#8217;s announcement, she&#8217;s received an outpouring of support from those in the tech community.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">To be bold, to be honest, to know your worth, to speak up for others, to do the thankless work, to pioneer the way, to suffer no fools, to be all they could only wish to be, wrapped in black womanhood is an affront to those who would rather see us cower than own our power 1/n</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Google declined to comment for this story <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical">but pointed to an internal email</a> from Jeff Dean, Gebru&#8217;s boss. In that email, Dean said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Given Timnit&#8217;s role as a respected researcher and a manager in our Ethical AI team, I feel badly that Timnit has gotten to a place where she feels this way about the work we’re doing. I also feel badly that hundreds of you received an email just this week from Timnit telling you to stop work on critical DEI programs. <strong>Please don’t</strong>. I understand the frustration about the pace of progress, but we have important work ahead and we need to keep at it.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, AWS launched the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/global-startup/">APN Global Startup Program</a>, which is sort of AWS&#8217;s answer to an incubator for mid to late-stage startups deeply involved with AWS technology. This year, the company wants to expand that offering, and today it announced some updates to the program at the Partner keynote at AWS re:Invent.</p>
<p>While startups technically have to pay a $2,500 fee if they are accepted to the program, AWS typically refunds that fee, says Doug Yeum, head of the Global Partner Organization at AWS &#8212; and they get a lot of benefits for being part of the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the APN has a $2,500 annual program fee, startups that are accepted into the invite-only APN Global Startup Program get that fee back, as well as free access to substantial additional resources both in terms of funding as well as exclusive program partner managers and co-sell specialists resources,&#8221; Yeum told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And those benefits are pretty substantial, including access to a new &#8220;white glove program&#8221; that lets them work with a program manager with direct knowledge of AWS and who has experience working with startups. In addition, participants get access to an ISV program to work more directly with these vendors to increase sales and access to data exchange services to move third-party data into the AWS cloud.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AWS announces DevOps Guru to find operational issues automatically&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-announces-devops-guru-to-find-operational-issues/embed/#?secret=VSapafnB5r" data-secret="VSapafnB5r" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>What&#8217;s more, they can apply to the new AI/ML Acceleration program. As AWS describes it, &#8220;This includes up to $5,000 AWS credits to fund experiments on AWS services, enabling startups to explore AWS AI/ML tools that offer the best fit for them at low risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, they get partially free access to the AWS Marketplace, offsetting the normal marketplace listing fees for the first five offerings. Some participants will also get access to AWS sales to help use the power of the large company to drive a startup&#8217;s sales.</p>
<p>While you can apply to the program, the company also recruits individual startups that catch its attention. &#8220;We also proactively invite mid to late-stage startups built on AWS that, based on market signals, are showing traction and offer interesting use cases for our mutual enterprise customers,&#8221; Yeum explained.</p>
<p>Among the companies currently involved in the program are HashiCorp, Logz.io and Snapdocs. Interested startups can apply on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/global-startup/">APN Global Startup website</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">VCs expect the companies they invest in to use data to improve their decision-making. So why aren’t they doing that when evaluating startup teams?</p>
<p>Sure, venture capital is a people business, and the power of gut feeling is real. But using an objective, data-backed process to evaluate teams — the same way we do when evaluating financial KPIs, product, timing and market opportunities — will help us make better investment decisions, avoid costly mistakes and discover opportunities we might have otherwise overlooked.</p>
<p>An objective assessment process will also help investors break free from patterns and back someone other than a white male for a change. Is looking at how we have always done things the best way to build for the future?</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0149206313493325">Sixty percent of startups fail because of problems with the team</a>. Instinct matters, but a team is too big a risk to leave to intuition. I will use myself as an example. I have founded two companies. I know what it takes to build a company and to achieve a successful exit. I like to think I can sense when someone has that special something and when a team has chemistry. But I am human. I am limited by bias and thought patterns; data is not.</p>
<p>You can (and should) take a scientific approach to evaluating a startup team. A “strong” team isn’t a vague concept — extensive research confirms what it takes to execute a vision. Despite what people expect, soft skills can be measured. VCVolt is a computerized selection model that analyzes the performance of companies and founding teams developed by Eva de Mol, Ph.D., my partner at CapitalT.</p>
<p>We use it to inform every investment decision we make and to demystify a common hurdle to entrepreneurial success. (The technology also evaluates the company, market opportunity, timing and other factors, but since most investors aren’t taking a structured, data-backed approach to analyzing teams, let’s focus on that.)</p>
<p>VCVolt allows us to reduce team risk early on in the selection and due diligence process, thereby reducing confirmation bias and fail rates, discovering more winning teams and driving higher returns.</p>
<p>I will keep this story brief for privacy reasons, but you will get the point. While testing the model, we advised another VC firm not to move forward with an investment based on the model’s findings. The firm moved forward anyway because they were in love with the deal, and everything the model predicted transpired. It was a big loss for the investors, and a reminder that hunch and gut feeling can be wrong — or at least blind you to some serious risk factors.</p>
<p>The platform uses a validated model that is based on more than five years of scientific research, data from more than 1,000 companies and input from world-class experts and scientists. Its predictive validity is noted in top-tier scientific journals and other publications, including<a href="https://hbr.org/2019/03/what-makes-a-successful-startup-team"> Harvard Business Review</a>. By asking the right questions — science-based questions validated by more than 80,000 datapoints — the platform analyzes the likelihood that a team will succeed.

With this, project managers and developers will be able to get deeper insights into the code teams are working on, for example, and where that code is in the deployment pipeline. Users of Jira Software Premium will also be able to track deployment frequency and cycle times right inside of the service now, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the quest to reach that near-mythical land of &#8216;insights,&#8217; many teams mistake consolidation for control. But the challenge is not the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">number</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of tools; it’s the way they&#8217;re integrated,&#8221; the Jira team writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;No single vendor will ever deliver all the products an agile software team needs, so the burden still lies on the team to manually connect the dots.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>This update, Atlassian argues, helps those teams do just that. For most teams, Jira is already the central repository where each piece of work is documented in some form or another, after all. Some of that work happens in Atlassian tools, but most of it happens in the context of third-party services. The idea here is to pull all of this DevOps work together and provide more visibility and insights into the state of a company&#8217;s development pipeline.</p>
<p>Specifically, there are four different updates here. The first is &#8220;code in Jira,&#8221; which may sound like you can now code inside of Jira, but in reality, it&#8217;s about seeing which repos in B<span style="font-weight: 400;">itbucket, GitHub, GitLab or Git Integration for Jira are currently actively worked on. With the new &#8220;deployments&#8221; feature, users can now get a real-time view of all of their deployment information across CI/CD services like Bitbucket Pipelines, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, Circle CI, Octopus Deploy and JFrog.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Whether you’re a product manager looking to see which features have deployed to which environment or a team lead looking to understand the average time it takes for your team to go from idea to production within a certain project, you’ll find your answer in the Deployments in Jira tab,&#8221; the company explains.</p>
<p>The last two features, only available in the pricier and more enterprisey <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/pricing">Jira Software Premium</a>, will soon provide more in-depth metrics about deployment frequency and cycle times. The idea here is simply to provide more metrics to help teams better understand trends and identify outliers in their processes.</p>
