										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Austin-based home lab testing kit startup <a href="https://www.everlywell.com">Everlywell</a> is expanding its scope considerably with two acquisitions, and a transformation that includes the establishment of a new parent company led by Everlywell CEO and co-founder Julia Cheek. The new entity, called Everly Health, will now offers services including at-home lab testing kits and education, population-scale testing through a U.S.-wide clinician network, telehealth and payer-supported/enterprise self-collected lab test.</p>
<p>This is a big move for Everlywell, which was found in 2015 (and which was a finalist in TechCrunch&#8217;s 2016 Disrupt SF Battlefield completion). The company has steadily iterated on its offerings, expanding its at-home testing from fertility products, to food sensitivities and allergies, and last year, to at home COVID-19 test collection.</p>
<p>Everly Health&#8217;s business now includes not only that kind of at-home consumer diagnostic and personal health education, but also many relationships through PWNHealth, which will rebrand to Everly Health Solutions, with health plans, employers and labs across the U.S.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Everlywell itself was actually a longtime partner of PNWHealth, which is what Cheek told me an in interview actually helped make the acquisition make so much sense to both companies. They&#8217;d been working together for years, and that collaboration had only deepened in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we found over the last year, was we were collaborating on all these different enterprise partnerships to offer solutions, and so our cultures are really well aligned, and our teams have worked closely together,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And we both share this common ethos that we felt the urgent need to help people and to save lives, but also this discipline around consumer-friendly and enabled care, grounded in diagnostics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overall, Cheek said that the decision to go out and acquire the pieces of the puzzle needed to deliver a more comprehensive care offering was partly driven by the pandemic, but that really just drove an acceleration of what Everlywell was already beginning to see before COVID-19. Freshly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/everlywell-raises-175-million-to-expand-virtual-care-options-and-scale-its-at-home-health-testing/">capitalized with the $175 million it raised last December</a>, the startup was in a position to make some bold moves in order to make the most of the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before the pandemic, but especially during and looking out to post-pandemic, we have just seen this massive acceleration of the need for consumer friendly testing services,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our business has continued to grow exponentially, even since normal doctor&#8217;s appointments resumed, orders of magnitude, 300% growth. We sat back and said, since we believe healthcare is in a watershed moment post-pandemic, where do we think we need to actually be to be able to offer a full-service diagnostic solution as this entire space grows. So it&#8217;s Everlywell as a consumer friendly brand, but it&#8217;s also this massive enterprise need for home testing, and broader consumer diagnostics.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new acquisitions do add some complexity to Everly Health&#8217;s business, since its Everly Health Solutions also serves a number of customers that would be considered competitive with Everlywell. Cheek points out that both businesses have a demonstrated track record of security and data integrity, compliant with HIPAA standards, and says that they&#8217;re setting up a strict firewall that will result in &#8220;complete data independence&#8221; of Everly Health Solutions to ensure there&#8217;s no possibility of anti-competitive behavior.</p>
<p>The companies will however share customer experience, design and product resources, however, and the plan is to build a unified brand focused on high-quality customer engagement across the board.</p>
<p>Everly Health hasn&#8217;t released the financial details of the transaction, but it has shared shared that PWNHealth CEO Sanjay Pingle will be acting in a transitional role in the combined company for the time being, and will serve on the board of Everly Health. Investors in PWNHealth, including Spectrum Equity, and Blue Cross/Blue Shield corporate VC Blue Venture Fund will also retain an ownership stake in Everly Health.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Design and marketing consultancy R/GA is expanding its Venture Studios program with the launch of a new <a href="https://www.coalitionventurestudio.com">Coalition Venture Studio</a> focused specifically on supporting Black-led and Black-owned startups.</p>
<p>The initiative is led by R/GA Entrepreneur in Residence Davyeon Ross, a Black entrepreneur who founded<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/19/shottracker-raises-5m-in-seed-funding-from-magic-johnson-and-david-stern-to-bring-real-time-analytics-to-nba-teams/"> sports analytics company ShotTracker</a>. The startup (which is backed by TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company Verizon, <a href="http://www.verizonventures.com/blog/2021/1/shottracker-secures-$11m-financing-led-by-evertz-technologies-and-verizon-ventures/">specifically Verizon Ventures</a>) was part of R/GA&#8217;s Dodgers Accelerator, and Ross attributed much of ShotTracker&#8217;s success to connections made by the agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;From that perspective, I got this firsthand view of the power of R/GA Ventures,&#8221; Ross told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To participate in the Coalition Venture Studio, startups must be majority Black-owned or have a Black CEO, CTO or board chair. However, Ross said that it won&#8217;t be using a traditional application process, and it won&#8217;t be limited to a handful of startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s going not going to be cohorts or batches of companies,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The thought process is, it’s an ongoing initiative [&#8230;] A big piece of this is, it&#8217;s not an application process, it&#8217;s a registration process. Once we work with R/GA to vet the companies, we can start positioning them for projects within the R/GA agency.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="coTW68Vo17"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/black-tech-nation-ventures/">Black Tech Nation Ventures is a new fund for Black entrepreneurs</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Black Tech Nation Ventures is a new fund for Black entrepreneurs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/black-tech-nation-ventures/embed/#?secret=coTW68Vo17" data-secret="coTW68Vo17" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In other words, assuming a company qualifies, they&#8217;ll become eligible for three main kinds of support through the Coalition program — creative capital (consulting, design, copywriting and other services), relationship capital (introductions to what Ross described as R/GA&#8217;s &#8220;network of incredible blue chip clients) and financial capital (which could come from a syndicate led by R/GA Ventures).</p>
<p>This launch comes after last year&#8217;s protests over the killing of George Floyd led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/">a broader conversation</a> about race and representation in startups and venture capital. Ross said he&#8217;s encouraged by that conversation — but at the same time, only 1% of VC money was <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/06/a-vcs-guide-to-investing-in-black-founders">deployed with Black entrepreneurs last year</a>, and there&#8217;s a risk that the industry could move on without addressing systemic issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a society, we tend to be very short term,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We say, &#8216;Oh my goodness, that happened,&#8217; and then we go about our lives [&#8230;] That&#8217;s why I was excited that R/GA reached out to make this commitment. Part of this is about accountability, part of this is about easy options for folks to get involved, part of this is about storytelling. A lot of companies made statements, so this is just providing them with vehicles to be able to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>To that end, Coalition has already signed up a number of <a href="https://www.coalitionventurestudio.com/partners/">partners</a>, including several from the startup and VC world like Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s TxO Initiative, Harlem Capital, Collab Capital, Ohub, Mac Venture Capital and Gingerbread Capital. R/GA&#8217;s parent company IPG is also a partner, as are the Dodgers and Elysian Park (home to Dodger Stadium).</p>
<p>Eligible startups can register <a href="https://www.coalitionventurestudio.com/startups/">on the Coalition website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup from Europe is joining the race to become the first big provider of lab grown fish.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bluu.bio/">Bluu Biosciences</a> has raised €7 million in a round of financing from investors including Manta Ray Ventures, Norrsken VC, Be8, CPT Capital and Lever VC to compete with a host of startups like BluNalu, Wild Type, and Shiok Meats in a bid to market with a lab-grown fish replacement.</p>
<p>The market for sustainable fish is huge and growing. Already, concerns over the effects of overfishing and industrial fish farming are mounting as demand for fish increases. It&#8217;s the same problem that other animal-based sources of protein face. The amount of demand for high quality sources of protein from the Earth&#8217;s several billion people cannot sustainably keep up with the available supply.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s why a number of cellular meat companies are focusing on fish instead of other meats like beef, pork, or chicken.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a lot of talent in Europe and very little companies built in this space. If you compare it t0 the mammalian space there are a lot fewer companies,&#8221; said Simon Fabich, co-founder and managing director of Bluu.  </span></p>
<p>At Berlin-based Bluu, the focus is on salmon, trout, and carp (the most popular fish in China). Other companies are tackling tuna, salmon, and shrimp, but Bluu sees carp as an especially attractive target, given its popularity in one of the world&#8217;s most populous companies.</p>
<p>One advantage for Bluu, its founders argue, is the deep experience that co-founder Sebastian Rakers has in the wild world of cultivated fish cells.</p>
<p>A marine and cell biologist who was working for several years at the Munich-based <a href="https://www.fraunhofer.de/en.html">Fraunhofer Institute</a>, one of Europe&#8217;s most celebrated research institutes, Rakers led a task force that looked at potential commercial viability of cell-based meat, after conducting research on the viability of using fish cells as a component for viral production for the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130292" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130292" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2130292" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130292" class="wp-caption-text">Bluu Biotechnologies co-founder Sebastian Rakers. Image Credit: <a href="https://www.bluu.bio/">Bluu Biosciences</a></p></div></p>
<p>During his research Rakers cultivated 80 different cell cultures for more than 20 different species of fish. What&#8217;s more, he was able to make these cell lines immortal.</p>
<p>Before envisioning an endless, ever-producing mass of fish cells that could overwhelm the world, it might be worth explaining what immortal cell lines mean&#8230; Actually&#8230; the endless, ever-producing mass of self-reproducing fish cells comes pretty close.</p>
<p>Most cell lines tend to die off after reprodcuing a certain number of times, which means that to manufacture meat at scale can require several biopsies of the same animal to cultivate multiple cell lines at a time. Rakers said that Bluu could avoid that step, thanks to the work that had already been done to develop these &#8220;immortal&#8221; salmon, trout, and carp cell cultivars.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s such a strong competitive advantage,&#8221; said Fabich. &#8220;If you have normal cells that are not immortalized you can only proliferate 20 to 25 times and then you need to start again from another biopsy. With immortalized cells you can grow up to 100,000 times and we can double it every day.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>With this technology in hand, Rakers said he was thinking about what could come next in his own career and met up with Gary Lin, an impact investor and the founder of <a href="https://www.purpleorange.com/">Purple Orange Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Lin connected Rakers with Fabich and the two men set off to commercialize Rakers&#8217; research as Bluu. And even though there are several companies that have a head start in the market (and in funding), Rakers said that there are certain advantages to coming in late.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Five years ago there was hardly any company looking into media development, hardly any companies focused on bioreactor technologies at a very large scale and there was no company looking for scaffolding alternatives for cell-based meat,&#8221; he said. Now there are. </span></p>
<p>The company is picking up speed quickly thanks to those other technology providers that are coming to market and will look to have a prototype product out by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>The company is also pushing for regulation, which both Fabich and Rakers said were one of the last remaining obstacles to commercialization. Ultimately, the company has its eye firmly on the Asian market. &#8220;That&#8217;s the one that moves the needle,&#8221; in terms of sustainability, Fabich said. &#8220;We can have the biggest impact if we change production behavior there.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New York State officials struck a deal with Gov. Andrew Cuomo to allow recreational use of cannabis. The move would create the largest legal cannabis market on the East Coast, potentially creating tens of thousands of jobs and significant startups opportunities.</p>
<p>This is a big first step, though the first sale of recreational weed is unlikely to happen in 2021. The framework needs a final review, and lawmakers still need to create the rules and regulations surrounding commercial sales. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/nyregion/ny-legalize-marijuana.html">According to the New York Times</a>, the Democratic-controlled State Legislature could pass the bill as soon as next week.</p>
<p>The deal comes after several failed attempts to bring recreational cannabis to New York. Neighboring state New Jersey passed a recreational marijuana bill in the 2020 election.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The legislation, as purposed, has several interesting aspects. The purposed bill allows for weed delivery and club-like consumption lounges where patrons can consume cannabis but not alcohol. In-home growing is also allowed and limited to six plants for personal use. According to the NYT, the proposed deal funnels millions of dollars in tax revenue back to the communities where the failed war on drugs had a disproportionately negative impact. This includes reserving many business licenses for minority business owners and providing loans, grants, and incubator programs for small farmers.</p>
<p>New York lawmakers also intend to rework laws around possession by eliminating penalties for less than three ounces of cannabis. This would also expunge the record of those convicted of activities that are now legal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Baking operational flexibility, agility and speed into your startup’s DNA from the get-go will go a long way toward driving your ultimate success. Understanding its importance and learning best practices might seem daunting, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/#tickets">TC Early Stage 2021: Operations and Fundraising</a> (April 1-2), is all about connecting early-stage founders with subject-matter experts across the startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>Don’t miss this opportunity to engage with some of the leading gurus on operational speed and efficiency. We’ve assembled a veritable dream team to answer your questions — these breakout sessions are highly interactive — help you avoid missteps and drive your startup like a finely tuned machine.</p>
<p>Our next event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a> takes place July 8-9 with all-new speakers, content and presentations. Buy a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/#tickets">dual-event early-bird pass</a>, attend both Early Stage conferences and save $100 or more — if you purchase before <strong>Friday, March 26 at 11:59 pm (PST).</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Want to be a fast, agile, operational contortionist? Check out these sessions and get your startup poised for success:</p>
<p><strong>Using Fast Feedback to Make Higher-Confidence Decisions and Accelerate the Dev Process</strong></p>
<p>Michael Mace, VP of Market Strategy at UserTesting, leads this discussion on how to use fast feedback methodologies to make high-confidence product decisions based on objective customer data in real time, without slowing the dev process. Quickly diagnose problems, settle disputes, reduce the risk of rework, and iterate faster. This session will include real-world case studies. <em>Brought to you by UserTesting.</em></p>
<p><strong>Why Founders Should Adopt OKRs Now</strong></p>
<p>Execution is key to a startup’s survival and growth — especially when it comes to fast-moving software and technology products. Standing in the tricky intersection of investors, customers and employees, a founder needs to balance priorities, align teams and create a visionary product that works. Moreover, in this age of hyper feedback loops and changing business models, the founder must be agile enough to absorb and quickly react to changes in the product roadmap and consumer needs. OKRs, a toolkit used extensively by engineering and product teams, is more than relevant now for founders of all kinds to embrace. Join Rahul Agarwal, product manager at Boomi, to learn the history of OKRs, what they’re about and witness case studies of successful real-life adoption. <em>Brought to you by Dell for Entrepreneurs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nailing the Little Things &#8211; How Startups can Achieve Operational Excellence from Day One</strong></p>
<p>The early days of launching a company can be a whirlwind for founding teams as unexpected challenges and opportunities require flexibility, agility and speed. But implementing a few key operating best practices and processes early can be a crucial part of a startup’s success when it prepares for rapid growth. Join partners from B Capital Group, a multi-stage global investor, to learn the most important things you can do to set your startup up for success early in your journey, and what’s most important to investors as you raise your Seed, A and B funding rounds. Speakers include Howard Morgan, chairman of B Capital Group and co-founder of First Round Capital, and Partners Karen Page (formerly of Box) and Gabe Greenbaum (formerly of Pritzker Group). <em>Brought to you by B Capital Group.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Big tech is back on the virtual hill.</p>
<p>Three of tech&#8217;s most prominent CEOs will appear before the House Energy and Commerce committee today at 9AM PT as lawmakers grill the companies on their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tech-hearing-capitol-attack-facebook-twitter-google/">failure to contain disinformation and extremism</a>.</p>
<p>In opening statements <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-disinformation-nation-social-medias-role-in-promoting">made available before the hearing</a>, Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter&#8217;s Jack Dorsey and Google&#8217;s Sundar Pichai each laid out the conversation they&#8217;d prefer to have.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zuckerberg pushed for reforms to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that wouldn&#8217;t resolve the issues at hand, but would probably give Facebook another leg up on smaller competitors. Google defended Section 230 and pointed to its own often mild or delayed efforts to contain election misinformation that ultimately snowballed into the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Twitter mostly looked forward rather than back, pointing to initiatives to make its own algorithms transparent and to invite more community-level moderation efforts.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/za6DHMsFHA0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The topic at hand Thursday is a big one, and there are plenty of directions lawmakers might take the hearing. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tech-hearing-capitol-attack-facebook-twitter-google/">In recent months</a>, the two subcommittees leading the joint hearing have questioned Facebook about its algorithmic group recommendations — a frequent concern among extremism experts — and reports that the company served combat gear ads next to posts promoting the Capitol riot. More broadly, the committee will delve into social media&#8217;s role in disseminating dangerous misinformation, but it&#8217;s possible we&#8217;ll take detours through some regulatory solutions like antitrust legislation and Section 230 reform along the way.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to follow along, we&#8217;ve embedded the hearing above or you can check back for other coverage as we go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the trucking industry, &#8220;dwell and detention&#8221; times are the enemies of efficiency, profits and drivers. More than two billion hours are lost each year due to dwell —the time spent at a distribution yard or facility — and detention — the gap between when unloading or loading is supposed to begin and when it actually does.</p>
<p>Baton, a San Francisco-based startup developed out of 8VC&#8217;s incubator program, has developed a business that it believes will solve these long-standing problems truckers. The company&#8217;s name gives a hint at its business model. Baton is developing a network of drop zones, 24-hour facilities it has sub-leased from partners, that are located outside of busy urban centers. Long-haul truckers can pull up and leave their loaded trailers at these drop zones. Baton then partners with local fleets of Class 8 trucks that will arrive at the drop site, grab the load and then take the freight to its final destination.</p>
<p>The startup developed a software platform that coordinates vehicles, drop-zones, warehouses and local drivers through a single API. Customers also receive live automated updates via API as loads are delivered.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In long-haul trucking, there&#8217;s a remarkable amount of wasted time,&#8221; co-founder Andrew Berberick said in a recent interview. Baton&#8217;s pitch is that it eliminates hours wasted with dwell and detention as well as the time spent sitting in traffic. The company says it can also help increase wages for drivers, who are typically paid by the mile and not the hour, as well as cut carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Baton has landed long-haul trucking firms as customers, including CRST, the private freight company that carries loads for some of the country&#8217;s largest retailers including Walmart. And it&#8217;s also attracted a variety of strategic investors. The company raised its first $3.3 million from real estate corporation Prologis and 8VC, in a seed round that closed in December 2019. Now, it&#8217;s tacking on more capital and investors in a Series A funding round, co-led by 8VC and Maersk Growth, the corporate venture arm of logistics giant AP Moller-Maersk.</p>
<p>Baton raised $10.5 million in the Series A, and now has a post-money valuation of $50 million, co-founders Nate Robert and Berberick told TechCrunch. Prologis, Ryder, Lineage Logistics, Project44 CEO Jett McCandless, KeepTruckin&#8217; CEO Shoaib Makani, Clarendon Capital operating partner John Larkin, I.S.G founder Trace Haggard, and Cooley LLC all participated in the round.</p>
<p>Baton has several drop zones in Los Angeles with plans to open more in the city. Robert and Berberick said their plan is to open zones in Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>Baton&#8217;s short term aim is to end waste in human-driven trucking operations. But Robert says the business model is well positioned to handle what he says will be the first viable applications of autonomous trucks. &#8220;The answer is on highways only,&#8221;Robert said. &#8220;And for that to occur you&#8217;ll have to have a nationwide network of transfer hubs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baton is already piloting the idea, which Robert called &#8220;autonomous relays&#8221; with an unnamed self-driving trucks company on the Arizona-California border.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;As we see automated and eventually electric trucks become standard for certain routes, the network of Baton hubs and the coordination provided by its software will become seen as core infrastructure. Baton makes the transformation to automated trucking possible,&#8221; 8VC partner and co-founder Jake Medwell said.</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">I’ve recently advised a number of emerging venture capital funds that are struggling to determine the most effective steps they can take to support their portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Almost every private equity and venture capital investor now advertises that they have a platform to support their portfolio companies. The popularity of the model can be judged by the fact that the U.S.<a href="http://www.vcplatform.com/"> VC Platform</a> community has grown approximately 120 percent in the last three years. Similarly, its European counterpart, the <a href="https://www.euvcplatform.com/">EU VC Platform</a>, has tripled in the same period.</p>
<p>However, most of us don’t have the budget of an Andreessen Horowitz to support almost every major need of emerging companies. You could spend an unlimited budget on all possible company-building <a href="https://teten.com/pa">resources</a>. “You can’t pick a platform strategy that’s unique, but you can pick a platform strategy that your firm can uniquely execute,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/rre-ventures-fund-vii/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">noted</a> Maria Palma of REE Ventures.</p>
<p>I propose here a framework for prioritizing your platform buildout. Once you have assembled the right core team, I recommend prioritizing as follows:</p>
<p><b>First, meet with your portfolio company management. </b>As an agenda for each meeting, I suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li> How can we most add value, in addition to helping with financing? (This is an open-ended query and the most important question.)</li>
<li>What are your fundraising goals?</li>
<li>What is the profile of people whom you are most interested in meeting?</li>
<li>From which service providers have you received the most value?</li>
</ul>
<p>In a <a href="https://docsend.com/view/w54w8ry">presentation </a>at the 4th Annual VC Platform Summit, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickbkim">Nick Kim</a>, Crosscut Ventures’ head of platform, shared their platform development methodology, which he viewed as an exercise in product development.</p>
<p>“Firms should match services to the stage-specific needs of companies,” Dan Kozikowski, partner and head of platform for <a href="https://firstmarkcap.com/">FirstMark Capital</a>, told me. “For example, recruiting writ large is useful at all stages of development. But things like vendor introductions are only needle-movers at the earliest stages. Similarly, customer introductions are invaluable in the early days, but become less valuable once a company has a fully formed go-to-market function.”</p>
<p>Then, pluck the low-hanging fruit: easy, low-cost, and highly scalable infrastructure. This typically includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Relationships with relevant service providers</b> in your vertical, often with pre-negotiated discounts: coaches, lawyers, accountants, common software vendors, consultants. Generally, I suggest exploring <a href="https://builtfirst.com/">BuiltFirst</a>, <a href="https://clutch.co/">Clutch</a>, <a href="http://fundedbuy.com/">FundedBuy</a>, <a href="https://rocketplace.com/">Rocketplace</a> and/or <a href="https://spotsource.com/">SpotSource.</a> For negotiation with providers, consider <a href="https://www.buyer.co/">Buyer</a>. Alpaca VC shares their <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vHQjLd0s3qJ-PX9yONOdszuOYrhHhtvrHDu0tz0nDVU/edit#gid=194978991">Master Agency List</a>.</li>
<li><b>A well-organized library of best practices </b>for founders in your vertical, which you can share as appropriate. <a href="https://search.firstround.com/">First Search</a>, <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/library">Startup School</a> and <a href="https://www.gsvlabs.com/passport">OneValley Passport</a> are examples of comprehensive founder resources from investors. <a href="http://askanything.vc/">Ask Anything</a> aggregates resources from all the VCs. I have developed a <a href="https://teten.com/ceo">founder curriculum</a> on my blog.</li>
<li><b>Relationships with venture partners, entrepreneurs in residence</b> and other non-salaried personnel who can help your companies. Explore a <a href="https://teten.com/speaker/operating-executives/">roadmap</a> of your options in working with outside talent.</li>
<li><b>Organize </b><a href="https://teten.com/blog/category/industry/conferences/"><b>events</b></a><b> in your vertical</b>. Particularly when events are all-virtual, this is an easy and low-cost way to build trusted relationships with the leaders in your space.</li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend building a strong internal tech stack to handle the deluge of requests for help you’ll get from companies as you scale. “The biggest investment of resources with our tech platform relates to the capturing and maintenance of data on our huge portfolio of 1,100-plus evolving tech companies,” Jeff Pomeranz, partner at <a href="http://rightsidecapital.com/">Right Side Capital</a>, said.</p>
<p>“For instance, tracking ‘months-of-runway’ combined with the month-over-month change to that metric allows us to rapidly identify companies that may be distressed. Adding full lifecycle data and industry exposure tags to that, across such a large number of companies, often enables us to see trends ahead of the market, such as retail decimation a few years ago.” Investigate ways to use<a href="http://teten.com/pevctech"> technology and analytics to make better investments</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond these steps, I suggest you apply a two-part test:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Today&#8217;s announcement comes after a messy 2020 for Holberton, and not only because the pandemic put a stop to in-person learning.</p>
<p>The original promise of Holberton was that it provided students &#8212; which it selects through a blind admissions process &#8212; with a well-rounded software development education akin to a college education for free. In return, students provide a set amount of their salary for the next few years to the school as part of a deferred tuition agreement, up to a maximum of $85,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But early last year, California&#8217;s Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education (BPPE) <a href="https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/holberton_emergency_20200124.pdf">directed the school</a> to immediately cease operation, in part because the agency <a href="https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/holbertonschool_1stamendacc.pdf">found</a> that Holberton had started offering a new, unapproved program. This program, a nine-month training program augmented by six months of employment, required students to pay the full $85,000 cost of its approved programs. After a hearing, the BPPE allowed Holberton to continue to operate its other programs. A number of students also <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/02/26/san-francisco-based-holberton-coding-school-facing-fraud-accusations-from-former-students/">accused the school</a> of not giving them the education it had promised.</p>
<p>Throughout this period, Holberton continued expanding, though. It opened campuses in Mexico and Peru, for example. Indeed, it doubled the number of schools in its system from nine to 18 in 2020.</p>
<p>But on December 17, 2020, Holberton voluntarily surrendered its operating license in California. The day before, Holberton <a href="https://blog.holbertonschool.com/the-future-of-holberton/#payment-comparison-table-SF">announced</a> that it would not re-open its campus in San Francisco, which had been shut down since March because of the pandemic. Holberton co-founder Sylvain Kalache argued that the school would be best positioned to achieve its mission by &#8220;working with amazing local partners who operate the campuses and deeply understand their markets’ unique needs&#8221; and not by operating its own campuses.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Edtech valuations aren&#8217;t skyrocketing, but investors see more exit opportunities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/edtech-valuations-arent-skyrocketing-but-investors-see-more-exit-opportunities/embed/#?secret=2FtVlPIK2H" data-secret="2FtVlPIK2H" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It now thinks of itself more as an &#8220;OS of Education&#8221; that offers franchised campuses and education tools.</p>
<p>In January, California&#8217;s attorney general struck down the fraud allegations against the school. &#8220;California was the only market in which Holberton faced any regulatory challenges,&#8221; Kalache wrote in the company&#8217;s first public acknowledgment of the lawsuits. &#8220;With this now behind us, we are excited to move forward with our original mission of providing affordable and accessible education to prospective software engineers around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly, that&#8217;s how Holberton&#8217;s funders feel about this, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;They’ve proven successful in breaking down barriers of cost and access while delivering a world-class curriculum,&#8221; said Manoel Lemos, managing partner at Redpoint eventures. &#8220;With the concept of ‘OS of Education’ as a service, they provide customers with all the tools they need for success. Customers can be nonprofit impact investors who want to improve local economies, education institutions who want to fill gaps in how they teach in a post-COVID learning environment, or corporations who want to provide the best training possible as education providers themselves or as employee development programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holberton founder and CEO Julien Barbier tells me that, today, &#8220;for the first time since our creation, we have started working with universities to help them create a better experience and add hands-on education on top of their traditional methodology. Everyone’s happy: the school, the students, and the teachers &#8212; because they prefer to focus on teaching and not spend huge amounts of time correcting projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>He expects to see 5,000 students join this year, up from 500 in 2019, and see the network expand with new schools in the U.S., Europe, LatAm and Africa. He also noted that the company already has customers for its &#8220;OS of Education&#8221; tools for auto-grading projects and its online programs. Just this week, Holberton Tulsa announced plans to more than double its physical campus in the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Raising funds is helping us support and accelerate our vision of creating this &#8216;OS of education.&#8217; Many educational entities need help and tools to better support their students and their staff. It is now that they need our help. Again, COVID has accelerated the digital transformation, and clearly, there are a lot of gaps that need to be filled,&#8221; he said. &#8220;[&#8230;] We are now a SaaS company which charges other businesses, universities or non-profits to use our tools and/or contents so that they can run their education/training programs at scale, with a better experience, while increasing the quality of education.&#8221;</p>

To see the accelerator take part in the funding round is not a surprise, as TechCrunch first caught wind of Ryu during its participation in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/techcrunchs-favorite-companies-from-500-startups-latest-demo-day-2/">the most recent 500 Startups demo day</a>. At the time, we were enthused by the idea of gamers wagering money to go head-to-head with other players on mobile devices. Investors appear to back our first impression of the company.</p>
<p>The gist behind our bullishness on the company&#8217;s idea is that esports is cool. And though your humble servant is sufficiently ancient as to favor PC-based esports, younger folks are into mobile gaming esports. Fair enough. Now mix in the sports-betting frenzy that we&#8217;ve seen in the United States, and you have a potentially potent cocktail.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>TechCrunch caught up with Ryu Games co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosskrasner/">Ross Krasner</a> to dig in a bit more. It turns out that the original esports-y model that we envisioned for Ryu was a bit off. Instead, players will often go toe-to-toe in an asynchronous fashion, betting high scores in a game against one another. So, competitive &#8220;StarCraft II&#8221; this is not. But &#8220;StarCraft&#8221; is famously difficult to be even mediocre at, while mobile games are simpler by nature, and thus more popular.</p>
<p>Perhaps your parents will square off against office friends in cash-fueled solitaire tournaments.</p>
<p>The money setup is simple, with Krasner likening it to a poker tournament. You wager a set amount, and then play. Ryu collects a fee for hosting, and then players get to it.</p>
<p>Ryu hopes to be present on a few dozen games this year. One matter that could slow adoption, however, is that games it partners with tend to relaunch a version of their title with Ryu&#8217;s SDK built in. The startup bites back against the work that partner-developers have to undertake by cross-promoting titles that use its system. So, if you sign up, you can do more than generate revenue. Your game might also find a new audience.</p>
<p>Like with most seed-stage startups, Ryu Games is more of a bet on the future than proof of a new trend. Let&#8217;s see how far it can get with this set of capital, especially as vaccines take larger and larger bites out of the pandemic that has kept us locked up for so very long.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online branded payments now run the gamut of anything from Spotify vouchers, Netflix vouchers, Neosurf, PaySafe cards, and everything in between. Consumers use them to pay for a variety of things. In Europe, they are an increasingly big business. Now, European branded payments company <a href="https://Recharge.com">Recharge.com</a> has raised €10m ($11.8m) in a debt funding round led by London-based <a href="http://www.kreoscapital.com/">Kreos Capital</a>, a growth debt provider for high-growth companies. In 2019 the Dutch fintech Creative Group, which owns the Recharge.com and Rapido.com brands, <a href="https://company.recharge.com/creative-group-raises-22-million-from-prime-venture">took investment of €22m from Prime Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Recharge has also appointed Michael Kent &#8211; who previously founded payments companies Small World and Azimo, along with UK neobank Tandem &#8211; as its non-executive chairman.</p>
<p>Recharge.com says it plans to use the funding to extend its mobile offering, product range, and expand in regions such as North America, Latin America and the GCC. It’s also aiming for sales of €450m in 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Günther Vogelpoel CEO of Recharge.com said in a statement: “We live in a world of instant wish fulfillment, from taxis that appear on demand to same-day delivery of consumer goods. Recharge.com gives customers a fast, safe and simple way to fulfill their wishes, whether that’s an essential remittance or access to digital goods and services.”</p>
<p>Commenting, Kent said: “The era of supermarket gift cards and mobile top-ups is drawing to a close. Branded payments have exploded during the global lockdown as consumers seek digital alternatives to the high street. People are now aware that online branded payments are safe, fast, and convenient.”</p>
<p>Through a range of digital vouchers from brands including Apple, Google, Spotify, Xbox and PlayStation as well as cross-border remittances of call, data credits etc Recharge is attacking the market from the consumer angle.</p>
<p>The biggest company in this space is Blackhawk networks which is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackhawk-ntwrk-m-a-silverlake-idUSKBN1F51LU">owned by private equity group Silverlake</a>. It’s considered a large player in Europe which has a direct-to-consumer model.</p>
<p>As Kent told me over a Zoom call: “Nobody actually owns the consumer side of this business globally so that&#8217;s the big opportunity.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What would happen to Robinhood and its cohorts if the apparent cooling in consumer trading demand continues? Let's talk about it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What happens to hot fintech startups that have benefited from a rise in consumer trading activity if regular folks lose interest in financial wagers?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the question facing Robinhood, Coinbase and other trading platforms that have ridden an upward cycle. Each has performed well in recent quarters: Robinhood by securing huge payment-for-order-flow revenues, while Coinbase&#8217;s trading fees have proven incredibly lucrative, something we learned when it filed to go public.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>According to recent reporting, the consumer trading frenzy could be slowing: Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/retail-trader-army-appears-to-retreat-with-latest-stimulus-wave?sref=lSuy1ocu">recently noted that options trading</a> volume is slipping, Robinhood&#8217;s app store ranking is falling, and some alternative assets are also losing steam. Other <a href="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1374675578771681285">reporting from the publication</a> notes that many SPAC shares are underwater while Google trends data indicates falling consumer trading interest, perhaps limiting the inflow of new users for equities-focused apps.</p>
<p>There are other indications that the red-hot speculative consumer market is cooling. Bitcoin is off around 10% in the last week after a blistering rise in recent quarters. Hot stocks like Peloton, once a darling of traders, fell more than 10% yesterday alone.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>But looking past price declines and other signals of market chop, <em>volume</em> itself at some well-known exchanges could be falling.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a historical precedent for such declines. Coinbase&#8217;s historical revenues, to pick an example, have proved variable based on consumer interest in cryptocurrencies, with the company benefiting from rising demand and trading activity and seeing its top line decline in periods of restrained enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Robinhood and its fellow free-trading apps have yet to undergo a similar rise-and-fall in trading volume, I&#8217;d reckon. At least of the sort of extreme up-and-down that Coinbase endured after the 2017-2018 bitcoin boom. Our question is, what would happen to Robinhood and its cohorts if the apparent cooling in consumer trading demand continues? Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Coinbase&#8217;s historical revenue declines, and the Robinhood example</h2>
<p>Coinbase was a famously lucrative organization during the 2017/-2018 bitcoin boom.</p>
<p>Indeed, we can see from the following chart from <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm">its S-1 filing</a> that the company&#8217;s <em>Monthly Transacting Users (</em>MTUs) dropped sharply into 2018. The percentage decline from 2.7 million to 800,000 is just over 70%.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2130160" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-8.31.48-AM.png?w=602" alt="" width="602" height="372" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-8.31.48-AM.png 602w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-8.31.48-AM.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-8.31.48-AM.png?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-8.31.48-AM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<p>And in case you think we&#8217;re being rude, we have a related chart from the same SEC filing that shows trading volume falling over the same period, not merely MTUs. We&#8217;re not picking a loose proxy to merely infer that trading revenue dipped at Coinbase. We can show it:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://gorillasapp.com/">Gorillas</a>, the Berlin-HQ&#8217;d startup that promises to let you order groceries and other &#8220;every day&#8221; items for delivery in as little as ten minutes, has raised $290 million in Series B funding, at a valuation that surpasses $1 billion.</p>
<p>The round &#8212; which was first <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tencent-dst-coatue-grocery-startup-gorillas-unicorn-funding-round-2021-3?r=US&#038;IR=T">reported</a> by BI &#8212; is led by Coatue Management, DST Global, and Tencent,  with participation from Green Oaks, Fifth Wall, and Dragoneer. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">Previous backer</a> Atlantic Food Labs also followed on.</p>
<p>Noteworthy, Gorillas CEO and co-founder Kağan Sümer tells TechCrunch the round is &#8220;100% equity&#8221; (i.e. without a debt component). Asked if it includes any secondary funding &#8212; seeing existing shareholders liquidate a portion of their shares &#8212; Gorillas declined to comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Having become one of the fastest European startups to have achieved so-called &#8220;unicorn&#8221; status &#8212; a valuation of $1 billion or more &#8212; Gorillas says it will reward its rider crew and warehouse staff with $1 million in bonuses. However, the company isn&#8217;t disclosing how this one-off bonus breaks down per worker, and it isn&#8217;t clear if the bonus is cash or stock or a mixture of both. The move comes at a time when Gorillas riders in Germany <a href="https://www.businessinsider.de/gruenderszene/food/gorillas-tencent-unicorn/">are reportedly organising to unionise</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In contrast to established gig economy models, we employ more than a thousand riders directly,&#8221; says Sümer. &#8220;Therefore, we invest in a strong career development program, rider security and a healthy working environment. Beyond that, all riders will receive a once-off payment&#8221;.</p>
<p>Founded last May by Kağan Sümer and Jörg Kattner in Berlin, Gorillas has already expanded to more than 12 cities, including Amsterdam, London and Munich. The company lets you order groceries and other household items on-demand with average delivery time of ten minutes.</p>
<p>To do this, it operates a vertical or &#8220;dark store&#8221; model, seeing it set up its own micro fulfillment centers, which currently total 40, spread across Germany, U.K., and the Netherlands. Customers are charged just over $2 per delivery and can order from &#8220;more than 2,000 essential items at retail prices&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that the weekly grocery run is outdated because people’s lives are increasingly spontaneous and shopping habits change accordingly,&#8221; says Sümer, noting that while access to supermarkets has increased, the space we have to store goods has decreased as people in cities are living in smaller spaces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Additionally, this pandemic has accelerated the need for grocery deliveries. If we can order clothes and trinkets and have them delivered to our door, the same should be said for our essential needs. Gorillas helps customers get what they need when they need it, whether this is their weekly grocery list or the tomatoes they forgot for tonight’s pasta recipe&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sümer says that the service initially attracted typical early adopters because it was a radically new experience and the app was only available in English. He claims that Gorillas has since gained a &#8220;very broad&#8221; base of users that are &#8220;extremely loyal&#8221;. &#8220;With geographical expansion and the rapid increase of word-of-mouth, we now cater to pretty much anyone you’d meet in a supermarket,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Asked to share what a typical basket looks like, and therefore what kind of existing grocery habits Gorillas is displacing, Sümer says that users increase their basket size over time as they gain trust in the service and its products. &#8220;Simultaneously, customers are integrating an increasing share of their typical supermarket purchases within their Gorillas orders. This includes fresh goods like fruit and vegetables, as well as products of local suppliers&#8221;.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, dark store competition in cities like London &#8212; where Gorillas recently expanded and counts as a key market &#8212; continues to ramp up. This is seeing operators issue vouchers and offer sizeable discounts in a bid to acquire customers fast, while VCs are pumping huge amounts of early-stage cash into a space where unit economics aren&#8217;t yet definitively proven.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Berlin-based Flink announced that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flink/">raised $52 million in seed financing</a> in a mixture of equity and debt. The company didn’t break out the equity-debt split, though one source told me the equity component was roughly half and half.</p>
<p>Others in the space include London’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/jiffy-grocery/">Jiffy</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/dija-launch/">Dija</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a>, and France’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/cajoo-promises-grocery-deliveries-in-15-minutes/">Cajoo. </a>There’s also London-based <a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp</a>, which remains in stealth, and heavily backed <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bdb43495-fadf-4217-bc33-bc52e6f0fdd4">Getir</a>, which started in Turkey but recently also came to London.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S.-founded goPuff &#8212; which this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/gopuff-new-funding/">raised another $1.15 billion in funding</a> at a whopping $8.9 billion valuation (compared to $3.9 billion in October) &#8212; is also looking to expand into Europe and has held <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/">talks to acquire or invest in the U.K.’s Fancy</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The curbside is being squeezed as the number of commercial vehicle operators and gig economy workers battle over this increasingly scarce real estate — a problem that has been compounded by an uptick in on-demand delivery services fueled by the pandemic.</p>
<p>A number of startups such as Coord and curbflow have popped up in recent years, all aiming to solve this supply and demand problem. One entrant, the three-year-old startup <a href="https://www.automotus.co/">Automotus</a>, is beginning to rack up deployments in zones within cities like Santa Monica, Pittsburgh, Bellevue, Washington and Turin, Italy. A project in Los Angeles is also in the works.</p>
<p>Investors have taken notice as well. The company, which developed video analytics technology to monitor and manage curbsides for cities, said in February it had raised $1.2 million in a seed round led by Quake Capital, Techstars Ventures, Kevin Uhlenhaker (the co-founder &amp; CEO at NuPark, which was acquired by Passport) and Baron Davis. CEO Jordan Justus told TechCrunch the company&#8217;s total raise is now $2.3 million. New investors include Ben Bear, Derrick Ko, and Zaizhuang Cheng of micromobility company Spin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup is still small, with just 11 full-time employees. However, Justus said the newly raised funds are being used to expand into new markets and to hire more employees.</p>
<p>Automotus uses computer vision technology to capture video of parking zones — places that might be designated for only zero-emissions vehicles or commercial deliveries. Their software handles a variety of functions, including analysis and enforcement. Cities are able to access analytics through a web app. Commercial fleets are able to access information about parking zones via open APIs and in some cases a mobile app, according to Justus.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129930" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129930" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2129930 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png" alt="Automotus Dashboard" width="2000" height="1545" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png?resize=300,232 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png?resize=768,593 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png?resize=680,525 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png?resize=1536,1187 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Automotus-Dashboard.png-1.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2129930" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Automotus</p></div></p>
<p>For instance, one newly announced pilot project with Santa Monica and Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator will monitor a one-square-mile zero-emissions delivery zone in the city. Automotus will provide anonymized data for evaluating the zone’s impacts on delivery efficiency, safety, congestion and emissions, and will make real-time parking availability data available to all zero-emissions delivery zone drivers.</p>
<p>The startup, which was founded in late 2017 and is a Techstars alum, makes its money primarily through revenue sharing on its enforcement feature. Automotus gets a slice of the payment commercial customers are automatically charged when parking in specific zones, as well as transaction fees on parking violations. While the analytics might help cities set policy or designate pick-up and drop-off zones, it&#8217;s the enforcement feature that Justus says offers the biggest opportunity.</p>
<p>Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles used Automotus&#8217; tech to fully automate parking enforcement. Automotus said enforcement efficiency and revenue increased by more than 500%, and added that implementing these measures led to a 24% increase in parking turnover and a 20% reduction in traffic.</p>
<div>
<p>&#8220;The enforcement component is really critical to the fleet operators because they need to know that these zones are managed efficiently and managed well so that they&#8217;re available for commercial use, if that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re intended for,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.coscreen.co/">CoScreen</a>, a startup that helps teams share screens and collaborate in real-time, formally launched its product to market. It also disclosed that it has raised $4.6 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unusual.vc/">Unusual Ventures</a> led its Seed round. <a href="https://twitter.com/tillpieper">Till Pieper</a>, CoScreen&#8217;s co-founder and CEO told TechCrunch in an interview that it raised the bulk of its capital pre-pandemic, with the rest coming during 2020 in smaller chunks. A number of angels took part in funding the company, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcwarner/">GitHub CTO Jason Warner</a>.</p>
<p>Why is screen-sharing worth millions in funding, and the time and attention of a whole team? It&#8217;s a good question. Happily the CoScreen team have built something that&#8217;s could prove more than a bit better than what you currently use in Zoom to share puppy pics with your team during meetings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>What&#8217;s CoScreen?</h2>
<p>CoScreen provides screen-sharing capabilities, but in a neat manner. Let&#8217;s say you are on a Mac at your house, and I&#8217;m on a PC at mine. And we need to collab and share some work. I have a document you need to help me edit, and you have an image you want me to view. Using CoScreen, with one click according to Pieper, we can share the two apps across the Internet. Yours will appear on my screen as it was native, and vice versa, and we can both interact with them in real-time.</p>
<p>Or as close to real-time as possible; Pieper told TechCrunch that latency is something that CoScreen will work on forever. Which makes sense, but what the company has built it thinks is good enough to take to market. So, today it&#8217;s launching the service after a period of time in beta for both Windows and Mac.</p>
<p>CoScreen also has audio and video-chatting capabilities. With limits. You can&#8217;t make video windows too big, for example, helping to keep the mental-load of chatting low. As someone with regular Zoom poisoning, that makes sense.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s project hits me as one of those things that sounds easy but isn&#8217;t. Remember Google Wave? It allowed for instantaneous co-writing. It was amazing. It died. And its successor-of-sorts Google Docs is a laggy mess to this day that feels more quarter-baked than half-done. Real-time tech is not simple.</p>
<p>Is the market too full of apps that allow a version of what CoScreen does for the startup to succeed? Maybe, maybe not. Zoom stormed the already-mature video chat market with a product that <em>actually worked</em>. And so software that I have used has been very good at screen-sharing, let alone sharing <em>and</em> collaborating. So if CoScreen&#8217;s tech is good, the company should have a shot at broad adoption.</p>
<p>Which it is banking on. The startup is currently offering its product for free for a few weeks. It will focus on monetization later, Pieper explained. Making money is just not a burning desire for the firm at the moment, which implies both confidence in its product and bank account.</p>
<p>Closing, the startup is targeting engineers and other agile teams, though I suspect that its product will have wider market remit in time.</p>
<p>At this juncture, we&#8217;ll have to wait for numbers to see what&#8217;s ahead for CoScreen. The company didn&#8217;t share much in the way of usage metrics, which was reasonable given its recent beta status. We&#8217;ll expect more hard figures the next time we chat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Skycatch today announced a $25 million raise, led by <a href="https://ventures.adb.org/">ADB Ventures</a> and Wavemaker. Founded in 2013, the Bay Area-based company provides centimeter-accurate 3D scanning services, primarily for construction sites and mining operations.</p>
<p>The service has already been rolled out in a number of different locations around the world &#8212; with north of 10,000 sites, according to founder and CEO Christian Sanz. The list includes Chile, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Australia, Canada, the U.S., Indonesia, China, Philippines, Thailand and Japan. In particular, the company is seeking to work with sites where connectivity is limited.</p>
<p>“The process of generating high-precision, centimeter-accurate data is extremely difficult. It typically is owned by the laser scanning market,” says Sanz. “Drones, in general, out of the box are not able to achieve that. We saw the true value prop for Skycatch is operating in edge environments where there’s no connection to internet. That’s where we saw the most demand, initially. That is typically mining companies, operating in all of these remote regions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company’s technology works with off-the-shelf drones, including ones manufactured by DJI. It provides the 3D mapping software, as well as a base station with an edge processor, known as the Edge 1. Skycatch is also working with off-the-shelf lidar companies to help capture data in more difficult environments, including underground for mining operations.</p>

<p>“Asian Development Bank (ADB) aims to play a catalytic role to enable technology in infrastructure projects, which result in reduced carbon footprints and increased safety and operational efficiency,” ADB’s Daniel Hersson said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “The enterprise-grade Skycatch technology for capturing, processing and analyzing high accuracy 3D drone data is a critical part to accomplishing that mission.”</p>
<p>The funds will go toward expanding the 50-person company’s sales and marketing team &#8212; both of which have been fairly small portions of the company’s overall headcount.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Before even taking its first deposit, <a href="http://www.bankgreenwood.com/">Greenwood</a>, the digital banking service targeting Black and Latino individuals and business owners, has raised $40 million &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/killer-mike-former-atlanta-mayor-andrew-young-and-bounce-tv-founder-ryan-glover-launch-a-digital-bank/">only a few months after its launch</a>.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Coming in to finance the new challenger bank are six of the seven largest U.S. Banks and the payment technology developers Mastercard and Visa.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, Bank of America, PNC, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Truist, are backing a bank co-founded by a man who declared, &#8220;I&#8217;m with the revolutionary. I&#8217;m with the radical policy,&#8221; when stumping for then Presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Joining the financial services giants in the round are FIS, a behind-the-scenes financial services tech developer; along with the venture capital firms TTV Capital, SoftBank Group&#8217;s SB Opportunity Fund, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Sports investors Quality Control and All-Pro NFL running back Alvin Kamara also came in to finance the latest round.</p>
<p>Atlanta-based Greenwood was launched last October by a group that included former Atlanta mayor Andrew Young and Bounce TV founder, Ryan Glover.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The net worth of a typical white family is nearly ten times greater than that of a Black family and eight times greater than that of a Latino family. This wealth gap is a curable injustice that requires collaboration,&#8221; said Glover, Chairman and Co-founder of Greenwood, in a statement. &#8220;The backing of six of the top seven banks and the two largest payment technology companies is a testament to the contemporary influence of the Black and Latino community. We now are even better positioned to deliver the world-class services our customers deserve.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the world shifted toward virtual one year ago, one service in particular saw heated demand: remote online notarization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to get a document notarized without leaving one’s home suddenly became more of a necessity than a luxury. Pat Kinsel, founder and CEO of Boston-based Notarize, worked to get appropriate legislation passed across the country to make it possible for more people in more states to get documents notarized digitally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That hard work has paid off. Today, Notarize has announced $130 million in Series D funding led by fintech-focused VC firm </span><a href="https://canapi.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canapi Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after experiencing 600% year over year revenue growth. The round values Notarize at $760 million, which is triple its valuation at the time of its $35 million Series C in March of 2020. This latest round is larger than the sum of all of the company’s previous rounds to date, and brings Notarize’s total raised to $213 million since its 2015 inception.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slew of other investors participated in the round, including Alphabet’s independent growth fund CapitalG, Citi Ventures, Wells Fargo, True Bridge Capital Partners and existing backers Camber Creek, Ludlow Ventures, NAR’s Second Century Ventures, and Fifth Wall Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notarize insists that it “isn’t just a notary company.” Rather, Canapi Ventures Partner Neil Underwood described it as the ‘last mile’ of businesses (such as iBuyers, for example). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has also evolved to “also bring trust and identity verification” into those businesses’ processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, Notarize has seen a massive increase in transactions and inked new partnerships with companies such as Adobe, Dropbox, Stripe and Zillow Group, among others. It’s seen big spikes in demand from the real estate, financial services, retail and automotive sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2020, the world rushed to digitize. Online commerce ballooned, and businesses in almost every industry needed to transition to digital basically overnight so they could continue uninterrupted,” Kinsel said. “Notarize was there to help them safely close these deals with trust and convenience.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to expand its platform and product and scale “to serve enterprises of all sizes.” It also plans to double down on hiring in the next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Notarize is disrupting outdated business models and technologies, and there’s massive potential, particularly in the financial services space, as more companies will need to offer secure digital alternatives to in-person transactions,” Canapi’s Underwood said.</span></p>
<p>Notarize&#8217;s success comes after a difficult 2019, when the company saw &#8220;critical financing&#8221; fall through and had to lay off staff, according to Kinsel. Talk about a turnaround story.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data centers and bitcoin mining operations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/the-debate-about-cryptocurrency-and-energy-consumption/">are becoming huge energy hogs</a> and the explosive growth of both risks undoing a lot of the progress that&#8217;s been made to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. It&#8217;s one of the major criticisms of cryptocurrency operations and something that many in the industry are trying to address.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.liquidstack.com/">LiquidStack</a>, a company that&#8217;s spinning out from the cryptocurrency hardware technology developer <a href="https://bitfury.com/">Bitfury Group</a> with a $10 million investment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company, which was formerly known as Allied Control Limited, restructured as a commercial operating company headquartered in the Netherlands with commercial operations in the U.S. and research and development in Hong Kong, according to a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">It was first acquired by Bitfury in 2015 after building a 2-phase immersion cooling 500kW data center in Hong Kong, that purportedly cut energy consumption by 95% versus traditional air cooling technologies. Later, the companies jointly deployed 160 megawatts of 2-phase immersion cooled data centers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Bitfury has been innovating across multiple industries and sees major growth opportunities with LiquidStack’s game-changing cooling solutions for compute-intensive applications and infrastructure,” said Valery Vavilov, CEO of Bitfury. “I believe LiquidStack’s leadership team, together with our customers and strategic support from Wiwynn, will rapidly accelerate the global adoption and deployment of 2-phase immersion cooling.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The $10 million in funding came from the Taiwanese conglomerate, <a href="https://www.wiwynn.com/">Wiwynn</a>, a data center and infrastructure developer with revenues of $6.3 billion last year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Wiwynn continues to invest in advanced cooling solutions to address the challenges of fast-growing power consumption and density for cloud computing, AI, and HPC,” said Emily Hong, chief executive of Wiwynn, in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a statement, LiquidStack said its technology could enable at least 21 times more heat rejection per IT rack compared to air cooling &#8212; all without the need for water. The company said its cooling method results in a 41 percent reduction in energy used for cooling and a 60 percent reduction in data center space.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Bitfury has always been focused on leading by example and is a technology driven company from the top of the organization, to its grass roots,” said Joe Capes, co-founder and chief executive of LiquidStack, in a statement. “Launching LiquidStack with new funding enables us to focus on our strengths and capabilities, accelerating the development of liquid cooling technology, products and services to help solve real thermal and sustainability challenges driven by the adoption of cloud services, AI, edge and high-performance computing.”</p>
