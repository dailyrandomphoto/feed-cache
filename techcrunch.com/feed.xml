										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Duolingo, best known for its whimsical owl and language-learning app, is working on a new product to add to its growing suite: a math app, according to CEO Luis von Ahn. The co-founder mentioned the app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/31/5-lessons-from-duolingos-bellwether-edtech-ipo-of-the-year/">during an interview last week</a>, the same day that Duolingo officially listed in the stock market.</p>
<p>After the interview, TechCrunch reached out to Duolingo to get more information about the app, but the company declined to provide more detail because it is “still very early” in the development process. It did say that users may learn more about it later this month at <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/duocon">Duocon</a>, Duolingo’s annual free conference. A May job posting shows that Duolingo has been looking for a <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/duolingo/jobs/5243613002">learning scientist </a>with a PhD in mathematics to help build out a new math app alongside a “small cross-functional team.”</p>
<p>The listing hints that the app will be focused on serving younger learners. It mentions that Duolingo wants candidates to have classroom experience and knowledge about teaching K-12 level math, especially with younger students between 3rd and 8th grade.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/49111031/Duolingo-venturing-into-maths">Duolingo&#8217;s current users feel mixed</a> about the idea of Duolingo getting into math.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WBgWuLCuwL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">Duolingo can&#8217;t teach you how to speak a language, but now it wants to try</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Duolingo can&#8217;t teach you how to speak a language, but now it wants to try&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/embed/#?secret=WBgWuLCuwL" data-secret="WBgWuLCuwL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In an interview on IPO day, CEO Luis von Ahn said that users may see Duolingo accelerate its math app and that the company plans to expand beyond language learning through upcoming acquisitions. That may calm some qualms around Duolingo needing to put a ton of resources toward an entirely new piece of software or curriculum.</p>
<p>“If there are other subjects where we think somebody is doing a pretty good job and they have a similar mission to us, and they have a similar company culture,” Duolingo may consider acquiring the company, von Ahn said in the interview.</p>
<p>Math-focused edtech companies include Khan Academy, <a href="https://brilliant.org/">Brilliant.org</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/math-learning-app-photomath-raises-23-million-as-it-reaches-220-million-downloads/"> Photomath</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/numerade-lands-100m-valuation-for-short-form-stem-videos/">Numerade</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/course-hero-symbolab-makes-a-rare-edtech-acquisition/">the recently acquired Symbolab. </a></p>
<p>For Duolingo, the math app is another chapter in its history of experimentation. The company has churned through hundreds of ideas in its decade of existence, which have had varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, it built a product suite beyond its core app, which includes Duolingo ABC, a literacy app for kids and the Duolingo English Test. Meanwhile, Duolingo’s “graveyard” of failed ideas includes a few retired monetization strategies and AI-powered chatbots. Popular features like leaderboards sputtered before they succeeded. And math, interestingly, has always been in the back of von Ahn’s head.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-origin/">As mentioned in the Duolingo EC-1</a>, von Ahn has always said that he and his co-founder, Severin Hacker, were thinking about making Duolingo a math app before they eventually decided on language learning.</p>
<p>“I love math, but if you learn math, math itself can’t make you any money,” von Ahn said in a previous interview. “You learn math to learn physics to become an engineer, whereas knowledge of English directly improves your income potential in most countries of the world.”</p>
<p>One user<a href="https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/49111031/Duolingo-venturing-into-maths"> wrote that</a> “[math] is such a key skill to learn…[and] hopefully this may provide better resources especially to those with such limited access, while being inspirational and equally engaging to those of us with more opportunities.”</p>
<p>Others seemed to want Duolingo to invest inwardly on its language-learning service before moving outward to other areas. “It&#8217;s odd that Duo should consider branching into Maths when its coverage of the majority of languages (with the notable exception of French and Spanish) leaves a great deal to be desired,” <a href="https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/49111031?comment_id=49113260">one user wrote. </a></p>
<p>The company can only teach from a beginner to a low-intermediate level of language fluency according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). About 30% to 40% of Duolingo courses are in some stage of CEFR alignment, per the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">company’s last pull of metrics</a> from May.</p>
<p>It may be too soon to assume how Duolingo’s math app would look, what it would offer or even if it will be monetized. Regardless, it will be Duolingo’s first formal foray into an area of education beyond language.</p>
<p>The company will need to find not only the product, but the philosophical overlap between the two subjects. Language learning is a skill that is benefited by cultural context and nuance, while math revolves around the goal of getting to the one right answer. However, both areas of education require methodical thinking and the ability to apply functions to get to answers. Ultimately, both rely on what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">Duolingo often argues is its biggest product</a>: motivation to open up an app, and pay attention to what’s happening on the screen.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Growth hacking is great to kickstart growth, test new opportunities and see what tactics work. Marketeers should be there to continue where the growth hackers left off."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ward van Gasteren embraces the “growth hacker” term, despite the fact that some in the profession prefer the term “growth marketing” or simply “growth.” What’s the difference to him? The hacking part should be a distinct effort from ongoing marketing efforts, he says.</p>
<p>“Growth hacking is great to kickstart growth, test new opportunities and see what tactics work,” van Gasteren said. “Marketeers should be there to continue where the growth hackers left off: build out those strategies, maintain customer engagement and keep tactics fresh and relevant.”</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;The choice between working with a growth hacker versus a digital marketer is not a one-or-the-other choice; the fields are very different in focus and actually complementary to each other.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Based in The Netherlands, he has developed his own growth hacking courses, <a href="https://growwithward.com/">Grow With Ward</a>, and worked with large companies like TikTok, Pepsi and Cisco, and startups like Cyclemasters, Somnox and Zigzag. In the conversation below, van Gasteren shares the importance of building internal processes around growth for the long term, the state of growth today and his own development.</p>
<p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>You’re a certified growth hacker &#8212; how do you think this sets you apart from others? How has this certification changed the way you approach working with clients?</strong></p>
<p>I was part of the first-ever class from Growth Tribe (when they still offered multimonth traineeships), which was an amazing experience. The difference that a certification shows is that you know that a certified growth hacker has knowledge of the beginning-to-end process of growth hacking, and that this person is supposed to look at more than just a single experiment to hack their growth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are a lot of cowboy growth hackers who simply repeat the same tactics, instead of trying to work from a repeatable process, where you identify problems through data, have a non-biased prioritization process for ideas and will focus on long-term learnings over direct impact. A proper certificate shows that you know what it takes.</p>
<p><strong>When do you think clients should invest in the beginner growth hacking course you offer on your website rather than investing in working with you directly? </strong></p>
<p>I created the course to make growth hacking available to a larger audience. I noticed that almost all other growth hacking courses fell into one of two buckets: (1) cheap (&lt;$200), but focused on superficial growth tactics, or (2) good quality in-depth content, but very expensive ($1,500-$5,000). And I believe everybody should have access to that knowledge of how to build a systematic process to achieve long-term sustainable growth, so I created my own course, since I know that working one-on-one with me is also too expensive for most people.</p>
<p>Especially if you’d look at students or junior marketeers, for whom I created a proper beginner growth hacking course that will teach you 20% of the knowledge that is necessary to achieve the first 80% of the results.</p>
<p><strong>Growth hacking does have some noticeable differences from marketing, as outlined on your <a href="https://growwithward.com/what-is-growth-hacking/">website</a>. How should clients make the decision between working with you, a growth hacker, instead of with a marketer? </strong></p>
<p>The choice between working with a growth hacker versus a digital marketer is not a one-or-the-other choice; the fields are very different in focus and actually complementary to each other. Growth hacking is great to kickstart growth, test new opportunities and see what tactics work. Marketeers should be there to continue where the growth hackers left off: build out those strategies, maintain customer engagement and keep tactics fresh and relevant. You shouldn’t hire a growth hacker to maintain your marketing strategies; they’re excited to make new growth steps and would get bored when they can’t test new ideas.</p>
<p>Most of the time, I help a client get up to speed, show which opportunities are valuable and give them a strategy to execute. Then I hand it over to marketing for the long-term execution and coach them on the execution, and step back in when there’s a need for new growth input.</p>
<p><strong>What are some common misconceptions about growth hacking? </strong></p>
<p>A lot of growth hackers still present growth hacking as a perfect approach, where thanks to our data-driven way of working we can always make the right moves. But that’s not true: The hard data that you see in your analytics tools, can only tell you what is slowing down your growth, but not why your growth slows down there. While the &#8220;why&#8221; is what we build our experiments on top of … many growth hackers just fill that with their own assumptions to keep their speed, but that’s not sustainable long term.</p>
<p>Next to the hard data, you need soft data: the why. And that comes from talking with customers, running hypothesis-focused experiments (not result-focused) and maybe by looking at your feedback from customer support or surveys. Every time I implement a soft data feedback loop with my clients, I see that we increase our experiment effectiveness from 1 in 10 up to 1 in 3.</p>
<p><strong>What trends are you seeing in the growth hacking world right now? </strong></p>
<p>The growth industry is definitely maturing. Less hacks, more teams, more focus on velocity. Everybody within the field is getting to know the best practices very quickly and implementing them even quicker. So then what? We need more knowledge, more qualitative feedback and a more systematic approach to scale up our impact, to be able to rise above best practices and implement truly relevant and sophisticated tactics for our businesses. Since the field is maturing, you see people starting to get rid of the shoestring tools.</p>
<p>For this reason, I’m currently rolling out a growth management tool for growth teams, called Upgrow, where teams can more easily manage their experiment velocity, report to stakeholders with the click of a button and make sure that they systemize the knowledge retention from their articles to build companywide knowledge. And you see that mature growth teams need this kind of software to really level up and manage these trends that are putting stress on their process due to the growth of their company.</p>
<p><strong>What do startups continue to get wrong? </strong></p>
<p>Most startups just keep perfecting their product forever-and-ever: “Just this one extra feature and then we go live.” I can understand that, since north-star metrics, NPS scores and product-led growth are dominating the conversation around startup growth nowadays, but let me be real: You will never be fully done. There will always be a next feature. And you will only have a benefit if you grow alongside your customers. Put a &#8220;coming soon&#8221; on your website for the features that are in the making, and just start selling and scaling up your growth efforts: Different channels bring different kinds of users, who will have new demands, so you have to be adapting all the time. Not just now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple later this year will roll out new tools that will warn children and parents if the child sends or receives sexually explicit photos through the Messages app. The feature is part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">a handful of new technologies Apple is introducing</a> that aim to limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) across Apple&#8217;s platforms and services.</p>
<p>As part of these developments, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">will be able to detec</a>t known CSAM images on its mobile devices, like iPhone and iPad, and in photos uploaded to iCloud, while still respecting consumer privacy.</p>
<p>The new Messages feature, meanwhile, is meant to enable parents to play a more active and informed role when it comes to helping their children learn to navigate online communication. Through a software update rolling out later this year, Messages will be able to use on-device machine learning to analyze image attachments and determine if a photo being shared is sexually explicit. This technology does not require Apple to access or read the child&#8217;s private communications, as all the processing happens on the device. Nothing is passed back to Apple&#8217;s servers in the cloud.</p>
<p>If a sensitive photo is discovered in a message thread, the image will be blocked and a label will appear below the photo that states, &#8220;this may be sensitive&#8221; with a link to click to view the photo. If the child chooses to view the photo, another screen appears with more information. Here, a message informs the child that sensitive photos and videos &#8220;show the private body parts that you cover with bathing suits&#8221; and &#8220;it&#8217;s not your fault, but sensitive photos and videos can be used to harm you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also suggests that the person in the photo or video may not want it to be seen and it could have been shared without their knowing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186143" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186143" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2186143" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png 2046w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=1536,803 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186143" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>These warnings aim to help guide the child to make the right decision by choosing not to view the content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, if the child clicks through to view the photo anyway, they&#8217;ll then be shown an additional screen that informs them that if they choose to view the photo, their parents will be notified. The screen also explains that their parents want them to be safe and suggests that the child talk to someone if they feel pressured. It offers a link to more resources for getting help, as well.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still an option at the bottom of the screen to view the photo, but again, it&#8217;s not the default choice. Instead, the screen is designed in a way where the option to <em>not</em> view the photo is highlighted.</p>
<p>These types of features could help protect children from sexual predators, not only by introducing technology that interrupts the communications and offers advice and resources, but also because the system will alert parents. In many cases where a child is hurt by a predator, parents <a href="https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/katies-apps-piece/289-d399ac48-f052-4378-bfd3-4589a83e9632">didn&#8217;t even realize</a> the child had begun to talk to that person online or by phone. This is because <a href="https://www.bark.us/blog/grooming-signs-sexual-predators/">child predators are very manipulative</a> and will attempt to gain the child&#8217;s trust, then isolate the child from their parents so they&#8217;ll keep the communications a secret. In other cases, the predators <a href="https://www.sexualassaultvictimlawyers.com/the-grooming-process-how-sexual-predators-con-you-and-your-child/">have groomed the parents</a>, too.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s technology could help in both cases by intervening, identifying and alerting to explicit materials being shared.</p>
<p>However, a growing amount of CSAM material is what&#8217;s known as self-generated CSAM, or imagery that is taken by the child, which may be then shared consensually with the child&#8217;s partner or peers. In other words, sexting or sharing &#8220;nudes.&#8221; According to a 2019 <a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent00.net/hubfs/7145355/Research/08112020_SG-CSAM_AttitudesExperiences-Report_2019.pdf?__hstc=208625165.d727c87a690279499c0437f031133788.1607630830912.1608068247513.1608130036388.3&amp;__hssc=208625165.2.1608130036388&amp;__hsfp=4238489979">survey </a>from Thorn, a company developing technology to fight the sexual exploitation of children, this practice has become so common that 1 in 5 girls ages 13 to 17 said they have shared their own nudes, and 1 in 10 boys have done the same. But the child may not fully understand how sharing that imagery puts them at risk of sexual abuse and exploitation.</p>
<p>The new Messages feature will offer a similar set of protections here, too. In this case, if a child attempts to send an explicit photo, they&#8217;ll be warned before the photo is sent. Parents can also receive a message if the child chooses to send the photo anyway.</p>
<p>Apple says the new technology will arrive as part of a software update later this year to accounts set up as families in iCloud for iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey in the U.S.</p>
<p>This update will also include updates to Siri and Search that will offer expanded guidance and resources to help children and parents stay safe online and get help in unsafe situations. For example, users will be able to ask Siri how to report CSAM or child exploitation. Siri and Search will also intervene when users search for queries related to CSAM to explain that the topic is harmful and provide resources to get help.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Many VCs tout their mentorship and hands-on approach to founders, especially those who run early-stage startups. But in the recent era of lightning-fast rounds closing at sky-high valuations, the cap tables of early-stage startups are becoming increasingly crowded.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that the value VCs bring has diminished. If anything, it’s quite the opposite — this new dynamic is forcing founders to be extremely selective about exactly who is sitting around their mentorship table. It’s simply not possible to have numerous deep and meaningful relationships to extract maximum value at the early stage from seasoned investors.</p>
<p>Founders should definitely pursue big rounds at sky-high valuations, but it’s important that they recognize how important it is to manage who they allow into their mentorship circles. Initially, founders should make sure their first layer consists of the real &#8220;doers&#8221; — usually angels and early venture investors who founders meet with weekly (or more frequently) to help solve some of the most granular problems.</p>
<p>Everything from hiring to operational hurdles all the way to deeper, more personal challenges like balancing family life with a rapidly growing startup.</p>
<p>This circle is where the real mentorship happens, where founders can be open and vulnerable. For obvious reasons, this circle has to be small, and usually consist of two to six people at most. Anything more simply becomes unwieldy and leaves founders spending more time managing these relationships than actually building their company.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			How founders manage their VC circles can mean the difference in success or failure for a thousand different reasons.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The second layer should consist of the “quarterly crowd” of investors. These aren’t necessarily people who are uninterested or unwilling to participate in the nitty gritty of running the company, but this circle tends to consist of VCs who make dozens of investments per year. They, like their founders, aren’t capable of managing 50 relationships on a weekly basis, so their touch points on company issues tend to move slower or less frequently.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In May, Yahoo! Answers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/06/technology/yahoo-answers-shutting-down.html">shut down</a> after helping the internet answer its most burning questions since 2005. But now, Quora, which began as a question-and-answer site but expanded to incorporate blogging, is making its platform more appealing to creators.</p>
<p>Quora says it&#8217;s &#8220;on track to be cash flow positive from ads alone,&#8221; implying that the platform isn&#8217;t currently in the black. But Quora sees tapping into the creator economy and subscriptions as a way to turn a profit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make sharing knowledge more financially sustainable for creators,&#8221; Quora CEO Adam D&#8217;Angelo wrote in <a href="https://quorablog.quora.com/New-Quora-Subscription-Products">a blog post</a>. &#8220;Even though many people are motivated and able to spend their time writing on Quora just to share their knowledge, many others could share much more with financial justification to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quora&#8217;s first new product is Quora+ &#8212; subscribers will pay a <a href="https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059646852-How-much-do-people-pay-for-their-Quora-membership-">$5 monthly fee</a> or a $50 yearly fee<em> </em>to access content that any creator chooses to put behind a paywall. These are the same rates that Medium, which has <a href="https://blog.medium.com/ad-free-medium-aeee8ef5dacf">no ads</a>, charges for its <a href="https://medium.com/membership">membership</a> program.</p>
<p>Rather than paying select creators, subscribers will pay Quora. Then, each subscriber&#8217;s payment will be distributed to creators &#8220;in proportion to the amount each subscriber is consuming their content, with more of a subscriber’s contribution going to writers and spaces the subscriber follows.&#8221; Creators have the option to enable a <a href="https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060063591-What-does-the-selective-audience-paywall-option-entail-">dynamic paywall</a> on Quora+ content, which would give free users access to certain posts if Quora thinks they&#8217;re likely to convert to paid membership; there&#8217;s also an &#8220;<a href="https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059641832-What-does-the-Adaptive-paywall-mode-entail-">adaptive</a>&#8221; paywall option, which uses an algorithm to decide whether to paywall content for a specific user on a case-by-case basis. This is supposed to help creators strike a balance between monetizing their content and growing their audience to find new potential subscribers.</p>
<p>Quora told TechCrunch that it is still experimenting with Quora+ and can&#8217;t yet say what percentage it will take from subscriptions.</p>
<p>The other option is for creators to write paywalled posts on <a href="https://quorablog.quora.com/Introducing-Spaces">Spaces</a>, which are like user-created publications on Quora. Quora will take 5% of the subscription fee, which the creator can choose at their own discretion &#8212; comparatively, the direct-to-consumer blogging platform Substack takes <a href="https://substack.com/going-paid?utm_source=menu-dropdown">10% of writers&#8217; profits</a>, which makes Quora a competitive alternative. Other platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/ghost-cms-adds-open-source-subscription-and-membership-options/">Ghost</a> ask for a $9 monthly fee, but let writers retain their revenue &#8212; for writers making at least $180 per month, Ghost would be more profitable than Quora.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We’re able to sustainably commit to taking only a minimal fee without needing to increase it in the future because we make enough revenue from ads to fund most of the platform’s development and operations,&#8221; D&#8217;Angelo wrote. Substack, meanwhile, doesn&#8217;t have ads.</p>
<p>Quora reached a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/21/uniquorn/">$1.8 billion valuation</a> in 2017 after raising $85 million, and at the time, the platform had 190 million monthly users. Now, according to D&#8217;Angelo&#8217;s blog post, over 300 million people use Quora each month. Despite this user growth, Quora <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/layoffs-hit-qa-startup-quora/">laid off</a> an undisclosed amount of staff in its Bay Area and New York City offices in January 2020.</p>
<p>Space subscriptions will launch today for English language users in <a href="https://www.quora.com/about/earnings_eligible_countries">25 countries</a>, including the U.S. The rollout of Quora+ will be less immediate as Quora invites select writers to test the platform and determine what works best for subscribers and creators.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Later this year, Apple will roll out a technology that will allow the company to detect and report known child sexual abuse material to law enforcement in a way it says will preserve user privacy.</p>
<p>Apple told TechCrunch that the detection of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is one of several new features aimed at better protecting the children who use its services from online harm, including filters to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/new-apple-technology-will-warn-parents-and-children-about-sexually-explicit-photos-in-messages/">block potentially sexually explicit photos</a> sent and received through a child&#8217;s iMessage account. Another feature will intervene when a user tries to search for CSAM-related terms through Siri and Search.</p>
<p>Most cloud services — Dropbox, Google, and Microsoft to name a few — already scan user files for content that might violate their terms of service or be potentially illegal, like CSAM. But Apple has long resisted scanning users&#8217; files in the cloud by giving users the option to encrypt their data before it ever reaches Apple&#8217;s iCloud servers.</p>
<p>Apple said its new CSAM detection technology — NeuralHash — instead works on a user&#8217;s device, and can identify if a user uploads known child abuse imagery to iCloud without decrypting the images until a threshold is met and a sequence of checks to verify the content are cleared.</p>
<p>News of Apple&#8217;s effort leaked Wednesday when Matthew Green, a cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins University, revealed the existence of the new technology in <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1423071186616000513">a series of tweets</a>. The news was met with some resistance from some security experts and privacy advocates, but also users who are accustomed to Apple&#8217;s approach to security and privacy that most other companies don&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>Apple is trying to calm fears by baking in privacy through multiple layers of encryption, fashioned in a way that requires multiple steps before it ever makes it into the hands of Apple&#8217;s final manual review.</p>
<p>NeuralHash will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-wwdc-2021-privacy-security/">land in iOS 15</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-unveils-macos-12-monterey/">macOS Monterey</a>, slated to be released in the next month or two, and works by converting the photos on a user&#8217;s iPhone or Mac into a unique string of letters and numbers, known as a hash. Any time you modify an image slightly, it changes the hash and can prevent matching. Apple says NeuralHash tries to ensure that identical and visually similar images — such as cropped or edited images — result in the same hash.</p>

	</p>
<p>Before an image is uploaded to iCloud Photos, those hashes are matched on the device against a database of known hashes of child abuse imagery, provided by child protection organizations like the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) and others. NeuralHash uses a cryptographic technique called private set intersection to detect a hash match without revealing what the image is or alerting the user.</p>
<p>The results are uploaded to Apple but cannot be read on their own. Apple uses another cryptographic principle called threshold secret sharing that allows it only to decrypt the contents if a user crosses a threshold of known child abuse imagery in their iCloud Photos. Apple would not say what that threshold was, but said — for example — that if a secret is split into a thousand pieces and the threshold is ten images of child abuse content, the secret can be reconstructed from any of those ten images.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s at that point Apple can decrypt the matching images, manually verify the contents, disable a user&#8217;s account and report the imagery to NCMEC, which is then passed to law enforcement. Apple says this process is more privacy mindful than scanning files in the cloud as NeuralHash only searches for known and not new child abuse imagery. Apple said that there is a one in one trillion chance of a false positive, but there is an appeals process in place in the event an account is mistakenly flagged.</p>
<p>Apple has <a href="http://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Apple_PSI_System_Security_Protocol_and_Analysis.pdf">published technical details</a> on its <a href="http://www.apple.com/child-safety/">website</a> about how NeuralHash works, which was reviewed by cryptography experts and praised by child protection organizations.</p>
<p>But despite the wide support of efforts to combat child sexual abuse, there is still a component of surveillance that many would feel uncomfortable handing over to an algorithm, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfWoodward/status/1423156599347154946">some security experts are calling</a> for more public discussion before Apple rolls the technology out to users.</p>
<p>A big question is why now and not sooner. Apple said its privacy-preserving CSAM detection did not exist until now. But companies like Apple have also faced considerable pressure from the U.S. government and its allies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/03/five-eyes-governments-call-on-tech-giants-to-build-encryption-backdoors-or-else/">to weaken or backdoor the encryption</a> used to protect their users&#8217; data to allow law enforcement to investigate serious crime.</p>
<p>Tech giants have refused efforts to backdoor their systems, but have faced resistance against efforts to further shut out government access. Although data stored in iCloud is encrypted in a way that even Apple cannot access it, Reuters reported <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive-idUSKBN1ZK1CT">last year</a> that Apple dropped a plan for encrypting users&#8217; full phone backups to iCloud after the FBI complained that it would harm investigations.</p>
<p>The news about Apple&#8217;s new CSAM detection tool, without public discussion, also sparked concerns that the technology could be abused to flood victims with child abuse imagery that could result in their account getting flagged and shuttered, but Apple downplayed the concerns and said a manual review would review the evidence for possible misuse.</p>
<p>Apple said NeuralHash will roll out in the U.S. at first, but would not say if, or when, it would be rolled out internationally. Until recently, companies like Facebook were forced to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55399509">switch off</a> its child abuse detection tools across the bloc after the practice was inadvertently banned. Apple said the feature is technically optional in that you don&#8217;t have to use iCloud Photos, but will be a requirement if users do. After all, your device belongs to you but Apple&#8217;s cloud does not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fleets <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">weren&#8217;t long for this world</a>, but Twitter&#8217;s product teams aren&#8217;t slowing down on bringing new stuff to Spaces, the company&#8217;s own take on audio rooms. Twitter introduced Spaces in a limited test last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/twitter-spaces-to-launch-publicly-next-month-may-include-spaces-only-tweets/">expanding</a> the Clubhouse copycat feature more broadly to anyone with at least 600 followers in May.</p>
<p>Now, Twitter is giving Space hosts the ability to add two co-hosts, who they can rope in through an invite system. Spaces will allow one main host, two additional co-hosts and up to 10 speakers. Additional co-hosts will make the task of moderation much more manageable, as they&#8217;ll be able to vet speaker requests, tap speakers and give anyone in the Space the boot.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">making it easier to manage your Space…introducing co-hosting!</p>
<p>&#8211; hosts have two co-host invites they can send<br />&#8211; the table just got bigger: 1 host, 2 co-hosts, and 10 speakers<br />&#8211; co-hosts can help invite speakers, manage requests, remove participants, pin Tweets and more! <a href="https://t.co/s76JFbhTL2">pic.twitter.com/s76JFbhTL2</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>With Fleets out of the picture, Twitter&#8217;s Spaces are the only feature for now that lives above the main feed in the Twitter app. That virtual real estate, which has echoes of Instagram&#8217;s Stories, draws the eye to anything that a social network wants its users to check out first. Twitter also began rolling out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-redesigns-its-mobile-app-to-make-spaces-the-center-tab/">dedicated tab to make it easier to discover Spaces</a>, surfacing live audio rooms in real time in a central location.</p>
<p>A number of major apps spliced live audio chat rooms into their platforms in light of Clubhouse&#8217;s breakout run. In June, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Spotify launched Greenroom</a>, a standalone app that allows people to create 1,000-person voice events. Naturally, Facebook also launched its own spin on live audio rooms (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">called Live Audio Rooms</a>) in June. Discord, already a leader in voice-based chat, added its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Clubhouse-like event channels</a> in March. Twitter followed the same trend with Spaces, but unlike with Fleets, it looks like the company plans to continue supporting the relatively new feature.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In a company’s early days, the difference between C-level executives and the rest of the organization is simple — employees can walk away from a failure, but the leaders cannot. Under these conditions, certain kinds of people thrive in leadership roles and can take a company from ideation to production.</p>
<p>While there’s no magic formula for what works and what doesn’t, successful startups share common traits in terms of the way their foundational leadership teams are built.</p>
<p>We’ve all experienced what it looks like on the negative end of the spectrum — people making points simply to hear their own voice, leaders competing for credit and clashing agendas. When people would rather be heard than contribute, the output suffers. Members of a healthy leadership team are unafraid to let others have the limelight, because they trust the mission and the culture they’ve built together.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			An honest self-assessment is necessary and this is something that only exceptional and selfless founders are capable of.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We are all imperfect human beings, founders included. There are always going to be moments that leaders can’t predict, and mistakes come with the territory. The right leadership team should be able to mitigate the unexpected, and sometimes make the future easier to predict. Putting the right people in the right roles early on can be the difference between success and failure — and that starts at the top.</p>
<h2>Start by determining who will lead as CEO</h2>
<p>Investors love founder-CEOs, and founders are often fantastic candidates for this role. But not everyone can do it well, and more importantly, not everyone wants to.</p>
<p>Startup founders should ask themselves a few questions before they lose sleep over the prospect of handing over the reigns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I even want to be CEO? If yes, for how long?</li>
<li>Can I maximize the potential of the company if I’m not the CEO?</li>
<li>Am I really the best person for this job at this stage?</li>
</ul>
<p>An honest self-assessment is necessary and this is something that only exceptional and selfless founders are capable of. In many cases, founders decide they need outside help to fill the role. While a CEO may not be your first hire — or even one of the first five — the person you choose will ultimately occupy your organization’s most critical leadership role, so choose wisely.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Ambitious vision grounded in execution reality. Your CEO should have hands-on experience that allows them to see around corners, predict pitfalls and identify opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>What to watch out for:</strong> Leaders who lack respect for the founding vision or the ability to hire and balance an executive team quickly. A good CEO should be able to manage short-term cash flow and go-to-market needs without compromising the true north, while building a foundation and culture for the long term.</p>
<h2>Then, hire a leader for your engineering team<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walter Isaacson, the biographer who chronicled the lives of Steve Jobs, Benjamin Franklin and Leonardo da Vinci, is turning his attention to the life and career of Elon Musk. The Tesla CEO announced the project in a tweet Wednesday.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">If you’re curious about Tesla, SpaceX &amp; my general goings on, <a href="https://twitter.com/WalterIsaacson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WalterIsaacson</a> is writing a biography</p>
<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1423104512479334402?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Musk said that Isaacson has shadowed him “for several days so far,” though he later added that an autobiography might still be in the cards one day. It’s unclear when the book will be released or how far along Isaacson is in the project. His biography on Steve Jobs (aptly titled &#8220;Steve Jobs<em>&#8220;</em>) took more than two years and included interviews with more than 100 of Jobs’ peers.</p>
<p>Musk has been the subject of a number of books, but Isaacson is the most high-profile biographer yet to take on his story. The author is currently a professor at Tulane University and was previously the CEO of the Aspen Institute and the CEO of CNN. Isaacson appeared onstage at TechCrunch&#8217;s Disrupt in 2014.</p>

<p>Other books on Musk’s life and work include Ashlee Vance’s 2015 biography, &#8220;Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future,&#8221; in which Musk participated; Ed Niedermeyer&#8217;s &#8220;Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors&#8221; and this month&#8217;s release of Tim Higgins’ &#8220;Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk, and the Bet of the Century.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musk and Higgins had a brief back-and-forth about a section of &#8220;Power Play&#8221; describing a particularly spicy interaction between him and Apple CEO Tim Cook. The conversation, which Higgins reported in his book and took place over the phone, was over Cook’s purported interest in acquiring Tesla back in 2016. As Higgins tells it, Musk tells Cook he’s interested, but on the condition that he be instated as CEO of Apple &#8212; to which Cook replies, “F—you.”</p>
<p>Musk maintained in a tweet that he and Cook have never spoken or written to each other. Higgins replied that the anecdote came from people who reported as hearing Musk’s recounting of the conversation at the time. He added that Musk was given plenty of opportunities to comment on the anecdote. “He didn’t,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the world of robotic startups, acquisition is often as good an outcome as any. And when it comes to robotic tractor startups, you could do worse than being acquired by John Deere. The agricultural technology giant announced today that <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/john-deere-acquires-bear-flag-robotics-to-accelerate-autonomous-technology-on-the-farm-301349496.html">it’s set to acquire Bear Flag Robotics</a> for $250 million.</p>
<p>The Bay Area-based firm, which specializes in autonomous farming heavy machinery, was founded in 2017. They first crossed our radar the following year, as a member of YC’s Winter 2018 cohort.</p>
<p>“We got a tour of an orchard and just how pronounced the labor problem is,” co-founder Aubrey Donnellan told TechCrunch at the time. “They’re struggling to fill seats on tractors. We talked to other growers in California. We kept hearing the same thing over and over: Labor is one of the most significant pain points. It’s really hard to find quality labor. The workforce is aging out. They’re leaving the country and going into other industries.”</p>
<p>In the intervening years, John Deere tapped Bear Flag for its own Startup Collaborator initiative. And the robotics firm has also begun to deploy its technology to an undisclosed (“limited,” per their wording) number of sites in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the biggest challenges farmers face today is the availability of skilled labor to execute time-sensitive operations that impact farming outcomes. Autonomy offers a safe and productive alternative to address that challenge head on,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Igino Cafiero, says in a release. &#8220;Bear Flag&#8217;s mission to increase global food production and reduce the cost of growing food through machine automation is aligned with Deere&#8217;s and we&#8217;re excited to join the Deere team to bring autonomy to more farms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Agricultural is one of several robotics categories that have seen a spike in interest in the past year, due to labor shortages that predate but were exacerbated by the global pandemic. Of course, that interest doesn’t make anyone immune from the difficulties of launching a robotics startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last month, apple-picking robotics firm Abundant<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/robotics-roundup-19/"> confirmed it was closing up shop</a>, noting, “After a series of promising commercial trials with prototype apple harvesters, the company was unable to raise enough investment funding to continue development and launch a production system,” the company noted at the time.</p>
<p>An acquisition seems like a reasonable outcome for a company like Bear Flag. The startup gains a lot of resources from its massive new owner, and its new owner adds some new tech to its portfolio. Indeed, John Deere has been pretty aggressively looking to expand into more cutting-edge technologies like robotics and drones in recent years.</p>
<p>Bear Flag will retain operations in the Bay Area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies developing driver detection technology could get a boost from a provision tucked inside the 2,702-page <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e/a/ea1eb2e4-56bd-45f1-a260-9d6ee951bc96/F8A7C77D69BE09151F210EB4DFE872CD.edw21a09.pdf">$1 trillion infrastructure bill</a> that would require automakers to build into new cars technology that can tell if drivers have had a few cold ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The provision in the bill, which is actually a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Reduce Impaired Driving for Everyone Act that was introduced in April 2021, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">would direct the U.S. Department of Transportation to establish a technology safety standard for automakers within three years. Automakers would then have another two years to comply and implement tech that detects and prevents drunk driving. Reuters was the first to</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-bill-seeks-require-anti-drunk-driving-vehicle-tech-2021-08-02/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">notice the language</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the provision doesn’t dictate what type of tech has to be in these vehicles, industry experts believe that companies developing camera-based driver monitoring systems (DMS) stand to benefit the most. DMS systems are already mature in the auto industry, representing a technological byproduct of autonomous driving developments. While the auto industry explores self-driving cars as a way to drastically reduce road deaths in the future, advocates and regulators say there&#8217;s room to use some of this tech to solve problems that exist <em>now,</em> like drunk or distracted driving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s happening in the U.S. Senate this week potentially opens the door to a camera-based real-time solution, which will be the first time that the U.S. automakers will have the ability and the requirement to look at real-time physiological changes in your body that occur when you are inebriated,” Dr. Mike Lenné, chief science and innovation officer at Seeing Machines told TechCrunch. &#8220;There are distinct reliable changes to the way you scan the environment, to the way your eyes respond to stimuli, which is why the police use that ‘follow the finger’ test.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system would have to monitor the performance of a driver to detect impairment and prevent or limit vehicle operation if impairment is detected; detect whether BAC (blood alcohol concentration) is equal to or greater than the legal limit, potentially preventing operation of the vehicle at all; or a combination of both systems. </span></p>
<p>Cameras aren&#8217;t the only solution that has been trotted out in recent years.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety (DADSS) program, a technology that’s been developed in partnership between the Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), has advocated using a breath or touch-based approach to determine BAC levels. The touch-based approach involves measuring BAC through the skin&#8217;s surface by shining an infrared light through the driver&#8217;s fingertip.</span><a href="https://www.dadss.org/faq"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">According to DADSS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the current timeline for bringing the breath-based approach to vehicles is by 2024, and the touch-based approach by 2025. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lenné argues that a camera-based approach would be far more successful than a breath or touch-based approach because BAC levels can rise within minutes. Someone could theoretically down a bunch of shots immediately before getting behind the wheel and it wouldn’t show up on a reading for several minutes. Or they could get wasted while driving. And BAC detection doesn’t help at all when it comes to drug-impaired driving. </span></p>
<h2>Europe versus U.S.</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moves are already being made in Europe to encourage automakers to include drunk driving detection technology, specifically through camera-based DMS approaches, whereas most of the discussion on this type of tech in the U.S. has been, until recently, focused on DMS for assisted driving and Level 2 autonomous driving and above. (According to the Society of Automotive Engineers, Level 2 autonomy means the vehicle has combined functions like steering and acceleration but requires the driver to remain engaged.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. provision could propel an industry that has already seen growth in recent years as automakers like GM and Ford implement hands-free advanced driver assistance systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From an integration viewpoint, it’s actually not a step change at all from what the OEMs are doing right now for distracted driving and drowsy driving with camera-based DMS. It’s just another feature to offer, another algorithm on the chip, if you like,” Lenné said. </span></p>
<h2>Near-term tech</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Billions of dollars have gone into developing the technology to make AVs a reality but they are really far off,&#8221; Stephanie Manning, chief government affairs officer at Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), told TechCrunch. &#8220;In the process, automakers have developed a lot of technology that can help us right now in terms of saving lives. If this passes, it&#8217;s going to be the biggest safety rulemaking that NHTSA has ever done in terms of lives saved, and it couldn&#8217;t have come at a better time. But the more we wait, the more we delay, the more people die.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology is not at all far from market, said Lenné, and he would know. Seeing Machines provides the DMS that is used in Super Cruise, GM&#8217;s hands-free advanced driver assistance system. Super Cruise, once relegated to just one Cadillac model, has expanded in capability and GM&#8217;s portfolio and is now in the Cadillac CT6, CT4, CT5, Escalade and Chevrolet Bolt. Seeing Machine&#8217;s tech is also used in the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class and EQS sedans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once it&#8217;s regulated, we can expect to see more entrants to the market because what this does is it creates a top-down demand,” said Lenné. &#8220;It takes it out of the consumers&#8217; hands and tells vehicles they must have these safety features, so the market size will increase dramatically, and so will the market opportunity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The global DMS market is estimated to surpass $2.1 billion by 2026, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 9.8% from this year, <a href="https://www.industryarc.com/Report/172/driver-monitoring-systems-global-market-report.html">according to IndustryARC</a>. Top-down demand due to regulations like the infrastructure bill will certainly increase demand, but it won&#8217;t make the problem easier to solve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to assess what&#8217;s going on in someone&#8217;s head, and that&#8217;s really different from having a forward-facing radar that&#8217;s trying to look at what&#8217;s 30 meters in front of you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re trying to interpret whether or not this person is safe to drive. So it&#8217;s a really difficult technical problem to solve. Our company is 21 years old. Smart Eye has been around for over 10 years. Whilst the market size has increased dramatically, it&#8217;s a hard problem to solve as a new entrant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Newcomers will face competition from established and large Tier 1 suppliers like Seeing Machines and Smart Eye, a Swedish computer vision company that people familiar with the industry say works with Ford (Ford did not confirm or deny this). IndustryARC also names major players as Faurecia, Aptiv PLC, Bosch, Denso, Continental AG and others. But new players are finding their way into the scene, like Israel-based Cipia, formerly Eyesight Technology, and Sweden-based Tobii Tech.</p>
<h2>Room for growth in the market</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More entrants to market means more advancements to the technology. Smart Eye&#8217;s recent acquisition of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/emotion-detection-software-startup-affectiva-acquired-for-73-5m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emotion-detection startup Affectiva for $73.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hints at the potential future applications of DMS in passenger vehicles. Today it might be distracted, drowsy or drunk driving, but in a few years DMS could detect other types of drug impairment, cognitive impairments or even road rage.</span></p>
<p>Tobii, an eye-tracker technology company, just announced its entrance into the DMS market, a space it&#8217;s been exploring for the past few years as it has watched the legislative changes happening first in Europe and now in the U.S.</p>
<p>While a new entrant to the automotive space, Tobii has been in the eye tracking space since 2001, working in industries like marketing, scientific research, virtual reality, gaming and more. Anand Srivatsa, Tobii&#8217;s division CEO, told TechCrunch he thinks one of the biggest challenges will be scaling across different populations, given the different eye shapes of different ethnicities, which he says puts Tobii at an advantage, even with its limited automotive experience.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Emotion-detection software startup Affectiva acquired for $73.5M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/emotion-detection-software-startup-affectiva-acquired-for-73-5m/embed/#?secret=8hdnxcuY6m" data-secret="8hdnxcuY6m" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Because of this long history, we have what it takes to deliver a full solution from a component level all the way to end software because we&#8217;ve done it in other parts of our business,&#8221; Srivatsa told TechCrunch. &#8220;Some of our automotive partners see that as a unique capability from Tobii where we can talk about the compute that is needed for eye tracking because we build our own asix, we&#8217;ve built our own sensor. We have end user software in some aspects of our business, so we understand the implications and the constraints of each of these parts of the stack, and we can work with them to create a more disruptive solution. And that&#8217;s something that I think is going to be quite important in this space. How do you reduce the total cost of the solution to allow it to scale efficiently across all cars?&#8221;</p>
<p>Srivatsa also said there&#8217;s room to extend into other spaces the biometrics or physiological signals that eye tracking yields, reconfiguring information based on outside road conditions or what else is going on in the car in a way that optimizes the tech to ensure drivers are spending the bulk of their time looking at the road.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I am hoping and dreaming for is technologies like forward collision warning, or blind spot warning or even the lane swerving warnings help me out when I need it most by understanding if I&#8217;m becoming complacent or tired, perhaps distracted, and then adjust how the systems perform, the warning timing and things like that, based on what I need in the moment,” Kelly Funkhouser, program manager of vehicle interface testing and head of connected and automated vehicles at Consumer Reports, told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Counter to that is I would like it to not bother me and nag and annoy me when I am fully paying attention. I&#8217;m like ‘Yeah I know exactly what I&#8217;m doing, I am purposely driving over this line so that I don&#8217;t hit the mom and kids.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lenné said there&#8217;s a potential for driver monitoring systems that capture what is really going on inside of a car to become more personalized in order to provide a better driving experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think in all of this, writing a better driving experience is absolutely pivotal,” said Lenné. “If it doesn’t do that, it risks not being accepted by the consumers.”</span></p>
<h2>Advancing existing ADAS tech</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automakers have been a part of the conversation regarding drunk driving technology for years. Back in 2007,</span><a href="https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/release-95e86dba49c0e8277e3c7b662e6aac68-070803-02-e"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nissan revealed a drunk driving concept car</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would use alcohol odor sensors, facial monitoring and vehicle operational behavior to detect driver impairment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same year,</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna16449687"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Toyota announced a similar system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it said would be in cars by 2009. More recently,</span><a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/volvo-drunk-driving-distracted-cameras-sensors-safety/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo announced in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it would install cameras and sensors in cars to monitor drivers for signs of being drunk or distracted and then signal the vehicle to intervene, but that tech is designed for Volvo&#8217;s SPA2 architecture for hands-free driving, which hasn&#8217;t been released yet. The bottom line is without legislation mandating drunk driving prevention and detection, automakers haven’t really moved forward on implementing the tech, despite much of the building blocks being in place already. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manning thinks that’s because automakers want to be able to upcharge for safety features. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Automakers want to test their supercomputers on the open road, but they don&#8217;t want to put the money and time and energy into solving drunk driving, because they don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s their responsibility, and they don&#8217;t want this rule-making,” she said. “We fully expect that they&#8217;re going to fight us tooth and nail throughout the rule-making process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representatives from GM and Ford could not be reached for comment, but John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which worked with NHTSA on the DADSS program, told TechCrunch that the auto industry is committed to supporting public and private efforts to address this threat to road safety.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We appreciate the efforts of congressional leaders and other stakeholders to advance a legislative approach that provides NHTSA the ability to review all potential technologies as options for federal regulation and, consistent with the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, to make a well-informed decision as to whether any specific technologies meet the standard for consumer vehicles,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Inspector General will review the FDA’s accelerated approval pathway, the office announced Wednesday. This sweeping review comes just two months after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/alzheimers-is-open-for-business-controversial-fda-approval-could-pave-the-way-for-future-drugs/">controversial approval of Biogen’s Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm</a>.</p>
<p>The review will focus on the FDA’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-health-care-professionals-drugs/accelerated-approval-program">accelerated approval pathway</a> — a route that allows drugs for serious diseases without existing treatments to be approved if they hit certain interim benchmarks (called surrogate endpoints). These drugs are thought to provide clinical benefit, but that benefit hasn’t actually been demonstrated before the drug is approved. Once the drug is approved, a phase four study would need to demonstrate clinical efficacy.</p>
<p>This is the pathway that allowed for the highly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/after-contentious-debate-fda-approves-first-alzheimers-drug-since-2003/">controversial approval</a> of Aduhelm, the first Alzheimer’s drug to be approved since 2003. It’s this approval that set the HHS-OIG review process in motion, per the Inspector General’s <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/workplan/summary/wp-summary-0000608.asp">Wednesday announcement</a>.</p>
<p>“The FDA&#8217;s approval of Aduhelm raised concerns due to alleged scientific disputes within the FDA, the advisory committee&#8217;s vote against approval, allegations of an inappropriately close relationship between the FDA and the industry, and the FDA&#8217;s use of the accelerated approval pathway,” the announcement reads.</p>
<p>“In response to these concerns, we will assess how the FDA implements the accelerated approval pathway.”</p>
<p>While the FDA has <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2111960">defended its decision</a> to approve Aduhlem via this pathway, there has been significant backlash about the drug’s efficacy and how it got approved in the first place.</p>
<p>Aduhelm, also known as aducanumab, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19323'">had demonstrated</a> it could reduce amyloid plaques in the brain (sticky compounds that disrupt communications between brain cells). However, there have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/after-contentious-debate-fda-approves-first-alzheimers-drug-since-2003/">lingering questions</a> about how much patients actually benefited from the drug. It was unclear whether lowering levels of amyloid plaques would actually slow rates of Alzheimer’s most pernicious symptom: cognitive decline.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In March 2019, two phase three trials of the drug were <a href="https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/aduhelm">shut down</a> after independent monitoring committees found that the drug wasn’t improving patients rates of cognitive decline. Another analysis conducted by Biogen in October, however, yielded different results. One phase three clinical trial of the drug did not show any improvements in cognitive decline, but the other trial did show some modest effects in patients who got the highest doses.</p>
<p>In November 2020 an independent FDA committee declined to endorse the drug for approval. Yet, by June 2021, the drug was approved anyway.</p>
<p>Within the pharmaceutical industry, the approval of Aduhelm initially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/alzheimers-is-open-for-business-controversial-fda-approval-could-pave-the-way-for-future-drugs/">sparked optimism</a> that the FDA might open its doors to more biomarker-based approvals. However, that optimism wasn’t shared by the wider scientific community.</p>
<p>Three members of the independent committee that had advised against the drug’s approval <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/10/health/aduhelm-fda-resign-alzheimers.html">resigned in protest</a>. Based on the inconsistent data, major hospital systems like Mt. Sinai and the Cleveland Clinic have indicated they <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/hospitals/nyt-cleveland-clinic-mount-sinai-won-t-prescribe-controversial-alzheimer-s-disease-drug">won’t prescribe the drug</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the controversy around Aduhelm’s approval has centered around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/health/alzheimers-drug-aduhelm-fda.html">allegations of an especially close working relationship</a> between the FDA and Biogen leading up to the drug’s approval. As <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/06/29/biogen-fda-alzheimers-drug-approval-aduhelm-project-onyx/">STAT first reported</a>, Biogen launched an internal effort called Project Onyx to try to convince regulators to approve the drug, and some FDA officials eventually played active roles in the drug’s approval, including joint presentations before external experts.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/DrWoodcockFDA/status/1413540804962947072">July 9 letter,</a> Janet Woodcock, acting FDA Commissioner, called for HHS-OIG to conduct an external review that would investigate this working relationship.</p>
<p>“We believe an independent assessment is the best manner in which to determine whether any interactions that occurred between the manufacturer and the agency’s review staff were inconsistent with FDA’s policies and procedures,” she wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>While the HHS-OIG investigation was spurred by the Aduhelm controversy, this review will not focus on reviewing the scientific evidence behind Aduhlem (or any other drug, for that matter). Rather it will peek under the hood of the <i>entire </i>accelerated approval pathway to assess how, and when, the FDA chooses to allow drugmakers to go down that road.</p>
<p>HHS-OIG will review interactions between the FDA and outside parties, policies and procedures, and interrogate the FDA’s compliance with those procedures. The review will cover the Aduhelm review process but will also interrogate how the pathway was used to approve other drugs as well.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/DrWoodcockFDA/status/1422957204802506755?s=20">statement on Twitter</a> Woodcock also said that the FDA will “fully cooperate” with the HHS-OIG review.</p>
<p>“Should the HHS OIG identify any actionable items and provide the agency with any recommendations, the FDA would review those expeditiously to determine the best course of action,” she said.</p>
<p>Should actions be required, they could have significant ramifications for drugs in the future, as this pathway is already an attractive option for other companies pursuing Alzheimer’s drugs.</p>
<p>Eli Lilly, for instance, is also working on an Alzheimer’s drug called donanemab, has released <a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-releases-donanemab-data-demonstrated-relationship-between">exploratory findings</a> from a Phase II trial showing that the drug lowered levels of amyloid and other biomarkers and was associated with patient improvements. However, the bulk of the results rest on the drug’s efficacy against biomarkers of Alzheimer’s, rather than individual patient outcomes.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/03/eli-lilly-and-company-lly-q2-2021-earnings-call-tr/">Q2 earnings call this week</a>, Eli Lilly’s senior vice president and chief scientific medical officer, Daniel M. Skovronsky, noted that the FDA’s approval of Aduhelm “reflects a shift in policy and sets a new path for Alzheimer&#8217;s drug approval in the U.S,” and Eli Lilly still intends to file for FDA approval for donanemab using the FDA accelerated approval pathway by the end of the year.</p>
<p>But, that’s the same pathway that will now be under investigation by HHS-OIG.</p>
<p>Still, we might not see results anytime soon, so it is unclear how this news will impact future Alzheimer’s drugmakers seeking to capitalize on a perceived “shift in policy.” The report is scheduled to be released in 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The $3.8 billion sale of Swedish automotive tech company Veoneer to Magna International hit a roadblock Thursday after chipmaker Qualcomm submitted a bid for the company for $800 million more.</p>
<p>Qualcomm’s $4.6 billion bid, which comes in at $37 per share, has already received approval from the company’s board and would not need a stockholder vote, the chipmaker said in a statement. Veoneer and Magna said in July that both companies’ boards had approved the acquisition.</p>
<p>Veoneer is a developer of advanced driver assistance systems, decision-making vehicle hardware and software that can perform a limited set of actions under certain conditions, like changing lanes on a highway or emergency braking. While ADAS is a far cry from “self-driving cars,” it has become a popular &#8212; and attainable &#8212; set of features that are appearing in a greater share of new vehicles on offer today.</p>
<p>The burgeoning bidding war between Magna and Qualcomm is bullish on the future of ADAS technology, as each company seeks to stay competitive with Tier-1 ADAS suppliers Continental and Bosch. Qualcomm’s market capitalization currently sits at $164.8 billion, while Magna’s is $25.3 billion. It&#8217;s unclear whether Magna will submit a counter-bid.</p>
<p>The market has responded to the new bid, with the stock price of Veoneer rising nearly $7 per share, from $31.22 to $38.20 between Wednesday and Thursday. Prior to the announcement of the sale to Magna on July 23, Veoneer stock sat at $19.93 per share.</p>
<p>Veoneer was spun off from automotive safety system maker Autoliv in 2018. The company formed a joint venture with Volvo Cars, dubbed Zenuity, that was focused on advanced driver assistance systems. That venture was later split last July.</p>
<p>The ADAS developer also has a pre-existing relationship with Qualcomm. The two companies signed an agreement in January to collaborate on an ADAS platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more businesses around the U.S. are choosing to implement vaccine requirements for patrons or staff, business discovery and review site Yelp is introducing new tools that allow businesses to communicate those changes to their customers. On Thursday, Yelp will begin rolling out two profile attributes, &#8220;Proof of vaccination required&#8221; and &#8220;Staff fully vaccinated,&#8221; to help consumers to understand how a business is operating with regard to the pandemic.</p>
<p>While there is no federal mandate for businesses to require proof of vaccination, some cities are introducing their own policies. Recently, New York City became the first to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/nyregion/new-york-city-vaccine-mandate.html">require proof of vaccination for indoor restaurants and gyms</a>, and, San Francisco is <a href="https://abc7news.com/san-francisco-coronavirus-vaccine-francico-mandate/10928812/">now exploring</a> a similar set of mandates. Other cities may choose to follow suit in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://kutv.com/news/local/requiring-proof-of-vaccination-utah-business-owners-weighing-new-risks">local</a> <a href="https://fox59.com/news/coronavirus/indiana-business-leaders-urge-workers-to-get-covid-19-vaccinations-take-other-safety-precautions/">business</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/business-owners-defend-their-decisions-to-require-vaccines-2021-8">owners</a> across the U.S. are implementing their own measures outside of federal or state guidance, including requiring masks or proof of vaccination for customers, or requiring their staff to be vaccinated. These choices often come at a price, as the businesses risk social media backlash and bad reviews from the anti-vaccine crowd.</p>
<p>Yelp&#8217;s new features will represent an attempt to help mitigate that reaction, the company explains.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186277" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186277" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2186277" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Vaccination-Attributes-on-Biz-Page.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Vaccination-Attributes-on-Biz-Page.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Vaccination-Attributes-on-Biz-Page.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Vaccination-Attributes-on-Biz-Page.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Vaccination-Attributes-on-Biz-Page.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Vaccination-Attributes-on-Biz-Page.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Vaccination-Attributes-on-Biz-Page.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Vaccination-Attributes-on-Biz-Page.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186277" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yelp</p></div></p>
<p>Yelp says it will proactively leverage a combination of automated systems and human moderators to safeguard businesses from attacks from customers if a business opts to activate either of the two new options related to their COVID vaccine policies.</p>
<p>Though the company has long since had <a href="https://trust.yelp.com/consumer-alerts/">systems</a> in place to address &#8220;review bombing&#8221; incidents, Yelp says the practice has gotten worse in recent months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the past, businesses that gained negative public attention may have had an influx of reviews from those who didn&#8217;t have a firsthand experience with the business in question, which violates Yelp&#8217;s policy. Yelp may then alert a visitor to the business&#8217;s page that there&#8217;s the potential for fake reviews or that there had been spikes in unusual activity. The company will sometimes even temporarily block users from being able to leave reviews. And in some cases, Yelp will also need to <a href="https://www.yelp-support.com/article/Will-Yelp-remove-a-false-or-defamatory-review">remove</a> false reviews or those that otherwise violate its policies.</p>
<p>But since January 2021, Yelp says it&#8217;s had to place over 100 <a href="https://trust.yelp.com/consumer-alerts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://trust.yelp.com/consumer-alerts/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628112440794000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGLmzIXaNJ27RlgZGP96EsKslekxA">Unusual Activity Alerts</a> on its pages in response to a business gaining public attention for their COVID health and safety practices. This has included if a business notified customers that vaccinations were required for its employees or for its patrons.</p>
<p>As a result, Yelp has had to remove nearly 4,500 reviews for violating its content guidelines.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186276" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186276" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2186276" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Sees-Rise-in-Unusual-Activity-Alerts-Related-to-COVID-Precautions.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="518" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Sees-Rise-in-Unusual-Activity-Alerts-Related-to-COVID-Precautions.png 2496w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Sees-Rise-in-Unusual-Activity-Alerts-Related-to-COVID-Precautions.png?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Sees-Rise-in-Unusual-Activity-Alerts-Related-to-COVID-Precautions.png?resize=300,229 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Sees-Rise-in-Unusual-Activity-Alerts-Related-to-COVID-Precautions.png?resize=768,585 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Sees-Rise-in-Unusual-Activity-Alerts-Related-to-COVID-Precautions.png?resize=680,518 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Sees-Rise-in-Unusual-Activity-Alerts-Related-to-COVID-Precautions.png?resize=1536,1170 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Sees-Rise-in-Unusual-Activity-Alerts-Related-to-COVID-Precautions.png?resize=2048,1561 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Sees-Rise-in-Unusual-Activity-Alerts-Related-to-COVID-Precautions.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186276" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yelp</p></div></p>
<p>As Yelp was already handling these types of incidents, it&#8217;s now more formally introducing a way for businesses to flag their COVID policies through the new products.</p>
<p>The company notes it put a similar system in place when it launched the <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/2020/06/yelp-teams-up-with-my-black-receipt-to-support-black-owned-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.yelp.com/2020/06/yelp-teams-up-with-my-black-receipt-to-support-black-owned-businesses&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628196935959000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg6aPudWeRNDHcFJWW0ow0DPrMEA">Black-owned attribute</a> in June 2020 and again followed the same process for other identity attributes (e.g., <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/2020/09/yelp-partners-with-momento-latino-to-support-latinx-owned-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.yelp.com/2020/09/yelp-partners-with-momento-latino-to-support-latinx-owned-businesses&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628196935959000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEG6OAaDRC58UrPmKujvwcTcRGgEQ">Latinx-owned</a>, <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/2021/04/yelp-and-gold-house-partner-to-make-it-easier-to-support-asian-owned-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.yelp.com/2021/04/yelp-and-gold-house-partner-to-make-it-easier-to-support-asian-owned-businesses&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628196935959000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEKJzcRB2AAQm1ALLqLfpxo4gllZQ">Asian-owned</a> and <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/2021/05/yelp-makes-it-easy-to-support-lgbtq-owned-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.yelp.com/2021/05/yelp-makes-it-easy-to-support-lgbtq-owned-businesses&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628196935959000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGB4fYRUx9ntK3Ka7UEsazUy9pXYg">LGBTQ-owned</a>) by proactively monitoring business pages that activated these attributes for any hateful, racist or other harmful content that violated its content guidelines.</p>
<p>The company tells TechCrunch there was demand for its new COVID policy feature from business owners, as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186274" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186274" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2186274" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Vaccination-Attribute-Filters.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Vaccination-Attribute-Filters.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Vaccination-Attribute-Filters.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Vaccination-Attribute-Filters.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Vaccination-Attribute-Filters.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Vaccination-Attribute-Filters.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Vaccination-Attribute-Filters.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Yelp-Vaccination-Attribute-Filters.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186274" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yelp</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Both business owners and consumers have expressed interest in Yelp releasing vaccine-related attributes,&#8221; said Noorie Malik, Yelp&#8217;s VP of User Operations. &#8220;For many months we’ve seen businesses implement vaccine requirements for both their customers and staff. As a result, we’ve also seen a rise in reviews focused on people’s stance on COVID vaccinations rather than their actual experience with the business,&#8221; Malik noted.</p>
<p>The businesses want to be assured that their page will be more actively monitored for false reviews when they choose to share this information.</p>
<p>Yelp, of course, understands that if allowed its reviews platform to become a place that veered away from customers detailing their firsthand experiences, it service overall would become less useful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yelp has always served as a trusted source of information on local businesses, helping the millions of people that come to Yelp every day make informed spending decisions,&#8221; Malik said. &#8220;It’s important that consumers have a resource for relevant firsthand information when engaging with a business. You could argue this is even more important during a public health crisis, making reviews from relevant firsthand consumer experiences critical.&#8221;</p>
<p>The feature is rolling out now and can be found on the <a href="https://business.yelp.com/">Yelp for Business</a> account page.</p>

Left unmentioned: A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spain-agrees-on-labor-reform-that-will-recognize-delivery-platform-riders-as-employees/">Spanish legal change</a> requiring companies that previously depended on freelance couriers to hire their delivery staff.</p>
<p>Race Capital’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/hear-startup-alley-companies-pitch-expert-vc-judges-on-the-next-episode-of-extra-crunch-live/">Edith Yeung</a> helped explain the Deliveroo choice to The Exchange, saying the Spanish market doesn&#8217;t have a very large population, which may mean that the “potential upside for being #1 in Spain has [a] ceiling.”</p>
<p>While she noted that she doesn&#8217;t have access to Deliveroo data, her statement jibes with the company&#8217;s own comment that Spain made up less than 2% of its aggregate gross transaction value (GTV) in the first half of 2021.</p>

<p>One company exiting a market is not a big deal, but we were curious about Deliveroo’s comments regarding the need for market leadership — or something close to it — to warrant continued investment. Is this the common reality for startups battling for market position, no matter if those markets are cities or countries?</p>
<p>Some startup markets have trended toward monopolies or duopolies. The Uber-Didi battle in China led to the companies agreeing to stop competing. Uber also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/uber-sold-its-food-delivery-business-in-india-to-zomato-for-206m/">recently sold its Uber Eats business in India to Zomato</a>. In the United States, Uber and Lyft&#8217;s smaller competitors have long been forgotten and both the American ride-hailing giants continue to battle for dominance.</p>

The food delivery game is concentrated amongst leading players. Postmates failed to survive as an independent company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/uber-takes-out-postmates/">winding up as part of Uber’s operations</a>. Perhaps Gopuff will manage to claw out a spot in the market, but DoorDash and Uber Eats together accounted for 83% of the U.S. food delivery business in June this year, <a href="https://secondmeasure.com/datapoints/food-delivery-services-grubhub-uber-eats-doordash-postmates/">per Second Measure data</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that some startup markets lean toward monopolies or duopolies. Many countries protect intellectual property via patents that can constrain new innovation to one or two players for an extended period of time. Monopolies can also arise when a new technology or method of business is invented — Google’s internet parsing search tech led to a nigh-monopoly in many markets, for example.</p>
<p>In businesses where efficiencies of scale have a large effect, monopolies can form when leading players consolidate smaller competitors until just one or two companies remain. Standard Oil is the canonical example of this process.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about the on-demand delivery market is that it is both incredibly expensive but isn&#8217;t very technologically difficult to get into, which has meant that many companies have jumped into the sector around the world. This means on-demand delivery is the opposite of other patent-protected markets from which we might expect monopolies to form or competition to be extinguished past the top two players.</p>
<p>Yet, it’s also an industry where economies of scale can play a key role in profit generation, and increased competition can lead to price wars and advertising tussles. It’s a ripe market, then, for consolidation, even if it lacks an exploitable IP base.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.allocations.com/">Allocations</a>, a fintech startup building software to help smaller private equity funds form and operate, announced that it has raised a $4 million round at a $100 million valuation.</p>
<p>The startup also shared a host of performance metrics, including that it reached a $4.6 million revenue run rate in June, and a $6 million bookings run rate in the same month.</p>
<p>Allocations also told TechCrunch that it has posted 28% monthly revenue growth over the last 12 months. With metrics like that, our curiosity was piqued. What is Allocations building that is attracting so much early demand? And how does the company&#8217;s thesis regarding the future of private equity funds intersect with microventure funds themselves?</p>
<h2>What Allocations does</h2>
<p>Born from CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kadvani/">Kingsley Advani&#8217;s</a> efforts in building a community of angel investors, and the issues that he ran into spinning up special purpose vehicles (SPVs), Allocations started off as software built to scratch its founder&#8217;s itch. SPVs are an increasingly common way to raise capital for a single investment from pooled sources, and in today&#8217;s rapid-fire venture capital market, Advani had to race to get capital into deals before they closed.</p>
<p>As with many technology startups, Allocations is software designed to solve a known pain point. The old way of putting together SPVs just didn&#8217;t match the expected pace at which private investors are expected to commit to investing.</p>
<p>Today the startup&#8217;s software helps its users to create new SPVs and funds more quickly, also helping investors manage capital calls and the like after their fund is formed. The startup <a href="https://www.allocations.com/pricing">charges</a> either one-time (in the case of an SPV, by definition a single-shot investment), or recurring fees (multiasset SPVs and funds). A 30-investment fund will cost its managers $15,000 per year through Allocations.</p>
<p>But how many funds are there for the startup to support? Is there enough market to allow Allocations to become a large enterprise itself? So far, the company has attracted some 300 funds to its roster. Advani thinks that there will be plenty of demand. In an interview with TechCrunch, the founder noted that present-day denizens of major funds locked out of material carry &#8212; venture economic upside, more simply &#8212; can peel off and start their own fund, allowing them much better economics. That dynamic could spur demand for his startup&#8217;s services.</p>
<p>Advani also said that family offices and other major capital pools that once fought for allocation into brand-name venture capital funds and other private equity vehicles &#8212; venture capital is a subset of private equity &#8212; are increasingly chasing smaller funds that may post better returns than larger investing partnerships can manage. This is the law of large numbers in reverse; it&#8217;s easier to 10x a $10 million fund than a $10 billion vehicle.</p>
<p>Advani expects his customers will put together multiple funds. Per the CEO, the goal of new fund managers is to get to their second fund. So, new managers often invest their first fund quickly in hope of reaching their second more quickly &#8212; more funds means more fees for Allocations.</p>
<p>In the startup&#8217;s view, the market will see many more small-scale private equity funds in time, perhaps smaller than $10 million in capital. This perspective mirrors what TechCrunch has seen in the market lately, with rolling funds rising to prominence in the early-stage startup investing, and solo GPs putting together what feels like more microfunds than ever.</p>
<p>Allocations fits into the larger trend of fintech startups taking antiquated models in the world of money and making them faster, more modern and often lower cost. Sure, there&#8217;s miles of distance between Allocations and Robinhood, but as both are about smaller investors, democratization of investing access, and using tech to tear down old walls, they are more brethren than different species.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> It&#8217;s a $4 million round, not $5 million. Post has been corrected.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">President Joe Biden is expected to set an ambitious new target for half of all new auto sales in the U.S. to be low- or zero-emission by 2030, a plan that has received tentative support from the Big Three automakers pending what they say will require hefty government support.</p>
<p>General Motors, Ford and Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler) issued a joint statement Thursday that they had “shared aspiration[s]” to achieve a 40% to 50% share of electric in new vehicle sales by the end of the decade, with the caveat that such a target “can be achieved only with the timely deployment of the full suite of electrification policies committed to by the Administration in the Build Back Better Plan.”</p>
<p>Some of the investments they list include consumer incentives, a national EV charging network “of sufficient density,” funding for R&amp;D and manufacturing and supply chain incentives.</p>
<p>Biden’s target, which will come in the form of an executive order on Thursday, will be nonbinding and entirely voluntary. The target includes vehicles powered by batteries, hydrogen fuel cells or plug-in hybrids.</p>
<p>Executives from the three OEMs, as well as representatives from the United Automobile Workers union, are expected to attend an event on the new target at the White House Thursday. Tesla, it seems, was not invited, according to a tweet from CEO Elon Musk.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Yeah, seems odd that Tesla wasn’t invited</p>
<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1423156475799683075?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Biden will also be calling for new fuel economy standards for passenger and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles through model year 2026, which were rolled back under President Trump’s tenure, according to a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-steps-to-drive-american-leadership-forward-on-clean-cars-and-trucks/">White House factsheet</a> released Thursday. The new standards, which will be crafted under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency, should come as no surprise to automakers: They were included in Biden’s so-called “Day One Agenda” and mark a cornerstone of his strategy to combat climate change.</p>
<p>The new standards will likely borrow from those passed by California last year, which were finalized in concert with a coalition of five automakers: BMW AG, Ford, Honda Motor Co., Volkswagen AG, and Volvo AB. Those automakers, in a separate statement Thursday, said they supported the White House’s plan to reduce emissions. However, like the Big Three, they said that “bold action” from the federal government will be needed to achieve emission reductions targets.</p>
<h2>The road to 2030</h2>
<p>While Biden’s nonbinding order is more of a symbolic one, the targets are likely achievable, Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds&#8217; executive director of insights said in a statement. She added that automotive industry leaders “have seen the writing on the wall for some time now” regarding electrification, regardless of who has been in the White House.</p>
<p>Thanks to the relatively long product development lead time, many of the major automakers have already announced multibillion-dollar investments in EVs and AVs at least through the middle of the decade. That includes a $35 billion investment through 2025 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/">from GM</a> and $30 billion through the same year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">from Ford</a> &#8212; not to mention similar announcements <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/auto-giant-stellantis-to-invest-e30b-in-electrification-through-2025/">from Stellantis</a> and many billions earmarked for battery R&amp;D <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/volkswagens-new-business-strategy-puts-software-and-autonomous-driving-front-and-center/">from Volkswagen</a>, and even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/volvo-to-sell-only-all-electric-vehicles-by-2030/">Volvo Cars’ shift</a> to all-electric by 2030.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="F4NafdPaoI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/auto-giant-stellantis-to-invest-e30b-in-electrification-through-2025/">Auto giant Stellantis to invest €30B in electrification through 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Auto giant Stellantis to invest €30B in electrification through 2025&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/auto-giant-stellantis-to-invest-e30b-in-electrification-through-2025/embed/#?secret=F4NafdPaoI" data-secret="F4NafdPaoI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>These massive numbers follow the automakers’ own sales targets, which are for the most part in line with Biden’s goal.</p>
<p>Fuel economy rules, however, have historically garnered slightly more mixed reactions from automakers. GM, Fiat Chrysler (now Stellantis) and Toyota had previously supported a Trump-era lawsuit that sought to strip California’s authority to set its own emissions standards &#8212; but each company eventually made an about-face, leaving the road open for Biden to introduce his own standards this year.</p>
<p>In a very real sense, Biden’s announcement is as much about geopolitics as it is about climate change. He, too, has seen the writing on the wall regarding EVs. His administration notes in the factsheet that “China is increasingly cornering the global supply chain” for EVs and EV battery materials. “By setting clear targets for electric vehicle sale trajectories, these countries are becoming magnets for private investment into their manufacturing sectors &#8212; from parts and materials to final assembly.”</p>
<p>While three times as many EVs were registered in the U.S. in 2020 versus 2016, America still lags behind both Europe and China in terms of EV market share, according to the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2021">International Energy Agency</a>.</p>
<p>The news has garnered a slew of mixed reactions, with some environmental groups urging more decisive action on the part of the administration. Carol Lee Rawn, senior director of transportation at Ceres, said in a statement that future standards should target a 60% reduction in emissions and a “clear trajectory” to 100% vehicle sales by 2035.</p>
<p>Although the UAW will be joining Biden at the White House on Thursday, President Ray Curry said in a statement that the group is “not focused on hard deadlines or percentages, but on preserving the wages and benefits that have been the heart and soul of the American middle class.”</p>

<p>I needed them all to get Preflight off the ground.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The many paths to the U.S. (and launching a startup)</h2>
<p>I had my first shot at making my longtime dream a reality when I was applying to college as an undergraduate. I figured if I could go to school in the United States, I could find a way to stay and start a business.</p>
<p>After doing some research, though, I realized that U.S. colleges were too expensive.</p>
<p>But I figured getting out of Turkey, my home country, would be a start. I looked around for affordable schools and saw that France had good options. So I went to France.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even after three attempts, I wasn’t able to get a student visa. So I headed back to Turkey and went to college there. After graduation, I knew I had a second shot at the U.S.: a master’s degree. I applied to computer science programs and got accepted &#8212; a huge win!</p>
<p>I first arrived in Georgia, where I got my TOEFL certification, then enrolled at Tennessee State University, where I got a teaching assistantship.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, to do all this, I had to have the right visas. I needed a student visa for my master’s degree, but if I wanted to work after graduation, I’d need a work visa.</p>
<p>The thing is, though, I didn’t want to work at a “job.” I wanted to start my own business, which requires a different type of visa altogether.</p>
<p>Oh, and there was another factor at play: I was enrolled at Tennessee State from 2014 to 2016, during the lead-up to the election of Donald Trump. So in addition to trying to figure out which visa I could reasonably get, I had to deal with the fact that the rules for visas could all change in the coming months.</p>
<p>These experiences are similar to what many founders deal with every day in the process of launching and running a business.</p>
<p>We don’t know if our products will work or if they’ll find a market. We don’t know how changing regulations might affect what we’re doing. We have no idea when something like a pandemic will pull the rug out from everything we’ve built.</p>
<p>But we keep going anyway. In my experience, the most successful founders are the ones who don’t wait for all the pieces to fall into place — they know that will never happen. They’re the ones who do the best they can with what they have. They trust that they’ll be able to adapt and adjust when things inevitably change.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my next lesson.</p>
<h2>Resilience: Hearing &#8220;no&#8221; as &#8220;not yet&#8221;</h2>
<p>Hearing “no” isn’t fun, especially when that “no” is about something you’ve wanted for more than a decade.</p>
<p>I experienced a lot of “no”s in my immigration journey, as one visa attempt after another failed. If I’d let any one of those failures stop me, I wouldn&#8217;t be where I am today — working at my own startup in the U.S.</p>
<p>The lesson I learned was to hear “no” as “not yet.” It’s been invaluable to me in my journey to becoming a founder.</p>
<p>For example: In 2014, while I was in graduate school, I learned about Y Combinator and decided that I wanted to be a part of it. Throughout grad school, I applied and got rejected three times.</p>
<p>The clock was ticking on my student visa, so I decided to shift my tactics. I applied to jobs at companies that were Y Combinator graduates to see what I could learn.</p>
<p>In 2016, I got hired at ShipBob, a Chicago-based company that was in <a href="https://www.ycdb.co/batch/s14">Y Combinator’s Summer 2014 batch</a>. I joined the team as its first full-time developer and the first one based in the States. From there, things changed dramatically.</p>
<p>For starters, I learned a lot. In my time with ShipBob — just two and a half years — we grew from 10 people to more than 400. I built two apps and applied to Y Combinator twice more and got rejected both times.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9kaAXYJ8Wr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/4-lessons-i-learned-about-getting-into-y-combinator-after-13-applications/">4 lessons I learned about getting into Y Combinator (after 13 applications)</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 lessons I learned about getting into Y Combinator (after 13 applications)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/4-lessons-i-learned-about-getting-into-y-combinator-after-13-applications/embed/#?secret=9kaAXYJ8Wr" data-secret="9kaAXYJ8Wr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But in my work growing and leading a team of developers, I saw a need for a product that didn’t yet exist: a smart, fast, no-code test automation tool.</p>
<p>My team was spending way too much time building tests for ShipBob’s latest updates to make sure existing functionalities worked when we deployed. But when the code changed too quickly, our tests were outdated. It was incredibly frustrating.</p>
<p>Then we hired two quality assurance engineers and it took them four months to get 10% automated test coverage.</p>
<p>These problems led me to an aha moment: I could build a company to address this. A tool that is fast in test creation and can adapt to the UI changes.</p>
<p>That company is Preflight, and it’s the one that finally got me admitted to Y Combinator in the Winter 2019 batch. I was ecstatic when I heard that we’d been accepted. But then I realized that I couldn’t actually work on Preflight full time with my current visa status — at least, if I wanted to one day make a salary, I couldn’t.</p>
<p>And that brings me to my next point.</p>
<h2>Maintaining a positive mental attitude as you face (many) challenges</h2>
<p>My professional life wasn’t the only thing that changed dramatically while I was at ShipBob. My immigration status also evolved.</p>
<p>ShipBob applied for and got me an H-1B visa, which made me eligible to work in the U.S.</p>
<p>But when I got accepted to Y Combinator on my sixth application, I knew I needed an alternative: If I left ShipBob to run Preflight, I would lose my H-1B and my ability to work in the U.S.</p>
<p>This kind of conundrum is all too familiar to most startup founders: There’s no new opportunity without a new challenge to accompany it.</p>
<p>So I did what any founder would do: I focused on the positive (I’d gotten into YC!) and dedicated myself to figuring out a different way to stay in the country.</p>
<p>First, I tried to apply for the EB-1 visa, but the required documentation was too burdensome. I don’t think any founder could prepare for that application without several months of preparation.</p>
<p>Then I tried the O-1. No luck.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IdtsDs5eGy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/dear-sophie-can-i-transfer-my-h-1b-to-a-startup-i-founded/">Dear Sophie: Can I transfer my H-1B to a startup I founded?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Dear Sophie: Can I transfer my H-1B to a startup I founded?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/dear-sophie-can-i-transfer-my-h-1b-to-a-startup-i-founded/embed/#?secret=IdtsDs5eGy" data-secret="IdtsDs5eGy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So I asked ShipBob if I could take an unpaid sabbatical, which would let me keep my H-1B status while I attended Y Combinator and worked on Preflight. They agreed. My brothers, who had both moved to Chicago and started working at ShipBob (you’re welcome, guys!) agreed to support me (thanks, guys!).</p>
<p>Finally, I had a solution that worked — but only for the time being. If Preflight was successful, I’d have to find a different way to stay in the country.</p>
<p>Transferring my H-1B to Preflight wouldn’t work, in part because it would require me to yield 70% to 80% ownership to my co-founder and agree that he could fire me at any time.</p>
<p>But there was another option I’d been reluctant to lean on: asylee status. In 2016, there was an attempted coup in Turkey (that’s the official story, anyway). I won’t get into the political details, but my family and I were supporters of the movement blamed for the attempt. As a result, we were at risk of imprisonment if we stayed in Turkey — and eligible for asylum status in the U.S.</p>
<p>I applied, but hoped that I’d land a work visa in the meantime, partly because asylum status can take years to get approved and partly because there was no telling whether the current administration would change the rules to make me ineligible before my status came through.</p>
<p>When I got accepted to Y Combinator, my asylum status was pending. When my initial sabbatical from ShipBob ran out, it was still pending. I asked for an extension and got it (thanks, ShipBob!). A few months later, I figured I could not get the visa sorted. I wanted to focus on my business and use asylum-pending status, which would give me work authorization for two years. I was therefore able to work on and take a salary from Preflight.</p>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>My asylum was granted early this year, four years after applying. Getting asylee status was a big win because it meant I could realize my dream of running a business in the U.S. So I was, in some ways, at the resolution of my immigration journey — but I was just at the beginning of my journey as a founder.</p>
<p>Right away, I had my first experience applying all the lessons I’d learned in the last six years: We wanted to raise our first funding round. That funding would let me start taking a salary.</p>
<p>All told, we approached more than 100 VCs before we got a yes. But we did get that yes, and we raised a seed round of $1.2 million in September 2019.</p>
<p>It was a big win for Preflight, but it didn’t have the transformational power for the company I’d hoped for. That’s because, after closing our round, we didn’t focus on sales and marketing to the extent that we should have.</p>
<p>After several months of frustrating results, I consulted with my advisers about how to proceed. They offered me insight that seemed obvious once I had it — but that I may not have gotten on my own &#8212; which was discussing everything that’s happening internally with the investors. And the outcome was me being the CEO.</p>
<p>In the month and a half after I adjusted course based on my vision, I grew Preflight’s revenue 600% in just about two months.</p>
<h2>The only constant is change</h2>
<p>The whole startup ethos of disrupting what’s not working to improve people’s lives is based on the premise that the world is constantly changing. The global disruption caused by COVID-19 underscored that in a major way.</p>
<p>Founders who accept that change is inevitable and who embrace uncertainty, develop resilience for when things go wrong, and maintain a positive mental attitude about the ups and (especially) the downs of running a startup will be the ones who succeed for the long haul.</p>
<p>I’ve known since I was 10 that I wanted to run a company in the United States. Given the choice, I would have opted for a much smoother road to entrepreneurship. But what I’ve discovered is that the difficult immigration path I had to follow provided exactly the training I needed to succeed in the challenging role of a founder.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drones are neat and fun and all that good stuff (I should probably add the caveat here that I’m obviously not referring to the big, terrible military variety), but when it comes to quadcopters, there’s always been the looming question of general usefulness. The consumer-facing variety are pretty much the exclusive realm of hobbyists and imaging.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a number of interesting applications for things like agricultural surveillance, real estate and the like, all of which are effectively extensions of that imaging capability. But a lot can be done with a camera and the right processing. One of the more interesting applications I’ve seen cropping up here and there is the warehouse drone — something perhaps a bit counterintuitive, as you likely (and understandably) associate drones with the outdoors.</p>
<p>Looking back, it seems we’ve actually had two separate warehouse drone companies compete in Disrupt Battlefield. There was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/12/intelligent-flying-machines/">IFM (Intelligent Flying Machines)</a> in 2016 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/vtrus-launches-drones-to-inspect-and-protect-your-warehouses-and-factories/">Vtrus two years later</a>. That’s really the tip of the iceberg for a big list of startups effectively pushing to bring drones to warehouses and factory floors.</p>
<p>The list now also includes <a href="https://www.corvus-robotics.com/">Corvus Robotics</a>, a YC-backed startup presumably named for the genus of birds that includes surprisingly intelligent species like crows and ravens (though, presumably, these ones don’t also travel together in murders). The company calls its offering &#8220;the world&#8217;s first unmanned warehouse inventory drones,” which is potentially disputable.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9SzI27FyhQY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=1&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>But the offering is interesting, nonetheless, effectively flying around to scan pallets for inventory purposes. According to a piece from <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/drone-warehouse-corvus-robotics">IEEE Spectrum</a>, the level-four autonomous drone network is capable of scanning 200 to 400 pallets an hour, including the downtime spent recharging (flying is hard work).</p>

<p>Speaking of that industry holy grail of full warehouse automation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/third-wave-automation-raises-40m-to-bring-its-autonomous-forklifts-to-warehouses/">Third Wave Automation just announced</a> a $40 million Series B, led by Norwest Venture Partners and featuring Innovation Endeavors, Eclipse and Toyota Ventures.

<p>Fellow warehouse automator inVia Robotics, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210728005353/en/Microsoft%E2%80%99s-M12-and-Qualcomm-Ventures-%E2%80%93-Joined-by-Hitachi-Ventures-%E2%80%93-Co-Lead-Series-C-Round-for-Award-Winning-Robotics-Company-inVia-Robotics">announced a $30 million Series C</a> at the tail end of last month. Tech giants Microsoft (M12) and Qualcomm (Qualcomm Ventures LLC) led the round, which brings the California firm’s total funding up to $59 million to date. Hitachi Ventures also joined for the round.

<p>And just because we couldn’t do all warehouse news this week (as tempting and easy as that might be), here’s a robot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37OpI8dHTGU">from General Electric named ATVer</a>. The sundry tech conglomerate has been field testing the autonomous &#8216;bot with the U.S. Army. Military funding, mind, continues to be a pretty massive driver in robotics, for better and worse.</p>
<p>“Our project and partnership with the US Army has really enabled us to make some important advances in autonomous systems,” GE’s senior robotics Shiraj Sen says in a release. “We believe the advances made on this project will not only help accelerate the deployment of future driver-less vehicle technologies; they will help encourage more autonomous solutions in other industry sectors like energy, aviation and healthcare that people depend on every day.”</p>

<p>In just under the wire, Sarcos this morning announced a partnership with T-Mobile that will bring 5G teleoperation to the company&#8217;s  Guardian XT robot. Robotics are, of course, one of those things that frequently get tossed around when discussing the potential benefits of 5G&#8217;s low-latency connection. Honestly, it&#8217;s the sort of thing that gets rolled out on stage during press events (<em>cough</em> Verizon), because robots are surefire crowd pleasers. So, it&#8217;s nice seeing it applied to some actual systems here.</p>
<p>From the release,</p>
<blockquote><p>The T-Mobile and <span class="il">Sarcos</span> collaboration begins with the integration of 5G to develop a remote viewing system powered by T-Mobile’s high bandwidth, low latency 5G network. This enables workers, supervisors, outside experts, and others, whether they are based locally or remote, to watch tasks being performed by the robot as it is controlled by an operator in the field. The second phase of development is expected to include full T-Mobile 5G wireless network integration, allowing teleoperation of the Guardian XT robot over 5G, giving operators greater flexibility and increasing their safety by enabling them to perform tasks from a distance.</p></blockquote>

<p>No matter where you and your business fall on the startup spectrum, you’ll find plenty of information, inspiration and opportunity at Disrupt 2021. Here’s why three of your contemporaries think going to Disrupt is an essential part of the startup experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>I love Disrupt because it features incredible companies. My work exposes me to lots of companies all over the world but, inevitably, I run across startups at Disrupt I haven&#8217;t heard of yet. It&#8217;s always fascinating to explore opportunities and find ways to work together. — Rachael Wilcox, creative producer, Volvo Cars.</p>
<p>When you’re building a startup, you’re in the weeds. It&#8217;s hard to get a 30,000-foot view, see where your company is and where it can go. Going to Disrupt and seeing what other startups are doing gives you that important perspective. It’s a huge benefit. — Jessica McLean, director of Marketing and Communications, Infinite-Compute.</p>
<p>As a cross-border VC fund manager, I’m always looking to identify new tech trends and how we can bring them to Latin America. Disrupt provides terrific insight on trends in different industries like e-grocery, AI and big data. — Daniel Lloreda, general partner at H20 Capital Innovation.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Disrupt experience also includes watching the world-renowned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/">Startup Battlefield</a> pitch competition. A field of 20 off-the-hook startups will take the stage and vie for $100,000 in equity-free prize money. Plenty of household tech names — like Vurb, Yammer, Dropbox and Mint — launched their company during Startup Battlefield. Watch the future giants of tech launch here.</p>
