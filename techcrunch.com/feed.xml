										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://www.y42.com/">low-code data platform Y42</a> today announced that it has raised a $31 million Series A funding round co-led by Atomico and Insight Partners. La Famiglia, which led the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/no-code-business-intelligence-tool-y42-raises-2-9m-seed-round/">seed round</a>, and Data Community Fund also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to date to just under $34 million.</p>
<p>Y42 wants to provide its users with an end-to-end data platform that can replace the various tools they are using today to integrate, transform, orchestrate and visualize their data. And yes, that means it wants to be able to give its users a single tool that can, for the most part, replace existing services like Fivetran, Airbyte, dbt and Tableau.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223016" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223016" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223016" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="591" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg 1459w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg?resize=768,443 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg?resize=680,392 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2223016" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Y42</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223013" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;It is a very crowded market,&#8221; Y42 under and CEO Hung Dang said. &#8220;But this is why the way we&#8217;re trying to approach this is by having a very different hypothesis than most point-to-point tools out there. [&#8230;] I come into this game with the mindset that I don&#8217;t care how long it takes me to build this product, but if I have a clean slate, how would I build this product? We are taking all the best practices of the modern data stack of these point-to-point tools, but apply them to one consistent platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>This means Y42 wants to give business intelligence teams and data analysts a single tool that helps them bridge the gap between doing some basic data analysis and hiring multiple full-time data engineers who can maintain a modern data stack. That&#8217;s an area where the company is winning a lot of new customers, but it also means that Y42 has to be able to scale with those users as they build up their data practices, something Dang is optimistic the company can do (especially given some of the features it has on its roadmap for next year).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223014" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132616.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223014" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223014" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132616.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="586" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132616.jpg 1451w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132616.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132616.jpg?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132616.jpg?resize=768,440 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132616.jpg?resize=680,389 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132616.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2223014" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Y42</p></div></p>
<p>“Every business leader today knows they need to extract more value from their data, but the data talent to adopt and maintain a modern stack is scarce; demand for data engineers is growing 50% annually. Y42 unlocks this bottleneck and democratizes access to data tools beyond a select few. In that, they are creating a new category.” said Atomico partner Irina Haivas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dang also noted that a number of bigger players in the industry, including the likes of Snowflake, are very interested in partnering with Y42. That&#8217;s in part because the service functions a bit like a gatekeeper for new customers who may not even yet have a data warehouse in use. Since Y42 itself sits on top of Google Cloud, BigQuery was always a natural recommendation for these customers, but it&#8217;s obviously not the only one.</p>
<p>The company currently has about 70 employees, up from 25 in March. Its customers include the likes of <a href="https://www.lifemd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.lifemd.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616452120912000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGF1J01xU9lwGPsAn0hLL6Cn0QYg">LifeMD</a>, <a href="https://thepetlabco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thepetlabco.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616452120912000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEDUzlxtUx7seE8InbBS4ZyKEtOFw">Petlab</a> and <a href="https://www.everdrop.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.everdrop.de/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616452120912000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGHLzJlfl3V1yIw8lWpDtwEF7ZeVw">Everdrop</a>. Unsurprisingly, Y42 plans to use the new funding to accelerate the development of its platform, scale its team and expand its go-to-market efforts. Y42 has already started building out a US-based team, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After already targeting verticals like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/19/amazon-launches-an-alexa-system-for-hotels/">hotels</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/amazon-launches-an-alexa-service-for-property-managers/">apartment complexes</a>, Amazon <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-brings-alexa-senior-living-communities-and-healthcare">announced</a> today it&#8217;s now rolling out new solutions for healthcare providers and senior living centers. The solutions, which are a part of Alexa Smart Properties, are designed specifically to meet the needs of deploying Alexa devices at scale and will allow the facility&#8217;s administrators to create customized experiences for their residents or patients.</p>
<p>In senior living centers, the residents would be able to use Alexa devices to call their family members and other loved ones, as well as keep up with the goings-on at their community and other community news. The devices could also be used to make announcements, allow the residents to communicate with each other through direct audio messages, make voice and video calls, and they can streamline other center activities &#8212; like check-ins, maintenance requests, and various administrative tasks. Amazon believes this could help make facilities more efficient and productive.</p>
<p>Amazon says senior living communities include Atria and Eskaton will integrate with its new solution.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223267" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The market for using Alexa in senior living communities was already being explored by third-party providers, like K4Connect, which last year<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/k4connect-a-startup-bringing-tech-to-senior-living-centers-closes-its-21m-series-b/"> closed on $21 million in Series B</a> funding to bring newer technologies, including Alexa&#8217;s voice assistance, to older adults and those living with disabilities. Companies like K4Connect and others, including Lifeline Senior Living, Aiva, and Vocera, can now tap into Alexa Smart Properties&#8217; tools and APIs to make it easier for them to roll out their own, customized solutions and software.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223278" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223278" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2223278" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg 2550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223278" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amazon had already piloted putting Alexa in patient rooms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/25/cedars-sinai-puts-amazon-alexa-in-patient-rooms-as-part-of-a-pilot-program/">in a test with Cedars-Sinai,</a> which allowed patients to use voice commands for performing basic tasks, like changing TV channels, as well as communicating with caregivers. The idea was that, by offloading some of the everyday tasks to Alexa, it could free up nurses to focus more on medical care.</p>
<p>With Amazon&#8217;s new solution for hospitals, patients will be able to use Alexa to communicate with care staff, control the devices in their room, and stay entertained with news and music. Healthcare providers can also communicate with their patients using Alexa features like calling and Drop-In, without having to enter the patient rooms. This could also help hospitals be more productive and conserve their medical supplies and protective equipment like gloves, masks, and gowns, notes Amazon. (PPE shortages had been an ongoing issue in some locations as Covid spiked during the pandemic.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cedars-Sinai is among those officially rolling out the Alexa Smart Properties solution, following its pilot program, and is joined by BayCare and Houston Methodist, Amazon says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Voice is intuitive for patients, regardless of age or tech-savviness,&#8221; said Peachy Hain, executive director of Medical and Surgical Services at Cedars-Sinai, in a statement. &#8220;Since it&#8217;s so easy to operate, patients can use Alexa to connect with their care team and stay entertained as soon as they settle in, while care providers can streamline tasks to make more time to care for those patients. It&#8217;s a total gamechanger for enhancing our hospital experience,&#8221; Hain added.</p>
<p>Though Amazon has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/amazon-responds-to-a-u-s-senators-inquiry-confirms-alexa-voice-records-are-kept-indefinitely/">struggled</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/alexa-user-gets-access-to-1700-audio-files-from-a-stranger/">with</a> privacy issues related to its use of voice recordings and transcriptions, the healthcare and senior living center solutions will not save the voice recordings and don&#8217;t require users to share personal info with Alexa to use the device, the company explains. Users can also mute the Echo&#8217;s microphone at any time with the button on top. Amazon also claims it safeguards protected health information received through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/amazon-alexa-launches-its-first-hipaa-compliant-medical-skills/">HIPAA-eligible Alexa skill</a> interactions.</p>
<p>Amazon has been working to bring Alexa to healthcare facilities for some time. A report <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/10/amazon-is-building-a-health-and-wellness-team-within-alexa.html">in 2018 by CNBC</a> had said the company was building out a healthcare team with Alexa in order to make the voice assistant useful in the industry. This included working through the complex HIPAA regulations that would be required to do so. The following year, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/amazon-alexa-launches-its-first-hipaa-compliant-medical-skills/">announced</a> its first HIPAA-compliant medical skills and began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/25/cedars-sinai-puts-amazon-alexa-in-patient-rooms-as-part-of-a-pilot-program/">piloting</a> its devices in hospitals. Elsewhere across Amazon, the company has invested in healthcare solutions in other ways, including through solutions like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Comprehend Medical</a>, a machine learning tool that gathers information from things like doctors’ notes and patient health records, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/amazons-2018-acquisitions-totaled-1-65b-led-by-pillpack-and-ring/">acquisitions</a> like online pharmacy PillPack.</p>
<p>Both of the new Alexa Smart Properties solutions will roll out in the U.S. starting next month, Amazon says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Make way for yet another &#8216;quick-commerce&#8217; player in Europe&#8217;s heavily heating on-demand grocery space: <a href="https://popmarket.gr/?lang=en">Pop Market</a> is a Greek startup which launched last week in Athens &#8212; taking orders via and app and touting 15min delivery times and a curated selection of &#8220;thousands&#8221; of items (including fresh fruit and vegetables).</p>
<p>The seed round, which Pop Market claims is the country&#8217;s largest seed raise to date, was led by Global Founders Capital and 468 Capital.</p>
<p>TechCrunch can confirm the startup has raised $3.5 million in seed financing to push its vertically integrated, dark store-based on-demand grocery model in a country where it says online grocery shopping remains largely untapped.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223234" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Pop Market cites data indicating that grocery retail in Greece was valued at €11.3BN in 2020 &#8212; yet points to <a href="https://convertgroup.com/insight/greek-egrocery-2020/">analyst estimates</a> suggesting less than 2% (approximately €163.3M) is currently online, which it suggests reflects a &#8220;huge gap&#8221; between customer expectations and what existing solutions in the market offer, as a result of poor customer experience (such as long delivery times, high prices and wrong or missing items).</p>
<p>Squeezing that gap by delivering a slicker grocery service to Greeks &#8212; fulfilled through its own network of city center dark stores &#8212; is Pop Market&#8217;s first focus. Although it also claims it has international ambitions. (Albeit, it will be going up against a large number of very well resourced competitors elsewhere in Europe &#8212; depending on where it might seek to expand.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On-demand delivery app Glovo is spinning up a B2B logistics unit for super speedy urban delivery&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/on-demand-delivery-app-glovo-is-spinning-up-a-b2b-logistics-unit-for-super-speedy-urban-delivery/embed/#?secret=rMbey3Mpc8" data-secret="rMbey3Mpc8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Even on home soil Pop Market has Delivery Hero-owned efood to contend with (and Delivery Hero is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/">an investor in Berlin-based dark store operator Gorillas</a>). <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/wolt-closes-530m-round-to-continue-expanding-beyond-restaurant-delivery/">Finland&#8217;s Wolt</a> is also active in the market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The biggest players in this market today are efood and Wolt. While both offer groceries, mostly through partnerships with traditional chains, the reality is that their roots are deep in the restaurant food delivery industry which largely affects how customers perceive them today,&#8221; suggests Pop Market co-founder Nick Telecki.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes Pop special is that we are 100% focused on offering the fastest delivery of grocery, convenience and retail products. Being the only fully-dedicated &#8216;Quick-Commerce&#8217; platform in the market is the only way to truly offer an unparalleled customer experience and capture consumer mindshare. Just look at Germany as an example, where Gorillas and Flink have grown tremendously in such a short amount of time, despite the presence of giants like Takeaway (Lieferando) and Wolt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Telecki argues that for on-demand groceries Greece is underserved vs &#8220;heated battlegrounds&#8221; in Western Europe, adding that its first focus will therefore be on its home market.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that online grocery penetration is only 2% presents a massive opportunity for us,&#8221; adds founder &amp; CEO Takis Malavetas. &#8220;If you look Greece holistically, the delivery market is much more mature compared to many other countries in Europe. When it comes to groceries specifically, there continues to be big gap between customer expectations and what existing solutions in the market offer, often including long delivery times, high prices and wrong or missing items. That makes groceries the last but largest piece of the retail puzzle that has yet to transition online.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having said that, the industry&#8217;s growth in the last few years has still been phenomenal with the first six months of 2021 up 150% compared to the year before. The biggest change we&#8217;ve been seeing in this online shift is that customers are breaking away from the planned weekly trip to the supermarket and are looking for more-frequent, yet smaller purchases. Those are habits that continue to be underserved in the market and our focus is to cover those daily occasional needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pop Market&#8217;s co-founders have prior experience in on-demand grocery delivery, with<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Malavetas having previously been involved in </span>setting up Home Run and Convibo in the UK, while Telecki was a member member of Delivery Hero&#8217;s global strategy team until recently.</p>
<p>If the pair can scale a domestic business fast enough they may see a chance to exit to a larger giant like Telecki&#8217;s former employer. But asked about this the startup kept its cards close to its chest, saying only: &#8220;We’ll evaluate any opportunities as they come, but our ultimate goal is on building a strong consumer business with best-in-class retention.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the seed funding will be used to spin up Pop Market&#8217;s domestic sprint, with a plan for rapid expansion across Greece &#8212; building out its nascent network of dark stores, scaling the supply chain and growing the team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It seems like every website has a chatbot of some kind to help answer simple questions without having to wait for a customer service representative. However, sometimes in the course of connecting it may take awhile, and as your attention shifts to something else, your time expires and you have to start all over again.</p>
<p><a href="https://atomchat.io/en/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AtomChat</a> is developing conversational artificial intelligence software focused on improving sales team performance by converting more via asynchronous messaging in WhatsApp. To accelerate its product development and international expansion plans, it secured $3.15 million in seed funding led by Mucker Capital, with participation from Techstars.</p>
<p>Erick Holmann and Rene Mouynes started the Panama City, Panama-based company in 2019 after working together for more than 15 years automating credit initiation processes for Citi and sales processes for telecommunications companies in Latin America.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222533" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2222539" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222539" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2222539" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AtomMsgs.png?w=680" alt="AtomChat" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AtomMsgs.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AtomMsgs.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AtomMsgs.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AtomMsgs.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AtomMsgs.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AtomMsgs.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AtomMsgs.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AtomMsgs.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AtomMsgs.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AtomMsgs.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222539" class="wp-caption-text">AtomChat messages. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> AtomChat</p></div></p>
<p>AtomChat is their third startup, and their previous outbound sales company was the inspiration, Holmann told TechCrunch. Today, a majority of people in Latin America skip shopping on the web and instead use a combination of apps like WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, where 3.5 billion monthly users send 20 billion messages each month, he added.</p>
<p>“We saw conversational commerce with messaging was going to be to sales what browsers were to the internet in the 1990s,” he added. “If you have a question about a car, you engage with the dealer via messaging. Automation is what everyone wants, but needs to be more focused on customer services and the big gap is on the human side. Customers want more one-on-one time and assisted buying.”</p>
<p>The company enables its customers to connect ongoing conversations that take place over days, weeks or months so that any customer service representative has the history versus having to start over each time. Some of its customers were able to triple sales in a span of two months after implementing AtomChat, Holmann said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Andres Barreto, managing director of Techstars Boulder, met the company when they were part of the accelerator program last year and decided to back them.</p>
<p>While tools available were created by companies from the United States thinking in terms of U.S. consumers, Latin America, instead, is one of those regions where e-commerce skipped the web and went right to messaging apps, he said.</p>
<p>“Erick and Rene understand the world outside the U.S. is changing and it is leapfrogging technologies that just don&#8217;t work in Latin America,” Barreto added. “There is now a vast majority of spending through messaging and super apps catching on which is a huge opportunity for them.”</p>
<p>The infusion of new capital will be deployed into technology development as the company continues to grow 15% in revenue month over month.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, AtomChat has racked up an enterprise customer list across 14 countries that includes Toyota, Hyundai, Ford, GNC and Avis. For example, it saw over 15 million customers engage with messaging and 140 million messages sent through the platform.</p>
<p>“We are just getting started,” Holmann. “We aren’t trying to reinvent the wheel for sales teams, but enable them to handle conversations in an efficient manner.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The reaction among TechCrunch staff was swift and, best I can tell, universal. I don’t recall the last time I saw so many colleagues legitimately excited for one specific new feature. MagSafe is back. Not the iPhone version (not to say that isn’t without its own charm) &#8212; the original. The laptop version. The version that Apple unceremoniously abandoned in 2017, with the arrival of the all-USB-C/Thunderbolt MacBook.</p>
<p>This is, I fully recognize, a strange place to begin a lengthy review of a new Pro-focused laptop. MagSafe is hardly the most important arrival on the 2021 MacBook Pro. That distinction almost certainly belongs to the new M1 Pro and Max chips. But the proprietary connector is an important microcosm. It’s a crowd-pleaser for longtime devotees who have stuck with the line through port feast and port famine.</p>
<p>The new model isn’t a kitchen-sink laptop &#8212; Apple doesn’t really do kitchen-sink devices. But, in addition to the new features, it finds the company returning some old favorites that many in the community no doubt feared were long gone. As the MacBook has evolved, features have come and gone. “Courage,” as the company infamously phrased it, when it dropped the headphone jack, back in 2016. That’s one of many instances where Apple was clearly ahead of the curve. But that’s the thing about courage. It doesn’t always wind up the way you’d expect.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222780" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2222861" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222861" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2222861" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222861" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>We as the consumers both demand change while complaining about it. We’re tough to please. Sometimes, as in the case of the headphone jack and the disk drive before it, mainstream consumer use catches up, and for many, the features are hardly missed. Other times, the manufacturer was hasty. The move from USB-A to USB-C was clearly a sign of inevitable progress. But losing MagSafe hurt.</p>
<p>The connector is, happily, back &#8212; in improved form. It’s joined by an SD card slot (support for <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">SD 4.0 standard, UHS-I and UHS-II SDXC cards)</span>, HDMI port and a row of function keys (replacing the beleaguered Touch Bar), which are all but gone from the current Mac lineup (with last year’s 13-inch MacBook Pro serving as the final holdout).There are three USB-C ports on-board &#8212; down from four on 13-inch. One never wants to lose any ports, but many will no doubt view the return of HDMI and MagSafe as a fair tradeoff. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Apple has made a concerted effort to recapture the creative pros who, for years, have been fundamental to its computer lineup. And in many ways, the new Pro models represent the purest manifestation of that. They’re powerful, hulking machines that look to the future of the Mac, while bringing back some hits from the past.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With a year of hindsight, it seems entirely plausible that last year’s 13-inch MacBook Pro will go down as a kind of curiosity, like the 2016 MacBook before it. The device is sticking around in the lineup for the time being, as a 13-inch sibling to the newly announced 14- and 16-inch models. It’s a strange fit. The truth of it is that the 13-inch MacBook has more common DNA with the Air it was introduced alongside &#8212; a MacBook Pro Lite or MacBook Air+, perhaps. It was clear then that the distinction wasn’t as pronounced as we’ve come to expect between the two models, and the arrival of this year’s Pro models have only served to highlight the gulf.</p>
<p>The heart of the product is, of course, Apple’s latest silicon. We expected a new chip in the lead up to this month’s Unleashed event, but Apple managed to surprise us by dropping two, the M1 Pro and M1 Max. Both are effectively souped-up versions of the M1 (built on the same 5nm architecture), and for most users in most scenarios, the differences between the two variants will be negligible. Heck, for most users in most scenarios, the regular old M1 will get the job done. But the core demo that Apple is going after here isn’t most users. It’s the creator class, the people who regularly push their systems to the limit with 3D rendering, 8K video editing and other activities that might have seemed a near impossibility on a laptop a decade back.</p>

<ul>
<li>M1: 16 billion transistors, 8 CPU cores, 7/8 GPU cores, 68.25 GBps memory bandwidth, 16GB max memory</li>
<li>M1 Pro: 33.7 billion transistors, 8/10CPU cores, 14/16 GPU cores, 200 GBps memory bandwidth, 32GB max memory</li>

</ul>
<p>After Apple unveiled the Pro and Max, the immediate question was how the company would divvy up the two chips. Ultimately, I think the company did the right thing here, offering the Max as an upgrade for both systems, at $200. These things add up fast, of course, but welcome to the Apple.com shopping cart. The company sent along the M1 Max with a 10-core PU and 32-core GPU, 64GB of RAM and 2TB of storage.</p>

<p>Memory options range from 16 to 64GB (the latter of which can only be had with the Max) and 512GB all the way up to 8TB. This system is $4,100 as configured. Bump it up to 8TB of storage and you get all the way up to $5,899 (if you go for the 16-inch, meanwhile, you can move the needle over $6,000). That’s a $3,900 premium over the $1,999 entry price.</p>

<p>The benchmark gains bear out the leap in specs. GeekBench’s single-core test for Apple Silicon didn’t see a massive gain, from 1711 on the 2020 MacBook Pro to 1781, but the multi-core score saw an impressive jump from 7549 to 12674.</p>

<p>The GFXBench Metal graphics test, meanwhile, shows off the new GPU, jumping from 3490 frames (at 54.3 fps) to 7717.5 in the Aztec demo, and from 4981 frames (77.4 fps) to 17981 (279.6 fps) in the offscreen version. The system still lags some Nvidia GPUs in the former, but impressively outperforms others in the latter. What may be most remarkable among these numbers is the fact that Apple is capable of seeing big performance numbers with significantly less power consumption than much of the competition.</p>

<p>The notion that the system doesn’t get hot is overstated &#8212; the bottom of the aluminum case gets toasty, but what is true is that you’re going to have to really push this system to get those fans to kick in. The battery life is beefy on this thing well. I was able to squeeze out 17:29 hours of Apple TV+ playback on a charge (the new Velvet Underground documentary is good. I know because I watched it A LOT). The reintroduction of MagSafe, meanwhile, brings fast charging, getting the system from zero to 50% battery in half an hour (with the 96 or 140W power adapter). The system can still be charged via one of the three USB-C ports (great for those times when you inevitably leave the proprietary plug at home), albeit not as quickly, topping out at 100W.</p>
<p>The MagSafe plug comes with a nice new braided cable, but otherwise looks and functions remarkably similarly to the quick detaching plug we all know and mostly love.</p>
<p>The MacBook also gets a design change to match its new internals. The 16-inch, for instance is thicker and heavier than its predecessor, bumping from 4.3 to 4.7 pounds and increasing from 0.64 to 0.66 inches thick. The 14-inch, meanwhile, weighs 3.5 pounds compared to the 13-inch’s three, while maintaining the same thickness as its smaller sibling.</p>
<p>As someone who’s been carrying around the 2020 Air (on those occasions I actually leave my apartment), that’s not an insignificant difference. While my wild speculation questions the future of the 13-inch MacBook (at least in its current form), it’s hard to imagine the thinner, lighter Air going anywhere.</p>

<p>The 14.2-inch display is big and bright, at 3024 x 1964. That comes in at 254 ppi to the 13-inch’s 227. Last year’s 500 nit brightness has increased to 1,000 nits sustained and up 1,600 peak brightness. That comes courtesy of a mini-LED array, with a 120Hz refresh rate (which adapts to suit the task, courtesy of ProMotion technology). The underlying tech is similar to what we saw on the most recent iPad Pro &#8212; and to date, a handful of laptops.</p>

<p>Thankfully, in this era of remote work, the FaceTime camera gets an upgrade, following in the footsteps of this year’s new iMac with a 1080p camera. That’s a nice upgrade from the 720p models we got on last year’s Pro and Air, which largely relied on computational photography and improvements from the M1 to improve things like white balance and reduce image noise. As you can see above, it’s a pretty dramatic improvement over the camera on the most recent Air.</p>

<p>The bezels have been decreased by 24% over previous models. It’s not quite an edge-to-edge display, but it’s getting there. Along with that change came, perhaps, the most controversial addition, the dreaded notch. For a spirited assessment of the notch, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-notched-the-new-macbook-pro/">read Devin’s piece</a>. I’m mostly notch-agnostic, which is to say, obviously full screen would be best, but I also understand why they’re a thing. It’s something Apple has maintained on the iPhone since the introduction of the iPhone X four years ago.</p>
<p>As the company noted at the event the other week, &#8220;it&#8217;s a really smart way to give you more space for your content, and when you&#8217;re in full-screen mode, you have that 16:10 window, and it looks great. It&#8217;s seamless.&#8221; I will say for certain that&#8217;s going to take some getting used to.</p>
<p>Other mobile companies have moved toward pinholes and, even in some cases, under-screen cameras. The latter has largely been a mess, dramatically impacting image quality. Something you definitely don’t want on your webcam in the era of the Zoom call. Effectively the inclusion of the notch means additional screen real estate up top where the bezel would otherwise be. Most of the time, it’s nothing a good, dark background can’t mask, or in the case of full-screen video, letter box bars.</p>
<p>It can, however, be a nuisance in full-screen mode, particularly in the case of apps with intensive menu systems. The menu bar automatically wraps around the notch. Developers don’t need to anything, it simply moves the menu bar items down so as not to be obscured. This was the case with Audacity, which has yet to even release an Apple silicon version, let alone develop for that brand new notch. The pointer, meanwhile, effectively passes under the notch when you scroll past.</p>
<p>If you need more than just a 14-inch display (don&#8217;t we all, sometimes?), the Pro chip is capable of supporting <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">two Pro Display XDRs. With the Max, you can run </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Pro Display XDRs and a 4K TV.

<p>The keyboard has been something of a sore spot for the MacBook line over the last several years. Thankfully, the company eventually returned to a mechanism that worked last year, after horror stories of stuck keys and an eventual keyboard replacement program. The current configuration tends toward the softer side of the laptop keyboard spectrum, but it’s light years beyond the rocky missteps of a few years back.</p>
<p>Whether the Touch Bar qualifies as a “rocky misstep” itself is a question of perspective, but it seems pretty clear that it fell short of Apple’s expectations. Having a super thin touch display over the keys is an interesting idea in theory, but I don’t know many people who regularly interacted with it. It was one of those things you wanted to like, but ultimately never offered up enough reasons to justify its continued existence. Which is to say that I, for one, am not sad to see it go.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222863" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222863" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2222863" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222863" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It’s too early to mourn its death completely, as it continues to hang on to the 13-inch MacBook for dear life, but, well, the future doesn’t look particularly bright for that input device. In its place, the full-height function keys are back, and leave it to Apple to position their return as a great new feature. As the company writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the first time, Magic Keyboard brings a full‑height function key row to MacBook Pro — with the tactile feel of mechanical keys that pros love.</p></blockquote>
<p>The keys include brightness, dictation, volume, Spotlight, Siri, Do Not Disrupt and music play back. It also maintains what was always the best part of the Touch Bar: Touch ID. This time it&#8217;s a full-size key, rather than the nub that you get on last year&#8217;s Air.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222860" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222860" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2222860" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222860" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Much like the return of MagSafe, the abandonment of the Touch Bar is a prime example of why the new MacBooks are the best in years. They build on the technologies and learnings of previous generations introduce some key breakthroughs and, perhaps, most importantly, listened to user feedback. That means moving on from what doesn’t work and doubling down on what does, and above all, not ever assuming you know what’s best for the consumer &#8212; particularly in the case of extremely particular creative pros.</p>
<p>Priced between $1,999 and $5,899, this is very much not the MacBook for everyone. For most consumers, the MacBook Air gets the job done &#8212; and then some. But if you’re someone who regularly finds yourself pushing your machine to the limits, the new Pro is a great marriage of the line’s best elements.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bild, which came out of private beta, is streamlining the design review process so that hardware product releases can be developed faster.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Pradyut Paul was a hardware engineering program manager at Apple, he saw firsthand the challenges of building and sharing hardware products using antiquated tools like email and spreadsheets.</p>
<p>It was after spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on expedited shipping after some designs were delayed that Paul realized there had to be a better way of engaging with other teams to develop hardware faster and validate more designs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222724" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222724" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2222724" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1-1.png?w=680" alt="Bild" width="680" height="462" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1-1.png 745w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1-1.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1-1.png?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1-1.png?resize=680,462 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1-1.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222724" class="wp-caption-text">Bild co-founders Pradyut Paul and Avinash Kunaparaju. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bild</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222715" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>He left Apple and started <a href="https://www.getbild.com/">Bild</a> in 2020, with CTO Avinash Kunaparaju and COO Derrick Choi, to put this type of collaboration into the cloud so that teams across an organization would be able to more easily review design processes leading to faster product releases.</p>
<p>“We came up with the idea of moving the engagements to the cloud,” Paul told TechCrunch. “It is more than just back-and-forth, but there are so many stakeholders involved and the communication repository is essentially the inbox.”</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $3 million seed round to build out its team in the areas of customer acquisition, sales and marketing and to continue product development, like building a self-service experience for new users. Tola Capital led the raise and was joined by Lux Capital, Shasta Ventures, Counterview Capital, Frontier Ventures and Techstars.</p>
<p>Users can use Bild’s web-based viewers to interact with 3D CAD, board files, bill-of-materials, schematics, drawings and simulation data. Traditionally, this was accomplished via sharing of screenshots and face-to-face meetings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other companies are tackling some of the individual pain points, like design review management specifically for mechanical engineers or collaborating on files, but Paul believes that Bild is the only one taking into account all of those, but across an entire company.</p>
<p>“People don’t have the same teams, so it is difficult to provide visibility,” he added. “One of the things we look at is the future of hardware and how it will be more connected to software and how to create an environment of collaboration with both.”</p>
<p>Bild was in private beta testing with 25 companies, but with the announcement of the funding round, the software is now publicly available. It has converted some of the early customers to paying customers, but is still figuring out pricing strategies, Paul said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222726" style="width: 966px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222726" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2222726 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture2.png" alt="Bild" width="956" height="466" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture2.png 956w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture2.png?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture2.png?resize=300,146 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture2.png?resize=768,374 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture2.png?resize=680,331 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture2.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 956px) 100vw, 956px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222726" class="wp-caption-text">Bild collaboration tool. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bild</p></div></p>
<p>Next up, the company is working on launching a visual disk and different ways to show visibility of CAD models to close the gaps between what it looks like in-person versus on the computer.</p>
<p>Akshay Bhushan, principal at Tola Capital, says the hardware market is a $50 billion to $70 billion industry that is still going through digitalization. Large companies, for example Autodesk, had walled off the space, but with more people working remotely, hardware and software is beginning to meld, he added.</p>
<p>“Bild is solving a problem every engineer would have and making pain points joyful,” Bhushan said. “Pradyut and Avinash are customer-obsessed and saw these problems that were also being recognized by the customer. All had different names for the same kind of email and process tracking and saw the value and the opportunity in what Bild is doing.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The Facebook Papers, a vast trove of documents supplied by whistleblower Frances Haugen to a consortium of news organizations has been released. The reporting, by <em>Reuters</em>, <em>Bloomberg</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em> and others, paints a picture of a company that repeatedly sought to prioritize dominance and profit over user safety. This was, however, despite a large number of employees warning that the company’s focus on engagement put users at risk of real-world violence.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/25/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-whistleblower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, for instance, claims that while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg played down reports that the site amplified hate speech in testimony to Congress, he was aware that the problem was far broader than publicly declared. Internal documents seen by the <em>Post</em> claim that the social network had removed less than five percent of hate speech, and that executives — including Zuckerberg — were well aware that Facebook was polarizing people. The claims have already been rebutted by Facebook, which says that the documents have been misrepresented.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg is also accused of squashing a plan to run a Spanish-language voter-registration drive in the US before the 2020 elections. He said that the plan may have appeared “partisan,” with WhatsApp staffers subsequently offering a watered-down version partnering with outside agencies. The CEO was also reportedly behind the decision not to clamp down on COVID-19 misinformation in the early stages of the pandemic as there may be a “material tradeoff with MSI [Meaningful Social Interaction — an internal Facebook metric] impact.” Facebook has refuted the claim, saying that the documents have been mischaracterized.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223237" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-knew-about-failed-police-abusive-content-globally-documents-2021-10-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported that Facebook has serially neglected a number of developing nations, allowing hate speech and extremism to flourish. That includes not hiring enough staffers who can speak the local language, appreciate the cultural context and otherwise effectively moderate. The result is that the company has unjustified faith in its automatic moderation systems which are ineffective in non-English speaking countries. Again, Facebook has refuted the accusation that it is neglecting its users in those territories.</p>
<p>One specific region that is singled out for concern is Myanmar, where Facebook has been held responsible for amplifying local tensions. A 2020 document suggests that the company’s automatic moderation system could not flag problematic terms in (local language) Burmese. (It should be noted that, two years previously, Facebook’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-06-facebook-myanmar-bsr-report.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">failure to properly act to prevent civil unrest in Myanmar</a> was highlighted in a report from Business for Social Responsibility.)</p>
<p>Similarly, Facebook reportedly did not have the tools in place to detect hate speech in the Ethiopian languages of Oromo or Amharic. Facebook has said that it is working to expand its content moderation team and, in the last two years, has recruited Oromo, Amharic and Burmese speakers (as well as a number of other languages).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/technology/facebook-like-share-buttons.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, reports that Facebook’s internal research was well-aware that the Like and Share functions — core elements of how the platform work — had accelerated the spread of hate speech. A document, titled What Is Collateral Damage, says that Facebook’s failure to remedy these issues will see the company “actively (if not necessarily consciously) promoting these types of activities.” Facebook says that, again, these statements are based on incorrect premises, and that it would be illogical for the company to try and actively harm its users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/facebook-files-show-growth-struggles-as-young-users-in-u-s-decline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, meanwhile, has focused on the supposed collapse in Facebook’s engagement metrics. Young people, a key target market for advertisers, are spending less time on Facebook’s platform, with fewer teens opting to sign up. At the same time, the number of users may be artificially inflated in these age groups, with users choosing to create multiple accounts — “Finstas” — to separate their online personas to cater to different groups. Haugen alleges that Facebook “has misrepresented core metrics to investors and advertisers,” and that duplicate accounts are leading to “extensive fraud” against advertisers. Facebook says that it already notifies advertisers of the risk that purchases will reach duplicate accounts in its Help Center, and lists the issue in its SEC filings.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.axios.com/clegg-facebook-exec-bad-headlines-whistleblower-documents-9acbf8c8-94c1-4ce6-97f0-0cf03b1bc7c0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><em>Axios</em></a> reported that Facebook’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-19-facebook-hires-tarnished-uk-politician-to-fix-its-reputation.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">Sir Nick Clegg</a> warned that the site should expect “more bad headlines” in the coming weeks. Between the material available in the Facebook Papers, another round of Frances Haugen’s testimony in the UK later today and rumors of more whistleblowers coming forward, it’s likely that Facebook will remain in the headlines for some time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the big leaders in buying up and scaling third-party merchants selling on Amazon and other marketplace platforms is announcing a major round of funding today as it continues to expand its ambitions. <a href="http://thras.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrasio</a>, the Boston-based startup, has closed an all-equity Series D of over $1 billion &#8212; a huge infusion in cash that it will be using to continue buying up more companies as well as to expand internationally. It said that it&#8217;s currently on a rate of buying 1.5 businesses per week and now has some 200 brands in its portfolio.</p>
<p>Silver Lake and Advent International led the round, with Advent remaining the company&#8217;s largest shareholder. Upper90, funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P., PEAK6 Investments and Corner Capital &#8212; all previous backers &#8212; were also in the round.</p>
<p>Thrasio has confirmed to me that the valuation is between $5 billion and $10 billion but declined to get more specific. As a marker of where it was prior to this round, in April of this year, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $100 million</a>, Thrasio was valued at $3.7 billion. Just on a straight added-capital basis that would put its valuation at close to $5 billion but the company also notes that it has been seeing accelerated growth &#8212; the number of brands under its wing has doubled since then to 200 &#8212; so very likely some ways higher than that. Current brands include <a href="https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/106f2ed10ddbc20cf6975184e74e4e56ed626fe0?url=https%3A%2F%2Fangryorange.com%2F&amp;userId=5317705&amp;signature=688f8c06a0bd5ad3" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/106f2ed10ddbc20cf6975184e74e4e56ed626fe0?url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fangryorange.com%252F%26userId%3D5317705%26signature%3D688f8c06a0bd5ad3&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635247668338000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEimYcEaZfdlO0RyfZUTwBDp3qpcA">Angry Orange pet deodorizers and stain removers</a>, <a href="https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/47b02c3201b4ee23608c7a19fc4b62fcf37acb50?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsaferest.com%2F&amp;userId=5317705&amp;signature=cee88c0b47717c50" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/47b02c3201b4ee23608c7a19fc4b62fcf37acb50?url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fsaferest.com%252F%26userId%3D5317705%26signature%3Dcee88c0b47717c50&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635247668338000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG9NMvJaBgtEm8P5jycAZda8MfDnA">SafeRest mattress protectors</a> and <a href="https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/df7125aeb92e4cf6469c05ece94669656294eee8?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthisworx.com%2F&amp;userId=5317705&amp;signature=279802a794191cbd" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/df7125aeb92e4cf6469c05ece94669656294eee8?url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fthisworx.com%252F%26userId%3D5317705%26signature%3D279802a794191cbd&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635247668338000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE-5Ilu4iS6eD2EvMUcl90eKy-kBQ">ThisWorx car cleaning and detailing products</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223225" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company, founded in 2018, has now raised $3.4 billion, including a $650 million debt round earlier this year.</p>
<p>Thrasio is one of the pioneers of the modern &#8220;roll up&#8221; player, and its traction, along with the wider opportunity in the market, have spawned dozens of other startups around the world building businesses replicating its model that have collectively raised hundreds of millions of dollars in equity and debt to build out their businesses.

<p>One of the reasons it has raised so much in this round is to better target that global opportunity. Thrasio already has operations in the UK, Germany China and Japan and the plan is to expand that further, both as a means of finding more companies to gobble up, but also to expand its wider supply chain.</p>
<p>That wider opportunity, meanwhile, remains a large one despite how crowded the market is getting. By various estimates there are between 5 million and 10 million third-party merchants selling on Amazon alone, leveraging the e-commerce giant&#8217;s giant audience of shoppers and its <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fulfillment by Amazon</a> platform for delivery and other distribution logistics to cut down the operational costs and inefficiencies of building a direct-to-consumer business from the ground up. Thrasio&#8217;s co-founder Josh Silberstein (who stepped away as co-CEO a couple of months ago) told me earlier this year that Thrasio estimates that there are around 50,000 businesses out of those that make more than $1 million in revenues annually, so the tail of what is out there in terms of size is very long.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Thrasio is building out a bigger economy of scale play around that basic model, and in some cases replacing some of the Amazon components with scale of its own, which &#8212; the theory goes &#8212; only improves as it grows. That includes sourcing for products (as well as wider supply chain challenges), analytics both to source the more interesting companies to buy up as well as to market those products once under the Thrasio wing, even its own fulfillment technology. It is also increasingly also looking at opportunities to build sales and customer relationships outside of the Amazon ecosystem, using other marketplaces, other sales channels and in some cases direct-to-consumer plays.</p>
<p>(And that analytics engine for sourcing potential acquisitions is working hard: Thrasio says that it has &#8220;evaluated&#8221; some 6,000 businesses overall.)</p>
<p>“Our business is getting better as it gets bigger, and these investments will be invaluable as we continue on that path,” said Carlos Cashman, the other co-founder and CEO of Thrasio, in a statement. “Advent and Silver Lake both have phenomenal track records of building successful global businesses, and the additional funds from existing investors including Upper90 and PEAK6 are extremely rewarding votes of confidence in a crowded space.”</p>
<p>“Thrasio created the Amazon aggregator category, and their innovative approach and impressive growth have brought a lot of attention to this space,” said Greg Mondre, co-CEO, and Stephen Evans, managing director, of Silver Lake, in a joint statement. “We believe Carlos Cashman and his team are well positioned to accelerate their growth and build the preeminent next-generation, technology-driven consumer goods company. We’re excited to partner with Carlos, his team and the existing shareholders as the company enters the next phase of growth.”</p>
<p>“Thrasio has quickly established itself as the largest e-commerce aggregator globally, and we are thrilled to strengthen our partnership with Carlos and his team, in addition to welcoming Silver Lake as a new investor,” added David Mussafer, chairman and managing partner and Jeff Case, managing director, of Advent International. “Thrasio is well positioned for further success, and we look forward to working with the company as it continues to scale.”</p>
<p><em>Updated to note that Silberstein is no longer co-CEO</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The new firm brings together a foursome with operator, venture capital and private equity expertise.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New venture capital firm <a class="c-link" tabindex="-1" href="https://www.acp.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.acp.vc/" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">Asymmetric Capital Partners</a> is putting $105 million to work in business-to-business startups, recently closing its first fund that was also oversubscribed.</p>
<p>Rob Biederman, founder and managing partner, started the firm earlier this year after founding and leading his own company, Catalant Technologies, a freelance marketplace. Joining him are Sarah Unger Biggs, Sam Clayman and Nancy Chou.</p>
<p>The foursome have previous connections: Biederman and Unger Biggs were college friends and worked together at Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs, while Clayman and Chou knew each other in high school.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222644" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Building a company is a lonely activity and it is nice to know someone you can turn to for traditional guidance,” Biederman said. “We spoke to founders who talked about negative VC experiences, and it occurred to me that some firms aren’t as empathizing, so we set out to build a firm where we can work shoulder to shoulder with founders to build their companies.”</p>
<p>The technology-focused firm is jointly based in New York and Boston and invests in seed to Series C-stage business-to-business companies across four theses: the digitization of legacy industries, next-generation software and business tooling, marketplaces and the disruption of time and place that lead to changes in work, retail and healthcare.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Biederman, while he was still a one-man shop, largely raised the fund during the spring and attracted investment from family offices and high net worth individuals who have private equity and venture capital backgrounds, Unger Biggs said.</p>
<p>The firm is both leading rounds and co-investing with other firms and aims to write check sizes from $250,000 to $10 million and has already gotten to work putting the capital to use in over a dozen startups, including recruiting platform Canvas, Firstbase, a remote work software and fintech company Clearco.</p>
<p>“Asymmetric is embracing technology at a place where a bunch of sectors are getting digital rails, leading to more speed and accuracy of delivery, advanced analytics and data capture,” Biederman said. “Connected devices are creating a massive new data set and people are bundling software to make use of that data.”</p>

<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s Rebecca Bellan and Aria Alamalhodaei were a bit ambitious this week, which means I dialed back some of the other parts. <em>Let&#8217;s go!</em></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223138" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But before we dive in, I wanted to give a nod to the inaugural effort of the<a href="https://www.indyautonomouschallenge.com/"> Indy Autonomous Challenge</a>, which was held Saturday. The IAC brought together students from 21 universities from 9 countries, who were charged with programming driverless racecars to compete in a  high-speed autonomous race. The winning team, which received the $1 million grand prize, was the Technical University of Munich. I did not attend, but was told by a few folks who were there that it was a small, yet fun event and solid foundation had been established for this to continue in future years.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start the week with a new-ish company and this week&#8217;s unsung hero of micromobility: <strong>Zoba. </strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zoba, a Boston-based startup that runs fleet optimization for many major micromobility companies, including <strong>Spin</strong>, just announced a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/zoba-wants-to-help-micromobility-companies-get-more-rides-increase-profitability/https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/zoba-wants-to-help-micromobility-companies-get-more-rides-increase-profitability/"> $12 million Series A raise.</a></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s AI runs behind the operator&#8217;s fleet management software. Zoba&#8217;s software takes into account shifting local regulations and basically helps micromobility companies get as many customers on vehicles as possible, while being as efficient as possible and helping to adhere to a company&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject of bottom lines, <strong>Lime</strong> said CEO <strong>Wayne Ting</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/lime-announces-second-ebitda-profitable-quarter-in-company-history/">said the third quarter of 2021</a> would be the company&#8217;s second profitable quarter, adjusted for EBITDA, of course. While Lime wasn&#8217;t able to generate more sales or revenue to increase top line growth, it seems it was able to increase efficiency in a way that quite possibly has led to profitability. But we&#8217;ll have to take their word for it. Nothing can be certain until the company goes public and dishes up those earnings.</p>
<p><strong>Bolt Mobility</strong> is launching both an in-app navigation system for its e-scooters, called &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/bolt-mobility-launches-in-app-navigation-for-shared-e-scooters/">MobilityOS</a>,&#8221; as well as a new scooter with a built-in smartphone holder that also uses the scooter&#8217;s battery to charge the phone! Let&#8217;s see how that one goes. Is it safer to just listen to audio directions and occasionally try to check your phone while riding, or is it safer to take a cheeky peek down at the screen every now and again?</p>
<p><strong>Helbiz</strong> has partnered with <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211020005551/en/Helbiz-Partners-with-Fantasmo-to-Integrate-Innovative-E-Scooter-Parking-Technology">mapping company Fantasmo</a> to integrate its parking tech into Helbiz&#8217;s e-scooter app. Fantasmo&#8217;s camera-positioning tech detects the exact location of e-scooters and validates parking within eight inches or less via a rider&#8217;s phone camera. The integration will roll out in Miami first.</p>
<p><strong>Voi</strong> is making a Copenhagen comeback as the city aims to become the world&#8217;s first carbon-neutral capital by 2025. Voi, based in neighboring country Sweden, is bringing 800 e-scooters to the Danish metropolis for the next year; the service could be extended another two years if all goes well.</p>
<p><strong>Niu Technologies</strong>, a Chinese electric motor scooter manufacturer, announced it would <a href="https://www.bike-eu.com/products-innovations/nieuws/2021/10/niu-technologies-expands-into-e-bikes-to-grow-international-market-presence-10141497">start making e-bikes</a> in order to help grow its international presence. The e-bike series includes a 15 mph and a 28 mph version. The bikes are pretty heavy at nearly 100 pounds, due to large aluminum frames and oversized dual suspension.</p>
<p>Japanese motorcycle manufacturer <strong>Kawasaki</strong> says it&#8217;s going all-electric in developed countries by 2035, which really gives it plenty of time to get its model together and keep selling gas-powered motorcycles in the meantime.</p>
<p>To compete with <strong>Ola&#8217;s</strong> amazing success selling electric scooters (the big ones, not the kick ones), <strong>Honda</strong> announced it would be selling the same in India. Honda Motorcycle &amp; Scooter India <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/honda-motorcycle-scooter-india-set-to-enter-electric-two-wheeler-segment-in-the-next-fy/articleshow/86946969.cms">told the Economic Times</a> it would have a product within the next financial year.</p>
<p>Finally, at the <strong>Micromobility America</strong> conference last month, micromobility legend Horace Dediu presented the 10 commandments of micromobility, which I now present to you. I do think you should <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBoG6hH-Z8o&amp;list=PL8xVg_NZwODQT3QPQy2p0ng8dhnEdnHaQ&amp;index=3&amp;ab_channel=MicromobilityIndustries">watch the video</a>, as well.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Nobody invented micromobility. &#8220;Micromobility is the confluence of thousands of ideas and the work of thousands of people.&#8221; A range of enabling technologies, like lithium ion batteries becoming cheaper, led to this micro outcome.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Most trips are short, which means short trips are more important. 50% of trips are from 0 to 5 miles. That number could actually increase if people have more access to a vehicle that&#8217;s designed for shorter trips.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Cars are a bundle. You can substitute the short trips with smaller vehicles, and you can substitute the bigger trips with bigger vehicles that are shared, like planes, trains and buses.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The smaller it gets, the bigger it gets. And by this he means volumes. For example, Android and iPhone sales far surpass those of PCs and other revolutionary computers, even though they came to market much later. In terms of vehicles, Dediu expects micromobility vehicles to grow much faster than electric vehicles in the future.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> You can&#8217;t get there from here. There are more cars than ever in all of our cities and countries, and based on adoption curves, that number will only increase exponentially. Even if you tried to electrify all cars, emissions would still rise beyond legal limits. But with micromobility, we could have twice the number of drivers with half the amount of emissions.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Don&#8217;t dig where there&#8217;s no treasure. All infrastructure is a sunk cost. All the arguments we have about not changing infrastructure are based on the massive costs associated with infrastructure builds, but those are fallacies. We&#8217;ve destroyed infrastructures in the past. Inner-city highways can be demolished, too.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> They promised flying taxis. We got bike lanes. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent on big moonshots like autonomous vehicles and flying cars, but the simple bike lane is far better and more revolutionary than &#8220;any of this crap.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> You sell miles, but customers buy smiles. The transition to micromobility will happen because people are happy with the vehicles and like riding them.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> Micromobility is a mind for the bicycle. Micromobility absorbs data, software, intelligence and sensing. It&#8217;s cheaper and builds on the shoulders of giants, and it&#8217;s increasingly the smartest machine on the road. &#8220;The power of software allows us to invest in solutions to overcome most of our machines&#8217; shortcomings.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Cities always win. Micromobility is urban freedom. Cities have gone through much worse than coronavirus, and they all came back stronger than ever. Cities are antifragile, the more you stress them, the stronger they become.</p>

<p>Welp &#8230; I&#8217;m not ready to call peak urban air mobility quite yet, but we might be getting close.</p>
<p><strong>HT Aero,</strong> an urban air mobility company that&#8217;s an affiliate of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng, raised an eyebrow-raising <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/xpeng-backed-urban-air-mobility-company-ht-aero-raises-500m/">$500 million in a Series A round</a>. The company said it will use the funds to acquire top-tier talent, advance R&amp;D and &#8220;continue to gain airworthiness provision and certification&#8221; as it advances toward the next generation of its vehicles, according to Deli Zhao, founder and president of the company.</p>
<p>The company recently revealed its fifth-generation flying vehicle, the Xpeng X2, which can handle autonomous flight take-off and landing for certain city scenarios, back-end scheduling, charging and flight control. The company says it wants to provide UAM solutions for individual consumers, rather than businesses, which would certainly be in line with Xpeng&#8217;s goals.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>AirGarage</strong>, a startup that works with parking real estate owners and offers a full-stack software and management service for their lot or garage, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/airgarage-a-full-stack-parking-operator-raises-12-5m-in-round-led-by-a16z/">closed a $12.5 million</a> Series A round led by a16z, with participation from existing investors Floodgate, Founders Fund and Abstract Ventures. AirGarage has more than 200 locations across 30 states under its management.</p>
<p><strong>Alaska Airlines</strong> launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/alaska-airlines-launches-new-venture-arm-with-first-investment-in-up-partners-230m-fund/">new venture capital arm</a>, dubbed Alaska Star Ventures. The aim is to find and invest in emerging technologies to help decarbonize air travel. Its first investment was to put $15 million into the Los Angeles-based UP.Partners&#8217; inaugural venture fund. UP.Partners&#8217; $230 million early-stage fund is focused on mobility technologies. Woven Capital, the investment arm of Toyota Motor&#8217;s Woven Planet Group, Standard Industries, Hillwood and OSM Maritime have also invested in the UP.Partners fund.</p>
<p><strong>Ally Financial</strong>, the automotive finance giant, plans to acquire credit card company Fair Square Financial for $750 million, <a href="https://www.autonews.com/finance-insurance/ally-invest-big-credit-cards-750-million-fair-square-deal?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+autonews%2FBreakingNews+%28Automotive+News+Breaking+News+Feed%29">reported Automotive News</a>.</p>

<p><strong>FlixMobility</strong>, the $3 billion-German transportation startup, showed it&#8217;s pretty darned interested in the U.S. market. The company agreed to acquire Greyhound Lines, the iconic U.S. bus network, from U.K.-based owner FirstGroup. The deal, which includes a vehicle fleet, trademarks and related assets and liabilities, has an enterprise value on a debt-free/cash-free basis of $46 million, with an unconditional deferred consideration of $32 million with an interest rate of 5% per annum alongside that.* (Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/germanys-flixmobility-acquires-greyhound-lines-the-iconic-u-s-bus-company-in-78m-deal/">Ingrid Lunden&#8217;s article</a> to get deeper into the details, including what that * is all about)</p>

<p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner.</p>
<p>The big news this week is the appointment of <strong>Missy Cummings</strong>, former Navy fighter pilot and engineering professor at Duke University, to a senior safety advisory role at the nation&#8217;s top vehicle safety regulator.</p>
<p>This kind of appointment might not typically get much notice from the general public. But Tesla fans sure did (side note from transportation editor and The Station creator Kirsten Korosec: the AV industry absolutely took notice; they just didn&#8217;t comment publicly). The reaction from a community of Tesla owners and shareholders was loud — a torrent of concern and vitriol that frothed forth on Twitter and that at times devolved into attacks on Cummings gender and character.</p>
<p>Cummings has been a vocal critic of Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot advanced driver assistance system, and more recently, its rollout of the &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; beta program to thousands of drivers across the United States. On the <strong>McKinsey Global Institute</strong> podcast last month, she called attention to what she referred to as &#8220;mode confusion,&#8221; or when the driver doesn&#8217;t have sufficient understanding of the capabilities (and limitations) of a system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve known about this for a long time in aviation, but this is new learning for the automotive world,&#8221; she said on the podcast. &#8220;We see this when people think that Autopilot and Full Self-Driving actually mean those things, and people climb in the backseat or take their hands off the steering wheel and don&#8217;t realize the trouble they&#8217;re in, and the car crashes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as news of the appointment was circulating, Tesla CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong> tweeted &#8220;Objectively, her track record is extremely biased against Tesla.&#8221; That tweet fanned the growing flames of dissent from Tesla fans, many of whom are also shareholders. A petition has even been circulated on Change.org requesting her removal.</p>
<p>Supporters of Tesla have also called attention to Cummings&#8217; service on the board of Veoneer, a Tier 1 company that supplies automakers with advanced driver assistance software and the accompanying hardware such as radars, lidars, thermal night vision cameras and other vision systems. It&#8217;s the lidar — a sensor that most in the industry with the exception of Tesla believe is required to offer fully automated driving — that triggered Tesla fans. <strong>Qualcomm</strong> recently reached an agreement to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/qualcomm-acquires-veoneer-for-4-5-billion-canceling-its-agreement-with-magna/">acquire Veoneer</a>.</p>
<p>Her critics suggest that the <strong>National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration</strong> may take a more conservative stance on ADAS and Tesla in the future. (It should be noted that NHTSA has in the past has generally taken rather laissez faire approach with Tesla; anything beyond that will seem as if the regulatory gates have come crashing down on the automaker.) It is unclear whether she will take an advisory role in the investigation into Autopilot currently underway at NHTSA, which was opened following 12 incidents of Teslas crashing into parked emergency vehicles.</p>
<p>Kirsten here with a side note on this issue: Missy Cummings first protected and then ended up deleting her Twitter account because she was not just trolled; she received death threats, which are being investigated, according to my sources.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> FSD <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/24/elon-musk-rolls-back-newest-full-self-driving-beta-due-to-software-issues/">software beta was rolled back</a> Sunday. Musk tweeted Sunday &#8220;Seeing some issues with 10.3, so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily. Please note, this is to be expected with beta software. It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA, hence public beta.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The other piece of news that caught my eye this week  &#8230;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> and <strong>Lyft</strong> have been lobbying the government to include provisions to boost electric vehicle adoption in the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill currently being debated in Congress.</p>
<p>The two ride-hailing giants have made sweeping, ambitious pledges that all rides booked on their platforms will be taken in an electric vehicle by 2030 &#8212; a goal that each company is unlikely to reach without hefty government support.</p>
<p>Both companies consider cost and lack of charging infrastructure to be two key obstacles to larger EV uptake, according to reporting from E&amp;E News. And it&#8217;s true that for many, electric vehicles remain prohibitively expensive, especially compared to the plethora of used internal combustion engine vehicles available&#8230; well, basically anywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our population of drivers who use our app, they are coming from lower-income communities, and they&#8217;re serving mobility in urban areas,&#8221; Adam Gromis, a sustainability policy manager with Uber, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/uber-lyft-lobby-for-ev-reconciliation-provisions/">told E&amp;E News</a>. &#8220;So for us, we want to see slow charging in underserved neighborhoods and multiunit dwellings, and we want to see fast charging in urban areas and areas of high mobility demand.</p>
<p>According to the spending transparency platform OpenSecrets, Uber and Lyft have each spent close to $1 million so far in the first half of the year on lobbying efforts, though each employed fewer lobbyists overall. Data on third quarter lobbying spending is not yet available.</p>

<p>Keeping this short — and a bit of a mishmash — this week.</p>
<p><strong>Elon Musk&#8217;s</strong> Boring Company received initial approval to build a transportation system that would shuttle passengers in Tesla vehicles via a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-loop-expand-strip/">network of tunnels under Las Vegas</a>. The special use permit and franchise agreement would allow the Boring Company to expand its Vegas Loop system beyond its current 1.7-mile footprint that connects the Las Vegas Convention Center campus to a 29-mile route with 51 stations that would include stops at casinos along the Las Vegas Strip, the city&#8217;s football stadium and UNLV. It would eventually reach the McCarran International Airport.</p>
<p><strong>Lyft</strong> released its first and long overdue <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/q8mvene1wzq4/4jxkFTH5YCQK8T96STULMd/4269e14dbcb8578ff64da45df08b8147/Community_Safety_Report.pdf">safety report</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Miles</strong>, the universal rewards app that lets users earn miles for every mile traveled, has launched in Japan. The expansion aims to build off of Miles&#8217; marketplace, which now offers users 500 personalized rewards from 350 brands, including Garmin, Hulu, Japan Airlines, Red Bull and Under Armour.</p>
<p><strong> Motional</strong>, the autonomous vehicle joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and Aptiv, is partnering with Transport for New South Wales too help the Australian state better understand the technology and possibilities that come with a driverless ride-hail service.</p>
<p><strong>Plus</strong>, self-driving truck technology developer, said it plans to expand into Europe. The company has hired Bosch veteran Sun-Mi &#8220;Sunny&#8221; Choi as senior director of business development to accelerate that European expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong>, which filed to go public, said in a recent regulatory filing that it expects to <a href="https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/rivian-expects-q3-net-loss-about-12-billion-higher-ev-production-costs?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+autonews%2FBreakingNews+%28Automotive+News+Breaking+News+Feed%29">record a quarterly net loss</a> of up to $1.28 billion due to costs associated with the start of production of its debut truck. The net loss for the period ended Sept. 30 will range from $1.18 billion to $1.28 billion, according to the preliminary results.</p>
<p><strong>Stellantis</strong>, the automaker formed through a merger with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Groupe PSA, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/stellantis-lg-energy-to-build-u-s-battery-factory-in-new-joint-venture/">reached a preliminary deal</a> with <strong>LG Energy Solution</strong> to produce battery cells and modules in North America.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> continued its profitability streak, reporting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/tesla-charges-forward-with-a-third-quarter-profit-of-1-6-billion/">net income of $1.62 billion</a> in the third quarter. That&#8217;s a nearly fivefold increase from the $331 million it earned in the same period last year. The record-setting profit came thanks to record sales and despite a global chip shortage and supply chain constraints that have affected the industry. Notably, Tesla was able to earn that record net income (on a GAAP basis) even as the vast majority of its sales came from its cheaper Model Y and Model 3 electric vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Wolfe Research</strong> went out and rode in an Argo AI autonomous test vehicle. The tl;dr is that they saw great progress and the vehicle was able to navigate an environment packed with cars, double parked trucks, street-cleaners, e-bikes, aggressively driven scooters, and pedestrians. &#8220;For the most part the vehicle performed complex decisions (yielding or not yielding to pedestrians, unprotected left turns, adjusting to construction),&#8221; the report said. Their takeaway: &#8220;We tested an Argo&#8217;s AV. And it reinforced our view that this technology is coming sooner, with potential for greater disruption than investors currently appreciate.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Zoox</strong>, the autonomous vehicle startup acquired last year by <strong>Amazon</strong>, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/amazons-zoox-is-expanding-autonomous-vehicle-operations-testing-to-seattle/">expanding to Seattle</a>. The company plans to open in 2022 an engineering office and operations facility, which will act as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing. The company, which today employs more than 1,300 people, tests its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, Las Vegas and Foster City, California, near its headquarters. The company started testing its autonomous vehicles on public roads in Las Vegas in 2019.</p>
<p>I spoke to co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson and he said Zoox has been eyeing Seattle as a test site for years. The company even completed a small pilot in the city in late 2019. The frequency of rain in the area is one of the primary reasons Zoox picked Seattle, Levinson said.</p>
<p>Zoox has developed some advanced weather proofing, including what Levinson described as &#8220;active rain mitigation&#8221; for its sensors. &#8220;We&#8217;re very excited about that and we want to test it and validate it in the rain; Seattle is a great place for that,&#8221; Levinson said.</p>
<p>While Zoox is setting up operations in the city where Amazon is based, Levinson emphasized that the two companies still operate separately. The Zoox office and operations hub will not be housed on the Amazon campus, for instance. Zoox will take advantage of its proximity to Amazon to work with the company on various collaborations in the future, Levinson said, describing that as an &#8220;extra bonus.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based e-scooter rentals company Tier Mobility has announced a $200 million raise which it says is the &#8220;first close&#8221; of its Series D, as investors continue to plough money into urban micromobility.</p>
<p>The startup confirmed to TechCrunch it will be raising a larger amount before the Series D is closed out (and the full round will also be a mix of debt and equity; although this first tranche is equity only).</p>
<p>However it declined to specify how much it&#8217;s targeting for the full Series D raise.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223190" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;As part of the Series D round we just did our first close and seek to increase the equity round plus raise a new debt facility,&#8221; said a Tier spokesman.</p>
<p>Tier&#8217;s PR also describes today&#8217;s first close as &#8220;part of a broader equity and debt raise&#8221;.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s <a href="https://www.zawya.com/mena/en/press-releases/story/TIER_raises_200mln_Series_D_funding_round_to_fulfil_its_mission_to_Change_Mobility_For_Good-ZAWYA20211025061342/">announcement</a> follows a $60M debt raise this summer, and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/e-scooter-startup-tier-raises-250-million-round-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2/">$250M Series C last November</a> (led by SoftBank).</p>
<p>Micromobility startups typically have high capex costs, especially as they expand their fleets during periods of expansion, so debt raises are fairly common.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, Alex Gayer, chief financial officer at Tier Mobility, said: &#8220;This equity funding provides further firepower to scale our multimodal market presence globally, and pursue strategic investments &amp; acquisitions. Our vehicle capex needs will be serviced with the debt capacity unlocked. Our goal is to build Tier into the European micro-mobility powerhouse, building on our current position as the number one player in the shared electric scooters market.”</p>

<p>Existing investor SoftBank Vision Fund 2 is co-leading the Series D with the UAE-based Mubadala Capital, which also backed Tier&#8217;s Series C last year, while other existing investors RTP Global, Novator, White Star Capital, Northzone, and Speedinvest also participating.</p>
<p>Mubadala&#8217;s increased backing for Tier follows it jumping into the UAE&#8217;s market last year &#8212; after it was selected by the local Roads &amp; Transport Authority, following a lengthy trial of scooter rentals.</p>
<p>The funding also includes sees new investors joining &#8212; including the green impact fund M&amp;G Investments and Mountain Partners, a diversified global investment holding.</p>
<p>Tier said its micromobility business is now valued at $2BN (which is up around double from the value <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/24d21036-96ef-499c-80e5-653d4aea3e52">being reported</a> around the time of its Series C last year) &#8212; saying it&#8217;s raised a total of $660M in equity and debt funding to date.</p>
<p>The 2018 launched e-scooter, e-bike and e-moped startup competes in a highly competitive space with a myriad of players, including the likes of Bird, Dott, Lime, Voi and Wind (to name a few) &#8212; although authorities in cities around the world have sought to bring a little structure to the fast-developing micromobility market by setting limits on the number of operators allowed per city. That means that winning a slot as a city provider can help leapfrog competitors at a local level.</p>
<p>In the press release, Tier, for example, trumpets its recent win of a tender to provide e-scooters for rent in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/dott-lime-and-tier-selected-for-london-e-scooter-trial/">a trial in London</a> (alongside Dott and Lime). Other new cities it touts are both in the Middle East: Manama (Bahrain) and Doha (Qatar).</p>
<p>It also operates in Paris &#8212; where city authorities have been making a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/how-four-european-cities-are-embracing-micromobility-to-drive-out-cars/">big push to shift the urban transport mix away from cars</a> to alternatives like bikes and public transport. So it can claim some major wins.</p>
<p>To-date, Tier says it&#8217;s deployed 135,000 e-scooters, e-bikes and e-mopeds across 150 cities in 16 countries &#8212; claiming to have established itself as &#8220;the European market leader through unrivalled capital efficiency and operational excellence&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Berlin-based startup&#8217;s plan for the new funding is for &#8220;acquisitions and strategic investments&#8221;, as well as for further international expansion &#8212; with Tier saying it will be targeting coverage across strategic growth markets, in Europe and the Middle East.</p>
<p>So it sounds like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/bird-confirms-acquisition-of-berlin-scooter-competitor-circ/">more consolidation</a> is headed for the fast-paced e-scooter market as fresh dollars pour in. (And one way to circumvent city-imposed limits on the number of operators &#8212; to grab further scale &#8212; would be to buy up rivals that have won tenders in cities you haven&#8217;t&#8230; )</p>
<p>Tier also says it will be directing some of the investment into continuing to roll out its network of battery charging stations hosted by local businesses, aka the Tier Energy Network.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the launch of e-bikes in several European countries, Tier is expanding its growing range of multimodal options, making it the first European micro-mobility provider to offer users three different types of vehicles in one app,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>In a statement, Lawrence Leuschner, CEO and co-founder, said: “The funding provides Tier with additional resources to fulfil our mission to Change Mobility For Good. Clocking more than 80 million trips, replacing over 13 million car rides, in such a short amount of time exemplifies that cities around the world look for ways to make their transport networks safer and move towards a zero-emission future.”</p>
<p>“Lawrence, Matthias and Alex&#8217;s passion for change can be felt across the organisation &#8212; from Tier&#8217;s hub in Dubai to their HQ in Berlin,&#8221; added Amer Alaily, director at Mubadala Capital Ventures, Europe, in another supporting statement. &#8220;They have quickly emerged as not only a leader in the European micro-mobility space, but one whose commitment to sustainability sets them apart from their competitors. We are proud to have been part of their journey and look forward to remaining a partner to Lawrence and his team for years to come.”</p>
<p><em>This report was updated after Tier confirmed to us that this $200M raise is a first all-equity tranche of what it intends will be a larger Series D &#8212; which will be a mix of debt and equity once closed</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.routine.co">Routine</a>, a new startup working on a productivity tool that should help you manage your work day more efficiently. It’s a brand new take on to-do lists as it combines both tasks, non-actionable notes and a daily planner.</p>
<p>The two co-founders of Routine are <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julienquintard">Julien Quintard</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/quentin-hocquet-27a3224">Quentin Hocquet</a>, two French entrepreneurs who previously created Infinit, a startup I covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/infinit/">several times</a>. Docker acquired Infinit back in <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-acquires-infinit/">2016</a>.</p>
<p>They are teaming up once again to create Routine. Right now, Routine is an app for macOS and iOS that works with your Google account. After setting up your account, Routine helps you figure out “what am I supposed to do right now?” at any point in time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222473" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>One of the most opinionated feature of Routine is the dashboard. Whatever you’re doing on your computer, you can pull up the Routine dashboard with a simple keyboard shortcut. By default, that shortcut is Ctrl-Space.</p>
<p>The Routine app adds an overlay on top of your screen with a few widgets. It looks a bit like the now-defunct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(macOS)">Dashboard</a> on macOS. On that dashboard, you’ll find a handful of things. On the left, you can see the tasks you have to complete today.</p>
<p>On the right, you can see how much time you have left before your next meeting and some information about that event. The date is pulled directly from your Google Calendar account.</p>
<p>In the center of the screen, Routine displays a big input field called the Console. You can type text and then press enter to create a new task from there. It works a bit like the ‘Quick Add’ feature in <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222475" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222475" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-dashboard.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" class="size-full wp-image-2222475" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-dashboard.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-dashboard.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-dashboard.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-dashboard.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-dashboard.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-dashboard.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-dashboard.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222475" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Routine</p></div></p>
<p>The idea is that you can add a task without wasting time opening your to-do app, moving to the right project, clicking the add task button and entering text into several fields. With Routine, you can press Ctrl-Space, type some text, press enter and you’re done.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also use the Console to schedule task directly using natural language. For instance, you can type ‘Take out trash every Wednesday at 7pm’ and Routine will create a new item every Wednesday.</p>
<p>Once your tasks are in Routine, you can manage them from the Routine app. In addition to the regular to-do app actions, such as rescheduling a task or marking it as complete, you can allocate some time for bigger tasks. From the Today interface, you can move a task from the task list to your calendar. It automatically creates a calendar event with that task.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222477" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222477" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-main-screen2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="665" class="size-full wp-image-2222477" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-main-screen2.png 1984w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-main-screen2.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-main-screen2.png?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-main-screen2.png?resize=768,499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-main-screen2.png?resize=680,441 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-main-screen2.png?resize=1536,997 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-main-screen2.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222477" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Routine</p></div></p>
<p>The app is a much a to-do app as a note-taking app. Each task represents a page. From that page, you get a Notion-like editor. You can write text, add headings, dividers and photos, create bulleted lists and more.</p>
<p>And if you create a task within a task, it automatically becomes a full-fledged Routine task. You can schedule it, insert it in your calendar and more. This works a bit like Evernote’s recent update with its <a href="https://evernote.com/features/tasks">new take on tasks</a>. Essentially, tasks remain in context.</p>
<p>As Routine integrates directly with your calendar, you can also open each event in your calendar and take notes from there. Essentially, each event is also a note by itself.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222478" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222478" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-screen-meeting-notes.png" alt="" width="1024" height="664" class="size-full wp-image-2222478" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-screen-meeting-notes.png 1985w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-screen-meeting-notes.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-screen-meeting-notes.png?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-screen-meeting-notes.png?resize=768,498 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-screen-meeting-notes.png?resize=680,441 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-screen-meeting-notes.png?resize=1536,997 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-screen-meeting-notes.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222478" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Routine</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, Routine lets you create Pages. Each Page is a document that can hold tasks or notes. You can use it to create various lists, such as grocery lists, packing lists and watch lists. You can also use it to store evergreen information, such as recipes or restaurants you like.</p>
<p>Routine is currently in closed beta. The startup has participated in Y Combinator’s W21 batch and raised a $2.7 million pre-seed round from BoxGroup and TargetGlobal. Several business angels also participated, such as Matt Robinson, Clément Delangue and Ian Hogarth.</p>
<p>I played around with the app and it’s an interesting take on both to-do lists and note-taking. Some people rely heavily on a to-do app, but they can’t store notes in there that easily. Other people store everything in a note-taking app. But they can’t easily view all their tasks at once. Routine aims to bridge that gap, so it’s going to be interesting to see whether the company manages to create a loyal community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://vendease.com/">Vendease</a>, an online marketplace that allows restaurants and other food businesses to buy supplies straight from manufacturers and farms, has raised a seed round of $3.2 million, the company confirmed to TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news is coming seven months after TechCrunch announced that the company, founded in January 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/backed-by-yc-vendease-is-building-amazon-prime-for-restaurants-in-africa/">took part in Y Combinator’s winter batch</a> that included nine other African startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based venture capital firm Global Founders Capital led the seed round. Y Combinator, Hustle Fund, Liquid 2 Ventures, Hack VC and Soma Capital participated, including individual local investors and early backers such as Paga CEO Tayo Oviosu, Remita CEO John Obaro and Magic Fund. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223041" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vendease tries to solve the challenges and inefficiencies in Africa’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fragmented food sector, starting with Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company found a sweet spot in a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decentralized marketplace play connecting suppliers and farms on one side with restaurants and food businesses on another</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a restaurant or food business places an order, the system generates all the possible suppliers that can fulfill it, looks at the best pricing versus quality and assigns that order to the supplier. According to the company, delivery </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within 24 hours, either by itself or third-party logistics providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the company recognized that these businesses needed more quality and operational help. While some complained of delivery times and quality of food supplies, others did not have sophisticated operations to handle them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CEO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tunde-kara-a0345121">Tunde Kara</a> tells TechCrunch that this led to Vendease building a series of stacks &#8212;  logistics, storage, payments, inventory management, embedded finance &#8212; to control the movement of food supplies from one point of production to the endpoint of consumption.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So when we say we’re building the operating system for food supply, this is what we mean,” said Kara, who founded the company with <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/olumide-fayankin-3a450339">Olumide Fayankin</a>, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/gatumialiyu">Gatumi Aliyu</a>, and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/waleoyepeju">Wale Oyepeju</a> Olumide Fayankin, Gatumi Aliyu and Wale Oyepeju.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vendease says it has also employed extensive quality control measures for the food supplies on its platform at the point of delivery or acceptance into its warehouse. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform also has an option that allows food businesses to receive free supplies for any order that turns out unsatisfactory</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the time Vendease launched until now, one thing has remained constant in the industry it plays in: the fluctuation of food prices in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With one of the highest inflation rates in the world, the country saw prices of food items such as beans <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1226123/percentage-change-in-prices-of-selected-food-products-in-nigeria/">grow by over 70%</a> from July 2020 to July 2021</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/nigeria/food-inflation">report</a> says the cost of food in the country has increased 19.57% in September 2021 compared to the same month last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are some of the unforeseen but combat-ready issues agritech and food tech startups have to deal with to scale</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Vendease’s case, Kara says the company has created a predictive analysis and storage system to help businesses predict future food prices, store food in advance, and peg their prices for any duration depending on the food category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process, according to the CEO, has saved businesses on the platform a ton of money and human capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we compare market prices to what users buy on our platform, we’ve approximately saved them about $480,000 in the last nine months, cutting a lot of unnecessary expenses from their general costs &#8212; savings that can go into other things </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expansion and growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kara says the company hopes to 10x this number in the next 12 to 18 months. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proactively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in our small way, we are helping to grow the GDP for the food businesses both on the farmers and vendor side of the marketplace,” he continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> human capital, Kara states the businesses on Vendease have saved approximately about 5,000 person-hours</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Vendease has moved 100,000 metric tonnes of food, Kara added. For a startup that is a little over eighteen months old, moving that amount of food is a noteworthy feat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving this quantity, coupled with Vendease’s technology stack, has allowed the company to analyze what its customers want before making their orders, which is why the company now has its warehouses and logistics service.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the YC-backed company hit an annualized transaction volume of $12.9 million and $1.2 million in annual recurring revenue</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Kara did not share revenue numbers, he said Vendease’s revenue has grown 17x since last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the platform’s financing side, over 1,000 businesses have accessed more than $3 million in supply chain finance </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">so far</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platforms digitizing the food supply chain for restaurants and food businesses across the continent have been scarce in Africa since Twiga launched in Kenya seven years ago (however, with a slightly different model).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that Vendease is in the fray, it wants to establish itself as the leader amongst an upcoming pack with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">newer players such as Kenya’s Kibanda TopUp. A requisite to that, according to Kara, is Vendease’s execution and operational knowledge of the market and data on food businesses; he believes they will give the company an edge over other platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But then we don’t see competition as a winner take all situation. We see it as validation for the work that we’re doing,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vendease currently operates in three Nigerian cities &#8212; Lagos, Abuja and Ibadan, with some of the biggest food brands in the country such as Hard Rock, Krispy Kreme and Shiro.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kara says the company will use the funding to expand into other cities and countries before the end of Q1 next year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the funding allows Vendease to continue to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build out its technology stack, secure partnerships with some payment platforms and banks to deepen its financial products, especially buy now, pay later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Donald Stalter, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the managing partner at Global Founders Capital said, “As a backer of one of Africa’s very first unicorns, Jumia, we’ve seen a great deal of talent in the market &#8211; and Tunde &amp; the Vendease team are best in class both in EMEA and globally. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their laser focus and rapid growth </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are unprecedented</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and there’s a massive opportunity ahead.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.hera.so">Hera</a>, a new calendar app that wants to turn the calendar into the main work interface. Hera helps you schedule meetings more easily with natural language processing and lets you share availabilities in an email or any messaging app. The startup is also going to build integrations with your other work tools so that you can surface important information before a meeting and extract information after a meeting.</p>
<p>So far, Hera has raised a $465,000 (€400,000) pre-seed round led by Eurazeo (under the Idinvest brand at the time) and several business angels. It has then joined Y Combinator’s S21 batch and raised a $1.7 million seed round led by Eurazeo.</p>
<p>Business angels who invested in the company include Alexis Bonillo, Thibaud Elzière, Kyle Parrish, Calvin French-Owen, John Gabaix and Karthik Puvvada. Notion Capital and Kima Ventures also invested.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222584" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Hera first started as a calendar app focused on note-taking during meetings. Since attending Y Combinator, the product has evolved quite a lot. It is now focused on managing the entire lifecycle of an event for busy people who manage a lot of (virtual) meetings.</p>
<p>First, Hera can help you schedule a meeting and get ready for a meeting. In just a few clicks, you can select multiple slots. Hera then generates a friendly text that you can copy and paste in an email thread, in a WhatsApp conversation or wherever you’re talking about your next meeting.</p>
<p>This is a much friendlier interface for the person receiving the message compared to traditional meeting scheduling tools. You don’t have to generate a link, and the person on the other end doesn’t have to click on a link to find out when this meeting could take place.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222585" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222585" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" class="size-full wp-image-2222585" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png 3016w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png?resize=1536,961 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png?resize=2048,1281 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222585" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hera</p></div></p>
<p>Second, Hera is going to pull context about your upcoming meetings. Chances are you already have a ton of info about people you’re meeting with. You send and receive emails, you may use a CRM and you may be meeting several times a year.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to become a project management platform, we’re going to integrate with tools that you already use,” co-founder and CEO Bruno Vegreville told me.</p>
<p>Hera lets you take some notes before the meeting so that you don’t forget about something. During the meeting, you can add more notes and then export this data to your favorite note-taking app, such as Notion.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222586" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222586" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png" alt="" width="1024" height="651" class="size-full wp-image-2222586" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png 3104w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png?resize=768,488 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png?resize=680,432 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png?resize=1536,977 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png?resize=2048,1302 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222586" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hera</p></div></p>
<p>Right now, Hera works best for users who want to take Google Calendar to the next level. Up next, the company wants to add some multiplayer components. For instance, you can imagine better scheduling if both people are currently using Hera. You could also imagine mentioning other Hera users directly in your calendar to get feedback on a meeting.</p>
<p>Hera has been in private beta for the past few months. The startup’s vision is quite clear. Some productivity tools, such as <a href="https://superhuman.com">Superhuman</a>, have made people more efficient when it comes to sorting threads and acting on incoming emails. If you consider meetings as threads, Hera could become the Superhuman of calendars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As scores of Indian startups populate their catalogs with live and recorded courses to reach and serve students in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, a handful of new-age firms are beginning to explore different approaches to tackle the challenge.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.teachmint.com">Teachmint</a>, one such startup that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/indian-edtech-teachmint-raises-20-million-to-expand-to-new-categories-and-geographies/">helping teachers and institutes create their own virtual classrooms</a> with a few taps on their smartphones and build direct relationship with students, has raised $78 million in its Series B financing round, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed.</p>
<p>Rocketship.vc and Vulcan Capital co-led the new round, the startup said on Monday. The new round values the 16-month-old Indian edtech firm at $500 million, according to two people familiar with the matter. (Teachmint has raised over $115 million to date.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223163" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Mihir Gupta, co-founder and chief executive of Teachmint, confirmed the size of the new funding round in a text message, but declined to comment on the valuation. Goodwater Capital and Epiq Capital as well as existing investors Learn Capital, CM Ventures, Lightspeed India and Better Capital also participated in the round, he said.</p>
<p>The new investment comes months after the startup was approached by one of the two Indian edtech giants that offered Teachmint a $400 million acquisition price, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Teachmint declined the offer. Gupta declined to comment.</p>
<p>The startup, which began its journey just weeks after the pandemic broke, is building what it calls the &#8220;ed-infra&#8221; for teachers in India to help them take online classes, engage with students virtually, assign them tasks, conduct attendance and also collect fees.</p>
<p>This approach is different from edtech giants such as Byju&#8217;s, Unacademy, and Vedantu, where teachers don&#8217;t have a direct relationship with their students.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And Teachmint&#8217;s model is working. The startup has amassed over 10 million users in the country, it said. It also offers its ed-infra service to institutes and said over 4,000 such institutions in India and overseas are using it.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s online education market with over 200 million school-going children. The market is estimated to generate $5 billion in revenue by 2025 (up from about $1 billion last year), according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since inception, we have been laser-focused on addressing the big technology-infrastructure gap that exists in education. Over the past 16 months, we have been humbled by the experience of powering the teaching and learning infrastructure for millions of teachers and students across India,&#8221; said Gupta.</p>
<p>&#8220;From supporting individual teachers to powering K-12 schools, coaching institutes, colleges, universities and even EdTechs, we are disrupting technology penetration in education at an unprecedented pace. We are thrilled to welcome onboard Rocketship.vc and Vulcan Capital along with Goodwater Capital and Epiq Capital. We are also grateful to have the continuous support of our existing investors as we execute our vision at the global stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup said it will deploy the fresh capital to hire talent across product, technology, and design roles and will soon offer its employees its biggest stock buyback option.</p>
<p>“Teachmint has addressed a latent technology problem in the education sector and are well positioned to scale their offering globally. Strong leadership combined with the passion and conviction to solve this, makes us a strong believer. We are glad to be on this rocket-ship,&#8221; said Madhu Shalini Iyer, Partner at Rocketship.vc, in a statement.</p>

Now a Berlin-based startup called <a href="https://www.billie.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Billie</a> that has built a similar service &#8212; but specifically targeting B2B transactions &#8212; is seeing a lift of its own boat from that rising tide. </span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The company has raised $100 million in a Series C round of funding, money that it will be using to continue building out the range of BNPL-type services that it provides to organizations buying goods to run their businesses, both in Europe and further afield after passing 100,000 customers earlier this year.</p>
<p>The round is a mark of just how popular BNPL has become as a concept in the payments stack, but also how much investors are looking to get in on the act: the funding is coming in at a $640 million valuation, the company has confirmed, growing nearly 4x since its last round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/16/billie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$35 million (€30 million) Series B in 2019</a>. Billie says that this is the largest round yet in the B2B BNPL space &#8212; which itself is also getting pretty crowded: competitors in this category including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/affirm-spinout-resolve-raises-60m-for-its-b2b-buy-now-pay-later-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resolve</a>, a spinout of Affirm; and <a href="https://shifter.no/nyheter/mytisk-vc-fond-gjor-sin-forste-norske-investering/214140" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tillit</a>, which is backed by Sequoia (which also backs Klarna).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223160" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What is also notable about Billie&#8217;s round is that it has a very interesting mix of financial and strategic investors. London&#8217;s D<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">awn Capital, a specialist in B2B startups, led the round, with internet giant Tencent and Klarna also participating; previous backers Creandum, Speedinvest, Picus and GFC are also in the round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Klarna&#8217;s investment comes on the back of a <a href="https://www.klarna.com/international/press/billie-and-klarna-launch-a-global-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major strategic deal</a> between it and Billie. As Matthias Knecht, co-founder and co-CEO of Billie, told TechCrunch, the two are integrating their services, and it will mean that in cases where Billie has a stronger payments relationship, but a consumer transaction arises, Klarna will handle the sale; and in cases where Klarna is present but Billie is not, and a business is doing the buying, Billie&#8217;s services will kick in. </span></p>
<p><span class="s3">Related to that, the company is also announcing hefty debt refinancing of $200 million <em>per month</em> (money to run the BNPL financing), coming from a consortium of German banks led by VVRB (Vereinigte Volksbank Raiffeisenbank eG), with Raisin Bank and Varengold Bank also participating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Billie has been around since 2016 and has actually been working in the concept of &#8220;BNPL&#8221; targeting businesses long before that became an established concept and term, as part of a bigger suite of products to service businesses and their incoming and outgoing payments needs. Its ambition was simple: since B2B transactions make up more than twice the volume of B2C transactions, there should be more tools for businesses &#8212; especially SMBs &#8212; to make those transactions as easy to handle as B2C ones. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Its other main product, in addition to the financing point-of-sale tool, is an invoicing service to help businesses collect money from others. (Indeed, it&#8217;s also the basis of its name, with Billie being a reference to &#8216;billing.&#8217;) Invoicing, Knecht tells me, is still a big part of its business with paying on invoice still a huge part (95% prefer it, he said) of how businesses want to pay for things. However, the bigger growth opportunity right now is BNPL, so for the moment it is doubling down on that with this investment. </span></p>
<p>A logical question might be why B2C giants in the BNPL space are not doing more B2B business directly. Knecht tells me that it comes down to very different data points and market dynamics when it comes to businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason the B2C players do not do B2B is because they see themselves as strong consumer brands,&#8221; Knecht said, pointing out how Klarna and others are increasingly raising their profile through their own apps a window for shoppers to discover and buy goods. &#8220;They are going away from solely being a payment method and towards a shopping experience for consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, he added, there are other reasons, too: business purchases are more complex than consumer ones, and ticket sizes are often 10 times more than the typical consumer transactions. He said the latter range from €60 to €100. (Note: Billie did not disclose updated figures how much it has financed to date, or customer numbers, but it notes <a href="https://www.billie.io/ueber-uns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on its site</a> that as of February 2021, it had worked with 100,000 businesses and financed €750 million in purchases by May 2021.)</p>
<p>And on top of this, the concept of &#8220;business&#8221; is also more complex: it can include a sole trader, a limited company, a school, a fire department, and so much more. This means completely different financing considerations at the BNPL end, and lots of different identity and other checks that need to be run.</p>
<p>While consumer services tend to get a lot more of the spotlight when it comes to e-commerce, B2B is not a small part of the bigger business opportunity. One <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273104/us-b2b-e-commerce-share/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimate</a> puts the percentage of B2B as between 14 percent (2020) and 17 percent (2023) of all e-commerce in the U.S., but that will work out to $1.7 trillion by the later date. Another estimate &#8212; the figures shift depending on what you are including in the category of B2B e-commerce, among other differences in calculation methodology &#8212; says that <a href="https://www.growglobal.com/global-e-commerce-b2b-e-commerce-5-times-bigger-than-b2c-e-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as of 2020 B2B was already five times as big as B2C</a>, working out to over $21 trillion in sales globally.</p>
<p>Over time, of course, you could see how consolidation is bound to come to the space. That makes a company like Billie a strong target for those payments giants &#8212; BNPL or otherwise &#8212; that might want to build out bigger platforms that integrate this function more tightly.</p>
<p><span class="s3">“As a specialist B2B investor with a deep fintech focus, we’ve been closely following Billie and the evolution of the B2B BNPL market. Over the last few years, we’ve built a trusted relationship with Matthias, Christian and Aiga, impressed by the clarity of their vision, rapid growth and deep experience not only in B2B payments but in the wider risk and regulatory landscape too. We are confident they are well on the way to revolutionising the B2B payments market and excited to join them on the journey ahead.” says Josh Bell, General Partner at Dawn Capital, in a statement. </span><span class="s4"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Knecht declined to comment on M&amp;A but described Klarna as a &#8220;close relationship.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://wefight.co">Wefight</a>, a French startup that has developed more than a dozen apps to help people suffering from chronic illness. Using a basic chatbot interface, people can ask questions and get answers about their illness.</p>
<p>The startup recently raised a $11.6 million (€10 million) funding round from Digital Health Ventures, Impact Partners, as well as existing investors Investir&amp;+ and BADGE’s business angels.</p>
<p>Wefight has developed a different app for each chronic illness. They’re all based on the same virtual assistant called Vik. There are currently more than a dozen apps about depression, asthma, multiple cancers, etc.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222510" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Essentially, Vik acts as an interface between the patient and Wefight’s content. The company has developed everything in-house, from natural-language processing technology to the framework that Wefight leverages to create new apps.</p>
<p>Every time a patient asks a question, the service tries to understand the meaning of the question and finds relevant information in the knowledge database.</p>
<p>It can then relay and serve content to the patient. Content has been written by professional pharmacists and tries to be as informative and neutral as possible. This way, you don’t necessarily have to wait for your next doctor’s appointment to go through your list of questions.</p>
<p>“Vik isn’t going to replace someone in the care pathway. It’s there to fill a gap,” co-founder and CEO Benoit Brouard told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And it seems like there’s a gap indeed. More than 400,000 people have tried the service so far. Vik has delivered 5 million answers. There are 70 people working for Wefight right now. Wefight tries to find new users by talking with patient organizations.</p>
<p>When it comes to the business model, Wefight works with pharmaceutical companies to finance new apps. Turning a treatment into a commercial success involves making sure that patients can identify the chronic illness they’re suffering from. And Vik acts as a top-of-the-funnel content provider.</p>
<p>“We reduce clinical inertia. When a lab decides to finance Vik Asthma, the lab doesn’t have any influence on the content that we create,” Brouard said. “Laboratories want patients who suffer from asthma to go and see a pulmonologist,” he added.</p>
<p>This way, the pool of patients who could potentially end up buying a specific drug is bigger. It’s a convoluted sales strategy for pharmaceutical companies. But something like Vik could improve the quality of life of patients.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand to other countries with a new office in Berlin. Every time Wefight launches an app in a new market, the company hires local health professionals and contact local patient organizations. It’s a long process, but that’s how Wefight can get it right for patients all around the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.justos.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a startup that says it will be the first insurance company in Brazil to use data when determining rates, has raised a $35.8 million Series A round of funding led by Ribbit Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank’s Latin American Fund and GGV participated as new investors, in addition to existing backers Kaszek, BigBets, Nubank CEO David Velez and Kavak CEO Carlos Garcia Ottati</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Justos had announced a $2.8 million seed raise that included participation from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kaszek, one of the largest and most active VC firms in Latin America, and the CEOs of several unicorns including Assaf Wand, CEO and co-founder of Hippo Insurance; Sergio Furio, founder and CEO of Creditas; Patrick Sigrist, founder of iFood and Fritz Lanman, CEO of ClassPass. Senior executives from Robinhood, Stripe, Wise, Carta and Capital One had also put money in the round.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222765" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serial entrepreneurs Dhaval Chadha, Jorge Soto Moreno and Antonio Molins co-founded Justos, having most recently worked at various Silicon Valley-based companies including ClassPass, Netflix and Airbnb. The trio, ironically none of whom are Brazilian, ​​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">met while playing soccer on an amateur team in San Francisco. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Justos has yet to officially launch its product and has already attracted such a large group of high-profile investors is notable. According to CEO Chadha, its launch is “imminent,” and the company already has 12,000 “leads” on its waitlist. So far, it has launched a driving test and quoting app and in advance of its formal launch, it has been collecting data from the driving test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process to get insurance in the country, by any accounts, is a slow one. It takes up to 72 hours to receive initial coverage and two weeks to receive the final insurance policy. Insurers also take their time in resolving claims related to car damages and loss due to accidents, the entrepreneurs say. They also charge that pricing is often not fair or transparent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos aims to improve the whole auto insurance process in Brazil by measuring the way people drive to help price their insurance policies. Similar to Root here in the U.S., Justos intends to collect users’ data through their mobile phones so that it can “more accurately and assertively price different types of risk.” This way, the startup claims it can offer plans that are up to 30% cheaper than traditional plans, and grant discounts each month, according to the driving patterns of the previous month of each customer. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We measure how safely people drive using the sensors on their cell phones,” Chadha told me at the time of the company’s last raise. “This allows us to offer cheaper insurance to users who drive well, thereby reducing biases that are inherent in the pricing models used by traditional insurance companies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos also plans to use artificial intelligence and computerized vision to analyze and process claims more quickly and machine learning for image analysis and to create bots that help accelerate claims processing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also has a social good component. The startup has agreed to support five nonprofit organizations in its first year: Instituto Ayrton Senna (education), AACD (disability), Gerando Falcões (economic opportunity), Casa 1 (LGBTQ) and Conexsus (sustainable development in the Amazon). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It intends to cap its profit so part of the amount that is not used to pay claims is donated to those institutions in its first year of operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Says the company: “The partnerships reinforce the insurtech&#8217;s disruptive vision, which, as its name suggests, aims to build a more transparent relationship with its customers and effectively contribute to improving society.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The insurtech plans to use its new capital to continue to hire, and expand its area of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">operations, as well as toward launching other lines of insurance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The startup has a team of 30 with the goal of having 50 employees by year&#8217;s end and 200 by the end of 2022.</span></p>
<p>Nick Shalek, general partner at Ribbit Capital, said his firm invested in Justos<span class="s1"> &#8220;because of the huge market opportunity and the caliber and technical prowess of the team.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">&#8220;With over 20 years of experience in Silicon Valley as entrepreneurs and at Netflix, Airbnb and ClassPass, we believe that the Justos team is well positioned to reinvent insurance in Latin America by focusing on creating customer value, lowering prices and expanding the market,&#8221; he wrote via e-mail.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the company has temporarily pulled back the latest version of the company&#8217;s Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software less than a day after its release.</p>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-2">&#8220;Seeing some issues with 10.3, so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452345284483235841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1452345284483235841%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F24%2F22743628%2Felon-musk-tesla-fsd-beta-10-3-rollback-issues-phantom-fcw">Musk tweeted on Sunday</a>. &#8220;Please note, this is to be expected with beta software. It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA (quality assurance), hence public beta.&#8221;</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-2">This news comes as Tesla is under fire from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">regulators questioning the safety</a> of its advanced driver assistance system that is branded &#8220;Autopilot&#8221; after several vehicles crashed into parked first responder vehicles while the system was engaged. Autopilot comes standard on Tesla vehicles. The so-called FSD software is an additional $10,000 and offers more automated driving features.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223109" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p data-testid="paragraph-2">However, Tesla vehicles are not self-driving. It is still an advanced driver assistance system, and drivers need to be fully attentive even when FSD is engaged. A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/mit-study-finds-tesla-drivers-become-inattentive-when-autopilot-is-activated/?tpcc=ECTW2020">recent MIT study</a> found drivers tend to be less attentive which can lead to safety risks.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-2">Version 10.3 was meant to be released to some Tesla owners on Friday, and on Saturday Musk said they would need to wait another day.</p>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-4">&#8220;Regression in some left turns at traffic lights found by internal QA in 10.3&#8221; he tweeted on Saturday. &#8220;Fix in work, probably releasing tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-4">Videos posted by beta users of the 10.3 software show multiple Forward Collision Warnings despite there being no immediate danger, and some vehicles even auto-braked without reason. Drivers also took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qeu10x/known_fsd_beta_103_taccautosteer_bug/">social media</a> to post issues including a disappearing Autosteer option, problems with traffic aware cruise control and Autopilot panic. Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452330803015335939">tweeted that the company is working on the issues with Autopilot and cruise control</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p data-testid="paragraph-4">Musk has not yet shared a possible release date for the next version of FSD.</p>
