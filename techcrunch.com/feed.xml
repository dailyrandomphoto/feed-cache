										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://blockset.com/">Blockset</a>, the blockchain infrastructure platform for enterprises by <a href="https://brd.com/">BRD</a>, announced early access to its Wallet-as-a-Service today. The white-label solution gives clients, like financial institutions, the ability to launch wallets that have the same features as BRD’s own mobile cryptocurrency wallet, which now has about 7 million users with over $20 billion assets under protection.</p>
<p>Blockset’s clients include some of the largest ATM networks and Japanese investment bank (and BRD investor) SBI Holdings, CoinFlip, Welthee, CoinSwitch, Coinsquare and Wyre. BRD’s other investors include Ripple and it has raised $56 million in funding so far.</p>
<p>One of Blockset’s selling points is access to real-time data about several kinds of cryptocurrencies. This not only allows users to see how their assets are performing, but also enables institutions to perform compliance tasks, fraud detection, anti-money laundering and other important services. Blockset also claims that its multi-chain API has up to 99.999% uptime.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The platform currently supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Tezos, Hedera, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV, and will add more chains based on customer demand.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cryptocurrency wallet BRD reaches 6 million users, driven by growth in Latin America and India&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/cryptocurrency-wallet-brd-reaches-6-million-users-driven-by-growth-in-latin-america-and-india/embed/#?secret=kaLQ30imAL" data-secret="kaLQ30imAL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Blockset already offered a white-label solution called WalletKit, before launching its current Wallet-as-a-Service with more features. BRD co-founder and CEO Adam Traidman compares its Wallet-as-a-Service to Google Maps, because both aggregate large amounts of constantly-changing data and can connect to other apps, while remaining user-friendly.</p>
<p>“The concept is really a result of learnings from working with our customers, tier one financial institutions, who need a couple things,” Traidman told TechCrunch. “Generally they want to custody crypto on behalf of their customers. For example, if you’re running an ETF, like a Bitcoin ETF, or if you’re offering customers buying and selling, you need a way to store the crypto, and you need a way to access the blockchain.”</p>
<p>“The Wallet-as-a-Service is the nomenclature we use to talk about the challenge that customers are facing, whereby blockchain is really complex,” he added. “There are three V’s that I talk about: variety, a lot of velocity because there’s a lot of transactions per second, and volume because there’s a lot of total aggregate data.”</p>
<p>Blockset also enables clients to add features like trading crypto or fiat or lending Bitcoin or Stablecoins to take advantage of high interest rates. Enterprises can develop and integrate their own solutions or work with Blockset’s partners.</p>
<p>Other companies that offer enterprise blockchain infrastructure include Bison Trails, which was recently acquired by Coinbase, and Galaxy Digital.</p>

<p>Blockset differentiates by focusing on real-time data. It looks at a smaller number of mainstream blockchains in order to ensure depth of information and speed.</p>
<p>“If you’re a financial institution, you can’t accept anything other than instant, accurate and highly-scalable kinds of data. Right down to the millisecond of latency is really important because it can give traders an advantage,” said Traidman.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Wyre chief executive officer Ioannis Giannaros said “Blockset is the clear industry leader in offering enterprise-grade SLAs [service-level agreements] that we require to guarantee high scalability, uptime and data integrity across multiple blockchains.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://upsie.com">Upsie</a>, a consumer warranty startup, has raised $18.2 million in a Series A round led by True Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing brings the total raised for the St. Paul, Minnesota-based startup to $25 million since its 2015 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large group of investors participated in the round, including Concrete Rose VC, Avanta Ventures, Kapor Capital, Samsung Next, Massive, Backstage Capital, Awesome People Ventures, Draft Ventures, Matchstick Ventures, M25, Silicon Valley Bank and Uncommon VC, among others. A number of angels also put money in the round. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clarence Bethea (pictured below) founded Upsie after realizing the significant markup that retailers were placing on warranties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His goal was to focus not on the retailer, but rather the end user and making the process more transparent, more affordable and simpler. For example, Upsie claims that it saves its customers anywhere from 50% to 90% compared to competitor warranty plans. Most other companies in the space, such as SquareTrade, offer warranties at the point of sale via retailers.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151362" style="width: 293px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151362" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2151362" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PD5_1834-e1620852150189.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="283" height="424" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151362" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Upsie</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve walked into a Best Buy or a Target, and when you&#8217;re checking out somebody at the register is offering you a warranty. But what most customers don&#8217;t know is that you&#8217;re paying as much as 900% more for that warranty than you should,” Bethea said. “There&#8217;s no transparency at the register and you never get to ask what&#8217;s covered and what&#8217;s not covered, or what should you do if you need to make a claim.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like many other companies, Upsie saw a bump in business last year thanks to the COVID-pandemic and resulting increase in consumer electronics sales (17%, according to the NPD Group Retail Tracking Service). In particular, there was a </span><a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/12/25/shortages-laptops-pc-high-demand-last-till-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spike in demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for laptops, desktops and tablets for distance learning and remote work. As a result, Upsie’s revenue surged by 2.5x over the past 12 months, although Bethea declined to reveal hard revenue figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With people working from home, devices were no longer a luxury but a necessity,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than at the point of sale, Upsie gives consumers an opportunity to purchase a warranty for a product via its website or mobile app after the transaction has taken place. The company offers protection for thousands of devices &#8212; from smartphones to appliances to gaming consoles to lawn and garden tools &#8212; or about 60% of the warranty market, according to Bethea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers have up to 120 days to purchase smartphone protection, 11 months to purchase appliance, TV and fitness equipment protection and up to 60 days for other consumer electronics. All warranty information, including a copy of the product receipt, is stored and accessible on demand. Upsie says it also aims to offer same-day repairs on many devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process, according to Bethea, is straightforward. Consumers need only upload an image of their receipt and provide purchase price and serial/IMEA numbers. When they need to file a claim, it’s a matter of pressing a button. And to make the process even easier, it will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">give consumers the ability to say, take their items directly to the Apple store for repair, and then get reimbursed afterwards by Upsie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want more people to be able to protect what they buy with their hard-earned money,” Bethea said. “Removing the worry around paying out of pocket to repair, say, your kid’s laptop is huge for families who have had to go with remote learning when the system doesn’t make this easy for everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upsie plans to use its new capital to increase customer awareness and continue building out its warranty product offerings and verticals, as well as to double its current headcount of 15.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to continue to grow our presence online through digital channels such as Facebook and Google, for one thing,” Bethea told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puneet Agarwal, partner at True Ventures, says his firm doubled down on its investment in Upsie after witnessing its solid growth over the years. (True Ventures led the startup’s $5 million seed round in April of 2019.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True Ventures was initially attracted to the sheer size of the warranty industry (estimated at $100 billion globally) and “how broken it was from the consumer experience perspective.” The firm also viewed Bethea as a “very special entrepreneur” who “exudes authenticity,” which must be refreshing to VCs who get inundated with pitches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We love to invest in old, staid industries where companies can disrupt from a business model and product perspective,” Agarwal said. “Upsie has done that in a big way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to describe Bethea’s move to go direct to consumer in the warranty space as “bold.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Upsie is the only one doing that, and it’s the biggest swing to take in this type of industry,” Agarwal said. “We believe he’s cracked the code and that’s why we doubled down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bethea’s background is not the same as a “typical” startup founder, which also was viewed as an advantage by True Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He came from the streets of Atlanta, Georgia, and had to overcome so much in his life,” Agarwal told TechCrunch. “Clarence is the type of person that when we started True, we wanted to fund. We admire his perseverance and grit to come to this point.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Internet of Things just got bigger. Four years after Ford Motor Company introduced an integration with Amazon’s suite of smart home devices, the automaker is beefing up its in-vehicle software offerings with built-in Alexa voice assistant and a wireless software update ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ford&#8217;s over-the-air software updates, which it has branded Power-Up, will have the capability of updating &#8220;virtually all&#8221; of the computer modules in new Ford vehicles, not just the ones that focus on infotainment, the company said in a statement Thursday. Ford estimates that Power-Up will be able to update more than 110 computer modules on higher-end models. The automaker aims to manufacture 33 million vehicles equipped with this service and Alexa by 2028.</p>

<div class="p-rich_text_block" dir="auto">
<div class="p-rich_text_section">Ford is clearly hoping shareholders and customers see the integration as a sign that the company can be a tech-forward automaker. One company executive in a media briefing Tuesday even referred to Ford as a “technology company.&#8221;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>“We believe that data is the new oil, since it&#8217;s essential to our electric future and enables us to have an always-on relationship with our customer,” Alex Purdy, head of Ford’s business operations for enterprise connectivity, said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That &#8216;data is the new oil&#8217; line is nothing new. Former Intel CEO Brian Krzanich made that very <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/krzanich-the-future-of-automated-driving/#gs.0oa5q8">declaration back in 2016</a>. New or not, data is seen as an increasingly valuable resource to automakers.</p>
<p>Purdy said the new software may reduce the need for repair trips and free up dealers to focus on more profitable services, like hardware repairs and maintenance. Many of the software updates will require little to no action from the driver, and they can schedule those updates that require a system reboot.</p>
<p>Using the built-in Alexa assistant, drivers will be able to use voice control to start or stop their engine, lock or unlock doors, defrost their windows, make a call or play music. Customers who have Alexa smart home devices will be able to connect the two systems so that they can, for example, turn on the lights in their home from their driveways. Ford aims to build Alexa software into 700,000 vehicles across the U.S. and Canada this year, though the company did not discuss rollouts in other countries.</p>
<p>Gone are the days of the customer survey – the new software ecosystem will give Ford data on how vehicle owners use their cars. “We can double down on the features people love, get rid of the ones people don’t,” Purdy said. Ford is giving all drivers complimentary access to Alexa for three years, suggesting that the automaker will likely receive mountains of very valuable information on the behavior of its customers from its use.</p>
<p>Ford and Amazon will work together on new features and commercial services for the next six years. It will be delivered via a Power-Up software update this fall beginning with F-150, Mach-E, Bronco, Edge, and Super Duty customers. The company will “work its way through” the remaining models until it’s available in Ford’s entire fleet of new vehicles, though Purdy acknowledged it will take many years to reach that goal.</p>
<p>The Power-Up system will also deliver BlueCruise, Ford’s Level 2 hands-free highway driving technology, though customers must purchase this upgrade. Drivers will be able to activate the technology on prequalified sections of divided highway. In the future Ford said it hopes to add more highway sections, lane change assist, and predictive speed assist that will adjust speed for road curves and other driving situations, similar to Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot.</p>
<p>Ford in February also announced a separate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/ford-vehicles-will-be-powered-by-googles-android-operating-system/">six year partnership with Google</a> to bring Android apps and services to drivers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TiMi Studios, one of the world&#8217;s most lucrative game makers and is part of Tencent&#8217;s gargantuan digital entertainment empire, said Thursday that it has struck a strategic partnership with Xbox.</p>
<p>The succinct <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/l1tw3BcKm2VTsUkKkulzxw">announcement</a> did not mention whether the tie-up is for content development or Xbox&#8217;s console distribution in China but said more details will be unveiled for the &#8220;deep partnership&#8221; by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Established in 2008 within Tencent, TiMi is behind popular mobile titles such as Honor of Kings and Call of Duty Mobile. In 2020, Honor of Kings alone generated close to $2.5 billion in player spending, according to market research company <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pubg-mobile-tops-billion-dollar-mobile-games-2020">SensorTower</a>. In all, TiMi pocketed $10 billion in revenue last year, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tencent-videogames-exclusive-idUSKBN2BP0FG">report</a> from Reuters citing people with knowledge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The partnership could help TiMi build a name globally by converting its mobile titles into console plays for Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox. TiMi has been trying to strengthen its own brand and distinguish itself from other Tencent gaming clusters, such as its internal rival LightSpeed &amp; Quantum Studio, which is known for PUBG Mobile.</p>
<p>TiMi operates a branch in Los Angeles and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/19/china-roundup-wechat-paywall-tencent-us-game-studio/">said</a> in January 2020 that it planned to &#8220;triple&#8221; its headcount in North America, adding that building high-budget, high-quality AAA mobile games was core to its global strategy. There are clues in a <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/353527484">recruitment notice</a> posted recently by a TiMi employee: The unit is hiring developers for an upcoming AAA title that is benchmarked against the Oasis, a massively multiplayer online game that evolves into a virtual society in the fiction and film Ready Player One. Oasis is played via a virtual reality headset.</p>
<p>Xbox&#8217;s latest Series X and Series S are to debut in China <a href="https://weibo.com/5203472552/KfhIEANCR?from=page_1006065203472552_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime">imminently</a>, though the launch doesn&#8217;t appear to be linked to the Tencent deal. Sony&#8217;s Playstation 5 just hit the shelves in China in late April. Nintendo Switch distributes in China through a partnership with Tencent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/nintendo-switch-china-tencent/">sealed in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Chinese console players often resort to grey markets for foreign editions because the list of Chinese titles approved by local authorities is tiny compared to what&#8217;s available outside the country. But these grey markets, both online and offline, are susceptible to ongoing clampdown. Most recently in March, product listings by multiple top sellers of imported console games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/console-game-china-pulled-ecommerce/">vanished from Alibaba&#8217;s Taobao marketplace</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX private spaceflight ambitions got a big boost in 2018 when Japanese entrepreneur and billionaire Yusaku Maezawa announced he&#8217;d be taking a trip aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon on a round-trip flight passing the Moon. Maezawa is still <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spacexs-first-paying-moon-flight-customer-wants-to-give-away-eight-seats-aboard-his-spaceship/">on track to make that trip by 2023 according to current schedules</a>, but he&#8217;s so eager to get to space that he just announced he&#8217;ll make a visit to the International Space Station as a private astronaut this December.</p>
<p>Maezawa will go as a client of Space Adventures, on a Russian Soyuz rocket set to take off from Kazakhstan on December 8, and he&#8217;ll be accompanied by his production assistant Yozo Hirano. Space Adventures is the same company behind prior Soyuz commercial spaceflight missions, including the trip made by Anousheh Ansari in 2006 and Guy Laliberté in 2009, among others. Laliberté&#8217;s trip was the most recent, with space tourism at the station officially on hold since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011 since Soyuz has been the only means to access the ISS. Now that SpaceX is flying regular astronaut shuttle missions, however, tourist trips are back on.</p>

<p>The trip that Maezawa plans to take will take place over the course of 12 days, and he&#8217;ll be doing three months of training prior to the mission in Russia to get ready for the experience. In addition to being the first private astronaut visit to the ISS in over 10 years, this is also the first time that two private astronauts will fly on board the same Soyuz at the same time. Maezawa and Hirano will also be the first Japanese citizens to make the journey as private individuals.</p>
<p>It may seem like overkill to get to visit space twice in a lifetime as a private astronaut, but Maezawa says he&#8217;s driven by a curiosity of &#8220;what&#8217;s life like in space?&#8221; which will of course be useful information to have on the planned Moon mission, which will spend three days getting there, make a loop around our natural satellite, and then spend three days coming back. He&#8217;s also planning to post the experience to YouTube, which is why Hirano is accompanying him to document.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has been fined just over €100 million (~$123M) by Italy&#8217;s antitrust watchdog for abuse of a dominant market position.</p>
<p>The case relates to Android Auto, a modified version of Google&#8217;s mobile OS intended for in-car use, and specifically to how Google restricted access to the platform to an electric car charging app, called JuicePass, made by energy company Enel X Italia.</p>
<p>Android Auto lets motorists directly access a selection of relevant apps (like maps and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/google-opens-android-automotive-os-to-spotify-other-media-app-developers/">music streaming services</a>) via a dash-mounted screen. But Enel X Italia&#8217;s JuicePass app was not one of the third party apps Google granted access to.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The app is accessible via the smartphone version of the Android platform &#8212; but of course a driver shouldn&#8217;t be reaching for their phone when at the wheel. So barring access through Android Auto puts a significant blocker on relevant usage.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s market restriction of JuicePass has drawn the attention &#8212; and now the ire &#8212; of Italy&#8217;s competition watchdog.</p>
<p>The AGCM said today that Google has violated Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union &#8212; and has ordered it to make the JuicePass available via the platform.</p>
<p>It also says Google must to provide the same interoperability with Android Auto to other third party app developers.</p>
<p>The authority points out that the Google Maps app, which offers some basic services for electric vehicle charging (such as finding and getting directions to charging points), is available via Android Auto &#8212; and could, in future, incorporate directly competitive features like payments.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the Authority&#8217;s findings, Google did not allow Enel X Italia to develop a version of its JuicePass app compatible with Android Auto, a specific Android feature that allows apps to be used while the user is driving in compliance with safety, as well as distraction reduction, requirements,&#8221; the AGCM writes in a <a href="https://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2021/5/A529">press release</a> announcing the sanction [translated to English using Google Translate]. &#8220;JuicePass enables a wide range of services for recharging electric vehicles, ranging from finding a charging station to managing the charging session and reserving a place at the station; this latter function guarantees the actual availability of the infrastructure once the user reaches it.</p>
<p>&#8220;By refusing Enel X Italia interoperability with Android Auto, Google has unfairly limited the possibilities for end users to avail themselves of the Enel X Italia app when driving and recharging an electric vehicle. Google has consequently favored its own Google Maps app, which runs on Android Auto and enables functional services for electric vehicle charging, currently limited to finding and getting directions to reach charging points, but which in the future could include other functionalities such as reservation and payment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google denies any wrongdoing and says it disagrees with the order. But it did not confirm whether or not it intends to appeal.</p>
<p>The tech giant claims the restrictions it places on apps&#8217; access to Android Auto are necessary to ensure drivers are not distracted. It also told us that it has been opening up the platform to more apps over time &#8212; with &#8220;thousands&#8221; now compatible.</p>
<p>It added that its intention is to keep expanding availability.</p>
<p>Google did not comment on why Enel X Italia&#8217;s app for recharging electric vehicles was not among the &#8220;thousands&#8221; it has already granted access to, however.</p>
<p>Per the AGCM, Enel X Italia&#8217;s app has been excluded from Android Auto for more than two years.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Google&#8217;s statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The number one priority for Android Auto is to ensure apps can be used safely while driving. That&#8217;s why we have strict guidelines on the types of apps which are currently supported and these are based on driver-distraction tests and regulatory and industry standards. Thousands of applications are already compatible with Android Auto, and our goal is to allow even more developers to make their apps available over time. For example, we have<span class="m_6987432655142616341apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/01/expanding-reach-of-your-android-auto.html__;!!FMox2LFwyA!6fsrPNDbZJJw2gEAwD5drOQWTvklgqAMBjuPxPgw88as7l9m8umHKiJUSYwkp36M-BE$" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/01/expanding-reach-of-your-android-auto.html__;!!FMox2LFwyA!6fsrPNDbZJJw2gEAwD5drOQWTvklgqAMBjuPxPgw88as7l9m8umHKiJUSYwkp36M-BE$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620980647999000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5KPJq0jI4xF2VwPqj5T6oUncy5g">introduced templates</a><span class="m_6987432655142616341apple-converted-space"> </span>for navigation, charging, and parking apps, open for any developer to use. We disagree with the Authority&#8217;s decision and we will review our options.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Google has a dominant position in the market via the Android smartphone platform, with a marketshare in Italy of around three-quarters according to the competition watchdog.</p>
<p>Under European Union law, a finding of market dominance in one market puts a responsibility on a company not to restrict competition in any other markets where it operates &#8212; and the EU already found Google to be a dominant company in general Internet search in every market in the European Economic Area back in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/MEMO_17_1785">2017</a>.</p>
<p>The AGCM said it&#8217;s concerned about the impact of Google&#8217;s restrictions on app access to Android Auto on the growth of the electric mobility market.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it were to continue, [it] could permanently jeopardise Enel X Italia&#8217;s chances of building a solid user base at a time of significant growth in sales of electric vehicles,&#8221; it wrote, adding that Google&#8217;s action in excluding the JuicePass app meant it did not appear in the list of applications used by users &#8212; thereby reducing consumer choice and creating a barrier to innovation.</p>
<p>The authority suggests Google&#8217;s conduct could influence the development of electric mobility during a crucial phase &#8212; as recharging infrastructures for electric cars are being built out and can help fuel growth and demand for recharging services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consequently, possible negative effects could occur to the diffusion of electric vehicles, to the use of &#8216;clean&#8217; energy and to the transition towards a more environmentally sustainable mobility,&#8221; it warned, linking anti-competitive behavior to negative consequences for the environment.</p>
<p>The AGCM added that it will monitor Google&#8217;s compliance with its order to ensure it effectively and correctly implements the obligations to provide third party app developers with access to Android Auto.</p>
<p>The authority&#8217;s action could be a taster of what&#8217;s coming down the pipe for gatekeeper players like Google in Europe under the incoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA).</p>
<p>The flagship legislative proposal is intended to supplement ex post competition law enforcement with ex ante rules on how dominant platforms which intermediate others&#8217; market access can behave &#8212; including by imposing up front requirements that they support interoperability.</p>
<p>The idea with the DMA is to supplement the slow and painstaking work needed to bring competition investigations to fruition with proactive measures slapped on tech giants to prevent certain types of known market abuse in the first place. Although the regulation is likely years out from being adopted and applied across the EU.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile competition probes of big tech continue.</p>
<p>Italy&#8217;s AGCM opened one into Google&#8217;s ad display business <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/googles-display-advertising-business-is-under-antitrust-probe-in-italy/">last October</a>, for example.</p>
<p>Google has already faced a number of EU antitrust decision in recent years &#8212; including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">$5BN penalty over how it operates Android</a>. Although search rivals <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/googles-eu-android-choice-screen-isnt-working-say-search-rivals-calling-for-a-joint-process-to-devise-a-fair-remedy/">continue to complain</a> that the remedy Google devised for that 2018 decision still does not sum to fair competition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nano Technologies, a startup that lets workers in Vietnam access their earned wages immediately through <a href="https://www.vuiapp.vn/">an app called VUI</a>, has raised $3 million in seed funding. The oversubscribed round was led by returning investors Golden Gate Ventures and Venturra Discovery, and included participation from FEBE Ventures, Openspace Ventures and Goodwater Capital.</p>
<p>Nano recently <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/nano-technologies">took part in Y Combinator’s accelerator program</a>. Golden Gate Ventures and Venturra Discovery both participated in its pre-seed funding. The startup was founded at the beginning of 2020 by Dzung Dang, formerly a general manager at Uber and chief executive officer of ZaloPay, and Thang Nguyen, who previously served as chief technology officer at Focal Labs and SeeSpace.</p>
<p>VUI launched six months ago, and now serves more than 20,000 employees from companies like GS25, LanChi Mart and Annam Gourmet. Nano Technologies claims that about 50% to 60% of employees sign up for VUI as soon as their employers offer it, and use the service about three times every month to withdraw their earned wages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Disrupting the paycheck, Gusto’s Flexible Pay allows employees to pick when they get paid&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/gusto-flexible-pay/embed/#?secret=WjoqYP4M2I" data-secret="WjoqYP4M2I" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nano’s earned wage access features can be used by employers of all sizes, in all sectors, to offer flexible pay to their employees, but its focus is currently on retail, food and beverage, and manufacturing, especially for textiles, garments and shoes. The startup says companies in these sectors have seen recruitment costs increase, while worker retention drops. This is in part because many people are opting for gig economy jobs, like ride-sharing, where their earning are automatically deposited into their digital wallets or bank accounts.</p>
<p>Nano usually fronts wage advances, and then is paid back back by employers on their paydays through payroll deduction. Employers who have higher liquidity can also front wages through their own balance sheets. VUI is usually offered by employers as a benefit, and they can opt to cover fees, have their workers pay fees or use a co-pay model.</p>

<p>Nano is among a crop of companies across the world that offer earned wage access, meant to help companies retain workers by letting them withdraw earnings whenever they want, instead of waiting until payday. In Southeast Asia, this also includes GajiGesa in Indonesia. In the rest of the world, other companies that offer similar services include Square, London-based Wagestream and Gusto). Nano’s plan is to continue focusing on Vietnam, and develop new products for employers, including tools for managing staff and engagement.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Chi Phan, the CEO of LanChi Mart, a subsidiary of Central Retail with about 2,000 employees, said “On-demand salary via VUI is an obvious idea and practical HR initiative that LanChi team is pleased to roll out to our employees as a new voluntary benefit. VUI provides a much-needed financial lifeline from LanChi to our employees, keeping the employee morale up during the COVID-19 pandemic and reducing attrition rites post-Tet.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Only four months after securing Series B fundraising of $310 million, Chinese autonomous driving company WeRide says it has achieved its Series C funding round that brings its post-money valuation to $3 billion.</p>
<p>This is first time the company has disclosed its value. The company did not share how much it has raised this round, only noting that it&#8217;s in the &#8220;hundreds of millions,&#8221; according to a statement released by the company. WeRide intends to use this funding round to invest in R&amp;D and commercialization as it works towards the next-generation of Level 4 driving, a term that means a vehicle can drive without human intervention in some environments and conditions. The company is also using the funds to prepare to commercialize its technology.</p>
<p>WeRide has scored a slew of large investments over the past year, including its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/weride-200-million-funding/">$200 million strategic round</a> in December from Chinese bus maker Yutong. The speed and scale of these investments signals that the company is burning through money and hungry for more, and that investors are banking on China&#8217;s tech. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/momenta-500-million-fundraise/">Rival Momenta has also received large sums this year</a>, exceeding its $1 billion in valuation with recent investments of $500 million and total funding of more than $700 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;WeRide Master Platform (WMP), our core autonomous driving technology solution has helped to accelerate the company’s development,&#8221; Tony Han, founder and CEO of WeRide, said in a statement. &#8220;This drives the successful operation of our Robotaxi service in Guangzhou since 2019 and the introduction of the WeRide driverless Mini Robobus, a completely new product category to the autonomous industry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>WeRide&#8217;s robotaxi pilot in Guangzhou began in 2019, but it began conducting test drives in the city&#8217;s Central Business District in January. Not long after, the company&#8217;s driverless Mini Robobus began road testing in Guangzhou and Nanjing. WeRide became the first autonomous driving company in China to secure an official license for online car-hailing operations in February, and in April, the California DMV issued <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/chinese-autonomous-vehicle-startup-weride-scores-permit-to-test-driverless-cars-in-san-jose/">WeRide a permit to test its driverless vehicles</a> on public roads in San Jose, California.</p>
<p>Many investors participated in this most recent round, including <span style="font-weight: 400;">IDG Capital, Homeric Capital, CoStone Capital, Cypress Star, Sky9 Capital and K3 Ventures, as well as existing investors CMC Capital Partners, Qiming Venture Partners and Alpview Capital.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla CEO and self-dubbed Technoking is back-peddling on the company&#8217;s stance about bitcoin and has suspended purchases of its electric vehicles with the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The change of stance, which was delivered via tweet, comes just weeks after Tesla CFO and dubbed &#8220;Master of Coin&#8221; Zach Kirkhorn said the company believes in the longevity of bitcoin, despite its volatility. The tweet from Musk sent the price of bitcoin down more than 4% (and falling). The price of bitcoin is down more than 7% for the day, although some of that decrease occurred prior to Musk&#8217;s tweet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at a great cost to the environment.</p>
<p>Tesla will not be selling any Bitcoin and we intend to use it for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy. We are also looking at other cryptocurrencies that use &lt;1% of Bitcoin&#8217;s energy/transaction.</p></blockquote>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Tesla invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin this quarter and then trimmed its position by 10%, Kirkhorn said during the company&#8217;s quarterly earnings call in April. That sale made a $101 million &#8220;positive impact&#8221; to the company&#8217;s profitability in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Kirkhorn said Tesla turned to bitcoin as a place to store cash and still access it immediately, all while providing a better return on investment than more traditional central bank-backed safe havens. Of course, the higher yields provided by the volatile digital currency comes with higher risk.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re getting whiplash from this announcement, you&#8217;re not alone. Tesla originally announced in March that it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/elon-musk-declares-you-can-now-buy-a-tesla-with-bitcoin-in-the-u-s/">accept bitcoin as a form of payment</a> in the United States. But Elon Musk, the Technoking of Tesla, is known for drastically affecting the crypto market with just a mere tweeting of his thumbs. Every time the man tweets an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/28/dogecoin-price-surges-after-tweets-from-elon-musk-and-mark-cuban.html">image of a Shiba Inu</a>, the joke coin called Dogecoin sores in the stocks.</p>
<p>In anticipation for Musk&#8217;s appearance on Saturday Night Live, many anticipated that the coin would reach $1, but when the &#8220;Dogefather&#8221; admitted (as a joke) to the currency <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/08/dogecoin-price-plummets-as-elon-musk-hosts-saturday-night-live-.html">being a hustle</a>, the price of the coin crashed 30%.</p>
<h2>Energy sucker</h2>
<p>When it first became public that Tesla had purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, investors, analysts and money managers at some of the country&#8217;s largest banks noted that it presented risks for the company. Others noted it could damage its reputation.</p>

<p>Bitcoin functions using what is known as a “Proof of Work” consensus, which means the network relies on mining to continue operating. The bulk of bitcoin mining is conducted in Russia and China. Until the energy grid decarbonizes, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/teslas-bitcoin-investment-could-be-bad-for-the-companys-climate-reputation-and-its-bottom-line/">TechCrunch noted back in February,</a> mining bitcoin will remain a dirty business, though plenty of mining operations today do use renewable energies, in part. One investor told TechCrunch that the cost per transaction from an energy intensity standpoint has only gotten more intense.</p>
<p>Musk hinted that other cryptocurrencies are on the table. Those will likely be ones that use “Proof of Stake” consensus mechanisms, which networks like Ethereum have committed to transition to due to their energy efficiencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vitalik Buterin donated cryptocurrencies worth $1.5 billion to several non-profit organizations, including $1 billion to a COVID-19 relief fund in India, on Wednesday in one of the largest-ever individual philanthropy efforts.</p>
<p>Or at least that was the worth of the cryptocurrencies &#8212; many of which are dog-themed &#8212; when he made the donation.</p>
<p>Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb65bcbb85c1633b0ab4e4886c3cd8eeaeb63edbb39cacdb9223fdcf4454fd2c7">transferred</a> 500 ETH and over 50 trillion SHIB (Shiba Inu), a meme coin, worth around $1.14 billion at the time of transaction, to the <a href="https://cryptorelief.in">India COVID-Crypto Relief Fund</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The transaction prompted a panic among some investors, contributing to <a href="https://nomics.com/assets/shib-shiba-inu">over 35% drop in SHIB’s price</a> on Wednesday &#8212; and its value <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/">continues to fluctuate</a>.</p>
<p>SHIB, named after Shiba Inu, and Dogelon Mars (ELON), another meme currency Buterin donated on Wednesday, are alternative cryptocurrencies that have exploded in popularity in recent months. SHIB is a joke on Dogecoin, which itself was created as a joke.</p>
<p>SHIB has successfully courted retail investors in China and other markets following recent surges in the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. It has managed to garner billions (USD) worth of investment in recent days before Wednesday&#8217;s crash.</p>

(CoinMarketCap)</p></div></p>
<p>The causes Buterin is supporting are no joke, and the volatility of the meme coins could result in less liquid money for the relief fund.</p>
<p>Buterin’s offloading of several dog-themed meme coins &#8212; which were sent to him without his consent in the first place &#8212; comes at a time when India is grappling with a surge in the coronavirus infections.</p>
<p>Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of crypto organization Polygon and who put together the Indian relief fund, late Wednesday <a href="https://twitter.com/sandeepnailwal/status/1392562768692252673">assured</a> people that he won’t do anything that hurts “any community specially the retail community involved with SHIB.”</p>
<p>The relief fund, which has so far used the prior donation funds to send oxygen cylinders and other medical supplies to Indian hospitals, said it plans to do a &#8220;thoughtful liquidation&#8221; to meet its goals. &#8220;We have decided to convert the donation slowly over a period of time,&#8221; the official Twitter page of the fund <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoRelief_/status/1392559057764962304">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Buterin, who became the youngest crypto billionaire at the age of 27 earlier this month, also <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdab7634a04e3b7afb0d5a9faf9db59a05a04372234c0c960342102a4859aca16">transferred</a> Ethereum and Dogelon Mars (ELON) worth $336 million to Methuselah Foundation, a nonprofit that supports efforts in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine therapies; and over 13,000 ETH to Givewell, a nonprofit organization that works to curate the best charities around the world. Buterin also donated to Gitcoin Community, MIRI and Charter Cities Institute.</p>

<p>India has been reporting over 350,000 daily infections and over 3,500 fatalities for the last two weeks. The second wave of the coronavirus has overwhelmed the South Asian nation’s healthcare system, leaving countless people to scramble for hospital beds, medical oxygen and other supplies.</p>
<p>A number of entrepreneurs including Balaji Srinivasan have donated to the India Crypto Relief Fund, which <a href="https://cryptorelief.in/transparency">maintains a log of all the donations</a>. Buterin himself had donated about $600,000 in ether and maker tokens to the fund last month.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>By now everyone is familiar with the tech world’s talent crunch: Developers are scarce and expensive, while data scientists are maybe even scarcer and expensiver. Some folks I’ve spoken to think that rising acceptance of remote work may help reduce the supply-demand imbalance. Hell, every early-stage startup I’ve spoken to in weeks is remote-first. Many were born during COVID, but they all love the ability to hire anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>But if a more distributed workforce is not enough to lower the pain that many companies feel when it comes to attracting and then <em>retaining</em> technical talent, good news could be coming. The sibling product philosophies of no-code and low-code are not only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dont-hate-on-low-code-and-no-code/">attracting lots of venture attention</a>, public companies that dabble with either are posting interesting results.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Perhaps the solution to needing lots more code is no code at all? &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<p>Today’s TechCrunch Top 3 come from the three phases of startup life: Early stage, when startups are still getting their product and market in order. Late stage, when they are prepping for an eventual exit. And the exit stage, when a former startup is looking to spread its wings and fly the private markets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/brazils-divibank-raises-millions-to-become-the-clearbanc-of-latam/">The anti-venture movement is global</a>:</strong> Today <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann</a></strong> reported that <strong>Divibank</strong>, a Brazilian startup offering revenue-based financing to other startups, has raised $3.6 million in a seed round led by Better Tomorrow Ventures (BTV). TechCrunch thinks it could build something akin to the <strong>Clearbanc</strong> of Latin America.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-fashion-portal-lyst-raises-85m-in-a-pre-ipo-round-reportedly-at-a-500m-valuation/"><strong>London’s Lyst looks to list</strong></a><strong>:</strong> When you raise a pre-IPO round, you’d best be heading toward the public markets. With fashion e-commerce app <strong>Lyst</strong> saying that its new $85 million funding round is pre-IPO money, well, we have big expectations.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">Bird hopes to take flight</a>:</strong> Bird is going public via a SPAC. TechCrunch has the big news <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-to-go-public-via-spac-at-an-implied-value-of-2-3b/">here</a></strong>, and a more dorky financial analysis <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">here</a></strong>. I helped write the latter. The short version is that a business-model shakeup is helping the scooter unicorn lose less money over time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>Scootin’ into startup mode, TechCrunch covered a huge number of funding rounds in the last 24 hours, so what follows is a sampling of the most interesting. Enjoy!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/argentinas-pomelo-raises-9m-to-build-a-new-payments-infrastructure-for-latam-fintechs/">Pomelo raises $9M to build a payments infrastructure for LatAm fintechs</a>:</strong> Building fintech infrastructure is a huge global task, so it’s not a surprise to see companies at work on the problem raising money. In this case, Pomelo is $9 million richer to tackle what might be the most interesting fintech market in the world.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/collective-a-back-office-for-the-self-employed-raises-20m-from-ashton-kutchers-vc/">Collective, a back-office platform for the self-employed, raises $20M from Ashton Kutcher’s VC</a>:</strong> Going indie is not easy, despite what the Substack hype might have you believe. So, Collective is betting that it can make bank off of helping folks run their own microcompany. Both the company and the investment are a wager on the creator economy.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/stampli-raises-50-million-in-series-c-to-help-companies-intelligently-manage-invoices/"><strong>Stampli raises $50 million in Series C to help companies intelligently manage</strong> <strong>invoices</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The Stampli round stood out because it was more capital in a single investment than the startup had raised during all of its previous life &#8212; by around 50%. So, something is going on at the corporate-invoice optimization software shop that has investor attention.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/planck-the-insurance-data-analytics-platform-raises-20m-growth-round/"><strong>Planck, the insurance data analytics platform, raises $20M growth round</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Two of the three Planck co-founders are bald, so I had no choice but to include my follicle-deficient brethren in today’s newsletter. Jokes aside, Planck collects data that it sells to commercial insurance companies. And now it has fresh capital from 3L Capital, Greenfield Partners, Team8, Viola Fintech, Arbor Ventures and Eight Roads to help it grow.</li>
</ul>
<h2>For unicorns, how much does the route to going public really matter?</h2>
<p>Natasha Mascarenhas and Alex Wilhelm recently hosted Yext CFO Steve Cakebread and Latch CFO Garth Mitchell on an episode of TechCrunch&#8217;s Equity podcast.</p>
<p>In their discussion, &#8220;The morality and efficacy of going public earlier,&#8221; the group discussed the myriad paths startups are taking to go public and assessed the pros and cons of each method, and, importantly, the potential impacts on employees and business operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think when money’s chasing money, you don’t want to be the last guy holding the money. You want to be the chase,&#8221; said Cakebread.</p>
<p>Since Latch is currently going public via a SPAC and Yext followed a traditional IPO route a few years ago, the discussion is heavily weighted toward experience, not opinion.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Turning to tech’s largest companies today, we have three things for you to chew on:</p>
<p>First, Waymo is losing key talent in a very public fashion. <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">Kirsten</a> reports that “Waymo’s chief financial officer Ger Dwyer and its head of automotive partnerships and corporate development Adam Frost,” both long-time execs, are “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/waymos-cfo-and-head-of-automotive-partnerships-are-leaving-the-autonomous-vehicle-company/?tpcc=ECTW2020">leaving this month</a>.” The exits come after the company’s former CEO also departed.</p>
<p>I guess we’ll have to drive ourselves for a bit longer.</p>
<p>Next up is a story that came out yesterday, but we missed in the newsletter. But after burning up the TechCrunch analytics all day, I decided to make sure that you saw it. With the simply excellent headline <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/">Prime today, gone tomorrow: Chinese products get pulled from Amazon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ritacyliao">Rita</a> writes that several Chinese retailers have evaporated from the online megastore. “In total, the suspended accounts contribute over a billion dollars in gross merchandise value (GMV) to Amazon,” she reported.</p>
<p>Changes afoot at Amazon? We’ll have to see, but the news is driving mega-attention from, we presume, confused shoppers.</p>
<p>Finally, looping back to no-code for a hot second, Salesforce is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/salesforce-is-bringing-drag-and-drop-interactive-components-to-its-low-code-toolkit/">only adding to its own efforts</a>. It’s everywhere!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toast has a reported valuation over $5 billion and has raised more than $900 million since launch. The restaurant POS service has clearly been on a rapid growth trajectory, but how has the company navigated the market during the pandemic, which has pushed and pulled the restaurant industry unlike ever before?</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-bessemer-and-toast">Extra Crunch Live (May 26 at 3pm ET</a>), we&#8217;ll find out. We&#8217;re sitting down with president and co-founder of Toast, Aman Narang, and one of the company&#8217;s investors, Bessemer Venture Partners&#8217; Kent Bennett.</p>
<p>Bennett is a partner out of the Cambridge office, focusing on consumer products and services as well as consumer-facing software. Before venture, Bennett was a creative executive for an entertainment production company called Licht Entertainment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>His portfolio includes Bevi, Blue Apron, Xtime and, of course, Toast.</p>
<p>Narang spent seven years at Oracle, then Endeca, working on the development of the company&#8217;s business intelligence platform and mobile commerce platform.</p>
<p>He co-founded Toast in 2011 and has been growing the company ever since, adding new products and features to the restaurant POS system.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Narang and Bennett to learn about how they came together for the company&#8217;s Series B deal, which Bessemer led. We&#8217;ll also talk about why Bennett wanted to bet on Toast, how they&#8217;ve worked together since and how they overcome challenges and disagreements. If we&#8217;re lucky, we may even get a peek at Toast&#8217;s original Series B pitch deck.</p>

<p>From there, we&#8217;ll head into the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off. Members of the audience can raise their hand to pitch live on the show, and Bennett and Narang will offer their feedback. It&#8217;s always a good time, but the only way to participate is to show up live. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-bessemer-and-toast">Register here for free!</a></p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is a free event and accessible to everyone, but only Extra Crunch members get access to the entire library of ECL episodes, all of which are packed with insights on how to raise and run a successful venture-backed company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1yV1CeEwY48?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Usually we wait a few days until a show has settled. While we stall, our producer and director Tina Chase Gillmor scours the recording for short clips that give a sense of the flavor and tenor of the conversation. This show, recorded a little more than 2 weeks ago, went deep on politics, government, anything but Trump, and eventually a pivot to the tech world and how it was grappling with the possible return to the office. I asked Brent Leary what he thought about the likelihood of working from anywhere, and discovered he was multitasking to the director&#8217;s cut of a famous Prince video.</p>
<p>Brian Solis had sent him this re-edit of George Harrison&#8217;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist, featuring a wonderful version of his classic White Album track While My Guitar Gently Weeps. An all-star cast of friends of the late Beatle included Tom Petty, Steve Winwood, Jeff Lynne, and a surprise guitar solo by Prince that ended with him tossing his guitar to the heavens in triumph. While the new video doesn&#8217;t reveal what happened to the instrument, it does extend our views of Prince and particularly his interactions with the other players. Re-released 17 years later, it does the impossible, preserving the magic of the event while somehow extending the mechanics of how Prince captivated not just his audience but his peers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It also reminds me of what magic we&#8217;ve come to expect from the technology industry and its band of stars. The success of the vaccines came not just from the miracle of new science and desperate nature of humanity&#8217;s need for rescue from the pandemic, but also from the growing hope that government and even politics can work. The jury has been and will continue to be out on how quickly we can recover, but there&#8217;s a question of recovering what. Is it a binary choice of office or mobile or something in between? Already some tech companies have moved toward the hybrid approach, where the office would reopen and workers would return for some but not all of the week.</p>
<p>As a parent of two girls, I&#8217;ve watched with fascination as they grew up with technology as a given not the revolution that it is. Our youngest has for many years structured her communication with us and her peers as a text-based, emotional video channel, and occasional authorization for face-to-face interaction. The pandemic made this mandatory, but as we get closer to a safer environment, the skills we&#8217;ve been mandated to learn are only going to solidify. Texting can be replied to in a while or treated as just information to be absorbed. Voice calls are optional, Facetime usually accepted as an opportunity to catch up but certainly not a daily proposition. Sneaking a peek at her Instagram feed is good for calming nerves but abstract in terms of any real details. That&#8217;s as it should be; I actually need more emotional buttressing than she does.</p>
<p>Prince was like that when he appeared early in his career, conversant in the history of his craft and matter-of-fact in his approach to the technology innovations unleashed by George Martin and the Beatles with Revolver and transformationally Sgt.Pepper. Prince took that studio process, the multitracking inventions of Stevie Wonder, the extra-worldly funk explorations of Hendrix, the cool mastery of Miles — and did it all. The record business pushed him, he pushed back, changed his name to a symbol, and eventually won control of his recordings. Nothing compares 2 U, he wrote.</p>
<p>The music business, like the movie and TV business, has changed everything about how we consume their products. Musicians have been homebound for more than a year with no way of touring to replace what used to be the major part of their income. Some are turning to the crazy world of packaging their work as crypto objects, the so-called non fungible tokens. Joke projects like Dogecoin have become intertwined with Saturday Night Live as Elon Musk plays a character in Weekend Update avoiding persistent questions about just what is going on here. As one Tweeter noted, they made a good choice watching Dogecoin dropping like a stone as funnier than the comedy broadcast.</p>
<p>Sooner or later the dust will settle and we can choose some Sneak Peeks to nudge the way forward. As much as we buy the idea that we need to return to some kind of normal, the sneaking suspicion is that we deserve some relief from the rigged deck that is our politics, our culture, devoid of empathy and based on power as the ultimate rationale for who can run the show. Like the filters in Zoom that let us change our backgrounds to where we choose to be coming from, it&#8217;s a reasonable choice to define our new office as a blend of the best of our new worlds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-saas-boost-released-as-open-source/">announced today</a> that it&#8217;s releasing a tool called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/saas-boost/">AWS SaaS Boost</a> as open source distributed under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a>. The tool, which was first announced at the AWS re:Invent conference last year, is designed to help companies transform their on-prem software into cloud-based software as a service.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-saas-boost/blob/main/CHARTER.md">the charter for the software</a>, the company describes its mission this way: &#8220;Our mission is to create a community-driven suite of extensible building blocks for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) builders. Our goal is to foster an open environment for developing and sharing reusable code that accelerates the ability to deliver and operate multi-tenant SaaS solutions on AWS.&#8221;</p>
<p>What it effectively does is provide the tools to turn the application into one that lets you sign up users and let them use the app in a multi-tenant cloud context. Even though it&#8217;s open source, it is designed to get you to move your application into the AWS system where you can access a number of AWS services such as AWS CloudFormation, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Amazon Route 53, Elastic Load Balancing, AWS Lambda (Amazon&#8217;s serverless tool), and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon&#8217;s Kubernetes Service). Although presumably you could use alternative services, if you were so inclined.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MongoDB switches up its open-source license&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/mongodb-switches-up-its-open-source-license/embed/#?secret=MGRYpPq23t" data-secret="MGRYpPq23t" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>By making it open source, it gives companies that would need this kind of service access to the source code, giving them a comfort level and an ability to contribute to the project to expand upon the base product and give back to the community. That makes it a win for users who get flexibility and the benefit of a community behind the tool, and a win for AWS, which gets that community working on the tool to improve and enhance it over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our objective with AWS SaaS Boost is to get great quality software based on years of experience in the hands of as many developers and companies as possible. Because SaaS Boost is open source software, anyone can help improve it. Through a community of builders, our hope is to develop features faster, integrate with a wide range of SaaS software, and to provide a high quality solution for our customers regardless of company size or location,&#8221; Amazon&#8217;s Adrian De Luca wrote <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-saas-boost-released-as-open-source/">in a blog post</a> announcing the intent to open source SaaS Boost.</p>
<p>This announcement comes just a couple of weeks after the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/amazon-announces-its-open-sourcing-deep-racer-device-software/">open-sourced its Deep Racer device software</a>, which runs its machine-learning fueled mini race cars. That said, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/aws-gives-open-source-the-middle-finger/">has had a complex relationship</a> with the open source in the past couple of years, where companies like MongoDB, Elastic and CockroachDB have altered their open-source licenses to prevent Amazon from making their own hosted versions of these software packages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://www.gasbuddy.com/">GasBuddy</a> mobile app, which typically helps consumers find the cheapest gas nearby, has now become the No. 1 app on the U.S. App Store for the first time ever, due to the fuel shortages in the U.S. that followed the cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline. Americans, fearful that gas would become unavailable, began panic-buying in ways that haven&#8217;t been seen since the great <a href="https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/2020/05/coronavirus-toilet-paper-shortage/">toilet paper outage of 2020</a>. As a result,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/12/business/energy-environment/gas-shortage.html"> thousands of gas stations</a> ran out of fuel entirely. This dramatic situation has greatly benefitted the GasBuddy app, which includes a crowdsourced feature that helps users locate which local stations still have gas for sale.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday afternoon, GasBuddy says the effects of the Colonial Pipeline shutdown are being felt<a href="https://www.gasbuddy.com/go/colonial-pipeline-shutdown-fuel-outages-by-state"> across 11 U.S. states</a>, largely in the Southeast and Washington, D.C. North Carolina had the highest number of gas stations with fuel outages, with 65% of stations reportedly out of gas as of 2:48 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Kentucky has the lowest at only 2%. Because this <a href="https://www.gasbuddy.com/go/colonial-pipeline-shutdown-fuel-outages-by-state">data</a> is self-reported by GasBuddy users, it may not represent the most current information, we should note.</p>

<p>During the week, consumers have been turning to GasBuddy to help them find where they can fill up. Yesterday, the app hit No. 1 in the &#8220;Travel&#8221; category on the App Store, while it steadily climbed its way up the App Store&#8217;s Top Overall charts.</p>
<p>This afternoon, GasBuddy became both the No.1 app in the non-games category as well as the highest-ranked app Overall across the U.S. App Store.</p>
<p>According to data from app store intelligence firm Apptopia, GasBuddy yesterday saw 15,203 new downloads &#8212; a 59% increase from its average daily downloads, which were 9,560 for the past 30 days. However, third-party data isn&#8217;t always accurate for sudden shots in rank &#8212; it catches up a few days after the fact.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151326" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151326" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2151326" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AdKQPr8e.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="329" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AdKQPr8e.jpg 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AdKQPr8e.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AdKQPr8e.jpg?resize=300,145 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AdKQPr8e.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151326" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apptopia</p></div></p>
<p>Reached for comment, GasBuddy says its downloads were actually far higher than the third-party estimates. Across all platforms, including both iOS and Google Play, it saw 20x more downloads yesterday compared with an average day in 2021. The company told TechCrunch it counted 313,001 total downloads yesterday, compared with average daily downloads for the previous 30 days of 15,339.</p>
<p>Broken down by platform, GasBuddy says it saw 104,735 downloads on Android and 208,266 downloads on iOS on Tuesday, May 11, 2021.</p>
<p>Apptopia also noted that GasBuddy hadn&#8217;t been the No. 1 app on the App Store in all the time it&#8217;s been recording app store rankings, which goes back to January 1, 2015. However, it noted the app itself launched back in 2010, making it possible (though not likely) that the app had reached No. 1 at some point.</p>
<p>GasBuddy confirmed that&#8217;s not the case. Today is the first time it has ever topped the App Store, though it got close once before when it reached No. 2 behind a walkie-talkie app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/as-irma-nears-florida-governor-tells-residents-to-use-gas-buddy-expedia-google-maps-more/">during Hurricane Irma in September 2017.</a></p>

<p>Consumers can continue to track statewide fuel outages <a href="https://www.gasbuddy.com/go/colonial-pipeline-shutdown-fuel-outages-by-state">here on GasBuddy&#8217;s website</a> as well as <a href="https://fuelinsights.gasbuddy.com/">where highest prices are being found</a>. In the app, they can report whether gas stations have gas or diesel, as well as current prices.</p>
<p>The Colonial Pipeline, which runs 5,500 miles from the Gulf to the Northeast, shut down on Friday due to a ransomware attack from a criminal hacking network known as DarkSide, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-denies-involvement-colonial-pipeline-cyberattack-2021-05-11/">which is suspected to be</a> based in Russia or Eastern Europe. The pipeline delivers <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-hacking-government-and-politics-technology-business-b2a867c0705acd953c90d6e2a58fabb9">about 45%</a> of fuel used by the Eastern Seaboard. Reports of the shutdown sent Americans to stock up on gas, worsening the situation further. The U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the Colonial Pipeline <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/energy-secretary-colonial-pipeline-restored_n_609ad7a0e4b099ba752f7675">intends to restore operations</a> by the end of the week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo&#8217;s chief financial officer Ger Dwyer and its head of automotive partnerships and corporate development Adam Frost — two longtime executives at the autonomous vehicle company — are leaving this month, departures that comes amid some executive shuffling following CEO John Krafcik&#8217;s exit earlier this year.</p>
<p>Dwyer and Frost&#8217;s departure was shared internally this week, according to multiple sources. Waymo has confirmed to TechCrunch that Dwyer and Frost are leaving.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re grateful to Ger and Adam for all they’ve done for Waymo and wish them all the best,&#8221; a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. &#8220;An executive search is underway for a new CFO to lead us into our next chapter as we continue to build, deploy and commercialize the Waymo Driver.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dwyer, who reported directly to parent company Alphabet&#8217;s executive leadership finance team, is among several executives who have left the company in the past five months. Krafcik <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/04/capstone-of-my-career-email-from-john.html">announced in April</a> that he was stepping down as CEO. Chief Safety Officer Deborah Hersman left in December and Tim Willis, who was head of manufacturing and global supply and general manager of Waymo&#8217;s Laser Bear lidar business, departed in February. Sherry House, who had been at Waymo since 2017 and was most recently treasurer and head of investor relations, left the company in April. She is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/lucid-motors-taps-waymo-intel-veterans-ahead-of-public-listing/">CFO at Lucid Motors</a>.</p>
<p>Still, some of the critical leaders, and the people directly below them, have remained. Tekedra Mawakana, who was COO, and Dmitri Dolgov, the CTO, are now co-CEOs of Waymo and appear to have the support of Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, according to brief remarks he made during the company&#8217;s first-quarter earnings call. Department heads directly below Mawakana and Dolgov are still at Waymo with a few exceptions, according to LinkedIn profiles. In March, both David Twohig, who was director of Future Automotive at Waymo, and Qi Hommes, who was once head of system safety, left. Hommes is now director of system safety engineering and analysis at Zoox, according to LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Dwyer&#8217;s departure also comes at a time when the demand for CFOs has rocketed alongside the continuous string of public offerings, including those done via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies. House&#8217;s move to Lucid Motors, which is going public via a merger with a SPAC, is one example.</p>
<p>Dwyer is a longtime Google employee, who started at the company in 2006. He made the leap in August 2016 over to Waymo, just a few months before the former Google self-driving project officially announced it had spun out to become a business under parent company Alphabet.</p>
<p>During his tenure, Dwyer oversaw the financial side of the business in a period of explosive growth that took the company from a few hundred employees to more than 2,000 today.</p>
<p>Frost, who headed up automotive partnerships, has also been an important figure at Waymo. He came to Google&#8217;s self-driving project in 2013 after nearly 17 years at Ford Motor Co., according to LinkedIn records. He was initially hired as a chief engineer and then rose through the ranks to chief automotive programs and partnerships officer and eventually chief automotive and corporate development officer. Waymo has locked in a number of what it has described as exclusive partnerships with automakers over the past several years, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/waymo-volvo-partner-to-develop-electric-robotaxis/">including Volvo</a>, Stellantis (formerly FCA), as well as one with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/waymo-takes-its-self-driving-car-ambitions-global-in-partnership-with-renault-nissan/">Renault and Nissan</a> to research how commercial autonomous vehicles might work for passengers and packages in France and Japan.</p>
<p>Waymo also expanded its geographic footprint beyond California during both Dwyer and Frost&#8217;s stints. The company brought its autonomous vehicles into cities like Austin and Kirkland, Washington for testing and established operations in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler, where it now operates a ride-hailing service called Waymo One using driverless vehicles as well as those with safety operators behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Last year, Waymo completed its first external round of fundraising, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/waymo-brings-in-2-25-billion-from-outside-investors-alphabet/">initially $2.25 billion</a> and later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/waymo-expands-first-external-investment-round-to-3-billion/">expanded to $3 billion</a>. The $2.25 billion round was led by Silver Lake with investments from Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Mubadala Investment Company, Magna, Andreessen Horowitz and AutoNation and its parent company Alphabet. The extended capital came from new investors, including those managed by T. Rowe Price, Perry Creek Capital, Fidelity Management and Research Company and others.</p>
<p>The external raise followed a flurry of activity that suggested Waymo was ramping up its commercial enterprise, including expanding its core fleet in Mountain View, Calif., the Phoenix area and into Texas. Waymo also began to move beyond its robotaxi testing and began piloting new business applications for its autonomous vehicle technology such as delivery and trucking and even a plan to start selling its custom lidar sensors to companies in the robotics, security and agricultural technology industries.</p>
<p>It has also made numerous partners and at least one acquisition under Dwyer&#8217;s watch. Waymo acquired in December 2019 a U.K. company called Latent Logic that spun out of Oxford University&#8217;s computer science department. The company uses a form of machine learning called imitation learning that could beef up Waymo&#8217;s simulation efforts. The acquisition marked the launch of Waymo&#8217;s first European engineering hub in Oxford, U.K.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Video sharing social network TikTok has removed more than 500,000 accounts in Italy following an intervention by the country&#8217;s data protection watchdog <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/tiktok-has-until-friday-to-respond-to-italys-order-to-block-users-it-cant-age-verify-after-girls-death/">earlier this year</a> ordering it to recheck the age of all Italian users and block access to any under the age of 13.</p>
<p>Between February 9 and April 21 more than 12.5M Italian users were asked to confirm that they are over 13 years old, according to the regulator.</p>
<p>Online age verification remains a hard problem and it&#8217;s not clear how many of the removed accounts definitively belonged to under 13s. The regulator <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9584923">said</a> today that TikTok removed over 500k users because they were &#8220;likely&#8221; to be under the age of 16; around 400,000 because they declared an age under 13 and 140,000 through what the DPA describes as &#8220;a combination of moderation and reporting tools&#8221; implemented within the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TikTok has also agreed to take a series of additional measures to strengthen its ability to detect and block underage users &#8212; including potentially developing AI tools to help it identify when children are using the service.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, TikTok sent us a statement confirming that it is trialling &#8220;additional measures to help ensure that only users aged 13 or over are able to use TikTok&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the statement, which TikTok attributed to Alexandra Evans, its head of child safety in Europe:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;TikTok&#8217;s top priority is protecting the privacy and safety of our users, and in particular our younger users. Following continued engagement with the Garante, we will be trialling additional measures to help ensure that only users aged 13 or over are able to use TikTok.</p>
<p>&#8220;We already take industry-leading steps to promote youth safety on TikTok such as setting accounts to private by default for users aged under 16 and enabling parents to link their account to their teen&#8217;s through Family Pairing. There is no finish line when it comes to safety, and we continue to evaluate and improve our policies, processes and systems, and consult with external experts.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Italy&#8217;s data protection regulator made an emergency intervention in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/tiktok-has-until-friday-to-respond-to-italys-order-to-block-users-it-cant-age-verify-after-girls-death/">January</a> &#8212; ordering TikTok to recheck the age of all users and block any users whose age it could not verify. The action followed reports in local media about a 10-year-old girl from Palermo who died of asphyxiation after participating in a “blackout challenge” on the social network.</p>

<p>Among the beefed up measures TikTok has agreed to take is a commitment to act faster to remove underage users &#8212; with the Italian DPA saying the platform has guaranteed it will cancel reported accounts it verifies as belonging to under 13s within 48 hours.</p>
<p>The regulator said TikTok has also committed to &#8220;study and develop&#8221; solutions &#8212; which may include the use of artificial intelligence &#8212; to &#8220;minimize the risk of children under 13 using the service&#8221;.</p>
<p>TikTok has also agree to launch ad campaigns, both in app and through radio and newspapers in Italy, to raise awareness about safe use of the platform and get the message out that it is not suitable for under-13s &#8212; including targeting this messaging in a language and format that&#8217;s likely to engage underage minors themselves.</p>
<p>The social network has also agreed to share information with the regulator relating to the effectiveness of the various experimental measures &#8212; to work with the regulator to identify the best ways of keeping underage users off the service.</p>
<p>The DPA said it will continue to monitor TikTok&#8217;s compliance with its commitments.</p>
<p>Prior to the Garante&#8217;s action, TikTok&#8217;s age verification checks had been widely criticized as trivially easier for kids to circumvent &#8212; with children merely needing to input a false birth date that suggested they are older than 13 to circumvent the age gate and access the service.</p>
<p>A wider investigation that the DPA opened into TikTok&#8217;s handling and processing of children&#8217;s data last year remains ongoing.</p>
<p>The regulator announced it had begun proceedings against the platform in December 2020, following months of investigation, saying then that it believed TikTok was not complying with EU data protection rules which set stringent requirements for processing children&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9249681">January</a> the Garante also called for the European Data Protection Board to set up an EU taskforce to investigate concerns about the risks of children&#8217;s use of the platform &#8212; highlighting similar concerns being raised by other agencies in Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tiktok-hit-with-consumer-child-safety-and-privacy-complaints-in-europe/">February</a> the European consumer rights organization, BEUC, also filed a series of complaints against TikTok, including in relation to its handling of kids&#8217; data.</p>
<p>Earlier this year TikTok announced plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/tiktok-calls-in-outside-help-with-content-moderation-in-europe/">bring in outside experts in the region</a> to help with content moderation and said it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/tiktok-to-open-a-transparency-center-in-europe-to-take-content-and-security-questions/">open a &#8216;transparency&#8217; center in Europe</a> where outside experts could get information on its content, security and privacy policies.</p>

You won’t know unless you apply, and time is running out. You have only 48 hours left to throw your helmet into the ring.</p>
<p>If you want to compete for glory, global exposure and $100,000 in equity-free prize money, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">apply to Startup Battlefield here</a> before <strong>May 13 at 11:59 p.m. (PT).</strong></p>
<p>Not familiar with Startup Battlefield? It has launched 922 companies — including the likes of Dropbox, Vurb, Mint and a bunch more — that have collectively raised $9.5 billion and produced 117 exits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We can tell you what it’s like to compete in Startup Battlefield and about the benefits and opportunities that come from it. But Stacey Hronowski — co-founder and CEO of Canix, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2020-is-canix/#:~:text=Canix,-Lucas%20Matney%40lucasmtny&amp;text=We%20started%20this%20competition%20with,arena%2C%20we%20have%20a%20winner.">winner of Startup Battlefield at Disrupt 2020</a> — describes it best.</p>
<p>“Our experience in Startup Battlefield was excellent. The rigorous training was specific and tailored to our individual business and presentation. I was particularly impressed with the Q&amp;A training. I&#8217;ve fundraised numerous times and the practice questions were some of the most insightful and specific questions I&#8217;ve faced. I feel extremely well prepared for future fundraises.</p>
<p>&#8220;Post Startup Battlefield, we received significant press coverage and reach outs from notable investors. The experience was one of the most special of my life; I never thought I&#8217;d get the chance to share the story of Canix with investors and media across the globe.”</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My startup is in big-time hiring mode. All of our employees are currently working remotely and will likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future — even after the pandemic ends. We are considering individuals who are living outside of the U.S. for a few of the positions we are looking to fill. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Does it make sense to sponsor them for a visa to work remotely from somewhere in the United States?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Selective in Silicon Valley</strong></p>
<p>Dear Selective,</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out &#8212; I’m always happy to hear about another fast-growing startup! If some of your leadership team is also abroad, check out the recent announcement about the new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/dear-sophie-how-does-the-international-entrepreneur-parole-program-work/">International Entrepreneur Parole program for founders</a>.</p>
<p>It can make great business sense to sponsor international talent for a visa even if the position involves working remotely from a location inside the U.S. With the right legal setup, your team can work from home in Silicon Valley, nearby in California, or in another state where the cost of living is not quite as high. We’ve received this question from many employers, and many of our clients are proceeding with sponsoring international talent with visas and green cards for work-from-home positions.</p>
<p>I discussed this and other issues related to recruiting and work trends with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-lampert-56859389/">Katie Lampert</a> for my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/070-talent-acquisition-for-startups-with-katie-lampert/">podcast</a>. Lampert leads the talent acquisition and infrastructure group at <a href="https://www.generalcatalyst.com/">General Catalyst</a>, a VC firm that invests in seed to growth-stage startups in the U.S. and abroad. She advises companies in the General Catalyst portfolio on all things talent-related, including establishing company culture, creating a company’s infrastructure for recruiting and retaining talent, and planning for the future.</p>
<p>“Recruiting is going to be more global, which is exciting,” Lampert said during our discussion. “This will have a really positive effect on cultural diversity in the workforce. Studies show that a more diverse workforce leads to greater financial success.”</p>
<p>In fact, the latest McKinsey &amp; Co. report on diversity, “<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters">Diversity wins: How inclusion matters</a>,” found that companies with ethnically and culturally diverse executive teams are 36% more likely to achieve above-average profitability than companies with less diverse teams. McKinsey has issued three reports on diversity, and with each subsequent report, the business case for ethnic and cultural diversity and gender diversity in corporate leadership has grown stronger.</p>
<p>In addition to boosting profitability, bringing international talent to the United States to join your startup offers a host of other benefits as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the famous phrase goes, &#8220;software is eating the world&#8221; &#8212; and now software is eating dentistry. Or, perhaps more accurately, the arena of orthodontics — the specialty of dentistry that deals with things like braces — is slowly but surely being digitalized.</p>
<p>To whit, <a href="https://smile2impress.com/">Impress</a>, a Southern European player in direct-to-consumer orthodontics, has raised a $50 million Series A funding round led by CareCapital (a dental division of Hillhouse Capital in Asia), along with Nickleby Capital, UNIQA Ventures and investors including Michael Linse, Valentin Pitarque, Peter Schiff, Elliot Dornbusch and others. All existing shareholders, such as TA Ventures and Bynd VC, also participated.</p>
<p>Impress is an homage to the direct-to-consumer startups in this area in the U.S., such as SmileDirect, and now plans to scale across Europe from its existing bases in Spain, Italy, Portugal, the U.K. and France.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was founded in 2019 in Barcelona by orthodontist Dr. Khaled Kasem and serial entrepreneurs Diliara and Vladimir Lupenko.</p>
<p>Speaking from Barcelona, Lupenko told me that the idea was to “combine the best orthodontic tradition with the most innovative technology in the sector.”</p>

<p>As things stand, most of the time, consumers can usually only access cosmetic teeth alignment treatments or orthodontic medical treatments in conventional clinics. The new wave of clinics employs 3D scans and panoramic X-rays to check nerve and bone health.</p>
<p>Impress’s model is to offer these high-quality medical treatments directly to consumers, by developing its own chain of orthodontic clinics, which also put an emphasis on design and a &#8220;modern&#8221; patient experience, it says.</p>
<p>As Diliara Lupenko says: “We didn’t copy what other companies in the space were doing and approached the market from a different angle from the get-go. We doubled down on the doctor-led digital model which brought us way better conversion rates and treatment quality even though on paper it looked complex in the beginning. It&#8217;s still very complex but we were able to crack it and scale exponentially.”</p>
<p>Impress now has 75 clinics in Spain, Italy, the U.K., France and Portugal, which optimize costs and automate key parts of the value chain.</p>
<p>It now says it&#8217;s approaching €50 million in annual run-rate and is projected to grow to €150 million of revenue in 12 months.</p>
<p>Andreas Nemeth, managing partner of UNIQA Ventures GmbH commented: “Impress&#8217;s customer-centric focus, as well as its demonstrated ability to blitzscale, attracted us to the business. Vladimir and his team leverage technology to create a seamless customer journey for invisible orthodontics and optimized their cost structure in a unique way using software.”</p>
