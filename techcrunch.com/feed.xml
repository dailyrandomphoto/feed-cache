										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holidays, TikTok is expanding its footprint in the living room. The company earlier this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/tiktok-is-coming-to-amazon-fire-tv-in-the-u-s-and-canada/">launched</a> its TV app in North America in partnership with Amazon Fire TV. Today, TikTok is <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-tv">rolling out</a> its TV app to more TV platforms across North America, including Google TV and other Android TV OS devices, and select LG Smart TVs, and Samsung Smart TVs.</p>
<p>The TikTok TV app redesigns the popular short-form video app for the big screen.</p>
<p>Like its mobile counterpart, the app offers access to both a user&#8217;s &#8220;For You&#8221; and &#8220;Following&#8221; feeds, when logged in, as well as a &#8220;Discover&#8221; page featuring some of the most popular content across the service, including in categories like comedy, gaming, food, travel, sports, and animals, among others. But unlike on mobile, where users have to swipe vertically to navigate through the available videos, TikTok TV includes an AutoPlay feature that serves up a continuous feed without interruptions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237820" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To accommodate vertical videos on the wider TV screen, the app displays a dimmer version of the video in the background to make the experience more visually interesting, instead of just using black bars to fill in the screen space.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237848" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237848" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2237848" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tiktok-tv-app.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tiktok-tv-app.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tiktok-tv-app.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tiktok-tv-app.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tiktok-tv-app.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tiktok-tv-app.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tiktok-tv-app.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tiktok-tv-app.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237848" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>Before today, the company <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-on-google-tv-and-android-tv-is-here">had offered</a> a TikTok TV app for Google TV and Android TV in the U.K., France, and Germany, but had yet to bring that version of the app to users in U.S. and Canada. In addition, TikTok had launched its TV app on Samsung TVs in the U.K. last year. Samsung said<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/samsung-tiktok-app-for-smart-tvs-coming-soon-to-the-us/"> it would roll out the app</a> to most of its 2021 smart TVs in the U.S. sometime this year.</p>
<p>TikTok also now says the new TV app will accommodate 2018-2021 LG Smart TVs models running webOS 4.0 through webOS 6.0.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The expansion may put TikTok in more direct competition with rival YouTube for consumers&#8217; attention.</p>
<p>Today, Google&#8217;s video app already has a strong presence in the living room, where now <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/watch-youtube-on-tv/">more than 100 million U.S. users</a> watch YouTube and YouTube TV on their big screens. In addition, third-party <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/more-than-half-of-us-youtube-viewers-watch-on-ctv-device">research from eMarketer</a> found that over half of U.S. YouTube viewers, or 113.1 million people, now watch through a connected TV device, as of a report issued in October 2021.</p>
<p>However, many of those users may not be tuning into short-form content. The company last year <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/more-than-half-of-us-youtube-viewers-watch-on-ctv-device">said</a> watch time of YouTube content over 30 minutes long increased by over 90% in a 12-month period. That could point to TV viewers&#8217; interest in longer-form video content compared with mobile users. With plans for its TV app underway, this may also have been a factor in TikTok&#8217;s decision to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiktok-expands-max-video-length-to-3-minutes-up-from-60-seconds/">expand its maximum video length</a> to 3 minutes earlier this year.</p>
<p>TikTok, in its announcement, touted that it has <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/1-billion-people-on-tiktok">over a billion monthly users</a> &#8212; but of course, that includes many markets that don&#8217;t yet have access to the TikTok TV app.</p>
<p>The new TV app will be rolling out starting today to supported platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies increasingly move to take advantage of machine learning to run their business more efficiently, the fact is that it takes an abundance of energy to build, test and run models in production. <a href="http://Neu.ro">Neu.ro</a>, an early stage full-stack MLOps solution is building a greener approach.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a zero emissions AI cloud solution in conjunction with Finnish cloud infrastructure partner <a href="http://atnorth.com">atNorth</a>.</p>
<p>The company says that atNorth is providing a Tier 3, ISO 27001-certified data center, running  NVIDIA A100-powered DGX and HGX systems. The data center offers 80MW of power capacity, which runs entirely on geothermal and hydro energy. What&#8217;s more, due to its location near the arctic, it provides essentially free cooling, giving neu.ro an energy-efficient solution for customers to build machine learning models using its solution.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237807" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Company co-founder Max Prasolov says that they found after researching the problem, that computing and telecommunications is taking around 9 percent of total energy consumption worldwide, a number their research suggests could double in the next decade. They believe that machine learning model building will be a growing part of that, and they decided to team with atNorth to reduce their own carbon emissions footprint.</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided just to move all our operations and all our experiments to the zero emission cloud. And the goal is not to be carbon neutral because we [know that we could] buy credits and compensate for [our usage]. The question is how to [achieve] zero emissions? We [realized] we spent so much energy and so much computing power to train our models for clients, and we understand that is definitely the biggest carbon footprint we [are producing],&#8221; Praslov said.</p>
<p>While the company was at it, it came up with a way through its software solution to build models in a more efficient way, which in turn, reduces the amount of energy needed and enables the company to deliver an even more sustainable solution.</p>
<p>In terms of the product itself, the company is offering a flexible, cloud native service where they provide some of the tooling, but leave enough room for companies to fill in with the pieces they think work best for them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The way that we approach it is instead of trying to build every single tool that needs to be built from data ingestion to monitoring to explainability to building pipeline engines, etc., we&#8217;re all about interoperability. We build what hasn&#8217;t been built, and we connect to the universe of Kubernetes-based tools that are already out there,&#8221; company co-founder Arthur McCallum explained.</p>
<p>The startup currently has a commercial solution, but it is working on an open source version of the stack which will be released shortly, probably before the end of the year. The company&#8217;s goal is to provide a cloud-based AI solution for smaller cloud vendors beyond the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. This would include regional vendors across the world.</p>
<p>Neu.ro launched in 2019 and came out with its first version of the solution last year. It has raised $2.3 million in seed funding so far, according to the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are myriad tax pain points that come from selling goods, content or services globally.  As the world has seen a surge in cross-border transactions, digital-first businesses face the challenge of understanding and managing global tax and compliance matters as they grow and scale internationally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter Dublin, Ireland-based </span><a href="https://www.fonoa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fonoa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Founded by three ex-Uber alumni &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davor Tremac, Filip Sturman and Ivan Ivankovicz</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; the two-year-old startup has developed APIs that help digital companies determine and calculate taxes they should collect on their internet sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fonoa, which helps companies like Lime, Uber, Teachable and Zoom stay tax compliant, has raised a $20.5 million in a Series A round as more goods and services are sold online &#8212; especially across international markets. Its customers primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> come from the ride-hailing, mobility, food delivery, SaaS and e-commerce industries, and also include subscription businesses. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237023" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Tremac says Fonoa’s APIs “easily” integrate with a customer’s existing data so they don’t have to spend hours figuring out tax matters manually. The company has surpassed 300 million tax transactions per year, as demand for its automated offering has grown. As a B2B SaaS operator, the company has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“very healthy margins” and has seen 7x revenue growth since December 2020, according to Tremac. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the digital world, businesses and customers transact on a global scale. Country borders are no longer a limiting factor, and technology drives global trade at an ever-increasing speed,” he said. “Combined with the increased scrutiny by regulators, dealing with tax matters in a more automated and trusted way has become an ever-more pressing issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company provides a “plug-and-play modular platform” that it says verifies a buyer and seller’s tax status, calculates the correct tax to charge and creates a locally compliant invoice after a transaction takes place. It also allows for automatic reporting of transactions in real time to a country’s government, where needed.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237030" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237030" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2237030 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fonoa-Product-Screenshot.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="469" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fonoa-Product-Screenshot.jpg 1235w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fonoa-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fonoa-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fonoa-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=768,529 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fonoa-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=680,469 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fonoa-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237030" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fonoa</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic, Tremac said, accelerated Fonoa’s growth “significantly” as it brought online commerce many years forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“More sales happening online means more work for us as each online transaction has to have a tax component,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OMERS Ventures led Fonoa&#8217;s Series A financing, which included participation from Index Ventures, FJ Labs and Moving Capital. Index in November of 2020 led its $4.5 million seed round, which was not previously announced. Other backers include Gautam Gupta, former COO and CFO at Opendoor and Uber; Eventbrite founder </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Hartz; DoorDash CFO Prabir Adarkar; Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas, former COO at GoCardless; and Fast COO Allison Barr Allen, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Uber alumni experienced firsthand how difficult it is to correctly calculate and report taxes to authorities throughout the world. So they set about developing technology that would automate taxes for the entire internet economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fonoa currently supports tax automation transactions across more than 100 countries today and has the goal of expanding to over 140 countries by year’s end with the help of its new capital. It also plans to use the money toward hiring. Although it is based in Dublin, Fonoa &#8212; like many other startups these days &#8212; is remote-first, with a 60-person distributed team working in 15 countries. It is looking to hire another 60 people in the U.S., Europe, Asia and LatAm across engineering, product, sales, recruiting and operations. The company also plans to use the funds to extend the coverage of current products as well as “build completely new ones,” Tremac said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are using all resources available to double down on growth as the opportunities ahead of us are massive,” he told TechCrunch. “We will keep expanding until we cover all relevant use cases for all of our products across all geographies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hannah Seal, principal at Index Ventures, believes that Fonoa unlocks growth for companies that operate internationally, and would otherwise be “bogged down” by the complexity of national tax regimes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This focus on enabling growth, not simply back-office automation, attracted us to Fonoa in the first place,” Seal wrote via e-mail. “Having run Uber in multiple markets, the team has a deep understanding of the challenges of scaling across borders and has developed products that allow companies to add and expand new geographies seamlessly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jambu Palaniappan, managing partner at OMERS Ventures, described Fonoa’s product as “the best and most complete offering in the market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are focused on the full tax stack from validations to real-time reporting and have put technology rather than consulting at the core of their product,” he wrote via email. “With governments around the world more concerned than ever about compliance, now is the perfect time for Fonoa to build a globally relevant platform.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://z1.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Z1</a>, a Brazilian neobank focused on offering digital accounts and a linked prepaid card to teenagers and young adults, secured $10 million in Series A funding just six months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/homebrew-leads-z1s-effort-to-bring-digital-banking-to-latin-americas-teens/">taking in $2.5 million</a>.</p>
<p>Co-founded in 2019 by João Pedro Thompson, Thiago Achatz, Mateus Craveiro and Sophie Secaf, Z1 developed a digital bank app aimed at helping Brazilian and Latin American teenagers become more financially independent.</p>
<p>Since the last raise in April, the company’s revenue grew 26 times and continues to do so at almost 40% per month, CEO Thompson said via email. Z1 also grew its customer base by eight times during the same time at a rate of 30% per month.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237513" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Kaszak led the latest round and was joined by existing investors MAYA Capital, Homebrew, Clocktower and The Chainsmokers. Going after new capital so soon was not on the company’s radar, Thompson said.</p>

<p>“Our plan was to raise again early next year, however, Kaszek reached out to us in July and convinced us to anticipate our Series A,” he said. “From the outset, it was clear they would be the ideal partner for us in the next phase of the company, and that we would benefit greatly from having them onboard.”</p>
<p>The new capital will enable Z1 to increase its employees in areas like engineering, product, marketing and customer experience, with plans to go from 60 to over 100 within the next three months. That additional manpower will provide support as the company aims to grow 10 times over the next 12 months and add new features to enhance the financial inclusion and literacy of customers.</p>
<p>Along with the announcement of the new funding, the company also said it would begin to offer its core banking experience for free. It had been charging a monthly subscription fee of $2 per month.</p>
<p>Thompson attributes some of Z1’s growth to the fact that a year ago, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-banks-payment-platform/brazil-launches-pix-instant-payments-system-whatsapp-to-enter-soon-idUSKBN27W25C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Brazilian Central Bank launched PIX</a>, an instant payments system where individuals and organizations can send and receive money instantly through an identification number, phone number or email for free, a service that he likened to “a government-built version of Venmo.”</p>
<p>Since PIX’s launch it is estimated that 105 million people, about half of Brazil’s population, registered to use it, Thompson said. He called it “a key enabler of financial inclusion, as many people have entered the formal economy because of it.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“PIX use among Gen Z (and consequently Z1 users) is higher than that of older generations, as the convenience and social aspect of sending and receiving money through PIX have been heavily explored by younger users,” he added.</p>
<p>Monica Saggioro, co-founder and partner at MAYA Capital, said via email that her firm doubled down on its investment in Z1 for a number of reasons, including that Gen Z is a growing, yet underserved market, and the firm believes there is great value in serving it well with dedicated products to their needs.</p>
<p>What she says many banks are trying to do is solve too many things at the same time, and that results in solving none of them very well. Instead, Z1 is uniquely positioned to serve the Gen Z population and evolve with its customers, and she has yet to find another company with a similar proposition.</p>
<p>“JP and Thiago were entrepreneurs-in-residence at MAYA, so we have been able to see them take Z1 from scratch and gain significant traction,” she added. “We are impressed with their capacity to envision, execute and attract top talent, which make a perfect combination of qualities we look for in founders.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Generation Z is already the largest generation in the world today, representing about 30% of the Brazilian and world population,” added Kaszek partner Nico Berman in a written statement. “Whoever can understand and capture this generation&#8217;s preferences now will reap the rewards in the coming years and decades. We believe the Z1 team is uniquely positioned to do that given their true purpose and deep understanding of this new generation of consumers.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company is growing at an incredible pace — 15 times in gross merchandise volume in just the last 30 days.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alice Deng and Lawrence Murata were working at artificial intelligence companies when they found inspiration from their respective family&#8217;s businesses to create <a href="https://www.slope.so/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slope</a>, which enables businesses an easy way to offer buy now, pay later services.</p>
<p>Prior to the global pandemic, suppliers were extending net terms of 30 days to pay, but at that scale, it is hard to build up credit for small businesses, Murata told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Then with the global pandemic, the pace at which business-to-business payment was moving online was accelerating,” Murata told TechCrunch. “We wanted to bring it online at checkout and empower businesses by making access to capital easy.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237456" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Businesses can get approved in seconds and begin offering the installments. At checkout, customers can choose the payment terms that work for them. Slope manages the lending, underwriting and any debt collection, and will pay out to the business once the product or service ships.</p>

<p>Deng and Murata are two-time Y Combinator founders, most recently attending the 2021 summer cohort. They actually went into the batch with a different company and pivoted to the business model Slope is today, launching in August.</p>
<p>Already, the company is growing at an incredible pace — 15 times in gross merchandise volume in just the last 30 days. In the past three months is has acquired merchant customers in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, India and Singapore. It will soon add merchants to its waitlist from China, Brazil and Europe.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $8 million in seed funding from a group of backers that include Global Founders Capital and founders of Dropbox, DoorDash, Opendoor, Plaid, PlanGrid, Mercury and Pilot. The core focus for the new funding is to grow Slope’s team, build out the infrastructure for customer-centric experiences and get merchants onboarded from the waitlist.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/b2b-payments-market-A08183" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global B2B payments market</a> was valued at $870 billion in 2020, with projections of reaching $1.9 trillion by 2028. At the same time, it was estimated that <a href="https://knowen-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/file/3460/Global%2BTechnology_%2BB2B_%2BHow%2Bthe%2Bnext%2Bpayments%2Bfrontier%2Bwill%2Bunleash%2Bsmall%2Bbusiness%2B.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$127 trillion of payment flows are attributed to B2B payments</a>, and this is expected to rise to $200 trillion, also by 2028.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our vision is to be Stripe for global B2B,” Deng said. “Winning in B2B requires building infrastructure and a core competency in global cross border transactions, that B2C players like Affirm and Afterpay haven&#8217;t had to grapple with.”</p>
<p>In addition, the co-founders interviewed hundreds of small businesses about the need for BNPL and ended up signing deals even before Slope had a product, which Deng noted was validation that this was a huge need in the market.</p>
<p>Don Stalter, partner at Global Founders Capital, said Slope’s growth was “impressive from the start, and one of the fastest-growing companies we have seen globally, at its stage and leanness of the team.”</p>
<p>Businesses have gone to banks for business loans, but it was a “janky process,” and anyone who can improve it at a rate of five times with technology will be a major disrupter, and if they can do it 100 time, they will revolutionize it, he added.</p>
<p>He believes Deng and Lawrence can do this by taking that big B2B payments market and attacking it with artificial intelligence and new technology that is going to improve opportunities for businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With demand for plant-based meat alternatives at an all-time high, Eclipse Foods is no doubt hoping to do for ice cream what companies like Impossible and Beyond have managed for the hamburger. Pre-pandemic, the company announced select retail availability in New York and its native San Francisco, and now it’s expanding coverage with a high-profile retail partnership.</p>
<p>Launched in early 2019, the company has raised nearly $16 million to date, including funding from YC. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/plant-based-dairy-replacements-are-coming-to-ice-cream-pints-in-san-francisco-and-new-york/">In an earlier interview with TechCrunch</a>, CEO Aylon Steinhart noted that the company looks to differentiate itself from other plant-based foodstuffs with a simple approach to provide an alternative food source.</p>
<p>“We’re not using any expensive biotech to get to where we’re going,” the exec noted. “We take plants and we use our world-class expertise in functional plant proteins and how they work to blend plants together in a quite simple way.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234374" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Eclipse is still looking to mimic dairy-based ice cream more directly. “Entering Whole Foods Market, a retailer synonymous for offering premium ingredient, high-caliber products, marks an important moment for Eclipse as we continue to grow our retail presence nationwide,” Steinhart said in a release.</p>
<p>The ice cream will be available at select locations in Northern California to start.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevOps cloud platform <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/render-challenges-the-clouds-biggest-vendors-with-cheaper-managed-infrastructure/">which won our Disrupt SF 2019 Startup Battlefield</a>, announced today that it closed a $20 million Series A funding round led by Addition alongside existing investors General Catalyst and South Park Commons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addition first made a small investment in Render in February 2020 when the company was not looking to raise a round, co-founder and CEO Anurag Goel told TechCrunch in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Render <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/render-raises-4-5m-for-its-devops-platform/">announced its last raise</a> in October 2020, a seed round for $4.5 million, after seeing strong inbound interest on the heels of Disrupt. The latest round brings the startup’s total funding to $26.75 million. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237650" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San-Francisco based company will use the proceeds to triple its employee base, currently 35 people, by the end of 2022, with a focus on product and customer growth, Goel said. It also plans to expand its data center footprint globally to at least 10 new regions in 2022 to improve latency, launching for the first time in both APAC and EMEA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the new features it plans to roll out are a free plan for web services and databases to increase access to its product, as well as built-in DDoS protection for its customers, Goel said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of Render’s customers use its platform for their entire cloud presence, according to Goel. Some of its notable customers include publicly-traded </span><a href="https://us.anker.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, online developer community </span><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indie Hackers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Web3 platform </span><a href="https://near.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NEAR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goel added that many of its customers host popular open-source projects </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">like Elasticsearch, MySQL and MongoDB on Render as an alternative to expensive managed versions of these services, because Render has simplified the process of managing such projects.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Render competes with the “big three” cloud providers &#8212; Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud &#8212; by offering a large suite of features at a competitive cost. Goel said many of Render’s customers migrate to its platform from Heroku and AWS because it provides “increased flexibility, better performance, and access to modern features </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">like infrastructure-as-code, private networking and persistent storage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a customer chooses what service to deploy, Render helps them manage the process and infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“AWS and other large providers were built for the 2000s, when managing infrastructure was the norm at every company,” Goel said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While the big three offerings require expensive and scarce DevOps engineering resources to manage, we offer simplicity and a world-class developer experience at a fraction of the cost.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">San Diego-based startup <a href="http://lifevoxel.ai/">LifeVoxel</a> has raised $5 million in a seed round to bolster data intelligence of its AI diagnostic visualization platform for faster and precise prognosis.</p>
<p>The platform, dubbed Prescient, is used for diagnostics, workflow management and triage, taking away the stress of managing software and hardware technology from physicians and hospitals &#8212; and allowing them to focus on patient care.</p>
<p>The Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform is used by healthcare facilities for remote diagnostics in various medical fields including radiology, cardiology and orthopedics. The platform stores diagnostic imagery, enabling physicians to analyze them, on-demand, from any device including mobile phones. It also includes features that makes it possible to include diagnostic annotations and reports.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237801" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We plan to spend the funds secured in this round to build out our deep learning AI models and machine learning algorithms to provide data intelligence to be able to identify similarities, abnormalities, and predictive diagnoses to help improve the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis,” LifeVoxel founder and chief architect <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/koveykovalan/">Kovey Kovalan</a> told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“In short, with our continued growth, we can help medical professionals figure out what is wrong with patients faster so they can begin the work of healing them sooner,” said Kovalan.</p>
<p>The round drew an array of investors including medical and radiology specialists and high-networth individuals with an interest in medical technology.</p>
<p>Kovalan, who was born and raised in Malaysia, studied computer science in Ohio State University, and on completion, went on to specialize in artificial intelligence. Research and interest later led him to apply artificial intelligence using GPU to offer medical imaging classification, resulting in the development of the platform, which his company says “enables zero-latency interactivity of medical images over internet.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The platform is designed to save about 50% cost of technology costs for hospitals using the software, and allows them to expand or scale down depending on the needs of the institutions. It also enables physicians to access patients and their data from anywhere in the world, making it possible to deliver speedier patient care.</p>
<p>He is hoping to use the platform to change the current landscape of medical imaging where images are hosted on-premises, making it hard for collaboration, and in harnessing it for artificial intelligence. The startup hopes to use the technologies for the improvement in diagnostic outcome using intelligent visualization.</p>
<p>“For rural populations currently lacking in specialists, the platform’s ability to turn any device into a radiology workstation offers access to the same network of specialist physicians for imaging study review as urban areas. Recently such techniques were deployed during the pandemic to provide first-of-a-kind interactive 3D VR Telepresence between remote proctors thousands of miles away and surgeons within operating rooms.”</p>
<p>The startup’s technology is timely as more healthcare institutions expand their remote and telemedicine capabilities &#8212; which has largely been fueled by the Covid pandemic. This is in addition to increased adoption of AI-enabled technologies for better patient outcomes as more hospitals move away from conventional cloud-based systems.</p>
<p>“Medical imaging and radiology need dynamic solutions to replace the inadequacies in conventional systems,” said co-founder, president and CEO of LifeVoxel Sekhar Puli.</p>
<p>“With this round of funding, we will be able to accelerate not only our vision to be the de facto platform for medical imaging applications across the globe but make significant strides in the Telehealth imaging and advanced tech-based AI solutions for the future of healthcare.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Pet item sales topped $100 billion in 2020, driven by the 48 million dogs and cats that were adopted over the past three years.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pets are big business. Sales in this area <a href="https://www.bioguardlabs.com/pandemic-era-pet-industry-surpasses-record-breaking-100-billion-in-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">topped $100 billion in 2020</a>, driven by the 48 million dogs and cats that were adopted over the past three years. However, in that same period, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jul/27/veterinarians-face-high-demand-treat-pets-amid-ado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 5,000 new veterinarians were added</a>, causing delays in getting appointments and added <a href="https://www.wisfarmer.com/story/news/2021/05/26/alarming-suicide-rates-reflective-stresses-felt-veterinarians/7361193002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stress upon veterinarians</a> to manage their practices.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://yourfuzzy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fuzzy</a> announced $44 million in growth funding to expand its digital pet care network of veterinary professionals to alleviate some of the strain on the industry and make care accessible and affordable to all. The San Francisco-based company previously raised <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/fuzzy-lands-18m-series-b-for-pet-telemedicine-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$18 million in a Series B round</a> in March.</p>
<p>The company, founded in 2016, provides 24/7 live chat and telehealth, ship-to-home prescriptions, vet-curated items in its e-commerce marketplace and educational content and programs. Its digitally-native approach can save pet parents up to $750 a year on healthcare expenses, Zubin Bhettay, co-founder and CEO of Fuzzy, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237381" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The big story in 2020 was that everyone needed telehealth services for themselves, and we saw that transfer to pets and then exacerbated by the industry,” he added. “The surge in people getting pets caused emergency room waits to grow to up to 10 hours, while it started taking four to six weeks to get a vet appointment.”</p>
<p>By leading the shift to more telehealth services, Fuzzy hopes to encourage pet parents to consider the health of their pet on a more regular basis to aid in their longevity. The company has facilitated more than 1 million consultations to date and with it, amassed data and operation expertise to be able to expand delivery care at scale.</p>
<p>Bhettay wasn’t planning to raise additional funds so soon after the Series B, but said accelerated growth in the business enabled the company to hire more, check off more of the to-do list items over the past eight months and provided a unique opportunity to lean in on partnerships and expand financial plans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He expects 2021 revenue growth to be five times over 2020, while Fuzzy memberships, which start for free and then a monthly subscription of $24.99 or annual subscription for $99.99, have increased through partnerships with retailers and vet groups. Bhettay did not reveal the company’s valuation, but did say it was more than a three-time uptick from the Series B round.</p>
<p>The round was led by Icon Ventures, with existing investors Greycroft, Matrix and Crosscut participating, with additional backing from veterinary clinic groups and individuals, including former Chewy chairman Mark Vadon and Clearlake Group founder Jose Feliciano. In addition, 25% of the capital was raised from underrepresented communities, Bhettay said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237386" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237386" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2237386 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fuzzy-Live-Chat.png?w=314" alt="Fuzzy app" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fuzzy-Live-Chat.png 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fuzzy-Live-Chat.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fuzzy-Live-Chat.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fuzzy-Live-Chat.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fuzzy-Live-Chat.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237386" class="wp-caption-text">Fuzzy live chat via its app. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fuzzy</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to expanding the vet network — Fuzzy is operational in 25 locations — his plans for the new funding include the development and launch of new product offerings, additional educational content and new member growth.</p>
<p>“We want to see pet care go from once a year to anytime, anywhere,” Bhettay added. “As we think about our vision of becoming the first place where everyone comes to, there are some features and products that we can bring into the business to accelerate that path, as well as acquisitions in the next six to 12 months.”</p>
<p>There are a number of startups tapping into this major trend of pets to capture that household spend in the areas of healthcare, insurance and food. Bhettay is also seeing the larger incumbents focus here, as well as marketing dollars, which he considers validation that the market is shifting to the digitalization of pet care.</p>
<p>Tom Mawhinney, general partner at Icon Ventures, has four dogs himself and felt the pains of having to wait weeks to get them in to see a veterinarian, including having to take one dog to the emergency vet.</p>
<p>He called Bhettay “an energetic and smart entrepreneur” who is building a strong team to go after a space that is ripe for disruption.</p>
<p>“The problems are more exacerbated the more pets that are added to the system, which has not grown in a way to support that,” Mawhinney added. “There needs to be new means for providing care to pets, and Fuzzy is putting in place a bespoke wellness plan that is encouraging interaction to become more frequent and make the overall lives of pets better.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The company formerly known as Facebook is delaying a rollout of end-to-end encryption across all its services until &#8220;sometime in 2023&#8221;, according to Meta&#8217;s global head of safety, Antigone Davis, penning an op-ed in the British newspaper, the<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/11/20/people-shouldnt-have-choose-privacy-safety-says-facebook-safety/"> Telegraph</a> this weekend.</p>
<p>While Facebook-owned WhatsApp has had E2EE everywhere <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/05/whatsapp-completes-end-to-end-encryption-rollout/">since 2016</a>, most of the tech giant&#8217;s services do not ensure only the user holds keys for decrypting messaging data. Meaning those services can be subpoenaed or hit with a warrant to provide messaging data to public authorities.</p>
<p>But back in 2019 &#8212; in the wake of global attention to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/how-facebook-has-reacted-since-the-data-misuse-scandal-broke/">Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal</a> &#8212; founder Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/2420600258234172/">announced</a> the company would work towards universally implementing end-to-end encryption across all its services as part of a claimed &#8216;pivot to privacy&#8217;.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237762" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Zuckerberg did not give a firm timeline for completing the rollout but, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/04/03/facebook-message-encryption-wont-happen-2022/">Facebook suggested</a> it would complete the rollout during 2022.</p>
<p>Now the tech giant is saying it won&#8217;t get this done until &#8220;sometime&#8221; the following year. Which sounds distinctly like a can being kicked down the road.</p>
<p>Davis said the delay is the result of the social media giant wanting to take it time to ensure it can implement the technology safely &#8212; in the sense of being able to retain the ability to be able to pass information to law enforcement to assist in child safety investigations.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we do so, there’s an ongoing debate about how tech companies can continue to combat abuse and support the vital work of law enforcement if we can’t access your messages. We believe people shouldn’t have to choose between privacy and safety, which is why we are building strong safety measures into our plans and engaging with privacy and safety experts, civil society and governments to make sure we get this right,&#8221; she writes, saying it will use &#8220;proactive detection technology&#8221; to ID suspicious patterns of activity, along with enhanced controls for users and the ability for users to report problems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Western governments, including the UK&#8217;s, have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/facebook-is-being-leant-on-by-us-uk-australia-to-ditch-its-end-to-end-encryption-expansion-plan/">leaning hard on Facebook to delay or abandon its plan</a> to blanket services in the strongest level of encryption altogether &#8212; ever since it made the public announcement of its intention to &#8216;e2ee all the things&#8217; over two years ago.</p>
<p>The UK has been an especially vocal critic of Facebook on this front, with Home Secretary Priti Patel very publicly (and repeatedly) <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56795852">warning Facebook</a> that its plan to expand e2ee would hamper efforts to combat online child abuse &#8212; casting the tech giant as an irresponsible villain in the fight against the production and distribution of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).</p>
<p>So Meta&#8217;s op-ed appearing in the favored newspaper of the British government looks no accident.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we roll out end-to-end encryption we will use a combination of non-encrypted data across our apps, account information and reports from users to keep them safe in a privacy-protected way while assisting public safety efforts,&#8221; Davis also writes in the Telegraph, adding: &#8220;This kind of work already enables us to make vital reports to child safety authorities from WhatsApp.&#8221;</p>
<p>She goes on to suggest that Meta/Facebook has reviewed a number of historic cases &#8212; and concluded that it &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">would still have been able to provide critical information to the authorities, even if those services had been end-to-end encrypted&#8221; &#8212; adding: &#8220;While no systems are perfect, this shows that we can continue to stop criminals and support law enforcement.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>How exactly might Facebook be able to pass data on users even if all comms on its services were end-to-end encrypted?</p>
<p>Users are not privy to the exact detail on how Facebook/Meta joins the dots of their activity across its social empire &#8212; but while Facebook&#8217;s application of e2ee on WhatsApp covers messaging/comms content, for example, it does not extend to metadata (which can provide plenty of intel on its own).</p>
<p>The tech giant also routinely links accounts and account activity across its social media empire &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/25/whatsapp-to-share-user-data-with-facebook-for-ad-targeting-heres-how-to-opt-out/">passing data like a WhatsApp user&#8217;s mobile phone number to its eponymous service</a>, following a controversial privacy U-turn back in 2016. This links a user&#8217;s (public) social media activity on Facebook (if they have or have had an account there) with the more bounded form of socializing that typifies activity on WhatsApp (i.e. one-to-one comms, or group chats in a private e2ee channel).</p>
<p>Facebook can thus leverage its vast scale (and historical profiling of users) to flesh out a WhatsApp user&#8217;s social graph and interests &#8212; based on things like who they are speaking to; who they&#8217;re connected to; what they&#8217;ve liked and done across all its services (most of which aren&#8217;t yet e2ee) &#8212; despite WhatsApp messaging/comms content itself being end-to-end encrypted.</p>
<p>(Or as Davis&#8217; op-ed puts it: &#8220;As we roll out end-to-end encryption we will use a combination of non-encrypted data across our apps, account information and reports from users to keep them safe in a privacy-protected way while assisting public safety efforts. This kind of work already enables us to make vital reports to child safety authorities from WhatsApp.&#8221;)</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">Earlier this fall</a>, Facebook was stung with a major fine in the European Union related to WhatsApp transparency obligations &#8212; with DPAs finding it had failed to properly inform users what it was doing with their data, including in relation to how it passes information between WhatsApp and Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook is appealing against the GDPR sanction but today it <a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/whatsapp-changes-privacy-policy-after-225m-watchdog-fine-41075354.html">announced a tweak to the wording of the privacy policy</a> shown to WhatsApp users in Europe in response to the regulatory enforcement &#8212; although it claimed it has not made any changes to how it processes user data.</p>
<p>Returning to e2ee specifically, last month Facebook whistleblower <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-raises-trust-and-security-questions-over-its-e2e-encryption/">Frances Haugen raised concerns over the tech giant&#8217;s application of the technology</a> &#8212; arguing that since it&#8217;s a proprietary (i.e. rather than open source) implementation users must take Facebook/Meta&#8217;s security claims on trust, as independent third parties are unable to verify the code does what it claims.</p>
<p>She also suggested there is no way for outsiders to know how Facebook interprets e2ee &#8212; adding that for this reason she&#8217;s concerned about its plan to expand the use of e2ee &#8212; &#8220;because we have no idea what they’re going to do&#8221;, as she put it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don’t know what it means, we don’t know if people’s privacy is actually protected,&#8221; Haugen told lawmakers in the UK parliament, further warning: &#8220;It’s super nuanced and it’s also a different context. On the open source end-to-end encryption product that I like to use there is no directory where you can find 14 year olds, there is no directory where you can go and find the Uighur community in Bangkok. On Facebook it is <em>trivially easy</em> to access vulnerable populations and there are national state actors that are doing this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haugen was careful to speak up in support of e2ee &#8212; saying she&#8217;s a supporter of open source implementations of the security technology, i.e. where external experts can robustly interrogate code and claims.</p>
<p>But in the case of Facebook, where its e2ee implementation is not open to anyone to verify, she suggested regulatory oversight is needed to avoid the risk of the tech giant making misleading claims about how much privacy (and therefore safety from potentially harmful surveillance, such as by an authoritarian state) users actually have.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Davis&#8217; op-ed &#8212; which is headlined &#8220;we&#8217;ll protect privacy and prevent harm&#8221; &#8212; sounds intended to soothe UK policymakers that they can &#8216;have their cake and eat it&#8217;; concluding with a promise that Meta will &#8220;continue engaging with outside experts and developing effective solutions to combat abuse&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re taking our time to get this right and we don’t plan to finish the global rollout of end-to-end encryption by default across all our messaging services until sometime in 2023,&#8221; Davis adds, finishing with another detail-light soundbite that it is &#8220;determined to protect people’s private communications and keep people safe online&#8221;.</p>
<p>While the UK government will surely be delighted with the line-toeing quality of Facebook&#8217;s latest public missives on a very thorny topic, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">its announcement that it&#8217;s delaying e2ee in order to &#8220;get this right&#8221; &#8212; following sustained pressure from ministers like Patel &#8212; is only likely to increase concerns about what &#8220;right&#8221; means in such a privacy sensitive context. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Certainly the wider community of digital rights advocates and security experts will be closely watching what Meta does here.  </span></p>
<p>The UK government recently splashed almost half a million of taxpayer&#8217;s money on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/uk-names-five-projects-its-funding-for-csam-detection/">five projects to develop scanning/filtering technologies that could be applied to e2ee services</a> &#8212; to detect, report or block the creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) &#8212; after ministers said they wanted to encourage innovation around &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/uk-offers-cash-for-csam-detection-tech-targeted-at-e2e-encryption/">tech safety</a>&#8221; through the development of &#8220;alternative solutions&#8221; (i.e. which would not require platforms <em>not</em> to use e2ee but instead to embed some form of scanning/filtering technology into the encrypted systems to detect/combat CSAM).</p>
<p>So the UK&#8217;s preferred approach appears to be to use the political cudgel of concern for child safety &#8212; which it&#8217;s also legislating for in the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/"> Online Safety Bill</a> &#8212; to push platforms to implement spyware that allows for encrypted content to be scanned on users&#8217; devices regardless of any claim of e2ee.</p>
<p>Whether such baked in scanner systems essentially sum to a backdoor in the security of robust encryption (despite ministers claims otherwise) will surely be the topic of close scrutiny and debate in the months/years ahead.</p>
<p>Here it&#8217;s instructive to look at Apple&#8217;s recent proposal to add a CSAM detection system to its mobile OS &#8212; where the technology was slated to scan content on a user&#8217;s device prior to it being uploaded to its iCloud storage service.</p>
<p>Apple initially took a bullish stance on the proactive move &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/interview-apples-head-of-privacy-details-child-abuse-detection-and-messages-safety-features/">claiming</a> it had developed &#8220;the technology that can balance strong child safety and user privacy&#8221;.</p>
<p>However after a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">storm of concern</a> from privacy and security experts &#8212; as well as those warning that such systems, once established, would inexorably face &#8216;feature creep&#8217; (whether from commercial interests to scan for copyrighted content; or from hostile states to target political dissidents living under authoritarian regimes) &#8212; Apple backtracked, saying after less than a month that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/apple-csam-detection-delayed/"> it would delay</a> implementing the system.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear when/whether Apple might revive the on-device scanner.</p>
<p>While the iPhone maker has built a reputation (and very lucrative business) as a privacy-centric company, Facebook&#8217;s ad empire is the opposite beast: Synonymous with surveillance for profit. So expecting the social media behemoth &#8212; whose founder (and all-powerful potentate) has presided over a string of scandals attached to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/a-brief-history-of-facebooks-privacy-hostility-ahead-of-zuckerbergs-testimony/">systematically privacy-hostile decisions</a> &#8212; to hold the line in the face of sustained political pressure to bake spyware into its products would be for Facebook to deny its own DNA.</p>
<p>Its recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">corporate rebranding to Meta</a> looks a whole lot more superficial than that.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cubbo touts itself as the only company that can take an order up to 5 p.m and get it out in Mexico City the same day.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Colombian e-commerce fulfillment startup <a href="https://www.cubbo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cubbo</a> landed $4 million in seed funding as it launches operations in its home country this month after first going into Mexico earlier this year.</p>
<p>The company came together in January under the leadership of Brian York and Josu Gurtubay. York’s backstory is quite interesting. He was born on the streets in Bogota, and was adopted and grew up in Boston.</p>
<p>In 2017, he started searching for his biological family in Colombia and reconnected with them. Prior to Cubbo, he founded three other startups in San Francisco. York previously worked with Gurtubay, too, in third-party logistics before transferring over the direct-to-consumer e-commerce businesses into Cubbo.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237366" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2237370" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237370" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2237370" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg" alt="Cubbo" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237370" class="wp-caption-text">Cubbo warehouse in Mexico City. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cubbo</p></div></p>
<p>Their vision is to transform city spaces throughout Latin America. For example, the company took over an abandoned space in Mexico City and turned it into an urban fulfilment center for its brands, York explained.</p>
<p>“Most of our customers sell through Amazon and Mercado Libre, so we manage their direct-to-consumer inventory and also some of the largest customers from outside of Mexico,” he added. “In Mexico, we are the only company that can take an order up to 5 p.m. and get it out in Mexico City the same day. Amazon and Mercado can do this, but have to get orders in earlier because their warehouses are outside the city.”</p>
<p>To keep costs down and the ability to get an order out the same day, Cubbo only handles non-perishable goods that are the size of a shoebox or smaller. This means items like cosmetics, consumer electronics and apparel. It also does not transport items itself, but partners with third parties to tackle the last-mile delivery after the company has picked, packed and bundled packages strategically.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The latest funding round was led by SV Latam Capital and included Bragiel Brothers, BluStone and a group of individual angel investors including Wonder Brands founders Federico Malek and Nicolas Gonzalez Luna, Merama co-founder Olivier Scialom, RioGrande co-founder Tony Mandly, 99 Minutos CEO Alexis Patjane, Justo CEO Ricardo Weder and Loft CEO Florian Hagenbuch.</p>
<p>York intends to use the proceeds to continue building out the Mexican and Colombian operations and gearing up to launch in Brazil. In November, the company reached its largest amount of orders per day, some 600% higher than previous months. Cubbo is also expected to double its revenue by the end of the year.</p>
<p>In the short period of time the company has been in business, it has grown to a team of 16 in Mexico and three in Colombia. York will also use the funding to round out the leadership team. He also plans to raise a Series A early next year as the company moves toward becoming cash flow positive by the second quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>“As we look into the ecosystem, we feel fortunate to have good supporters in our niche,” York said. Brands in Latin America have 20% of sales coming from direct-to-consumer, and  everyone wants to grow in the next five years, so it is important for brands to own their data and customer experience, and that is our general overarching theme.”</p>

<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in Los Angeles this past week to meet up with startups, investors and of course, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/21/the-highs-and-lows-of-the-2021-los-angeles-auto-show/">check out the LA Auto Show</a>. So considering my busy schedule, I&#8217;ve handed the reins to Aria Alamalhodaei.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start the day off with a chortle. Last week’s Saturday Night Live featured an e-bike shout-out during the show’s “Weekend Update” news anchor skit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A new report shows that the fastest growing form of electric vehicle is the e-bike, which is particularly popular in cities,” </span><a href="https://twitter.com/DavidZipper/status/1460040672791126019?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said comedian Michael Che</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “At this point, experts believe the only thing that can slow these bikes down are car doors.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In only a few words, Che sums up the irony behind the growing popularity of e-bikes. Despite increased usage and modal shifts, cars unfortunately remain the kings of the concrete jungle &#8212; at least until cities step up and prioritize more egalitarian, greener forms of transport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a deal to end car emissions by 2040 </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8c4a1809-902f-4582-a29e-1c83a97b9dff" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">didn’t quite make it to light</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at COP26, </span><a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2021/11/12/report-climate-goals-impossible-unless-sustainable-transport-claims-40-percent-of-mode-share/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">revealed that urban residents need to start making 40% of trips by foot, bike, micromobility or transit within the next 10 years or we won’t be able to reach our climate goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some cities are making strides. A few cities in the U.S., like Oakland, Bakersfield and Pittsburgh, have started experimenting with</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-11/u-s-cities-test-effects-of-universal-basic-mobility" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “universal basic mobility” pilots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that subsidize buses, e-scooters and e-bikes so people can more freely move about. The end goal is to usher in more economic activity to cities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At CoMotion LA, an urban mobility conference, </span><b>Spin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced it would be one of the micromobility companies to work with local community nonprofits in Bakersfield, like the Dream Center, to identify 100 eligible participants to receive access to free public transit, Spin e-scooters and e-bikes for a year. Bakersfield will be the third UBM pilot Spin is participating in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the event, Spin also announced a partnership with Blue Systems to provide a data dashboard to select U.S. cities aimed at boosting pedestrian safety and eliminating sidewalk riding and improper parking. </span></p>
<p><b>Fetch.ai</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an AI lab with an open-access decentralized ML network for smart infrastructure, has partnered with </span><b>Datarella</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a blockchain company, to launch the MOBIX Micromobility Marketplace, a platform that will hopefully incentivize users through rewards to use micromobility services. MOBIX users can earn miles by recording micromobility trips, which can then be converted into tokens to be used on future trips or traded at crypto exchanges. Users anywhere can download the app on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. </span></p>
<p><b>Lime </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnered with </span><b>SafeUP</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a community safety network offering guardians for women if they feel unsafe, to provide free rides on Lime scooters and bikes to SafeUP guardians in NYC, LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Miami, Washington, DC, Austin and Tel Aviv. </span></p>
<p><b>Bird </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">had its</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/birds-first-public-earnings-show-missed-q3-revenue-but-potential-for-full-year-growth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first public earnings call </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">since becoming a public company via SPAC. The company’s revenues only slightly missed expectations, but the company boosted its guidance for the full-year 2021 period. It’s relying on an uptick in commuting and tourism, as well as an easing of supply chain constraints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australian startup </span><b>Zoomo</b> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/e-bike-subscription-service-zoomo-raises-60m-series-b-to-disrupt-last-mile-delivery/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised a $60 million Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to expand its e-bike subscription service. The company offers e-bikes for gig workers or enterprise fleets, and wants to disrupt the last-mile delivery industry. </span></p>
<p><b>Zembo</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a French startup with operations in Uganda selling e-motorcycles through a lease-to-own program, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/zembo-nabs-3-4-million-from-toyota-dob-equity-and-infraco-africa-to-grow-its-motorcycle-startup-in-uganda/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $3.4 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to begin scaling operations across Africa. It’s backed by Mobility 54, a corporate VC subsidiary of Toyota Tsusho Corp, which will leverage Toyota’s automotive footprint to help Zembo expand.</span></p>
<p><b>Superpedestrian</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is the latest micromobility operator to be featured on the </span><b>Moovit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> app, following behind Lime, Spin and Bird. Now, Moovit users planning trips with the app will be able to find LINK scooters where available. </span></p>
<p><b>Lyft </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expanding its partnership with </span><b>Mastercard</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Bay Area to include bikeshare. Mastercard will help </span><b>Bay Wheels</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is available on the Lyft app, build an additional 35 bikeshare stations next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in San Francisco, </span><b>Scoot/Bird</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have teamed up with </span><b>Scootaround</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pilot an accessible mobility program in the city. Initially piloted in the Bronx, the program allows riders with disabilities to find, reserve and pay for one of three accessible vehicle types. </span></p>
<p><b>Tier </b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/e-scooter-startup-tier-buys-nextbike-to-double-down-on-commitment-to-e-bikes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bought</span></a> <b>Nextbike, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">a German bike-sharing platform, signaling both the company’s commitment to a multimodal approach and, perhaps, more micromobility consolidations in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric scooter maker </span><b>Niu</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has hinted it would be expanding its urban mobility portfolio at EICMA, or the Milan Motorcycle show, next week. This sounds like it could be a new type of vehicle, and </span><a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/17/electric-scooter-maker-niu-teases-new-electric-vehicle-announcement-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electrek is guessing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it might be the company’s three-wheeled canopied scooter concept, which was revealed at CES 2020. Fingers crossed! The micromobility world really needs a solution for rainy days.</span></p>

<p>Last week was all about <strong>Rivian&#8217;s</strong> much-hyped IPO. This week I want to talk about <strong>Lucid Group</strong>, which completed its first quarter as a publicly traded company this week. It looks like its market cap now exceeds both <strong>Ford</strong> and <strong>General</strong> <strong>Motors</strong>, after a stock boost that added $17 billion to its valuation.</p>
<p>What comes next for the new EV entrant? Deliveries, according to investors during the earnings call, starting with its Lucid Air Dream Edition, followed by the Grand Touring, Touring and Air Pure. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/lucid-groups-customer-reservations-top-17000-since-end-of-third-quarter/">CEO Peter Rawlinson said he&#8217;s confident</a> the company will be able to manufacture 20,000 vehicles next year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, reservations have reportedly increased to 17,000 &#8212; up from around 13,000 at the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>One other big deal — or more accurately, dead deal — to note this week: Ford CEO Jim Farley said Friday that the automaker has ended its planned vehicle collaboration with Rivian. The company still is a major shareholder of Rivian.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $1.2 trillion bipartisan </span><b>infrastructure</b> <b>bill</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contains a whole slew of new provisions and funds that target vehicles. Big budgets for things like EV charging and electric school buses have been the most headline-grabbing, but they’re far from the only significant provisions included in the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The infrastructure bill is also taking aim at driver safety. Besides </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/the-station-the-biggest-deal-of-2021-and-executive-shuffling-in-transportation-land/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introducing provisions to include anti-drunk driving tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in new vehicles, the legislation also opened the door for adaptive headlights to come to the U.S. Within 24 months, the </span><b>Secretary of Transportation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be required to revise the regulations around headlights &#8220;to allow for the use on vehicles of adaptive driving beam headlamp systems.&#8221; That means that soon, headlights in America won’t have just two modes &#8212; bright and super-bright &#8212; but instead will be able to dynamically respond to the environment and adjust brightness and beam lighting accordingly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill also authorizes the transportation secretary to determine when to mandate tech like automated emergency braking, lane-assist and forward-collision warnings. Read: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">when</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">if. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means these features will soon be available in all new cars. Cars may also need to be equipped with rear seat occupancy warnings that would go off to prevent a pet or child being left in the backseat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other news that caught my attention this week&#8230;</span></p>
<p><b>The New York City Council </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is </span><a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5190166&amp;GUID=B236F0C1-4256-4377-BFB4-2FD58FFDA68B&amp;Options=ID%7cText%7c&amp;Search=" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">considering a bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that would require the Taxi and Limousine Commission to create a set of rules relating to the licensing and use of autonomous vehicles as taxis. Looks like the state is trying to be proactive about this tech. </span></p>
<p><b>Self-Driving Coalition</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is drawing a line in the sand: it wants policymakers, journalists (hello!) and other stakeholders to clearly distinguish between autonomous driving systems and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The group has long insisted &#8212; rightly, in our opinion &#8212; that conflation of the two technologies could lead to drivers misusing ADAS and not fully understanding its capabilities and limitations. </span></p>
<p><b>The California Energy Commission </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved a staggering $1.4 billion plan to boost the adoption of electric vehicles, with nearly 80% of the money earmarked for EV charging and hydrogen refueling stations. Notably, the majority of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is dedicated to medium- and heavy-duty infrastructure &#8212; chargers for things like buses, school buses and trucks. </span></p>

<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><b>Apple</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/apple-reportedly-aims-to-debut-a-fully-self-driving-car-in-2025/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reportedly making moves to develop its electric car</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it’s planning to make it autonomous, as well. The &#8220;fluid&#8221; plan is to have the car ready to go by 2025, but Apple’s already had a range of setbacks with this car and it declined to comment on the news. </span></p>
<p><b>Baidu</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reckons it has the largest robotaxi service in the world, based on its 115,000 rides. The service, Apollo Go, aims to be in 65 cities by 2025 and 100 cities by 2030, the firm’s CEO Robin Li </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/baidu-robotaxi-2030/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said during an earnings call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/baraja-unveils-spectrum-hd-a-world-first-lidar-built-to-enable-level-4-autonomy-at-automotive-scale-and-integration-301425796.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baraja</a> </strong>has released a lidar system that it says is ready for &#8220;Level 4 autonomy at scale.&#8221; Spectrum HD will cost under $1,000 and will be available for sampling next year.</p>
<p><b>Honda </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is moving forward with an </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/honda-shows-off-the-latest-version-of-its-autonomous-work-vehicle/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">off-road autonomous work vehicle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which it’s testing at a solar panel construction site. The vehicles can tow trailers of up to 1,653 pounds and carry construction materials of up to 880 pounds across the 1,000 acre worksite.</span></p>
<p><b>Pony.ai</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> restructured its passenger car and autonomous trucking R&amp;D units in September, and TechCrunch has since learned a few key executives left after, at least one of whom think the different use cases of urban driving and highway driving should have separate product teams. Two of the employees left to start their own L4 trucking business. Sources have confirmed to TechCrunch that Pony’s autonomous trucking operations in the States have been suspended, but the company is still testing in China.</span></p>
<p><strong>Qualcomm </strong>is collaborating with <strong>BMW Group </strong>to design and develop <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/11/16/qualcomm-and-bmw-group-extend-their-long-lasting-technology-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BMW&#8217;s next-gen ADAS and autonomous systems</a> stack.</p>
<p><b>REE Automotive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has come up with a fully autonomous concept vehicle based on a brand new </span><a href="https://ree.auto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultra-modular EV platform design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The concept is geared for last-mile autonomous and electric delivery companies, fleet operators, e-retailers and tech companies looking to build fully autonomous solutions. </span></p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>Los Angeles Auto Show </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">was this week, so let’s start with some of the top automaker reveals:</span></p>

The three-wheeled, open-cabin, electric delivery vehicles are already being used in Asia and Europe, and might be an answer to last- or middle-mile delivery in the U.S. </span></p>
<p><b>Fisker’s</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all-electric </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/the-all-electric-fisker-ocean-suv-debuts-with-a-rotating-screen-from-foxconn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocean SUV debuts with a rotating screen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of manufacturer </span><b>Foxconn</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s obvious touches. Fisker’s first EV will have a 17.1 inch central screen that can rotate from portrait to landscape mode depending on whether the driver is using GPS or just chilling and watching movies in the car. </span></p>
<p><b>Hyundai </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/hyundais-new-electric-suv-concept-showcases-a-hygienic-lounge-like-interior/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyundai SEVEN Concept vehicle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, featuring a “hygienic” interior, because ew, COVID. The concept is built on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyundai’s Electric Global Modular Platform, which is the same platform as the Ioniq 5, and features lounge-like interiors with swiveling seats and a whole bunch of hygienic bits and bobs. For example, a hygiene air flow system for tailored airflow and a UVC sterilization cycle. </span></p>
<p><b>Porsche</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unveiled the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/porsche-takes-the-gts-electric-with-the-taycan-sedan-and-sporty-wagon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taycan GTS sedan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a third body style called Taycan GTS Sport Turismo, rounding out the Taycan vehicle portfolio, which the company has invested more than $1 billion in developing.</span></p>

It’s the first EV under Toyota’s bZ brand, and it should come to the U.S. in mid-2022 with an estimated range of up to 250 miles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other EV news…</span></p>
<p><b>Canoo</b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/canoo-is-setting-up-headquarters-in-walmarts-hometown-picks-panasonic-as-battery-supplier/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced plans to establish its HQ </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and an advanced manufacturing industrialized facility in Bentonville, Arkansas. (Do we detect a future deal with Walmart?). During the company’s Q3 earnings call, Canoo said it’s getting close to producing vehicles on its gamma platform.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luxury EV startup </span><b>Lucid Group</b> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/lucid-groups-customer-reservations-top-17000-since-end-of-third-quarter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">completed its first quarter as a public company </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">after merging with Churchill Capital IV Corp in July.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations will be required for all new homes and businesses in the UK starting in 2022, the government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-to-announce-electric-vehicle-revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">announced</a> today. The new measure aims to boost EV adoption in the nation by adding up to 145,000 extra charging points each year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will mean people can buy new properties already ready for an electric vehicle future, while ensuring charge points are readily available at new shops and workplaces across the UK — making it as easy as refueling a petrol or diesel car today,&#8221; the press release states.</p>
<p>The UK government has already backed the installation of over 250,000 charging points, so the new rules would increase that by over 50 percent in the first year alone. Buildings like supermarkets and workplaces are included in the law, along with large scale renovations that will have over 10 parking spaces. However, details of the rules, like specifications and power outputs of the installations, have yet to be released.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237769" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Britain&#8217;s opposition Labour party noted that London and the southeast part of the country have more charging points &#8220;than the rest of England and Wales combined,&#8221; and the new law doesn&#8217;t help in that regard. It also said that it doesn&#8217;t include any provisions that would make EVs more affordable for lower- and middle-income families, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59369715" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><em>BBC</em></a> reported.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[E-commerce fulfillment is certainly having a moment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Though <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/supply-chain-problems-show-signs-of-easing-11637496002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports of global supply chain bottlenecks show some easing</a>, they likely still won’t be back to normal until some time next year. <a href="https://deliverr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deliverr</a>’s technology was developed to enable next-day, affordable e-commerce fulfillment for its merchants despite these disruptions. And investors are lining up to keep its machine going.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company announced Monday $250 million in Series E funding, boosting its valuation to $2 billion. This new valuation is more than double its previous valuation when the company raised just seven months ago, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/deliverr-scores-170m-to-bring-fast-delivery-to-every-e-commerce-vendor/">$170 million round</a> led by Coatue.</p>
<p>Deliverr, which provides fulfillment services to e-commerce merchants on marketplace platforms, like Shopify, Walmart, Amazon, eBay and Target, uses predictive analytics to anticipate demand for products based on variables, including demographics and geography, and then preposition items close to demand.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237686" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company is seeing supply chain constraints become “much more acute,” so its approach is to have a network of over 80 warehouses, cross-docks and sort centers near places of demand to reduce the number of miles a product travels and makes it more affordable to get products faster, Harish Abbott, co-founder and CEO, said via email. That approach has resulted in Deliverr&#8217;s merchants growing 90% year-over-year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Deliverr scores $170M to bring fast delivery to every e-commerce vendor&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/deliverr-scores-170m-to-bring-fast-delivery-to-every-e-commerce-vendor/embed/#?secret=owiuhrGj0q" data-secret="owiuhrGj0q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Demand remains at elevated levels from the pandemic,” he said. “Labor pool constraints made us more creative in our partnerships and expansion strategies as we watched e-commerce emerge as the primary sales channel while brick and mortar stores saw unimpressive growth.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Deliverr grew its gross merchandise value “significantly” year over year and is poised to power over $2.5 billion by the end of the year. It also grew its warehouse and carrier network to provide one-day fulfillment services to the largest metropolitan areas — and the company touts that half of the U.S. population lives within 100 miles of a Deliverr network.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company also saw growth in the number and diversity of its merchant base while also doubling the size of its team and opening offices around the world.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/ecommerce-fulfillment-service-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global e-commerce fulfillment services market</a> is expected to be valued at $86.4 billion by the end of the year and is poised to nearly double to $168.7 billion by 2028. With consumers expecting faster and more reliable shipping methods, Deliverr is well-positioned to capitalize on those expectations and global supply chain constraints, Abbott said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce fulfillment is certainly having a moment, with capital pouring into companies all over the world. For example, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/e-commerce-logistics-startup-hive-buzzes-following-34m-investment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/fabric-200-million-robotics-fulfillment-e-commerce/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fabric</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/nigerias-sendbox-raises-1-8m-to-provide-e-commerce-fulfilment-for-small-merchants/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sendbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/31/shipblu-bags-2-4m-for-its-e-commerce-and-fulfilment-service-in-egypt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ShipBlu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were some of the latest to announce funding within the past few months. </span>For Deliverr’s latest investment, new investor Tiger Global is taking the lead, joined by existing investors 8VC, Activant, GLP, Brookfield Technology Partners and Coatue.</p>
<p>Having raised funds earlier in the year, Abbott said the company was already “well funded,” but saw increased interest from investors and thought Tiger was “an exceptional investor and partner” and “has an incredible track record on identifying promising companies, partnering with them and ultimately building exceptional iconic enterprises,” Abbott said.</p>
<p>The new capital will enable the company to continue improving on its technology and product development, invest in adding more employees and expand its next-day capabilities.</p>
<p>“That’s ultimately what drives conversion and great customer experiences,” Abbott added. “We will also invest in building new capabilities, like returns, prep, LOT tracking, and temperature control so that Deliverr is the easiest-to-use fulfillment service out there for brands.”</p>
<p>John Curtius, partner at Tiger Global, said in a written statement that “Deliverr is well-positioned to lead the ecommerce fulfillment space as several market forces converge.”</p>
<p>&#8220;No other company, at the cutting-edge of fulfillment infrastructure and technology, will be able to solve for logistics chain disruptions, offer merchants next-day delivery, and save merchant money — all at the same time,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nigeria-based Mobility-as-a-Service platform Treepz (formerly Plentywaka) has acquired Ugabus, a Ugandan bus company that aggregates inter-city bus operators. While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Onyeka Akumah, CEO and co-founder of Treepz, told TechCrunch that the acquisition was funded with a recent $1.5 million raise that acted as an extension to a previous seed round.</p>
<p>The seed extension, which came from new investors including Japan-based Uncovered Fund, Dubai-based Blanford Capital and Jonomi Capital and Egypt-based Jedar Capital, adds onto an August <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/mobility-startup-plentywaka-picks-up-1-5m-seed-acquires-ghanas-stabus/">raise of $1.3 million</a>, funding Treepz used to purchase Stabus, a Ghanian bus company, to fund its expansion plans across the continent. Treepz is closing the seed round at $2.8 million.</p>
<p>The acquisition, which will see Treepz fully acquire all of Ugabus&#8217;s operations and staff, marks Treepz&#8217;s first entry into the East African market. Ugabus, which will be renamed Treepz Uganda on December 1, currently has 70% of all the country&#8217;s bus operators on its platform, which includes around 50,000 customers that use the service to travel between cities in Uganda, according to Treepz.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237734" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ll be able to service most of the major cities in Uganda, but the good thing about East Africa is they have very seamless borders between the countries, so it&#8217;s easy to move from Uganda to Rwanda, Uganda to Tanzania, Tanzania to Burundi, and so forth,&#8221; Akumah told TechCrunch. &#8220;The plan is to extend into Tanzania and Burundi first. Those are places we will pay attention to next year. We are also really interested in Ethiopia. So the same thing we were doing with Ghana, across Ghana to Togo and Benin from Nigeria for the West African region. So next year, we will consolidate on our positions on East Africa and West Africa and start collapsing into on in Sub Saharan Africa.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In Lagos, Treepz&#8217;s hometown, the startup&#8217;s business model consists of three verticals. The main service, &#8220;Daily Treepz,&#8221; is like Uber for minivans and buses. It offers riders in a city fixed daily routes from bus stop to bus stop, allowing them to reserve seats using the app and pay via a digital wallet system. &#8220;Travel Treepz&#8221; is the startup&#8217;s intercity bus service, which allows Treepz to act as an aggregator for other bus companies, similar to what Ugabus&#8217;s model is. Finally, Treepz has recently introduced corporate bookings, providing transportation services for businesses.</p>
<p>When Treepz Uganda launches this week, it&#8217;ll start with intercity and corporate services.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We will look at the opportunity of doing Daily Treepz there in the future, but for now it&#8217;s easier for us to launch there with what we already have and what the team is already used to,&#8221; said Akumah. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Intracity trips account for the majority of Treepz customers, said Akumah, because it&#8217;s a daily service that people use twice a day, five days per week, spending an average of $2 to $3 everyday commuting.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bus operators are starting to see us as a technology partner against competition,&#8221; said Akumah. &#8220;The Treepz technology as an inventory management system can now be used by the bus operators to power their different systems. And that in turn, turns out to be a tremendous opportunity for growth for us. So we see a future where as we aggregate bus operators for city to city, and we also work with bus operators within cities. It just grows the numbers over time around the transactions that happen on our platform.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In addition to the seed funding, Treepz also recently received funds from Google&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-sets-up-50m-fund-to-invest-in-african-startups/">African Investment Fund</a>, which the startup will use to aggressively expand its on-demand ride-sharing and intercity bus ticketing services in Africa. The company had previously outlined plans to expand as far as Toronto, where Treepz has backing after being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/nigerias-plentywaka-gets-backing-from-techstars-plans-expansion-to-canada/">accepted into Techstars Toronto</a>, but is focusing instead on helping digitize and modernize the African transportation ecosystem.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Treepz is building the most important mobility infrastructure in Africa&#8217;s megacities,&#8221; said Takuma Terakubo, CEO and general partner of Uncovered Fund, in a statement. &#8220;The development of public transportation is essential in African countries where urbanization is advancing.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://jina.ai/">Jina.ai</a>, an open-source startup that uses <a href="https://docs.jina.ai/get-started/neural-search/">neural search</a> to help its users find information in their unstructured data (including videos and images), today announced that it has raised a $30 million Series A funding round led by Canaan Partners. New investor Mango Capital, as well as existing investors GGV Capital, SAP.iO and Yunqi Partners also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $39 million to date.</p>
<p>Jina.ai CEO and co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hxiao87/?originalSubdomain=de">Han Xiao</a>, who co-founded the company together with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nanwang28/">Nan Wang</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/binghexuanbin/">Bing He</a>, explained that the idea behind neural search is to use deep learning neural networks to go beyond traditional keyword-based search tools. Making use of relatively new machine learning technologies like <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/transfer-learning-for-deep-learning/">transfer learning</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_learning">representation learning</a>, the company&#8217;s core Jina framework can help developers quickly build search tools for their specific use cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given an image, audio, video or whatever &#8212; we first use deep neural networks to translate this data format into a universal representation,&#8221; Xiao explained. &#8220;In this case, it&#8217;s mostly a mathematic vector &#8212; 100-dimensional vectors. And then, the matching [algorithm] does not count how many letters match but counts the mathematical distance, the vector distance between these two vectors. In this way, you can basically use this kind of methodology to solve all kinds of data search problems or relevance problems.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237709" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Xiao described Jina as akin to TensorFlow for search (with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> being Google&#8217;s open-source machine learning framework). Just like TensorFlow or PyTorch defined the design pattern of how people design AI systems, Jina wants to define how people build neural search systems &#8212; and become the de-facto standard for doing so in the process.</p>
<p>But Jina is only one of the company&#8217;s current set of products. It also offers the <a href="https://hub.jina.ai/">Jina Hub</a>, a marketplace that allows developers to share and discover the building blocks for Jina-based neural search applications, as well as the <a href="https://jina.ai/blog/introducing-finetuner/">recently</a> launched <a href="https://github.com/jina-ai/finetuner">Finetuner</a>, a tool for fine-tuning any deep neural network.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last 18 months, we spent a lot of effort on building the core infrastructure, on building the foundation of this big neural search tower &#8212; and that part is already done,&#8221; Xiao said. &#8220;And now we are slowly building the first floor, the second floor of this big building &#8212; and we try to provide an end-to-end development experience.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237716" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-21-165941.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237716" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2237716" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-21-165941.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="352" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-21-165941.jpg 1094w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-21-165941.jpg?resize=150,52 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-21-165941.jpg?resize=300,103 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-21-165941.jpg?resize=768,264 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-21-165941.jpg?resize=680,234 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-21-165941.jpg?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2237716" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jina.ai</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company says the Jina AI developer community currently counts about 1,000 users, with applications that range from a video game developer who use it to auto-fill relevant game assets in the right-click many of its game editor to a legal-tech startup that uses it to enable its chatbot to provide a Q&amp;A experience that draws on data from PDF documents.</p>
<p>The open-source Jina framework already has almost 200 external contributors since its launch in May 2020 and the company also hosts an active Slack community around the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reasons we are doing open source is mostly because of the velocity of open source &#8212; and I believe the velocity of the development is a key factor for the success of a software project. A lot of software just dies because this velocity goes to zero,&#8221; Xiao said. &#8220;We are building the community and we are leveraging the community to gather feedback to iterate fast. And this is super important for infrastructure software like us. we are building the community. And we are leveraging the community to gather feedback to fast iterate. And this is super important for infrastructure software like us. You need all these top-tier developers to give your feedback about the usability, accessibility and so on in order to improve it quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jina.ai plans to use the new funding to double its team and especially to expand its operations in North America. With this expanded team, the company plans to invest in R&amp;D to expand the overall Jina ecosystem and launch new tools and services around it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditional search systems built for textual data don’t work in a world brimming with images, video, and other multimedia. Jina AI is moving companies from black and white into color, unlocking unstructured data in a way that’s fast, scalable, and data-agnostic,&#8221; said Canaan Partners&#8217; Joydeep Bhattacharyya. &#8220;The early applications of its open-source framework already show glimmers of the future, with neural search underpinning opportunities to improve decision-making, refine operations and even create new revenue streams.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On October 3, <span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://twitter.com/bbnaija?lang=ca"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Brother Naija</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” a reality show sponsored by Nigerian social payments company Abeg, came to a rapturous close after 72 days on air</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The show, which commenced on July 24, is the most popular and most-watched reality show in Africa, raking in impressive numbers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> money and viewership</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “Big Brother” franchise, started in the Netherlands, has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been duplicated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worldwide, including Nigeria, where pay-TV company MultiChoice Nigeria organizes it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237469" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It features a group of people who live together in a huge house, detached from the outside world but watched via television cameras</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent season of “Big Brother Naija” was the sixth since launching in 2006. In its fifth season, the show’s organizers claimed that viewers cast a whopping 900 million votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With millions of eyeballs tuned in to watch the show daily, it is only fitting that companies looking to appear before viewers have to pay a premium</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to some sources, it costs $2 million to become a headline sponsor of the drama show, and Abeg, the latest one, is the newest beneficiary of the kind of blitzscaling growth “BBN” provides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>A new generation fintech app with some drama</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abeg </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 by</span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/dare-adekoya-0457b2105"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dare Adekoya</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/muheez-akanni-70106a182"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Muheez Akanni</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/patriciaadoga"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Patricia Adoga</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/eniola-ajayi-bembe-6443011b1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Eniola Ajayi-Bembe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its name is a wordplay on popular Nigerian slang </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">abeg</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which means to ask or beg for something.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform</span><a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/09/30/abeg-africa-cash-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched in September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of that year with a Cash App-esque play: By leveraging a wallet-based system, Abeg allows users to request and send money to each other with tags</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what started as a couple of Gen Zs trying out cool stuff outside Nigeria’s traditional payments space </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turned into a company looking to scale after gaining 5,000 users in its first few weeks with zero marketing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for the next few weeks, Abeg won more users. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, coming into 2021, the hype around the app &#8212; especially on Twitter, where it gained fame &#8212; died down. To many, it seemed like the app was marching toward a slow death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it came as a surprise when in April, MultiChoice announced the startup as the show’s headline sponsor before the sixth season began months later</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did the six-month-old startup, which at the time had not disclosed any fundraising and seemed to be struggling, manage to sponsor a show that cost $2 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? That was the question on the lips of many observers. And they came up with some theories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, TechCrunch got some answers in a call with the startup’s founders. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before the Big Brother show, we had already raised a pre-seed round from local investors,” CEO Adekoya said on the call</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He said the team used a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the undisclosed pre-seed round to sponsor the show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this revelation, the answer appeared to be in the fine print of</span><a href="https://africamagic.dstv.com/show/big-brother-naija/news/multichoice-unveils-abeg-as-s6-headline-sponsor-bbnaija/news"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> MultiChoice’s announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back in April, which identified Abeg as “a product of leading financial technological company Piggytech Global Limited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/1624392D:NL"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piggytech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the parent company of</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/nigerias-piggybank-ng-raises-1-1m-announces-group-investment-product/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PiggyVest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Nigeria’s most popular savings app and one of the country’s most valued fintech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multichoice&#8217;s announcement suggests that Abeg </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was acquired by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Piggytech even before the show started (according to people familiar with the matter, this happened in late 2020), and some sources say Piggytech paid the “BBN” sponsorship money for Abeg</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Abeg CEO dismissed this report, it seems like a more logical assertion because rarely would you see a pre-seed stage startup with a few thousand users raise money and earmark a marketing budget of $2 million only to spend it at one go</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abeg’s acquisition by its parent company has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been shrouded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in secrecy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it has also been glaring for months to many people &#8212; particularly Nigerian tech Twitter where the handles of Abeg and PiggyVest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regularly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exchange banter on the social media app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, Piggytech and its subsidiaries have neither </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refuted nor confirmed their relationship until now</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We [Abeg and PiggyVest] are more or less under the same parent company; so, like sister companies and subsidiaries of Piggytech,” CTO Akanni said in the call</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship has also produced some drama. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, Nigerian tech Twitter was abuzz about a young startup that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regrettably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> relinquished most of its ownership to a big company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It didn’t take long to know the companies involved. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was more speculation on how this contributed to the ousting of</span><a href="https://www.benjamindada.com/tag/under-the-hoodie/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Michael “Trojan” Okoh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the ex-CTO Abeg brought on to build out the app’s first version late last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some sources told me that Okoh left because of ownership dynamics in which Piggytech allegedly bullied its way into acquiring Abeg</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. TechCrunch reached out to Piggytech and Okoh, but they declined to comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the call with Abeg founders, though, Akanni denied the reports saying, “You can see it as how someone would leave the company usually and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unusually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It wasn’t because of a ‘PiggyTech takeover’ &#8212; it was because of other reasons we won’t like to disclose.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since both camps moved past this drama, Okoh has launched Thepeer, a Nigeria fintech company where he is chief technology officer, while Abeg numbers have boomed courtesy of “BBN</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<h2><b>The Big Brother impact and what next?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abeg isn’t the first tech startup to sponsor the reality TV show;</span><a href="https://technext.ng/2021/07/06/bbn-sponsorship-is-nigerian-tech-companies-new-path-to-massive-market-adoption/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other tech companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have done so in the past. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They include now-defunct e-commerce company PayPorte; betting companies Betway and Bet9ja; and fintechs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/kuda-the-african-challenger-bank-raises-55m-at-a-500m-valuation/">Kuda</a>, Patricia and unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of them reported astronomical growth following the season finale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the perfect blueprint for Abeg to copy. And it did, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">masterfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entering into the show with a new design, a relaunched app and over 20,000 users, Abeg claims it now has almost 2 million users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“‘Big Brother’ is like a large billboard in Africa where brands can &#8230; advertise and promote their products. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as Abeg, we are trying to infuse culture, lifestyle into the app, because payments is part of people’s lives,” COO Adoga said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So it’s pretty much worked for us because we’re trying to &#8230; promote and introduce the brand to the market and [tell] people what we’re about and what Abeg </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is supposed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Abeg launched last year, its best use case for social payments was to let users run giveaway campaigns</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giveaways on the app became more prominent during the Big Brother show as celebrities and influencers (sponsored by Abeg) used the app to send money to their fans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relying on such a model is unsustainable. Users enjoyed using the app for giveaways on version 1.0, but it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">surely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wasn’t enough for user retention. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that Abeg has acquired more users and grown 100x, retention will become more critical than ever in version 2.0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abeg team knows this and is exploring more specific use cases with Piggytech’s backing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We went the giveaway route </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to attract a lot of signups, which worked, and for people to reserve their usernames and get around with the app,” Adekoya said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Moving forward, Abeg will be your go-to payment app for anything you want to pay for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why Patronize, also known as “Abeg for businesses” was launched. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform, another Piggytech subsidiary as confirmed by the company to TechCrunch, is a Square-esque product for Nigerian small and medium businesses to accept payments from customers using the Abeg app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Square, Patronize provides tools to help businesses grow, manage and reward their customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unlike Square, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Patronize is void of cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its own smart point-of-sale devices, Abeg is trying to disrupt POS machines in retail shops and stores and bank transfers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granted, these are two tough propositions, but Abeg is right to think there’s opportunity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While fund transfers in Nigeria are instant with the help of the Nigeria Interbank Settlement System (NIBSS) as the infrastructure behind it,</span><a href="https://www.thecable.ng/failed-transactions-banks-have-refunded-n89bn-to-customers-in-nine-years-says-cbn"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> failed transactions and downtimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are still common occurrences</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abeg, with its wallet system, provides a unique channel to make payments which, according to the company, has a 99.9% uptime</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abeg is banking that customers will see it as an alternative when they feel dissatisfied with traditional payments and become the go-to platform to pay for a movie, food, event or drugs from pharmacies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will all these be enough to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> users? It’s not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">entirely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> certain because one would still need to use the bank transfers to fund an Abeg wallet. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And some users I have spoken with about the product don’t see why they should make transfers into their Abeg wallets every time to make payments when they could also transfer money to the recipient’s bank</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are issues Abeg needs to address to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its millions of users. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way it plans to do this is via direct integration with PiggyVest so users from the savings app can fund their Abeg wallets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the play here? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So PiggyVest reportedly paid out ₦250 billion (~$500 million) into its users’ bank accounts so far at their last email to them this month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s a lot of money. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And since an Abeg wallet can perform some functions of a traditional bank account like transfers, bill payments or buying tickets, PiggyVest is telling its users, “why don’t we use your Abeg wallets as your default withdrawal vault instead of your bank accounts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some users will likely find this inconvenient. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And sources tell me that Abeg might begin to allow users to earn interest on money sitting in their wallets in a bid to appease them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these features, Abeg’s strategy is to leverage the pull and success of its “sister company” to achieve stickiness and, at the same time, bring into fruition the financial ecosystem Piggytech is building to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> float</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside that, Abeg is going big on social gatherings, sponsoring entertainment events and musical shows of Grammy-award winning artists such as Wizkid and Burna Boy to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more users this upcoming holiday season</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the influx of</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> venture capital into the Nigerian fintech space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is crowded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with platforms housing comparable features such as buying airtime, paying utility bills, making transfers and savings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abeg claims to be different because its users won’t experience slow payments and high transaction costs which exist on other platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though this pitch remains lost on some people, Piggytech believes Patronize will do the trick in changing their opinions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business-focused platform is also on a user acquisition spree, onboarding tens and hundreds of merchants with smart POS devices to cater to the millions of users acquired by Abeg</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The dollar is mostly green, but in the hands of <a href="https://kompas.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kompas</a>, so are kroner, euros and shekels. The firm has an Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Tel Aviv presence, and now has a $160 million sack of funds to deploy across its focus areas: sustainability and technological innovation in the construction, real estate and manufacturing industries. The new fund in particular wants to take early-stage companies under its waxy golden wings, with check sizes ranging from $1 million-$5 million.</p>
<p>The fund will be managed by partners Sebastian Peck and Talia Rafaeli, and has aspirations to back breakthrough innovations that accelerate the adoption of digital technology and industrial automation in the real estate, construction and manufacturing sectors. It especially wants to reduce waste and CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>The fund strategy is driven by increasing regulatory pressure to reduce CO2 emissions, and the emerging desire for a greener built environment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237158" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Kompas&#8217; managers have a recent past in corporate VC on the automotive side; an industry that has also seen huge shifts in its desire for pastures greener. Sebastian Peck previously headed up the corporate VC arm for Jaguar Land Rover, while Talia Rafaeli led investments on behalf of Porsche’s VC arm in Europe and Israel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tackling the existential threat of climate change requires us to think differently how we design and build our future cities, commercial buildings and residential homes,&#8221; says Sebastian Peck. &#8220;Today, 39% of the global CO2 is emitted by the building sector and 30% of the waste generated in Europe stems from construction and demolition. To meet its environmental obligations, the sector needs to change radically, which represents tremendous opportunity for technological innovation and new business models,” he adds. “Our goal is to deliver top quartile financial returns by backing founders who will have a real impact on our industry.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Venture capital plays a critical role in funding the development of breakthrough solutions to mitigate the climate impact of modern industry and underpin more sustainable business practices,&#8221; says Talia Rafaeli. &#8220;We are incredibly excited to embark on this journey, and back the ambitious founders that will bring about this change.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://lydia-app.com">Lydia</a> is entering a whole new category by adding trading to its financial super app later this year. The company is partnering with <a href="https://www.bitpanda.com/en">Bitpanda</a> for this feature. Lydia users will be able to buy, hold and sell American and European shares, precious metals, cryptocurrencies and ETFs.</p>
<p>Lydia started as a peer-to-peer payment app that lets you send and receive money instantly from a mobile app. It has added more features over time, such as debit cards, IBANs, money pools, cashback, donations, personal loans, etc.</p>
<p>Like Venmo or Cash App in the U.S., the company attracts new users with peer-to-peer payments and then exposes them to more features and financial products that they can access directly from the app. And it’s been working well as Lydia now has 5.5 million users.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237161" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A few months ago, Lydia introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/lydia-partners-with-cashbee-to-add-savings-accounts/">savings accounts</a> powered by Cashbee. It’s a good old fixed-rate savings account that offers 0.6% in interests. It’s not much, but it’s better than leaving it on your main Lydia account.</p>
<p>And yet, the feature has been working well. On average, users who open a savings account in Lydia put thousands of euros on that account. The next logical step is trading, which introduces more risks but better potential returns.</p>
<p>“If you want to buy assets right now, it’s too complicated,” Lydia co-founder and CEO Cyril Chiche told me. “Even just accessing those markets is complicated. It takes you several days to register and verify your account. After that, you have to send money. And then, there are minimum amounts.”</p>
<p>With Lydia’s trading feature, creating a trading account takes just a few taps in the app. You don’t have to send a photo of your passport again, you don’t have to create a new account with a separate password. You can trade 24/7, which means that you can convert shares to cash and spend it with a Lydia card in just a few taps — there&#8217;s no need to plan ahead because money arrives on your Lydia account instantly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After that, you can buy your first share — or fraction of a share — for as little as €1. Lydia and Bitpanda offer fractional shares in French, European and American companies. You can buy precious metals, such as gold, platinum, silver and palladium. You can invest in bitcoin, Ethereum and <a href="https://www.bitpanda.com/en/prices/cryptocurrencies">dozens of other crypto assets</a> — it&#8217;s worth noting that Bitpanda started as a crypto trading company. Finally, you can also access trackers (ETFs).</p>
<p>Essentially, if there’s an asset that is accessible through a Bitpanda account, you can also access it through your Lydia account. Fees are the same on Lydia and Bitpanda. There are no fees involved with fractional shares but there are <a href="https://support.bitpanda.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000902525-What-fees-and-premiums-can-I-expect-to-pay-on-Bitpanda-">some fees</a> for cryptocurrencies and precious metals.</p>
<p>“We met with a lot of potential partners and we realized that we had a lot of things in common [with Bitpanda],” Chiche said. It&#8217;s a win-win partnership as Bitpanda can also use Lydia as a way to promote <a href="https://www.bitpanda.com/en/whitelabel">its white-label service</a> and integrate trading in other apps. Both companies have agreed to share revenue that comes from Lydia users taking advantage of the trading feature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ByteDance is shutting down its edtech business in India, the company informed the local team on Monday, according to two sources directly familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The decision follows weeks-long discussion in which the company also explored migrating India team to work with the European edtech team, sources said, requesting anonymity as they are not authorized to speak with the press. Most of the employees, if not all, are being let go, one of the sources said. The edtech division employed over three dozen people in India.</p>
<p>Even as ByteDance&#8217;s marquee offering, TikTok, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned in India last year</a>, at least two of its businesses &#8212; Snapsolve, the education learning app, and music streaming service Resso &#8212; have remained operational in the country. ByteDance, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/bytedance-to-cut-jobs-in-india-amid-tiktok-ban/">cut down much of its India workforce last year</a>, continues to employ people for the music and edtech businesses in the country.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237743" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But both the verticals have stayed low-key in the country and employees have been advised to not talk about the businesses publicly, according to many familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>SnapSolve, which competes with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/james-murdoch-lupa-systems-leads-31-million-funding-in-india-doubtnut/">Doubtnut,</a> helps students in grade six through 12 find solutions of math problems by taking and uploading pictures of them. Doubtnut counts Sequoia Capital India and James Murdoch&#8217;s Lupa Systems among its backers.</p>
<p>ByteDance, which posted several new roles for its India edtech business as recently as last month, didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment.</p>
