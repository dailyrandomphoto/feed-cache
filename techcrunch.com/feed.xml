										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This week, we&#8217;ve got a first look at one of TikTok&#8217;s early e-commerce tests, which involves a program for sellers involving product anchors on videos and the option for affiliate sales. We&#8217;re also digging into the new iOS and Android betas, the FTC complaint against math app Prodigy and more.</p>

<h3>TikTok tests a new e-commerce experience in Indonesia</h3>
<p>The Financial Times recently <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/629c1c17-3daa-46af-8177-1814baaa2bed">reported</a> TikTok was preparing to launch a range of new e-commerce experiences in 2021, including the ability for creators to share links to products, support for affiliate sales, and even livestreamed shopping. Now, we&#8217;ve got a first look at some of the live tests around e-commerce that TikTok has in progress.</p>
<p>The company recently launched a &#8220;<a href="https://seller-id.tiktok.com/university/home">Seller University</a>&#8221; website aimed at its Indonesian audience, where it details how brands can advertise their products on video. Here, TikTok explains brands have two ways to advertise, either by making their own videos or by working with affiliates.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you choose to sell through your personal page, you can then display products via livestreaming or short videos, with product anchors embedded in your content. When customers view your content, they can be redirected to the corresponding product detail page by clicking on the product anchor,&#8221; the site explains.</p>
<p>The Seller University also details other information, like how to sign up to be a TikTok seller and what sort of products are prohibited, along with other rules and guidelines.</p>

<p>TikTok Sellers have to provide their contact information, including location, phone, email, shop and warehouse location, and other required documentation to be approved. They can then set up a Seller profile, where they can manage other users associated with their account. Once live as a Seller on the app, they&#8217;ll have a &#8220;TikTok Shop&#8221; on the second tab on their profile, which users can view when they visit the page.</p>
<p>When their videos showing their products are viewed, there are &#8220;product anchors&#8221; embedded in the content. Clicking on these anchors will redirect the viewer to the product detail page where they can transact. In addition, brands can collaborate with TikTok influencers to promote their products through a new &#8220;TikTok Affiliate&#8221; program.</p>

<p>TikTok told TechCrunch the program is a test of its e-commerce solutions in Indonesia, and one of several product tests in the area of e-commerce.</p>
<h3>Consumer advocacy groups file FTC complaint against edtech app Prodigy</h3>
<p>A coalition of 20 consumer advocacy groups, led by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, have filed an FTC complaint against the popular edtech app Prodigy, which offers a math learning app for web and mobile. The app is designed much like modern-day freemium games, with math &#8220;battles&#8221; designed to improve math skills, grades and test scores.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges a variety of abuses, including how it aggressively pushes kids using the free version provided to schools to nag parents for the paid $59 annual subscription, which includes a richer gaming experience.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2115505" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="494" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg 1140w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?resize=300,218 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?resize=768,558 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?resize=680,494 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The groups also take issue with the app&#8217;s in-app rewards and badges &#8212; some of which are only available to paid users, including fancier loot boxes &#8212; saying these features cause division between those who pay and those who can&#8217;t. And it alleges that Prodigy&#8217;s claims about educational improvements don&#8217;t hold merit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2115507" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="442" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg 1204w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?resize=768,499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?resize=680,442 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>In response, Prodigy says it takes the concerns seriously, but over 95% of users play the game for free and the business model involving the paid membership is how free access is provided.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without this model, we would be required to put all of our educational content behind a paywall, which contradicts our mission of providing full access to fun and engaging math learning,&#8221; a company spokesperson said. &#8220;The alternative would be to generate revenue via advertising, which is not a model we believe best benefits or protects our users. We never show third-party ads on our platform, nor do we sell or lease any other user information to third parties,&#8221; they noted.</p>
<p>The FTC has stepped up its enforcement over how apps targeting children can behave, with a focus on data collection practices and COPPA violations, which has resulted in fines for apps like TikTok and YouTube. This complaint, however, is not about children&#8217;s privacy, but rather how they&#8217;re being marketed to via edtech.</p>

<p>Robinhood&#8217;s CEO Vlad Tenev <a href="https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/robinhood-gamestop-reddit-hearing-congress/">testified before Congress</a> this week over the GameStop frenzy.

AOC pointed out that Robinhood isn&#8217;t truly free, it&#8217;s just hiding the cost from retail investors by subsidizing free trades with payment for order flow. (A percentage of its revenue Tenev ridiculously claimed he couldn&#8217;t recall, saying only &#8220;it&#8217;s over 50%.&#8221;)</p>

Dispo&#8217;s gimmick is that users have to wait 24 hours to see the photos they snap.</p>

<p>The updated version of <a href="https://www.zillow.com/z/3d-home/">Zillow&#8217;s 3D Home app</a> introduced new technology that combines into one interface 3D Home tours, listing photos and AI-generated floor plans. To create the floor plans and home tour, the app uses computer vision and machine learning on panoramic photos the agent or photographer captured using the app and a 360-degree camera. The app also leverages AI to predict things like room dimensions and square footage. Both the home tour and floor plan can then be automatically uploaded to the lists and added to a website, MLS or shared on email/social media.</p>
<p>Due to the pandemic, <span class="il">Zillow</span> 3D Home tours published on for-sale listings increased 255% during 2020 as customers used it as a safer way to tour properties, the company also noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another week and the biggest story in a sea of big stories continues to center on SPACs, these blank-check companies that raise capital through IPOs expressly to acquire a privately held company and take it public. But some industry watchers as starting to wonder: Is the party just getting started, with more early guests still trickling in? Have we reached the party&#8217;s peak, with the music still thumping? Or did someone just quietly barf in the corner, an indicator it&#8217;s time to wrap things up before something worse happens?</p>
<p>It certainly feels like things are in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-spac-boom-visualized-in-one-chart-11612962000">full swing</a>. Just today, B Capital, the venture firm cofounded by Facebook cofounder Eduardo Saverin, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1844740/000114036121005525/nt10020541x1_s1.htm">registered plans</a> to raise a $300 million SPAC. Mike Cagney, the fintech entrepreneur who founded SoFI and more recently founded Figure, a fintech company in both the home equity and blockchain space, raised <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/77969/Fintech-SPAC-Figure-Acquisition-I-prices-$250-million-IPO;-led-by-former-So">$250 million</a> for his SPAC. Even Michael Dell has made the leap, with his family office registering plans this afternoon to raise a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-msd-capital-ipo/blank-check-firm-led-by-ex-goldman-banker-aims-for-500-million-ipo-idUSKBN2AJ2LC">$500 million</a> blank-check company.</p>
<p>Altogether, according to Renaissance Capital, 16 blank-check companies raised $3.4 billion this week, and new filers continue to flood into the IPO pipeline, with <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/78016/US-IPO-Weekly-Recap-The-IPO-market-takes-its-annual-February-break-in-a-1-I">45 SPACs</a> submitting initial filings this week (compared with 10 traditional IPO filings). Perhaps it’s no wonder that we’re starting to see headlines like one in Yahoo News just yesterday titled, &#8220;<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/why-some-spac-investors-may-get-burned-192802863.html">Why some SPAC investors may get burned.&#8221;</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Interestingly, such headlines could gum up the SPAC machine. So argues Ivana Naumovska, an assistant professor at INSEAD, in a new Harvard Business Review piece titled, “<a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/the-spac-bubble-is-about-to-burst">The SPAC Bubble is About to Burst</a>.”</p>
<p>Naumovska points to research showing that when more people adopt a practice, it will become increasingly widespread due to growing awareness and legitimacy. Yet when it comes to something that’s more controversial &#8212; which it could be argued that SPACs are &#8212; outsider concern and skepticism also grows as the practice becomes more widely used. Thus are born headlines like that one in Yahoo Finance.</p>
<p>Naumovska has studied this phenomenon before, focusing on earlier reverse mergers that, as she notes, &#8220;surged in the mid-2000s, outnumbering IPOs in some years, and peaked in 2010, before falling off a cliff in 2011.&#8221; She says she and fellow researchers collected a plethora of data on the use of reverse mergers and market responses to them, including how the media evaluated such vehicles. Of the 267 articles published between 2001 and 2012, she says, 6 were positive, 148 were neutral, 113 were negative.</p>
<p>Notably and unsurprisingly, the negative articles grew as the number of reverse merger transactions involving firms with relatively low reputations increased. And as the media picked up on these companies, so did regulators, and with investors, regulators, and the media feeding off one another’s signals, the party came to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, most of the coverage around SPACs right now remains <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/is-anything-too-big-to-be-spacd/">neutral</a>. If business reporters are privately skeptical of SPACs, they are reserving judgment, possibly because save for some highly concerning cases &#8212;  like when the electric truck startup Nikola was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/business/nikola-trevor-milton-resigns.html">accused of fraud</a> &#8212; there isn’t much to criticize yet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to judge many of the SPACs raised over the last six months, as they have yet to announce their targets (SPACS have two years from the time they raise funds to zero in on a target, or else give back their IPO proceeds).</p>
<p>The argument that most investors have for creating a SPAC &#8212; which is that a lot of so-called unicorn companies are ready to be publicly traded &#8212; resonates, too, given how <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2020/02/26/why-more-businesses-are-choosing-to-stay-private/?sh=18f56c706400">bloated</a> the private market has become.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, some of the merger deals that critics have long expected would begin to unravel have not, like Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company that kicked off SPAC mania when it went public in the <a href="https://www.space.com/virgin-galactic-goes-public-nyse-stock-exchange.html">fall of 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Sir Richard Branson founded the company in 2004 in order to fly passengers on suborbital spaceflights, but even after putting off plans yet again to attempt a rocket-powered flight to suborbital space last week, its shares &#8212; which have more than doubled since January&#8211; remain in the figurative stratosphere. (The company, which reported almost no revenue last year, is currently valued at $12 billion.)</p>
<p>Other offerings haven&#8217;t gone quite as smoothly. Clover Health, a health insurance company that, like Virgin Galactic, was taken public via a SPAC organized by famed investor Chamath Palihapitiya, is &#8220;facing a confluence of existential threats&#8221; to its business, as observed in a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2021/02/17/billionaire-clover-health-ceo-vivek-garipallis-expletive-ridden-tirade/?sh=56a63464140a">deep dive</a> by Forbes.</p>
<p>Among others poking into its business practices are the The Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the short-seller Hindenburg Research, which has accused it of making misleading claims. (Clover has rebutted the allegations, but Forbes says it is still facing at least three class-action lawsuits over its failure to disclose ahead of its IPO that the DOJ was investigating the company.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get it,&#8221; said skeptic Steve Jurvetson last month in conversation with this editor of the SPAC frenzy. The veteran venture capitalist, who sits on the board of SpaceX, said there are &#8220;some good companies [being taken public]. Don&#8217;t get me wrong; they aren&#8217;t all fraudulent.&#8221; But many are &#8220;early-stage venture companies,&#8221; he noted, &#8220;and they don&#8217;t need to meet the forecasting requirements that the SEC normally requires of an IPO, so [SPAC sponsors are] specifically looking for companies that don&#8217;t have any operating numbers to show [because they] can make any forecasts they want . . .That&#8217;s the whole racket.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Evd4PI0mQn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/a-deep-dive-on-steve-jurvetson-and-maryanna-saenkos-200-million-new-fund/">Steve Jurvetson and Maryanna Saenko on their new fund, SPACs and the great tech exodus</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Steve Jurvetson and Maryanna Saenko on their new fund, SPACs and the great tech exodus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/a-deep-dive-on-steve-jurvetson-and-maryanna-saenkos-200-million-new-fund/embed/#?secret=Evd4PI0mQn" data-secret="Evd4PI0mQn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>If others agree with Jurvetson, they hesitate to say so publicly. For one thing, plenty of VCs would be happy to see their portfolio companies taken public however possible, including via SPAC. Others who haven&#8217;t formed SPACs of their own are reserving the right to consider them down the road.</p>
<p>Ed Sim of Boldstart Ventures in New York is one of few VCs in recent months to say outright, when asked, that his firm isn&#8217;t considering raising a SPAC any time soon. &#8220;<a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/7976041">I have zero interest in that honestly</a>,&#8221; says Sim. &#8220;You can come back to me if you see my name or Boldstart [affiliated] with a SPAC two years from now,&#8221; he adds, laughing.</p>
<p>Many more investors stress that when it comes to SPACs, it&#8217;s all about who is sponsoring what. Among them is Kevin Mayer, the former Disney exec and, briefly, the CEO of the social network TikTok. In a call yesterday, Mayer advanced the idea that there are &#8220;many fewer public companies now than there were 10 years ago, so there is a need for supplying another way to go public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mayer has a vested interest in SPACs. Just yesterday, along with former Disney colleague Tom Staggs, he registered plans for a<a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/77960/TMT-focused-SPAC-Forest-Road-Acquisition-II-files-for-a-$300-million-IPO"> second a SPAC, </a>after it was announced earlier this month that their <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/forest-road-spac-kevin-mayer-tom-staggs-buys-digital-fitness-group-beachbody-company-1234691065/">first SPAC</a> will be used to take public the digital fitness specialist Beachbody. But Mayer also argues that not every SPAC should be judged by the same yardstick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I think it&#8217;s overdone? Sure, everyone and their brother is now getting to a SPAC, so yeah, that does seem a bit ridiculous. But I think . . . the wheat will be separated from the chaff very, very soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may need to be if SPACs are to endure.</p>
<p>While the mechanism has won over powerful adherents, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">working against SPACs are numbers that are starting to trickle in and that don&#8217;t look so great.</span></p>
<p>Last week, for example, Bloomberg Law shared its analysis of the companies that went public as a result of a merger with a SPAC dating back to Jan. 1, 2019 (and for which at least one month of post-merger performance data is available). In it, 14 out of 24 reported a depreciation in value as of one month following the completion of the merger, and one-third of the companies reported a year-to-date depreciation in value.</p>
<p>The number of securities lawsuits filed by SPAC stockholders post-merger is also on the rise, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-post-merger-spac-performance-is-mixed">noted the outlet</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Given the astonishing rate at which SPACs are now being formed anyway, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the question of whether the phenomenon is sustainable is one that more people are naturally </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/11/19/a-sober-look-at-spacs/">beginning to ask</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For her part, Professor Naumovska thinks she already knows the answer.</span></p>

<p><strong>The big story: Uber loses UK legal challenge</strong></p>
<p>The United Kingdom&#8217;s Supreme Court has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">reaffirmed earlier rulings</a> that the Uber drivers who brought the case — which dates back to 2016 — are workers, not independent contractors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Drivers are in a position of subordination and dependency in relation to Uber such that they have little or no ability to improve their economic position through professional or entrepreneurial skill,&#8221; the court said in a statement. &#8220;In practice the only way in which they can increase their earnings is by working longer hours while constantly meeting Uber’s measures of performance.”</p>
<p>Uber, while acknowledging the decision, emphasized that it applies to the specific group of drivers who brought the case, many of whom are no longer driving through the app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has fired Margaret Mitchell, the founder and former co-lead of the company&#8217;s ethical AI team. Mitchell announced the news <a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1362885356127801345">via a tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Google confirmed Mitchell&#8217;s firing in a statement to TechCrunch; Google said:</p>
<blockquote><p>After conducting a review of this manager’s conduct, we confirmed that there were multiple violations of our code of conduct, as well as of our security policies, which included the exfiltration of confidential business-sensitive documents and private data of other employees.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In January, Google revoked corporate access from AI ethicist Margaret Mitchell for reportedly using automated scripts to find examples of mistreatment of Dr. Timnit Gebru, <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-google-is-investigating-the-actions-of-another-top-ai-ethicist-50030739-ea3d-4ea2-b452-c228b4fc9773.html">according to Axios</a>. Gebru says she was fired from Google while Google has maintained that she resigned.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Mitchell <a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1357819673455202304">published</a> the email she said she sent to Google&#8217;s press team the day her corporate email access was cut off. The email spoke about Gebru&#8217;s firing and how it appeared to be &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">fueled by the same underpinnings of racism and sexism that our AI systems, when in the wrong hands, tend to soak up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Mitchell&#8217;s letter, which you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ERi2crDToYhYjEjxRoOzO-uOUeLgdoLPfnx1JOErg2w/edit">read in full here,</a> details the different ideas and structures at play that led to Dr. Gebru&#8217;s departure from Google. Mitchell argues what happened to Gebru &#8220;appears to stem from the same lack of foresight that is at the core of modern technology, and so itself serves as an example of the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mitchell adds:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firing seems to have been fueled by the same underpinnings of racism and sexism that our AI systems, when in the wrong hands, tend to soak up. How Dr. Gebru was fired is not okay, what was said about it is not okay, and the environment leading up to it was &#8212; and is &#8212; not okay. Every moment where </span><a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1334352694664957952"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Dean and Megan Kacholia do not take responsibility for their actions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is another moment where the company as a whole stands by silently as if to intentionally send the horrifying message that Dr. Gebru deserves to be treated this way. Treated as if she were inferior to her peers. Caricatured as irrational (and worse). Her research writing publicly defined as below the bar.  Her scholarship publicly declared to be insufficient. For the record: Dr. Gebru has been treated completely inappropriately, with intense disrespect, and she deserves an apology. </span></p></blockquote>
<p>The letter went on to discuss the ethical artificial intelligence approach to developing technology, how Mitchell came to lead and then co-lead the ethical AI team with Gebru and what ultimately happened. Within the next year, Mitchell said she wanted &#8220;those of us in positions of privilege and power&#8221; to come to terms with &#8220;the discomfort of being part of an unjust system that devalued one of the world&#8217;s leading scientists, and keep something like this from ever happening again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mitchell&#8217;s firing comes shortly after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/google-has-a-new-responsible-ai-lead/">Google announced the appointment of Dr. Marian Croak</a> to lead its responsible artificial intelligence division. When we reached out to Google yesterday the company did not have a comment on Mitchell&#8217;s fate.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Google internally announced the results of its investigation of Gebru&#8217;s exit, <a href="https://www.axios.com/google-tweaks-diversity-research-policies-following-inquiry-8baa6346-d2a2-456f-9743-7912e4659ca2.html">according to Axios</a>. The company did not reveal what it found, but said it would implement some new policies to enhance diversity and inclusion at Google.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Mitchell and will update this story if we hear back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since the pandemic began, have you been walking more, or do you know someone who bought a new car? Perhaps you ran your first errand on a rented e-bike or scooter?</p>
<p>Over the last year, I&#8217;ve experimented with different mobility options to see which ones best suit my needs, as have most people I know. It can be challenging to maintain a recommended physical distance on a bus or subway. (After a decade-plus hiatus, I even briefly considered rejoining the ranks of automobile owners!)</p>

<hr />
<p>It took some getting used to, but I now enjoy traveling around San Francisco on a scooter or e-bike. Pre-pandemic, I was leery of riding two-wheeled vehicles in a city with a high rate of injury collisions, but there are fewer cars on the road than there used to be.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has spotlighted many of the weakest points in our transportation system, but some of the rapid shifts in consumer behavior are creating opportunities for tech once considered fanciful, like sidewalk delivery robots and eVTOLs (electric vertical and takeoff vehicles).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/10-investors-predict-maas-on-demand-delivery-and-evs-will-dominate-the-post-covid-future-of-mobility/">Transportation editor Kirsten Korosec reached out to 10 investors</a> to learn more &#8220;about the state of mobility, which trends they’re most excited about and what they’re looking for in their next investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s who she interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clara Brenner, co-founder and managing partner, Urban Innovation Fund</li>
<li>Shawn Carolan, partner, Menlo Ventures</li>
<li>Dave Clark, partner, Expa</li>
<li>Abhijit Ganguly, senior manager, Goodyear Ventures</li>
<li>Rachel Holt, co-founder and general partner, Construct Capital</li>
<li>David Lawee, founder and general partner, CapitalG</li>
<li>Sasha Ostojic, operating partner, Playground Global</li>
<li>Sebastian Peck, managing director, InMotion Ventures</li>
<li>Natalia Quintero and Rachel Haot, Transit Innovation Partnership/Transit Tech Lab</li>

<p>Yesterday&#8217;s House Financial Services Committee hearing on the GameStop short squeeze saga was fairly typical: Most lawmakers used their time to grandstand and little new information was revealed.</p>
<p>But Alex Wilhelm found one tidbit: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/a-fraction-of-robinhoods-users-are-driving-its-runaway-growth/">Much of Robinhood&#8217;s revenue is generated from payment for order flow</a> (PFOF). Under the practice, market makers pay the trading platform for executing trades.</p>
<p>To get a sense of how much Robinhood&#8217;s high rollers contribute to the company&#8217;s general health, he calculated its PFOF revenues for the last three months of 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;Borrowing a term from the casino trade, these whales generate the bulk of the company’s revenue stream.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Why do SaaS companies with usage-based pricing grow faster?</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1990106" style="width: 797px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1990106" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1990106" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1144864948.jpg" alt="A piggy bank streaks down the road to riches on a skateboard and with a rocket strapped to his back." width="787" height="517" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1144864948.jpg 787w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1144864948.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1144864948.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1144864948.jpg?resize=768,505 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1144864948.jpg?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1144864948.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1990106" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=John+Lund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Lund <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>HubStop introduced usage-based pricing in 2011 to boost its retention rate, then near 70%.</p>
<p>When it went public three years later, its net revenue retention rate was edging close to 100%, &#8220;all without hurting the company’s ability to acquire new customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Offering new users frictionless onboarding, customer support and free credits is a proven method for making them more active — and loyal.</p>
<p>So, why do <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/why-do-saas-companies-with-usage-based-pricing-grow-faster/">public SaaS firms with usage-based pricing see faster growth</a>?</p>
<p>&#8220;Because they’re better at landing new customers, growing with them and keeping them as customers,&#8221; says Kyle Powar, VP of growth at OpenView.</p>

<p>In October 2018, private-market money valued Coinbase at around $8 billion. As of this week, it&#8217;s valued at $77 billion.</p>
<p>Similarly, Stripe is valued at $115 billion on secondary markets. In the middle of last year, that figure was closer to $36 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would I line up to pay $77 billion for Coinbase?&#8221; asked Alex. &#8220;Probably not, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/paying-115b-for-stripe-or-77b-for-coinbase-might-be-quite-rational/">that doesn’t mean that the public markets won’t.</a>&#8221;</p>

<p>Natasha Mascarenhas reports that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/pandemic-era-growth-and-spacs-are-helping-edtech-startups-graduate-early/">some edtech startups are hitching rides with special purpose acquisition vehicles</a> so they can speed up their journey to the public markets.</p>
<p>To learn more, she interviewed Susan Wolford, chairperson of $200 million SPAC Edify Acquisition, and Nerdy CEO Chuck Cohn. Nerdy, parent company of Varsity Tutors, is going through a reverse merger with TPG Pace Tech Opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s less about going into the public markets and more about that this transaction allows us to take an offensive position and lean into the big opportunities,&#8221; Cohn said.</p>

<p>When I saw that Alex Wilhelm wrote on Tuesday about two more startups that were taking the SPAC route to public markets, I briefly wondered if we&#8217;ve been covering special purpose acquisition companies <em>too</em> frequently.</p>
<p>After I read his first sentence, I realized Alex made exactly the right call because the trend that emerged in 2020 may be turning into a actual wave: This week, pet e-commerce company Rover and fintech startup MoneyLion both announced that they&#8217;re planning SPAC-led debuts.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/investors-spac-push-could-revamp-the-private-market-money-game/">On Monday, Alex covered the news</a> that Lerer Hippeau Acquisition Corp. and Khosla Ventures Acquisition Co. I, II and III. filed S-1 filings last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to wonder if every VC worth a damn in the future will have their own raft of SPAC offerings,&#8221; says Alex.</p>
<p>Wrote Lerer Hippeau Acquisition Corp.:</p>
<blockquote><p>With our portfolio now maturing to the stage at which many are considering the public markets, we view SPACs as a natural next step in the evolution of our platform.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If we are not careful, every entry of this column could consist of SPAC news,&#8221; writes Alex.</p>

<p>Fifteen U.S.-based institutions of higher learning have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/from-dorm-rooms-to-board-rooms-how-universities-are-promoting-entrepreneurship/">joined forces to create the University Technology Licensing Program LLC (UTLP)</a>.</p>
<p>The program makes it easier for entrepreneurs and investors to find IP that can drive their companies forward, but it&#8217;s also an attempt to repair what one participant calls &#8220;the somewhat broken interface between universities and very large companies in the tech space.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Incredible growth people are independent and creative and are drawn to environments that explicitly value these traits,&#8221; says Jessica Li, a content/growth professional who was previously a VC.</p>
<p>To land top talent, &#8220;demonstrate that you have a team structure in place where a growth marketer could fit in and thrive.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp said earlier this week that it will allow users to review its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/elon-musk-dunks-on-facebook-and-recommends-signal-in-wake-of-u-s-capitol-insurrection-attempt/">planned privacy update</a> at “their own pace” and will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/following-backlash-whatsapp-to-roll-out-in-app-banner-to-better-explain-its-privacy-update/">display a banner to better explain the changes</a> in its terms. But what happens to its users who do not accept the terms by the May 15 deadline?</p>
<p>In an email to one of its merchant partners, reviewed by TechCrunch, Facebook-owned WhatsApp said it will “slowly ask” such users to comply with the new terms “in order to have full functionality of WhatsApp” starting May 15.</p>
<p>If they still don’t accept the terms, “for a short time, these users will be able to receive calls and notifications, but will not be able to read or send messages from the app,” the company added in the note. The company confirmed to TechCrunch that the note accurately characterizes its plan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The &#8220;short time&#8221; will span a few weeks. In the note, WhatsApp linked to a newly <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-happens-when-our-terms-and-privacy-policy-updates-take-effect">created FAQ page</a> that says its policy related to inactive users will apply after May 15.</p>
<p>WhatsApp’s <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/about-inactive-account-deletion">policy for inactive users</a> states that accounts are “generally deleted after 120 days of inactivity.”</p>
<p>The instant messaging service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/whatsapp-faces-legal-challenge-over-privacy-in-its-biggest-market/">received backlash from some of its users</a> &#8212; including those in India, its biggest market &#8212; last month after an in-app alert said they had until February 8 to agree to the planned privacy terms, which are being made to reflect its recent push into e-commerce, if they wished to continue using the service.</p>
<p>Following backlash, WhatsApp said its planned privacy update had created confusion among some of its users. &#8220;We’ve heard from so many people how much confusion there is around our recent update. There’s been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help everyone understand our principles and the facts,&#8221; it wrote in a blog post last month.</p>
<p>Since 2016, WhatsApp&#8217;s privacy policies have granted the service permission to share with Facebook certain metadata such as user phone numbers and device information. The new terms will allow Facebook and WhatsApp to share payment and transaction data in order to help them better target ads as the social juggernaut <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/facebook-adds-carts-to-whatsapp-to-make-shopping-easier/">broadens its e-commerce offerings</a> and looks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/02/facebook-warned-over-privacy-risks-of-merging-messaging-platforms/">merge its messaging platforms</a>.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago/">used by over 2 billion users</a>, last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15/">delayed enforcing the new policy by three months</a> and has been explaining its terms to users ever since &#8212; though its <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/giving-more-time-for-our-recent-update">explanations</a> <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/answering-your-questions-about-whatsapps-privacy-policy?lang=en">hadn&#8217;t explicitly</a> addressed what it planned to do with users who didn&#8217;t accept the terms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brex is the latest fintech to apply for a bank charter.</p>
<p>The fast-growing company, which sells a credit card tailored for startups with Emigrant Bank currently acting as the issuer,<a href="https://www.brex.com/posts/brex-ILC-filing-announcement/"> announced Friday</a> that it has submitted an application with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI) to establish Brex Bank.</p>
<p>The industrial bank will be located in Draper, Utah, and be a wholly owned subsidiary of Brex.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has tapped former Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) exec Bruce Wallace to serve as the subsidiary&#8217;s CEO. He served in several roles at SVB, including COO, chief digital officer and head of global services. It also has named Jean Perschon, the former CFO for UBS Bank USA, to be the Brex Bank CFO.</p>
<p>Last May, Brex announced that it had raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/brex-brings-on-150m-in-new-cash-in-case-of-an-extended-recession/">$150 million in a Series C extension</a> from a group of existing investors, including DST Global and Lone Pine Capital.</p>

<p>With that raise, Brex, which was co-founded by Henrique Dubugras and Pedro Franceschi, had amassed $465 million in venture capital funding to date.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement today that &#8220;Brex Bank will expand upon its existing suite of financial products and business software, offering credit solutions and FDIC insured deposit products to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).&#8221;</p>
<p>Offering credit products to small businesses has become a popular product offering and source of revenue for tech companies serving entrepreneurs, including Shopify and Square in the commerce arena. Likewise, offering business-focused bank accounts, like <a href="https://www.shopify.com/balance">Shopify Balance</a>, which is currently in development with a plan to launch sometime this year in the U.S.</p>
<p>These financial products can provide additional opportunities for revenue on interest and cost of borrowing for these companies, which might have better insight into the risk profiles of the types of businesses they serve than traditional lenders and FIs.</p>
<p>“Brex and Brex Bank will work in tandem to help SMBs grow to realize their full potential,” said Wallace.</p>
<p>Brex is based in San Francisco and counts Kleiner Perkins Growth, YC Continuity Fund, Greenoaks Capital, Ribbit Capital, IVP and DST Global, as well as Peter Thiel and Affirm CEO Max Levchin, among its investors. It currently has over 400 employees, and though it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/brex-the-credit-card-for-startups-cuts-staff-amid-restructuring/">had significant layoffs mid-year in 2020</a>, it cited restructuring rather than financial difficulty as the cause of that downsize.</p>
<p>Other fintechs that have made moves toward bank charters include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/varo-bank-raises-another-63m-led-by-nba-star-russell-westbrook/">Varo Bank, which this week raised another $63 million</a>, and SoFi, which last October was granted preliminary approval for a national bank charter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2017, Ironclad founder and CEO Jason Boehmig was looking to raise a Series A. As a former lawyer, Boehmig had a specific process for fundraising and an ultimate goal of finding the right investors for his company.</p>
<p>Part of Boehmig&#8217;s process was to ask people in the San Francisco Bay Area about their favorite place to work. Many praised RelateIQ, a company founded by Steve Loughlin who had sold it to Salesforce for $390 million and was brand new to venture at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to meet Steve and had kind of put two and two together,&#8221; said Boehmig. &#8220;I was like, &#8216;There&#8217;s this founder I&#8217;ve been meaning to connect with anyways, just to pick his brain, about how to build a great company, and he also just became an investor.'&#8221;</p>
<p>On this week&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, the duo discussed how the Ironclad pitch excited Loughlin about leading the round. (So excited, in fact, he signed paperwork in the hospital on the same day his child was born.) They also discussed how they&#8217;ve managed to build trust by working through disagreements and the challenges of pricing and packaging enterprise products.</p>
<p>As with every episode of Extra Crunch Live, they also gave feedback on pitch decks submitted by the audience. (If you&#8217;d like to see your deck featured on a future episode, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">send it to us using this form.</a>)</p>

<h2>Episode breakdown:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The pitch — 2:30</li>
<li>How they operate — 23:00</li>
<li>The problem of pricing — 29:00</li>
<li>Pitch deck teardown — 35:00</li>
</ul>
<h2>The pitch</h2>
<p>When Boehmig came in to pitch Accel, Loughlin remembers feeling ambivalent. He had heard about the company and knew a former lawyer was coming in to pitch a legal tech company. He also trusted the reference who had introduced him to Boehmig, and thought, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take the meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, Boehmig dove into the pitch. The company had about a dozen customers that were excited about the product, and a few who were expanding use of the product across the organization, but it wasn&#8217;t until the ultimate vision of Ironclad was teased that Loughlin perked up.</p>
<p>Loughlin realized that the contract can be seen as a core object that could be used to collaborate horizontally across the enterprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was when the lightbulb went off and I realized this is actually much bigger,&#8221; said Loughlin. &#8220;This is not a legal tech company. This is core horizontal enterprise collaboration in one of the areas that has not been solved yet, where there is no great software yet for legal departments to collaborate with their counterparts.&#8221;</p>
<p>He listed all the software that those same counterparts had to let them collaborate: Salesforce, Marketo, Zendesk. Any investor would be excited to hear that a potential portfolio company could match the likes of those behemoths. Loughlin was hooked.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a slide that I&#8217;m guessing Jason didn&#8217;t think much of, as it was just the data around the business, but I got pretty excited about it,&#8221; said Loughlin. &#8220;It said, for every legal user Ironclad added, they added nine other users from departments like sales, marketing, customer service, etc. It was evidence that this theory of collaboration could be true at scale.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin is known for its usually mild winters. But on February 12, a winter storm hit the state &#8212; leading to over a week of freezing temperatures. This has resulted in a statewide disaster with millions of Texas residents losing power or water, or both.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s too early to tell the exact toll this has all taken in loss of life, property damage and economic activity. But it’s clear that this disaster is, and will continue to be, devastating on many levels. Austin-area hospitals even lost water this week, as an indication of how bad things have been.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since last Thursday, my own household lost power and got it back multiple times. On February 17, we lost water, with no idea of when it will be restored. I realize there are many worse off than me, so I’ll spare you the pity party, but it’s definitely been a humbling experience. Boiling snow/ice for toilet water and rationing the little bottled water we had left with fear of frozen/bursting pipes. At least we have been warm the past couple of days, as many still don’t have power.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, over the past few months (and years, really), Austin has been making headlines for other news &#8212; namely the fact that so many tech companies, founders (ahem, Elon) and investors are either moving their headquarters here (Oracle), building significant factories (Tesla) or offices (Apple, Google, Facebook) here, or are thinking about relocating entirely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of state income taxes has been a big draw, as well as the housing/land/office prices that are affordable when compared to those in the Bay Area. This is nothing new, but only accelerated as the pandemic has encouraged/forced more remote work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, some of the very things that have led to the state being more attractive to companies have also contributed to the crisis: Fewer taxes means less money for infrastructure, for one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it goes beyond that. Many other states have had freezing cold temperatures without the loss of power and water that Texas is currently experiencing. As The Washington Post </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/16/ercot-texas-electric-grid-failure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported earlier this week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the state’s choice to deregulate electricity led to “a financial structure for power generation that offers no incentives to power plant operators to prepare for winter. In the name of deregulation and free markets, critics say, Texas has created an electric grid that puts an emphasis on cheap prices over reliable service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Elon shared his disappointment on Twitter:</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/ERCOT_ISO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ERCOT_ISO</a> is not earning that R</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s fair to say Texas has attracted widespread criticism of its handling of this new crisis &#8212; both in terms of its lack of preparation and mismanagement (Sen. Cruz, we’re looking at you). But are the events of the past week going to take away some of the shine on Austin as a potential relocation destination for tech and investors? Will this deter people from wanting to move here? Isn’t it also ironic that some folks who didn&#8217;t want to move here due to the scorching summer temperatures are now also slamming the city/state for the impacts of a major winter storm?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I did what many other enterprising tech reporters might do in this situation, and took to Twitter. The results were pretty much as expected &#8212; varied and passionate on either side.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were many tweets from Austinites who defended their city and praised how its residents have come together during crises:</span></i></p>

<p>And now some don&#39;t want to move to Texas because weather?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/mars-rover-perseverance-touches-down-tomorrow-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Perseverance</a> Mars rover <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/perseverance-lands-safely-on-mars-and-sends-back-its-first-images-of-the-surface/">landed safely yesterday</a>, but only after a series of complex maneuvers as it descended at high speed through the atmosphere, known by the team as the &#8220;seven minutes of terror.&#8221; NASA has just <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8866/nasas-perseverance-rover-sends-sneak-peek-of-mars-landing/">shared a hair-raising image</a> of the rover as it dangled from its jetpack above the Martian landscape, making that terror a lot easier to understand.</p>
<p>Published with others to the rover&#8217;s Twitter account (as always, in the first person), the image is among the first sent back from the rover; black-and-white shots from its navigation cameras appeared almost instantly after landing, but this is the first time we&#8217;ve seen the rover — or anything, really — from this perspective.</p>
<p>The image was taken by cameras on the descent stage or &#8220;jetpack,&#8221; a rocket-powered descent module that took over once the craft had sufficiently slowed via both atmospheric friction and its parachute. Once the heat shield was jettisoned, Perseverance scanned the landscape for a safe landing location, and once that was found, the jetpack&#8217;s job was to fly it there.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2113235" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113235" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2113235 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg" alt="Perseverance rover and its spacecraft in an exploded view showing its several main components." width="900" height="657" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg?resize=768,561 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg?resize=680,496 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113235" class="wp-caption-text">The image at the top of the story was taken by the descent stage&#8217;s &#8220;down-look cameras.&#8221; <strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>When it was about 70 feet above the landing spot, the jetpack would have deployed the &#8220;sky crane,&#8221; a set of cables that would lower the rover to the ground from a distance that safely allowed the jetpack to rocket itself off to a crash landing far away.</p>
<p>The image at top was taken just moments before landing — it&#8217;s a bit hard to tell whether those swirls in the Martian soil are hundreds, dozens or just a handful of feet below, but follow-up images made it clear that the rocks you can see are pebbles, not boulders.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115432" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-landing-pics-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115432" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2115432" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-landing-pics-2.jpg" alt="Photo of the Mars rover Perseverance's wheel and rocks on the surface." width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-landing-pics-2.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-landing-pics-2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-landing-pics-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-landing-pics-2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-landing-pics-2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-landing-pics-2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2115432" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>The images are a reminder that the processes we see only third-hand as observers of an HQ tracking telemetry data sent millions of miles from Mars are in fact very physical, fast and occasionally brutal things. Seeing such an investment of time and passion dangling from cords above a distant planet after a descent that started at 5 kilometers per second, and required about a hundred different things to go right or else end up just another crater on Mars&#8230; it&#8217;s sobering and inspiring.</p>
<p>That said, that first person perspective may not even be the most impressive shot of the descent. Shortly after releasing that, NASA published an astonishing image from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which managed to capture Perseverance mid-fall under its parachute:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115444" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115444" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2115444" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg" alt="Photo taken from 700km away by the Mars reconnaissance Orbiter of the Perseverance rover descending under its parachute." width="1024" height="577" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg 2121w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg?resize=1536,866 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg?resize=2048,1155 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance_descent.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2115444" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona</p></div></p>
<p>Keep in mind that MRO was 700 km away, and traveling at over 3 km/second at the time this shot was taken. &#8220;The extreme distance and high speeds of the two spacecraft were challenging conditions that required precise timing and for Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to both pitch upward and roll hard to the left so that Perseverance was viewable by HiRISE at just the right moment,&#8221; <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/jpl/hirise-captured-perseverance-during-descent-to-mars">NASA wrote in the description of the photo</a>.</p>
<p>Chances are we&#8217;re going to be treated to a fuller picture of the &#8220;seven minutes of terror&#8221; soon, once NASA collects enough imagery from Perseverance, but for now the images above serve as reminders of the ingenuity and skill of the team there, and perhaps a sense of wonder and awe at the capabilities of science and engineering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tracy Chou&#8217;s resume is impressive. She interned at RocketFuel, Google and Facebook before becoming a software engineer at Quora and Pinterest. She is also a major advocate for diversity within the tech industry, launching <a href="https://projectinclude.org/">Project Include</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>Now, she&#8217;s the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.blockpartyapp.com/">Block Party</a>, a platform aimed at making people feel safer on social media platforms.</p>
<p>Obviously, we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to announce that we&#8217;ll be sitting down with Chou at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TechCrunch Sessions: Justice</a> in early March.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/block-party-launch/">Block Party was born specifically out of Chou&#8217;s experience</a> working at places like Quora — building a block button was one of the first things she built after being harassed on the platform. As an advocate for diversity, and a big name in the tech sphere in general, Chou has had her fair share of experience with online harassment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last year has been one of financial hardship for billions, and among the specific hardships is the elementary one of paying for utilities, taxes and other government fees — the systems for which are rarely set up for easy or flexible payment. <a href="https://home.promise-pay.com/">Promise</a> aims to change that by integrating with official payment systems and offering more forgiving terms for fees and debts people can&#8217;t handle all at once, and has raised $20 million to do so.</p>
<p>When every penny is going toward rent and food, it can be hard to muster the cash to pay an irregular bill like water or electricity. They&#8217;re less likely to be shut off on short notice than a mobile plan, so it&#8217;s safer to kick the can down the road&#8230; until a few bills add up and suddenly a family is looking at hundreds of dollars of unpaid bills and no way to split them up or pay over time. Same with tickets and other fees and fines.</p>
<p>The CEO and co-founder of Promise, Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins, explained that this (among other places) is where current systems fall down. Unlike buying a TV or piece of furniture, where payment plans may be offered in a single click during online checkout, there frequently is no such option for municipal ticket payment sites or utilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have found that people struggling to pay their bills want to pay and will pay at extremely high rates if you offer them reminders, accessible payment options and flexibility. The systems are the problem — they are not designed for people who don’t always have a surplus of money in their bank accounts,&#8221; she told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;They assume for example that if someone makes their first payment at 10 PM on the 15th, they will have the same amount of money the next month on the 15th at 10 PM,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;These systems do not recognize that most people are struggling with their basic needs. Payments may need to be weekly or split up into multiple payment types.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even those that do offer plans still see many failures to pay, due at least partly to a lack of flexibility on their part, said Ellis-Lamkins — failure to make a payment can lead to the whole plan being cancelled. Furthermore, it may be difficult to get enrolled in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some cities offer payment plans but you have to go in person to sign up, complete a multiple-page form, show proof of income and meet restrictive criteria,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have been able to work with our partners to use self-certification to ease the process as opposed to providing tax returns or other documentation. Currently, we have over a 90% repayment rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Promise acts as a sort of middleman, integrating lightly with the agency or utility, which in turn makes anyone owing money aware of the possibility of the different payment system. It&#8217;s similar to how you might see various payment options, including installments, when making a purchase at an online shop.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115397" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115397" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2115397" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png" alt="Mobile and computer screens showing payment interfaces with optiosn to pay over time." width="1024" height="654" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png 1764w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=1536,980 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2115397" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Promise</p></div></p>
<p>The user enrolls in a payment plan (the service is mobile-friendly because that&#8217;s the only form of internet many people have) and Promise handles that end of it, with reminders, receipts and processing, passing on the money to the agency as it comes in — the company doesn&#8217;t cover the cost up front and collect on its own terms. Essentially it&#8217;s a bolt-on flexible payment mechanism that specializes in government agencies and other public-facing fee collectors.</p>
<p>Promise makes money by subscription fees (i.e. SaaS) and/or through transaction fees, whichever makes more sense for the given customer. As you might imagine, it makes more sense for a utility to pay a couple bucks to be more sure of collecting $500, than to take its chance on getting none of that $500, or having to resort to more heavy-handed and expensive debt collection methods.</p>
<p>Lest you think this is not a big problem (and consequently not a big market), Ellis-Lamkins noted a recent study from the California Water Boards showing there are 1.6 million people with a total of $1 billion in water debt in the state — one in eight households is in arrears to an average of $500.</p>
<p>Those numbers are likely worse than normal, given the immense financial pressure that the pandemic has placed on nearly all households — but like payment plans in other circumstances, households of many incomes and types find their own reason to take advantage of such systems. And pretty much anyone who&#8217;s had to deal with an obtusely designed utility payment site would welcome an alternative.</p>
<p>The new round brings the company&#8217;s total raised to over $30 million, counting $10 million it raised immediately after leaving Y Combinator in 2018. The funding comes from existing investors Kapor Capital, XYZ, Bronze, First Round, YC, Village, and others.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A lot of clients come to us saying they want to be more respected in their space. They know their competitors are trusted and they want the same recognition, if not more.</p>
<p>This feels even more important now after the absolute disaster that was 2020. Consumers and clients alike just want to be able to count on brands and not stress over whether they’re making the right decision.</p>
<p>Marketers seem to know this. When we teamed up with Semrush to <a href="https://blog.frac.tl/2021-data-backed-digital-marketing-predictions">explore keyword search data in 2020 related to marketing goals</a>, brand awareness and authority showed steady upward trends.</p>

<p>If you’re one of these marketers, I have some strategies you can use to improve your brand’s authority this year. It can’t happen overnight, but you can start implementing these strategies now to see results over time.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			I have some strategies you can use to improve your brand’s authority this year.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Strategy #1: Get media coverage</h2>
<p>Media coverage can build the authority of your brand in a few ways.</p>
<p>For one, it’s hard for people to trust you if they don’t know you exist. Of course, you can pay for ads or kill it on social to get your name out there, but media coverage has other benefits, as well.</p>
<p>When reputable publications and websites reference your brand and link to your site, they’re sending a signal that they trust what you have to say. It’s third-party confirmation that you know what you’re talking about and/or have something to offer.</p>
<p>For example, for our client Stoneside, we surveyed folks to see how many <a href="https://www.stoneside.com/resources/articles/plant-love">purchased and cared for houseplants in 2020</a>.</p>
<p>The report got coverage on <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/houseplant-popularity-blooms-during-pandemic-5077405">TreeHugger</a> and <a href="https://www.simplemost.com/trendiest-houseplants-2021/">Simplemost</a>, but it also served as great context for other articles, like <a href="https://hellogiggles.com/lifestyle/best-houseplants/">HelloGiggles</a> and <a href="https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/news/article/the-ultimate-guide-to-caring-for-houseplants-in-the-winter">The Weather Network</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, getting media coverage isn’t easy. You need newsworthy content or an expert opinion to contribute, and you need to know how to pitch it to writers.</p>
<h3>Small budget options</h3>
<p>Are there industry blogs you can write a guest post for? Are there peers in your industry who are looking for quotes for their content? Start building connections with other industry experts. Cite their work in your content and build a rapport.</p>
<p>For example, I sometimes work with marketing tool brands like Semrush and BuzzSumo because those brands align well with Fractl, as we all work in the same industry.</p>
<p>You can also sign up for <a href="https://www.helpareporter.com/">HARO</a>, in which journalists post requests to speak to particular types of experts. However, it’s not often you’ll see relevant requests, and even then it’s a toss up whether they’ll reach out to you specifically.</p>
<h3>Larger budget options</h3>
<p>If you can afford it, a combination of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/earn-the-best-backlinks-with-high-quality-content-and-digital-pr/">content marketing and digital PR </a>is the way to go. If you have resources internally — marketing folks who are savvy with data analysis and content creation — you can start by seeing if you have any internal data that would be interesting to a wider audience.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nearpod offers an edtech platform that K-12 teachers use in the classroom to create interactive slides filled with videos, quizzes, questions and other activities. Students can use any device to participate in the lessons in real time; there is also a student-paced learning mode. In response to the pandemic, Nearpod now also offers remote learning.</p>
<p>It’s been a busy year for Nearpod. The company, which was founded in 2012 by three Argentinian entrepreneurs, is now led by Pep Carrera, who was brought on in early 2020 just as the pandemic gained traction. The company has raised more than $30 million in venture capital according to Crunchbase, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/01/nearpod-raises-21-million-to-turn-mobile-devices-into-a-teaching-tool-rather-than-classroom-distraction/">we last profiled the startup in 2017 when it raised its Series B</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Renaissance has had their eyes on Nearpod for a while, said Brekhus, a former edtech founder himself. “We [Renaissance] were looking to connect more with lesson delivery and teacher engagement in the classroom and Nearpod has done that in an exceptional way,” he said.</p>
<p>Carrera and the entire team will continue work as usual, with the exception that now Carrera will be reporting to Chris Bauleke, CEO of Renaissance. “We’re looking to continue on our mission and combine our mission with Renaissance,” Carrera said.</p>

<p>Carrera, who grew up in Miami and moved back in 2020 from Michigan to lead Nearpod, has had quite a year. In a previous interview, he told me “My first day on the job, I’m driving to the office [near Dania Beach] and talking to the management team on the phone, and we decided that we needed to close the office due to the pandemic. This was in March.” Nearpod currently employs about 290 employees, most of whom are at their Dania Beach HQ.</p>
<p>Carrera wouldn’t clearly confirm if he was brought on to lead the company to an exit, but he did say the founders were looking at several growth options with the intention of better serving their users — teachers and students alike.</p>
<p>While the pandemic has posed many questions around remote work, under the leadership of Carrera, Nearpod has seen explosive growth in 2020. While Nearpod was primarily designed to be used in the classroom, the team was able to turn it into a remote-learning platform, too, making it a forerunner in K-12 distance education.</p>
<p>Nearpod is used in all 50 states, and in more than 1,800 school districts. In 2020 alone, the company grew by about 50% with more than 1 million teachers using the product, and 2-3 million students online per day. In a December 2020 interview, Carrera told me that all the money being generated right now is being put back into the company to propel its growth, which has been organic. Nearpod spends very little ad dollars on marketing. The real marketing, he said, is by word of mouth.</p>

<p>Prior to joining Nearpod, Carrera was president of ProQuest Books, where he led a team focused on providing innovative software that made the acquisition, management, and delivery of books to academic learners, researchers, and librarians efficient and impactful. And even prior to ProQuest, as president and COO, Carrera grew VitalSource Technologies, the digital learning division of Ingram Conte Group, serving more than 20 million learners per year globally, by 10x over his six years there.</p>
<p>M&amp;A activity in edtech has accelerated as VCs have splurged funding into the space. As my colleague Natasha Mascarenhas wrote recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/booming-edtech-ma-activity-brings-consolidation-to-a-fragmented-sector/">edtech M&amp;A is leading to mass consolidation in the space</a>. Nearpod joins a number of other edtech companies like Symbolab and Woot Math that have exited in recent months.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Financial institutions are falling behind the tech curve in delivering on the convenience consumers demand, leaving the door wide open for Big Tech companies like Apple, Amazon and Google to become our bankers. In November, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-pay-gpay-plex-digital-wallet-checking-account-citi-2020-11">Google redesigned its contactless payments service Google Pay</a>, merging the services of traditional banks with the seamless, convenient experience users expect from the likes of Big Tech.</p>
<p>But there’s a catch.</p>
<p>Despite the elaborate smoke and mirrors that Google has put up, one fact remains: Google is an advertising company with ads representing<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/"> 71% of its revenue sources in 2019</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			What happens when an advertising company now wants to be our bank?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>One must ask: What happens when an advertising company — armed with the terabytes of data points it has harvested from our personal emails, location data, song preferences and shopping lists — now wants to be our bank? The answer is potentially unsettling, especially considering the extraordinary neglect Big Tech has shown for user privacy, as seen<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/29/apple-google-facebook-amazon-congress-hearing/"> here</a>. And<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-demands-social-media-operations-data-from-big-tech-companies-11607980188"> here</a>. And <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-republican-state-attorneys-ad-practices-2020-12">here</a>.</p>
<p>As the marketplace is poked by yet another technocrat tentacle, this time in the heart of financial services, traditional banks that consumers and businesses once relied on find themselves at a crossroads. To retain market share, these institutions will need to continue investing in fintech so they can level up with convenience and personalization provided by new competitors while preserving trust and transparency.</p>
<h2>Traditional banks miss the digital mark</h2>
<p>Fintech holds the potential to fundamentally transform the financial services industry, enabling financial institutions (FIs) to operate more efficiently and deliver superb user experiences (UX).</p>
<p>But there’s a digital gap holding FIs back, especially small community banks and credit unions. Many have long struggled to compete with the deep pockets of national banks and the tech savvy of neo and challenger banks, like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/varo-will-use-funding-to-complete-regulatory-chartering-process-2020-6">Varo</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/monzo-raised-77-million-funding-sees-strong-paid-account-growth-2020-12">Monzo</a>. After investing more than $1 trillion in new technology from 2016 through 2019, the majority of banks globally have yet to see any financial boost from digital transformation programs, according to <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/only-half-of-banks-globally-are-making-significant-advancements-in-digital-transformation-resulting-in-lower-market-valuations-accenture-report-finds.htm">Accenture</a>.</p>
<p>Never before has this gap been more prevalent than amid the pandemic as customers migrated online en masse. In April 2020 alone, there was a 200% uptick in new mobile banking registrations and total mobile banking traffic jumped 85%, according<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/27/coronavirus-crisis-mobile-banking-surge-is-a-shift-likely-to-stick.html"> to Fidelity National Information Services (FIS)</a>.</p>
<h2>Data is the grand prize for Big Tech, not revenue from financial services</h2>
<p>Naturally, Big Tech players have recognized the opportunity to foray into financial services and flex their innovation muscles, giving banks and credit unions a strenuous run for their money. Consumers looking to digitize their finances must heed caution before they break up with traditional banks and run into the arms of Big Tech.</p>
<p>It’s important to bear in mind that the venture into payments and financial services is multipronged for Big Tech players. For example, in-house payments capabilities would not just provide companies focused on retail and commerce an additional revenue stream; it promises them more power and control over the shopping process.</p>
<p>Regulations in the U.S. might restrain this invasion to an extent, or at least limit a company’s ability to directly profit. Because let’s face it: the Big Tech players certainly aren’t asking for the regulatory &#8220;baggage&#8221; that comes with a bank charter.</p>
<p>But tech companies don’t need to profit directly from offerings like payments and wealth management, so long as they can hoard data. Gleaning insights on users’ spending patterns offers companies significant ROI in the long term, informing them how a user spends their money, if they have a mortgage, what credit cards they have, who they bank with, who they transact with, etc.</p>
<p>Financial behavior also potentially includes highly personal purchases, such as medications, insurance policies and even <a href="http://howtobemarried.us/2017/01/02/how-google-and-facebook-ruined-my-marriage-proposal/">engagement rings</a>.</p>
<p>With this laser sharp view into consumers’ wallets, imagine how much more valuable and domineering Google’s advertising platform will become.</p>
<h2>Banks must lead the charge in ethical data</h2>
<p>When it comes to the digitization of financial services, the old adage “with great power comes great responsibility” rings true.</p>
<p>Customer data is an incredible tool, allowing banks to cater to all consumers wherever they fall on the financial spectrum. For example, by analyzing a customers’ spending habits, a bank can offer tailored solutions that help them save, invest or spend money more wisely.</p>
<p>However, what if being a customer of these services means you’re then inundated with ads that respond directly to your searches and purchases? Or, even more insidiously, what if your bank now knows you so well that they can create a persona for you and proactively predict your needs and desires before even you can? That’s what the future looks like if you’re a customer of the Bank of Google.</p>
<p>It’s not enough to use customer data to refine product offerings. It must be done in a way that ensures security and privacy. By using data to personalize services, rather than bolster revenue behind the scenes, banks can distinguish a deeper understanding of consumer needs and gain trust.</p>
<p>Trust could become the weapon that banks use to defend their throne, especially as consumers become more aware of how their data is being used and they rebel against it. A <a href="https://www.idx.us/knowledge-center/ponemon-privacy-security-2020">Ponemon study on privacy and security</a> found that 86% of adults said they are &#8220;very concerned&#8221; about how Facebook and Google use their personal information.</p>
<p>In an environment where data collection is necessary but contentious, the main competitive advantage for banks lies in trust and transparency. A report from<a href="https://www.ncipher.com/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/ncipher-survey-reveals-americans-trust-banks-most-their-personal"> nCipher Security</a> found that consumers still overwhelmingly trust banks with their personal information more than they do other industries. At the same time, trust is waning for technology, with 36% of consumers reportedly less comfortable sharing information now than a year ago, according to<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/trusted-tech.html"> PwC.</a></p>
<p>Banks are in a prime position to lead the charge on ethical data strategy and the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, while still delivering what consumers need. Doing so will give them a leg up on collecting data over Big Tech in the long term.</p>
<h2>Looking toward a customer-centric, win-win future</h2>
<p>The financial services industry has reached a pivotal crossroads, with consumers being given the choice to leave traditional banks and hand over their personal data to Big Tech conglomerates so they can enjoy digital experiences, greater convenience and personalization.</p>
<p>But banks can still win back consumers if they take a customer-centric approach to digitization.</p>
<p>While Big Tech collects consumer data to support their advertising revenue, banks can win the hearts of consumers by collecting data to drive personalization and superior UXs. This is especially true for local community banks and credit unions, as their high-touch approach to services has always been their core differentiator. By delivering personalized interactions while ensuring the data collection is secure and transparent, banks can regain market share and win the hearts of customers again.</p>
<p>Big Tech has written the playbook for what not to do with our data, while also laying the framework for how to build exceptional experiences. Even if a bank lacks the technology expertise or the deep-pocket funding of Facebook, Google or Apple, it can partner with responsible fintechs that understand the delicate balance between ethical data usage and superior UXs.</p>
<p>When done right, everybody wins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech now has less stringent and extreme transportation requirements than when it debuted. Originally, the mRNA-based vaccine had to be maintained at ultra-low temperatures throughout the transportation chain in order to remain viable &#8212; between -76°F and -112°F. New stability data collected by Pfizer and BioNTech, which has been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for review, allow it to be stored at temps between 5°F and -13°F &#8212; ranges available in standard medical freezers found in most clinics and care facilities.</p>
<p>The vaccine should remain stable for up to two weeks at that temperature, which vastly improves the flexibility of its options for transportation and last-mile storage in preparation for administration to patients. To date, the vaccine has relied largely on existing &#8220;cold-chain&#8221; infrastructure to be in place in order for it to be able to reach the areas where it&#8217;s being used to inoculate patients. That limitation hasn&#8217;t been in place for Moderna&#8217;s vaccine, which is stable at even higher, standard refrigerator temperatures for up to a month.</p>
<p>This development is just one example of how work continues on the vaccines that are already being deployed under emergency approvals by health regulators across the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. Pfizer and BioNTech say they&#8217;re working on bringing those storage temp requirements down even further, so they could potentially approach the standard set by the Moderna jab.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Taken together with another fresh development, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/single-dose-of-pfizer-vaccine-is-85-effective-israeli-study-shows-11613723218">study results from Israeli researchers</a> that found just one shot of the ordinarily two-shot Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine could be as high as 85% effective on its own, this is a major development for global inoculation programs. The new requirements open up participation to a whole host of potential new players in supporting delivery and distribution &#8212; including ride-hailing and on-demand delivery players with large networks like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/amazon-offers-biden-resources-for-covid-19-vaccine-rollout/">Amazon, which has offered President Biden&#8217;s administration its support</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/uber-and-moderna-partner-on-covid-19-vaccine-access-and-information/">Uber, which is already teamed up with Moderna on vaccine education programs</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EfOTbvQ37M"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/amazon-offers-biden-resources-for-covid-19-vaccine-rollout/">Amazon offers Biden resources for COVID-19 vaccine rollout</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon offers Biden resources for COVID-19 vaccine rollout&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/amazon-offers-biden-resources-for-covid-19-vaccine-rollout/embed/#?secret=EfOTbvQ37M" data-secret="EfOTbvQ37M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This also opens the door for participation from a range of startups and smaller companies in both the logistics and the care delivery space that don&#8217;t have the scale or the specialized equipment to be able to offer extreme &#8220;cold-chain&#8221; storage. Technical barriers have been a blocker for some who have been looking for ways to assist, but lacked the necessary hardware and expertise to do so effectively.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Transportation is important to basically all people and is a real mess, so it will likely continue to be a hot topic and a source of investor interest for years to come."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The COVID-19 pandemic didn&#8217;t just upend the transportation industry. It laid bare its weaknesses, and conversely, uncovered potential opportunities.</p>
<p>Electric bikes sales spiked as public transit ridership evaporated. The public, and investors, began to recognize the utility of autonomous sidewalk delivery bots, which had once been viewed as mere novelties; the rising popularity of on-demand delivery prompted major retailers like Walmart to put more resources toward meeting consumers&#8217; needs and was one of the driving forces behind Uber&#8217;s decision to dump nearly every business unit and acquire Postmates.</p>
<p>The upshot? The transformation isn&#8217;t over. Following up on our May of 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/6-leading-mobility-vcs-discuss-the-road-ahead/">survey of the sector</a> and about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/7-top-mobility-vcs-discuss-covid-19-strategies-and-trends/">the impact of COVID-19 in particular</a>, TechCrunch spoke with 10 investors about the state of mobility, which trends they’re most excited about and what they’re looking for in their next investments. They see opportunities within software, particularly around mobility-as-a-service ventures and fleet management, continued demand for delivery and the push for electrification and batteries as well as the financial instrument — SPACs — that so many startups turned to in 2020. But there&#8217;s a lot more; they even see tailwinds for eVTOLs.</p>

<h2><strong>Clara Brenner, </strong><span class="s1">co-founder and </span><strong>managing partner, Urban Innovation Fund</strong></h2>
<p><strong> COVID-19 disrupted virtually every sector of the transportation industry. E-bike demand spiked, shared scooters initially struggled with some rebounding, ridership dwindled in ride-hailing and plummeted in public transit as consumers turned to cars and other alternatives. Meanwhile, demand for delivery skyrocketed and the autonomous vehicle industry went through a consolidation. What sectors will recover in 2021 and where are the new and unlikely opportunities to invest?</strong></p>
<p>COVID has exposed how rickety, insolvent and inequitable transit is in the U.S. Tools that empower cities to get compensated for private enterprise monetizing public infrastructure, and that ensure more equitable mobility access are exciting to me. Companies like Ride Report that help cities wrap their arms around all of the various public and private transit happening on their streets are exciting to me.</p>
<p><strong> What are the remaining opportunities for new startups, now that the autonomous vehicle industry is maturing with unprecedented consolidation, billion-dollar funding rounds and even a few low-volume commercial operations kicking off?</strong></p>
<p>Autonomous vehicles still have a long way to go, and there is still lots of room for new startups to make their mark on this space. In particular, we&#8217;ve been interested to see new entrants working on software tools to facilitate regulation and parking.</p>
<p><strong> What are the overlooked areas that you want to invest in, now that legacy automakers are shifting their portfolios to electric and new EV manufacturers are preparing to start production?</strong></p>
<p>We are very interested in the emerging fleet management space &#8212; and this is reflected in a number of our recent investments, including Electriphi (software to help fleets transition to electric) and Kyte (activating underutilized fleets to deliver a magical car rental experience). There are so many efficiencies that come from the fleet model for transportation &#8212; we think this will be an increasingly important area in the coming years.</p>
<p><strong> What is the fundraising model of success for transportation startups of the future? Do you expect early-stage funding in this sector to stay hot indefinitely? Do you see SPACs as the path to liquidity long term for a large number of startups in this sector?</strong></p>
<p>Transportation is important to basically all people and is a real mess, so it will likely continue to be a hot topic and a source of investor interest for years to come. However, for capital intensive transportation companies, the rounds have gotten so huge and expensive that they often make little sense for early-stage funders to participate in (they get diluted down hugely). Not that this seems to be dissuading many investors at the moment.</p>
<p>At the Urban Innovation Fund, we are spending a lot of time looking at software tools that enable larger hardware systems to work more efficiently. In terms of longer-term liquidity, SPACs represent a good option for many companies. That said, consolidation/mergers seems the most logical outcome for most companies in the transportation space &#8212; where strategic partnerships and integrations represent critical competitive advantages.</p>
<p><strong> What do you want to see from the Biden administration to accelerate innovation in the transportation sector?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see the Biden administration invest in our urban public transit systems &#8212; we know those systems can work beautifully. This may not accelerate &#8220;innovation,&#8221; but it will accelerate progress. This is a fundamental confusion in the VC space &#8212; innovation does not always equal progress.</p>
<h2><strong>Shawn Carolan, partner, Menlo Ventures</strong></h2>
<p><strong> COVID-19 disrupted virtually every sector of the transportation industry. E-bike demand spiked, shared scooters initially struggled with some rebounding, ridership dwindled in ride-hailing and plummeted in public transit as consumers turned to cars and other alternatives. Meanwhile, demand for delivery skyrocketed, and the autonomous vehicle industry went through consolidation. What sectors will recover in 2021, and where are the new and unlikely opportunities to invest?</strong></p>
<p>Pretty much all aspects of transportation will show recovery in 2021 with the population&#8217;s strong desire to get closer to normal, daily infections dropping, better mask compliance and increased vaccinations. The slowest will be commute-to-work use cases where the &#8220;new normal&#8221; for many will be 50%-100% fewer trips to the office on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Personal above shared movement: The psychological aftermath of the pandemic will persist for some time; people do and will continue to prefer more distance from others. This will lead to an acceleration of personal e-mobility solutions, both outright purchase and subscription models, including scooters and e-bikes (Unagi, where we are investors), asset-sharing models where riders aren&#8217;t in close proximity to strangers (GetAround, Turo, Lime, Bird), and single-ridership Ubers and Lyfts over UberPools and the like.</p>
<p>E-commerce supply chain: E-commerce has experienced a step-function in demand that will persist. Many shippers, trucking companies, manufacturers, distributors, etc., are still poorly connected, inefficient, and managed with paper and manual labor. The entire supply chain is ripe for Amazon-like efficiency and clarity; this will be driven by factory/warehouse level automation, robotics, best-of-breed fulfillment, and logistics software like our investments in Alloy, Fox Robotics and ShipBob.</p>
<p>Local delivery: Instacart, DoorDash, UberEats, etc. have brought local delivery mainstream. This trend will continue, and the larger incumbents will be working hard to get their act together for streamlining fulfillment rather than let the delivery fleets capture all of the upsides. Here companies like AnyCart that streamline ordering for grocery and recipes can partner versus compete with large grocery chains to deliver a compelling user experience and more reasonable prices.</p>
<p><strong> What are the remaining opportunities for new startups, now that the autonomous vehicle industry is maturing with unprecedented consolidation, billion-dollar funding rounds and even a few low-volume commercial operations kicking off?</strong></p>
<p>Until there is a teleporter, opportunities will always exist to make transportation better, faster and cheaper for a given distance. The big levers coming are:</p>
<p>Electric propulsion (on ground and air) yields a much lower cost per mile with lower opex motors and lower cost of recharge versus burning fuel. Opportunities exist here mostly for component companies making better batteries, motors and quiet propellers.</p>
<p>Better asset utilization: More efficient routing of vehicles (via routing software), higher capacity utilization (via more efficient marketplaces), and less downtime (through better scheduling and optimization algorithms) bring prices down.</p>
<p>Autonomy: Drivers are a big part of both the cost structure of transportation and also accidents. Human-level autonomy is still several years off, but we see lots of opportunity for autonomy in constrained environments (vehicles moving in repetitive patterns with few obstacles) and through the air.</p>
<p><strong> What are the overlooked areas that you want to invest in? Now that legacy automakers are shifting their portfolios to electric, and new EV manufacturers are preparing to start production, what are the overlooked areas that you want to invest in?</strong></p>
<p>We believe there are many transportation options beyond the car. Electric scooters, bikes, eVTOLs and others will keep growing in popularity for both utility and fun.</p>
<p><strong> What is the fundraising model of success for transportation startups of the future? Do you expect early-stage funding in this sector to stay hot indefinitely? Do you see SPACs as the path to liquidity long term for a large number of startups in this sector?</strong></p>
<p>Transportation will be a perennial sector of opportunity given how large a piece of consumer spend it occupies. Till the late 2000s, Silicon Valley barely touched transportation; this has, of course, changed dramatically since that period, particularly with the rise of Tesla.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s often quite capital intensive, though. Proving solid unit economics at a small scale before scaling will become more of a mandate given the machinations in the shared scooter market and how it showed that rapid growth doesn&#8217;t solve all woes.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d love to see better debt financing for electric vehicle companies. With their much lower operating costs and the low-interest macro environments, we find ourselves in, if there were large pools of clean transportation debt capital that could get more vehicles in consumers&#8217; lives via modest monthly fees that would go a long way in accelerating adoption. For example, Unagi all-access subscription offers a beautiful personal scooter for $30-$40 per month with great ROI given the usage patterns and reliability. If the debt markets line up to finance these at scale, it could be a nice win-win.</p>
<p>SPACs prove to be a good option for companies with high R&amp;D costs and a long horizon to reach traditional IPO milestones (i.e., &gt;$100 million ARR). Some of these projects aren&#8217;t going to work out, though and retail investors will be left holding the bag when the stocks crater. This will be the kickstarter &#8220;failed launch&#8221; phenomenon at a much larger scale, and there will be some nasty fallout.</p>
<p>Corporate venture capital, mainly industrial and automative focused companies, are getting more aggressive as the industry recognizes their need to adapt.</p>
<p><strong> What do you want to see from the Biden administration to accelerate innovation in the transportation sector?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;d love to see aggressive policies to further the acceleration of clean technology. Aside from the obvious environmental imperative to reduce carbon emissions, it makes good economic sense. Some examples would be personal and corporate tax credits for investing in anything that offers lower environmental impact.
