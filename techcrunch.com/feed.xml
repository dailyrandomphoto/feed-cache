										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spain&#8217;s on-demand delivery platform Glovo has announced what it&#8217;s calling &#8220;The Couriers Pledge&#8221; &#8212; an initiative which commits its business to setting a new &#8212; &#8220;fairer&#8221; &#8212; social rights standard for its gigging couriers.</p>
<p>The self-defined &#8220;standard&#8221; covers earnings, safety, communication and support for development opportunities.<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Glovo says the commitments will (eventually) apply to couriers working across its entire market footprint &#8212; whatever their exact employment status.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224832" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The delivery platform and dark store operator currently has 74,000 couriers across its market footprint (mostly in Europe and Africa) &#8212; but it says it expects to have 240,000 couriers active on the platform by 2023.</p>
<p>So the Pledge looks set to touch a lot of platform workers.</p>
<p>That said, the slated improvements to Glovers&#8217; (as it calls gig workers&#8217;) working conditions will not arrive overnight.</p>
<p>Instead, changes to bring its various regional operations in line with the Pledge will be rolled out gradually, over the next ~24 months &#8212; to take account of local differences in regulations and operational conditions, per co-founder Sacha Michaud.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nor will the application of the Pledge be precisely uniform; each market will have specifics, reflecting local differences in ops or indeed laws. (He notes, for example, that in some markets it works with third party contractors who supply couriers &#8212; so it can only <em>ask</em> those other companies to make sure their workers are covered.)</p>
<p>The first of markets where the Pledge will be applied happen to sit at the edges of Europe: Georgia and Morocco.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Glovo says it will be figuring out the rollout map as it goes along &#8212; so it&#8217;s not clear when its home market of Spain might be covered.</p>
<p>But it says its goal is to have its whole fleet of couriers covered by the end of 2023, and just under half (40%) by the end of Q2 2022.</p>
<h2>Fairwork is involved, but is it fair work?</h2>
<p>Glovo writes that it &#8220;collaborated&#8221; with <a href="https://fair.work/en/fw/homepage/">Fairwork </a>&#8212; an academic research project which benchmarks gig platforms against a set of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/flipkart-ranked-highly-for-fairness-of-working-conditions-in-india-gig-platform-study/">fairness principles</a> &#8212; to help it come up with the contents of the Pledge, which is comprised of four components (see below), aka &#8220;pillars&#8221; as Glovo calls them.</p>
<p>However Fairwork told TechCrunch it does not endorse Glovo&#8217;s Pledge as &#8220;fully instituting fairness for Glovo workers&#8221; &#8212; dubbing it only a &#8220;first step towards improving conditions&#8221;.</p>
<p>So the preliminary external assessment is that Glovo could still do a lot better.</p>
<p>Fairwork will be carrying out regular (possibly quarterly or biannual) audits to assess whether Glovo is living up to the commitments as it rolls the Pledge out across its markets.</p>
<p>Glovo has said these reports will be made public.</p>
<p>It also specifies that Fairwork is not being paid by it for this oversight work &#8212; in order to preserve its independence.</p>
<p>Going public about wanting to improve and being transparent about whether it actually has is a key part of the strategy here, per Michaud.</p>
<p>&#8220;We identified that this is the right thing to do and we&#8217;re going to commit openly to doing that,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We need a window to execute on that in the different regions for the complexity of our business from an operations perspective and regulatory and we&#8217;ll find a way to make it happen in every single country &#8212; and the ones we launch in the future as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Michaud is quick to talk up what he argues are the &#8220;good things&#8221; gig work has done for the world of work &#8212; reeling off familiar talking points like &#8220;easy access to income with very low barriers&#8221; for people who &#8220;maybe might have difficulty to find other types of work or income&#8221;; and of course the familiar gig platform claim of &#8220;flexibility&#8221;; or work that he euphemistically couches as having a &#8220;dynamic nature&#8221;; and maybe suits people who don&#8217;t do well with more traditional, rules-based employment &#8212; he accepts that a course correction is needed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">That said, there is no admission that the model itself is intentionally exploitative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Rather he suggests gig platforms historically miscalculated &#8212; believing they were catering to a specific niche of people who just needed a &#8220;few&#8221; extra hours&#8217; work to supplement their income. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But now the reality is a &#8220;large number&#8221; of Glovo&#8217;s couriers depend on the platform as their primary &#8212; or even sole &#8212; source of income, he says.   </span></p>
<p>Hence: &#8220;We have a certain responsibility as a company to give them more guarantees and more coverage so they can continue working on a certain baseline,&#8221; as he hedges its goal for the Pledge.</p>
<p>Michaud also rejects the idea that increased competition in the on-demand delivery space &#8212; with dark store/&#8217;q-commerce&#8217; startups busy bubbling up all over Europe, as well as (new) on-demand delivery businesses zeroing in on dedicated niches (like pharmaceuticals or high end/lux brands) &#8212; is a (retention) motivation for Glovo offering couriers better conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think regulatory wise it&#8217;s going to move in this direction &#8212; that we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; he hazards instead, adding: &#8220;We see no point in waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why, then, aren&#8217;t these conditions Glovo&#8217;s standard already? &#8220;Operationally wise it&#8217;s complex,&#8221; is his response on that.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dynamics in every market is very different and regulation is very different &#8212; sometimes it&#8217;s not that easy,&#8221; he also argues. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a question of choosing which is the best model, generally and pretty much adamantly our couriers have said, very large percentage wise, that they want flexibility at the same time as having decent earnings and autonomy. And sometimes, depending on the regulation, it&#8217;s quite complex to manage both those things.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s why the commitment &#8212; and the two year window [to roll it out].&#8221;</p>
<h2>Mind the fairness gaps</h2>
<p>Michaud describes the goal for the Pledge as being to plug what he calls &#8220;gaps&#8221; in the fairness of couriers&#8217; working conditions.</p>
<p>Glovo&#8217;s PR announcement also talks about creating &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">equality of access to social rights and benefits for couriers, independent of the way couriers work with the platform&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some gaps still,&#8221; says Michaud in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;As a company &#8212; and other platforms as well &#8212; I think we need to fill those gaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our commitment to the pledge is to try and cover the gaps and improve them, and make a commitment that by a certain date &#8212; the end of 2023 &#8212; that any courier on our platform will have certain minimum guarantees or social rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Below are the four components Glovo lists in the &#8216;Couriers Pledge&#8217; &#8212; and how it (top-line) defines them:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>FAIR EARNINGS</strong><br />
&#8220;Fair earnings per hour should be secured and regular collaboration has to be rewarded.&#8221;<br />
<strong>360o SAFETY</strong><br />
&#8220;All couriers must have fully fledged insurances covering any unforeseen situation. Safety on the road has to be a top priority.&#8221;<br />
<strong>PROACTIVE MANAGEMENT</strong><br />
&#8220;We will hear and act upon couriers’ needs and issues in a transparent manner following a two-way communication.&#8221;<br />
<strong>CARING FOR COURIERS</strong><br />
&#8220;Working as a rider should be a temporary thing. Fostering learning opportunities and keeping an open dialogue is a key goal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a little more detail in the fuller document Glovo also shared &#8212; where, for example, &#8220;proactive management&#8221; boils down to &#8220;Demostrable Service Level Agreements (SLAs)&#8221; being implemented &#8220;to guarantee effective communications&#8221; between courier and platform staff, and it offers the commitment that: &#8220;Any difficult concept or the algorithm logic needs to be explained in a simple and understandable way, so they know how the Glovo platform works.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also pledges an &#8220;easy appealing process&#8221; if a courier is disabled from the app.</p>
<p>But there is zero talk of collective bargaining &#8212; something <em>workers</em> in the EU are entitled to <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf"><em>as a right</em></a>.</p>
<p>Michaud bills the initiative as &#8220;open&#8221; &#8212; hence why, presumably, Glovo isn&#8217;t branding it &#8216;The <em>Glovo</em> Couriers Pledge&#8217; &#8212; as he&#8217;s &#8220;hopeful&#8221; other delivery platforms will sign up.</p>
<p>Although he adds that it hasn&#8217;t yet approached any competitors about doing so.</p>
<p>On this, it&#8217;s worth noting that Uber already came out with its own suggestion for &#8220;a new standard for platform work&#8221; (as it put it) for Europe back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/uber-lobbies-for-prop-22-style-gig-work-standards-in-the-eu/">February</a> &#8212; when it published a whitepaper lobbying the EU to adopt <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/after-prop-22s-passage-uber-is-taking-its-lobbying-effort-global/">California-style laws that don&#8217;t disrupt its business model</a> (i.e. by requiring it to pay full employment benefits).</p>
<p>Whether Glovo&#8217;s Pledge has more substance than Uber&#8217;s whitepaper remains to be seen &#8212; but engaging Fairwork as an auditor is certainly an interesting and laudable step. After all, the group wasted no time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/">blasting Uber&#8217;s whitepaper as &#8220;corporate lobbying masquerading as progressiveism&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Fairwork also accused Uber of trying to “<span data-contrast="auto">legitimize a lower level of protection for platform workers than most European workers benefit from” &#8212;</span><span data-contrast="auto"> arguing there&#8217;s plenty of scope for it to improve conditions for workers within existing laws and further excoriating it for claiming improved conditions are dependent on regulatory change. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So Glovo will need to tread carefully to avoid a similar accusation that it&#8217;s delaying rolling out better working conditions for portions of its gig workers as a cynical ratchet to try to drive local policy change to align with its business model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The wider context here is of course that gig platforms have &#8212; even from the get-go &#8212; faced accusations that they are inherently exploitative of labor and seek to erode workers rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Critics accusing them of applying </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a bogus classification of &#8216;self-employment&#8217; that exploits delivery couriers by extracting the labor of an army of precarious but essential (to the business&#8217; function) labor force without providing the benefits and rights of employment.</span></p>
<p>Platforms typically counter such accusations by arguing that couriers want gigging &#8216;flexibility&#8217; rather than traditional employment &#8212; and further claiming &#8216;outdated&#8217; employment laws don&#8217;t allow them to provide benefits without applying the sort of rigid conditions their workers don&#8217;t want.</p>
<p>However on that they are counter-accused of a self-serving, selective interpretation of the law; and, therefore, of dragging their feet on offering better conditions. (See <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/">Fairwork&#8217;s aformentioned evisceration of Uber</a>.)</p>
<p>They have also often lost litigation challenging their employment classifications.</p>
<p>In the UK, for example, Uber lost a long running employment litigation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">earlier this year</a>, after the Supreme Court ruled that a group of drivers were workers, not self-employed contractors as Uber had tried to argue (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/uber-loses-employment-tribunal-in-the-uk/">for literally years</a>).</p>
<p>While, in Spain &#8212; one of the markets where Glovo operates &#8212; the country&#8217;s top court rejected its classification of delivery couriers as &#8216;<em>autónomos</em>&#8216; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/spains-top-court-rejects-glovos-classification-of-couriers-as-self-employed/">last year</a>. And lawmakers there have since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spain-agrees-on-labor-reform-that-will-recognize-delivery-platform-riders-as-employees/">passed a labor reform</a> specifically targeted at recognizing platform delivery couriers as employees. (Portugal is also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/portugals-gig-economy-workers-set-become-staff-2021-10-22/">reported to be eyeing a similar law</a>.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spain agrees on labor reform that will recognize delivery platform riders as employees&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spain-agrees-on-labor-reform-that-will-recognize-delivery-platform-riders-as-employees/embed/#?secret=QpNUn0sPF1" data-secret="QpNUn0sPF1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Glovo did not responded to the change in Spanish law by instantly employing the circa 10,000 couriers active on its platform in the country. It has said it will be hiring around 1,800 couriers (but Michaud admits it hasn&#8217;t yet hit that figure).</p>
<p>It has also chosen to make changes to how it operates the platform to try to justify keeping a majority of its local Glovers as &#8216;freelance&#8217; couriers. (Some of whom may be employed by third party agencies &#8212; at which point they are essentially being subcontracted to do gig jobs on its platform but which it argues Spain&#8217;s labor reform allows.)</p>
<p>The net result is that even with a labor law in place that <em>says</em> delivery couriers working on platforms like Glovo are employees, plenty of platform workers in the country are (still) not employed and thereby face a variety of working conditions.</p>
<p>This in turn means Glovo&#8217;s decision <em>not</em> to prioritize rolling out the Pledge to couriers in its home market looks, well, interesting.</p>
<p>Michaud claims Spain&#8217;s regulations make applying the commitments there more &#8220;complex&#8221; &#8212; since he argues that most of its local couriers don&#8217;t want to be employed; and that local employment law on freelancers/self-employed ties its hands on giving additional benefits &#8212; &#8220;because it would imply a labor relationship&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Again, I insist, most of these workers don&#8217;t want [employment] &#8212; so you&#8217;re excluding them,&#8221; is his familiar line of argument.</p>
<p>This suggests Glovo will be directing its efforts in Spain (at least initially), not on improving working conditions for the majority of couriers but pushing for amendments to the labor reform to allow it to (eventually) raise courier benefits (somewhat) &#8212; without having to reclassify them as full-fat employees as the law intends, and which would instantly give them&#8230; well&#8230; far better working conditions.</p>
<p>So it is, to put it politely, rather tautological.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Michaud summarizes its domestic plan as: &#8220;Working with the social agents and finding common ground to get those workers that stay autonomous&#8230; the benefits and the guarantees that they need.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also points to how Glovo is now operating in Italy &#8212; calling it &#8220;a good guideline&#8221; of what it&#8217;s hoping to achieve elsewhere via the Pledge &#8212;  flagging a recent gig economy regulation he says covered a lot of the things that are already in the commitments.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example we give guaranteed income per hour there &#8212; but they&#8217;re freelancers. We begin paying their social security directly &#8212; so they&#8217;re covered when they&#8217;re ill. It includes safety, training and obviously material. And obviously it includes further education &#8212; so all the pieces that sometimes are missing. So that&#8217;s a fairly good reference.</p>
<p>&#8220;There we are giving guaranteed income, earnings per hour&#8230; It maintains the flexibility, they&#8217;re autonomous&#8230; they have collective voice, they&#8217;re represented by trades unions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, there are further steps Glovo believes it can make for couriers there too, per Michaud, who adds: &#8220;Italy will hopefully be under the Pledge early next year.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Towards better gig work across the EU?</h2>
<p>European Union lawmakers, meanwhile, have an active eye on conditions in the gig economy across the bloc &#8212; having been nudged to take a public interest by the surge in popularity of delivery platforms during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic last year.</p>
<p>The Commission has spent the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">better part of this year</a> consulting on how conditions for gig workers might be improved, initially through platforms making changes themselves &#8212; but also dangling the prospect of pan-EU standards coming down the pipe.</p>
<p>So the EU&#8217;s executive scoping out potential legislation gives gig platforms a serious incentive to jockey for position &#8212; and try to frame the terms of debate. And, ultimately, pushing their own version of what &#8216;fair&#8217; standards are on policymakers.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_805">speech</a> back in February the EU&#8217;s digital policy chief, Margrethe Vestager, warned that what she acknowledged can be “poor” and “precarious” working conditions on gig platforms must be &#8220;addressed&#8221;.</p>
<p>But she also talked of wanting to &#8220;find a balance between making the most of the opportunities of the platform economy and ensuring that the social rights of people working in it are the same as in the traditional economy&#8221;. So it&#8217;s really not clear what the Commission is cooking. (And at the time of writing the EU executive had not responded to a request for an update.)</p>
<p>With the EU&#8217;s process ongoing, Glovo&#8217;s pledge is timed to pre-empt any rules the bloc&#8217;s lawmakers might draw up &#8212; and which could even end up over-ruling country-specific labor reforms (potentially rolling back those &#8220;complex&#8221; regulations that so trouble gig platforms&#8217; business interests).</p>
<p>That means Glovo&#8217;s Pledge must be read, at least in part, as a lobbying instrument &#8212; illustrating its strategic red lines.</p>
<p>It is notable, for example, that Glovo&#8217;s pledge on earnings does not commit to paying couriers for every single hour of working time. Such as when they are logged into the app and waiting for a job to come in; or waiting outside a restaurant for a delivery to be made up and brought out to them; or biking through traffic jams and pouring rain trying to find a customer&#8217;s address; or waiting outside the customer&#8217;s address for the person to answer the door. And so on.</p>
<p>Michaud confirms that Glovo continues to pay couriers <em>per delivery</em>.</p>
<p>The pledge as it stands doesn&#8217;t change that. Rather the suggestion is Glovo will &#8216;top-up&#8217; courier earnings if they fall below a locally set wage indicator for hourly earnings (it says it&#8217;s using WageIndictator data to make these calculations), as well as factoring in any additional costs the courier may have to fund to carry out deliveries in that location (e.g. bike repairs, fuel etc).</p>
<p>So its definition of &#8220;fair&#8221; earnings continues to limit how much couriers can earn on its platform by not paying for all their actual working time.</p>
<p>This is a recurring battleground in gig economy litigation. And &#8212; over in the UK &#8212; Uber&#8217;s recent, post-Supreme Court ruling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/">announcement</a>, claiming it would now treat drivers in the country as &#8220;workers&#8221;, did not extend to paying them for all the hours they clock up logged into the Uber app either; instead it said it would be calculating working time from the point a trip commences.</p>

<p>&#8220;Today they&#8217;re only paid per job,&#8221; confirms Michaud &#8212; referring to the majority of Glovo delivery couriers who the startup does not directly employ, before adding: &#8220;We have different types [of employment relationships with couriers] so it&#8217;s very varied &#8212; that&#8217;s why we wanted to equal the playing field for everyone to a certain [extent].&#8221;</p>
<p>We raised this issue with Glovo&#8217;s chosen auditor, Fairwork, suggesting that paying by working time would be fairer than paying per delivery &#8212; and they agreed.</p>
<p class="m_-8989863430237308944paragraph"><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="il">&#8220;Fairwork</span> advised Glovo on how their pledge could comply with the <span class="il">Fairwork</span> principles. In that process we advised them that workers should be paid for waiting time, at the rate of the living wage,&#8221; researcher Alessio Bertolini told us. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="il">&#8220;Fairwork</span> will be auditing and scoring Glovo on that basis. We are pleased that Glovo has consulted with us in this process, and has indicated openness to being held accountable to their commitments by <span class="il">Fairwork</span>. However, this does not constitute an endorsement from <span class="il">Fairwork</span> of Glovo&#8217;s commitments as fully meeting all standards of fairness,&#8221; he added. <u></u></p>
<p class="m_-8989863430237308944paragraph"><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Workers are actively contributing to platforms’ operations and revenue, and to customers’ ability to receive prompt service, during all the time they are logged in and available to accept jobs. They are giving up personal time, and the freedom to do other activities in other places. They are also often representing the platform, with branded equipment and apparel. For all these reasons, it is <span class="il">Fairwork</span>’s strong position that waiting time is working time and should attract <span class="il">fair</span> pay.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p class="m_-8989863430237308944paragraph"><span class="m_-8989863430237308944eop">So, well, Glovo may find its first full Fairwork audit a fairly painful read too. </span></p>
<p>For the record, Michaud dodged the question about paying couriers&#8217; working time rather than per delivery when we put it to him &#8212; sidestepping into a tangent on how it measures &#8220;earnings per hour&#8221; to ensure they reflect a local average based on data from WageIndicator (but that&#8217;s not what we were asking).</p>
<p>He also segued into talking about Glovo&#8217;s use of technology to distribute jobs to couriers &#8212; saying it has &#8220;stock management systems&#8221; in most of the countries where it operates which he said are intended to &#8220;optimize&#8221; supply and demand in order to make up earnings to that local wage level. (Presumably by sharing out available jobs between couriers to avoid too much of an earnings skew between individuals.)</p>
<p>With the Pledge, he says the idea is to plug gaps in this job distribution system &#8212; topping up earnings in instances where couriers aren&#8217;t sent enough jobs by the platform &#8212; but not plugging the bigger wage gap resulting from Glovo choosing not to pay out their working time.</p>
<p>He mentions a courier he says he met recently in Ghana &#8212; who told him that he&#8217;d been working for over two hours and had only had three deliveries, saying that&#8217;s &#8220;not good enough&#8221; and that it&#8217;s &#8220;the type of thing we want to address&#8221;, before adding: &#8220;We want to step up&#8230; And hopefully other companies will join us in raising the bar.&#8221;</p>
<p>However Glovo&#8217;s preference for &#8220;raising the bar&#8221; on courier earnings remains far below Fairwork&#8217;s definition of what is actually fair pay &#8212; and, well, what European employment law has long established as fair: A minimum wage per each hour of time worked. So &#8212; for now at least &#8212; it is essentially a familiar gig economy push to try to normalize a lower tier of employment rights for platform workers, who are already among the most vulnerable and precariously placed workers in society.</p>
<p>Whether EU policymakers will be swayed by this deregulatory pitch is the next pressing question.</p>
<p>Michaud confirms he will be <span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">presenting the Pledge to the Commission and members of the European Parliament this week. (</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">T</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">he support of MEPs will be required to pass any EU legislation in this area &#8212; parliamentarians also frequently amend Commission proposals.) </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is the way the gig economy will go, especially in Europe,&#8221; he suggests, fleshing out the pitch EU lawmakers will hear. &#8220;There&#8217;s a strong case for who the workers are on these platforms &#8212; who generally have low access to &#8216;normal&#8217; employment, or certainly at that given time. It&#8217;s easy access to income, it&#8217;s very flexible and dynamic. And then again what I think is true if someone is working on a platform and it&#8217;s the primary source or very important source of their income &#8212; although we will cover everyone, even if they&#8217;re only working five hours a week they&#8217;ll still have the necessary coverage &#8212; I think there needs to be better coverage, better social benefits. When they&#8217;re ill they should have coverage and things like that. Which often are not covered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked for its assessment of the <span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">general state of delivery gig <span class="il">worker conditions</span> across Europe, Fairworks&#8217; Bertolini said standards are shockingly low &#8212; which may be why some of the bigger (and better resourced) gig platforms, with l<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/">ashings of VC cash</a> to spend on an in-house team of policy staffers to hone pitches and lobby lawmakers, spy a chance to frame themselves as offering &#8216;higher&#8217; gig work standards. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;</span></span><u></u><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">As previous <span class="il">Fairwork</span> reports in Europe, such as Germany and UK, already have shown, the vast majority of platforms fail to provide even the most basic labour standards that would be considered <span class="il">fair</span>,&#8221; he went on. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Some of the main issues include the lack of a minimum wage floor, lack of statutory health and safety protections, lack of access to due process and lack of channels for collective representation. Many of these issues stem from the classification of workers as self-employed or independent contractors in order for platforms to avoid obligations and protections.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Regardless of employment status, all workers should have the same basic legal rights and social protections,&#8221; Bertolini added. &#8220;If a lower tier of protections for certain classes of workers is institutionalized, we risk seeing a race to the bottom.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">He also warned that putting guarantees into law to avoid the misclassification of independent contractors aren&#8217;t in and of themselves a panacea &#8212; as Spain is perhaps finding out now. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;We believe that guaranteeing that workers are not misclassified as independent contractors is an important part of the solution but it shouldn’t be everything. What we are seeing in many countries is that even platforms that rely on an employment model can use systems of sub-contractors to avoid their legal responsibilities. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Any future EU legislation should take into consideration these issues and make sure that these companies are made responsible for the conditions of the workers on their platform. We believe all workers, however they are classified, should benefit from minimum standards of fairness in their jobs.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">Bertolini also said that, g</span></span><span class="m_-8989863430237308944eop"><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">iven the variety of classifications and rights associated with employment status in different countries, <span class="il">Fairwork&#8217;s view</span> is it most important to ensure that all workers are provided with decent labour standards across <span class="il">Fair</span> Pay, <span class="il">Fair</span> Conditions, <span class="il">Fair</span> Contacts, <span class="il">Fair</span> Management and <span class="il">Fair</span> Representation &#8212; regardless of their specific employment classification. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944eop"><span class="m_-8989863430237308944normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;We do not support any employment classification system that falls short of guaranteeing these standards for all gig workers, such as the example of Prop 22 in California,&#8221; he added. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="m_-8989863430237308944eop">So Commission lawmakers look like they&#8217;re going to have their work cut out to find their sought for &#8220;balance&#8221; between precarity and stability. Screwing their courage to the sticking place may be more profitable on this fundamental rights issue. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Insurance policy provider Acko is the latest Indian startup to become a unicorn, joining nearly three dozen other firms in the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market that have attainted the coveted status this year.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-headquartered startup said it has raised $255 million in a new financing round, bringing its all-time raise to $450 million. The new financing round, which is subject to approval from the country&#8217;s insurance regulator, was led by General Atlantic and Multiples Private Equity.</p>
<p>CPPIB, Canada&#8217;s largest pension fund and Lightspeed Growth as well as existing investors Intact Ventures and Munich Re Ventures also participated in the round, which values the five-year-old startup at $1.1 billion, up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/amazon-backed-indian-insurtech-startup-acko-raises-60-million/">$500 million a year ago</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225397" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.acko.com">Acko</a> is attempting to take on the country’s antiquated insurance industry with a digital-first product. It develops and sells bite-sized auto insurance products (aimed at drivers and others in transportation-related scenarios), healthcare protections to employers, as well as protection on gadgets.</p>
<p>The startup has distribution partners with a number of firms including Amazon, which is an existing investor in Acko, as well as travel and hotel booking platform MakeMyTrip, ride-hailing firm Ola, insurance giant Bajaj Finance and Urban Company.</p>
<p>Acko covers nearly a million gig workers in the country through partnerships with companies including food delivery giants Swiggy and Zomato. Overall, Acko has amassed over 70 million customers and is clocking a run rate of $175 million in premiums.</p>
<p>Offering a large catalog of bite-sized insurance policies is crucial for firms in India. Only a fraction of the nation’s 1.3 billion people currently have access to insurance and most can’t afford sizable policies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to rating agency ICRA, insurance products had reached less than 3% of the population as of 2017. An average Indian makes about $2,100 a year, according to the World Bank. ICRA estimated that of those Indians who had purchased an insurance product, they were spending less than $50 on it in 2017.</p>
<p>“ACKO has meaningfully redefined the protection category for consumers and plans to continue innovating in the space. We strongly believe in supporting our customers in protecting their valued assets or the health and safety of their loved ones via a differentiated product and value-added service,&#8221; said Acko founder and chief executive Varun Dua.</p>
<p>&#8220;Insurance and protection must work for people based on their unique risks and needs in a seamless, reliable fashion. We are thrilled to partner with trusted investors who have a deep understanding of the regulatory environment and bring firsthand experience in working with innovative, high-growth companies.”</p>
<p>The startup said it plans to deploy the fresh capital to broaden its healthcare offerings and hire more talent across technology, product and data science roles.</p>
<p>“We also continue to deepen our health strategy and intend to invest over $150 million in the health business in the near future. We believe health insurance products, claims innovation and a deeply connected ecosystem of health services that improve health outcomes for customers are today’s most urgent needs.”</p>
<p>The funding comes at a time when scores of Indian startups are raising record amounts of capital at an unprecedented pace in India. This week itself, cross-border payments startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/zolve-raises-40-million-to-help-global-citizens-access-financial-services/">Zolve</a>, agritech firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/dehaat-raises-115-million-in-the-largest-agritech-round-in-india/">DeHaat</a>, fintech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/24/india-groww-valued-at-3-billion-in-251-million-funding/">Groww</a>, and edtech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/indian-edtech-teachmint-valued-at-500-million-in-78-million-funding/">Teachmint</a> unveiled their new funding rounds. TechCrunch reported earlier this week that Tiger Global and Falcon Edge Capital are in advanced stages of talks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiger-and-falcon-look-to-double-down-on-indian-social-commerce-startup-dealshare/">mint another unicorn in India</a> (DealShare).</p>
<p>Policybazaar, which competes with Acko, will open its initial public offering next week. The startup is looking to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/indian-online-insurer-policybazaar-files-for-ipo-seeks-to-raise-over-800-million/">raise over $800 million in the IPO</a>.</p>

TechCrunch read the strong pricing event as indicative of a warm IPO market not only for pure tech companies, but also unicorns that are more tech-enabled than <em>tech</em> tech. The company began trading today, initially rising before losing ground as the day grew late.

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/abacus-ai-snags-50m-series-c-as-it-expands-into-computer-vision-use-cases/"><strong>Abacus.ai wants to democratize ML:</strong></a><strong> </strong>As far as goals go, Abacus’ plan to simplify machine learning model creation, as our own Ron Miller put it, is a good one. Tools like what the startup has in mind could lessen a market crunch in data talent and perhaps empower more workers to execute their own data-focused tasks.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/daring-foods-bites-into-third-round-in-12-months-as-plant-based-chicken-product-enters-walmart/"><strong>Plant-based chicken is expensive:</strong></a> At least if you want to buy into the companies creating it. Today, Daring Foods announced that it has raised an eye-popping $65 million Series C, and that its plant-based chicken comp product will find shelf space in 3,000 Walmart locations. Given that Walmart is not the <em>first</em> megaretailer we’d anticipate would roll out fake chicken, the partnership could indicate that plant-based meats are more generally popular than we thought.</li>

<h2>The Bowery Farming TC-1</h2>
<p>Just over a tenth of Americans have jobs in food and agriculture, so it&#8217;s easy to see why many of us lack a keen awareness about what we&#8217;re eating or where it comes from.</p>
<p>Our food supply isn&#8217;t as secure or predictable as we assumed: Climate change, safety recalls, the COVID-19 pandemic and even immigration policies can directly impact what’s available at the store. The technological leaps that made it possible to feed (most of) the world will not see us through the next century unless we change course.</p>
<p>Plant-based protein has gotten a lot of press, but vertical farming that leans on hardware and robotics has reached scale, reports Brian Heater, TechCrunch hardware editor.</p>
<p>In a four-part series, he explores the origins and operations of Bowery Farming, a profitable startup that has raised almost $500 million since 2015 to create new tech and facilities that raise leafy greens sold in nearly 900 markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security bug in the <a href="https://docket.care/#security">health app Docket</a> exposed the private information of residents vaccinated against COVID-19 in New Jersey and Utah, where the app received endorsements from state officials.</p>
<p>Docket lets residents download and carry a digital copy of their immunizations by pulling their vaccination records from their state&#8217;s health authority. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/apple-wallet-is-getting-verifiable-covid-19-vaccination-cards/">digital copy</a> has the same information as the COVID-19 paper card, but is digitally signed by the state to prevent forgeries. Docket is one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/companies-navigate-ethical-minefield-to-build-proof-of-vaccination-apps/">several so-called vaccine passports</a> in the U.S., allowing residents to show their vaccination records — or a scannable QR code — for getting into events, restaurants or crossing into countries where vaccines are required.</p>
<p>But for a time, the app allowed anyone access to the QR codes of other vaccinated users — and all the personal and vaccine information encoded within. That included names, dates of birth and information about a person&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccination status, such as which type of vaccine they received and when.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225136" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch discovered the bug on Tuesday and immediately contacted the company. Docket chief executive Michael Perretta said the bug was fixed at the server level a few hours later.</p>
<p>The bug was found in how the Docket app requests the user&#8217;s QR code from its servers. The user&#8217;s QR code is generated on the server in the form of a SMART Health Card, a widely accepted standard for validating a person&#8217;s vaccination status across the world. That QR code is tied to a user ID, which isn&#8217;t visible from the app, but can be viewed by looking at its network traffic using off-the-shelf software like Burp Suite or Charles Proxy.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But Docket&#8217;s servers weren&#8217;t checking to make sure the person requesting a QR code was allowed to request it. That meant it was possible for any app user to change their user ID and request someone else&#8217;s QR code. Worse, Docket user IDs are sequential, and so new QR codes could be enumerated simply by changing the user ID by a single digit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not known if anyone else discovered the bug. Perretta said the company is &#8220;currently in the process of reviewing logs to determine if there was any malicious activity on the platform.&#8221; Perretta also said that the company was working to inform state governments about the lapse but did not say if the company planned to notify its users of the security lapse.</p>
<p>Nancy Kearney, a spokesperson for New Jersey&#8217;s Department of Health, said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The New Jersey Department of Health was notified by our vendor, Docket, of a code vulnerability related to the recent release of a QR code associated with the app. Docket assured the Department that they identified and fixed the vulnerability within the code. No other functionality of the app was affected. The privacy and security of Docket users remains paramount. At this time, Docket is investigating for any indication of potential records that could have been compromised. The Department continues to work with Docket to ensure their ongoing vigilance on this matter.</p></blockquote>
<p>A spokesperson for Minnesota&#8217;s Department of Health also not reply. (Docket is available for Minnesota residents, but the state has not yet deployed QR codes.)</p>
<p>Tom Hudachko, a spokesperson for Utah&#8217;s Department of Health, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Utah Department of Health is committed to ensuring the privacy of Utah residents and expects its contractors and partners to maintain the same commitment. Docket notified us [Tuesday] of a bug within its system that could potentially allow users to receive the personal information of other users. Docket has assured us they have identified what caused the bug and have resolved this issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We are working with Docket, and our own data security teams to identify any users that may have had their information inappropriately shared and provide appropriate notification to those individuals,&#8221; said Hudachko.</p>
<p>But questions remain about how the bug slipped through to begin with. It&#8217;s not known exactly how many vaccinated people&#8217;s records were at risk. Last week, Docket said in a since-deleted tweet that it had reached one million users. New Jersey and Utah have a combined 8.5 million residents who have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Perretta would not say, when asked, what kind of security testing was done on Docket before its launch.</p>
<p>Utah&#8217;s Hudachko said that Docket went through a &#8220;thorough security review&#8221; by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), two offices housed within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). An ONC spokesperson deferred comment to CMS and HHS, neither of which responded to our requests for comment.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which approved the app, also did not respond to questions asking if the agency had conducted a security review.</p>
<p>Docket isn&#8217;t the only vaccine passport app maker that&#8217;s faced security issues. The bug found in the Docket app is a nearly identical issue found in an app called Aura, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/coronavirus-albion-security-flaws-app/">exposed thousands of QR codes</a> containing the vaccination status of staff and students. And earlier this year, the Calgary-based proof-of-vaccination app Portpass <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/portpass-privacy-breach-1.6191749">exposed the personal information</a> of hundreds of thousands of people after leaving its website unsecured, while one hacker was able to create an <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/vaccination-passport-safety-security-hacker-1.6155488">entirely fake vaccine passport</a> using Quebec&#8217;s official proof-of-vaccination app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Niantic announced yesterday that its next augmented reality mobile game will be <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/pikminbloom/?hl=en">Pikmin Bloom</a>, a collaboration with Nintendo. The free game is available now for iOS and Android in Singapore and Australia but will roll out globally in the coming days.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ZeIQEZIPv8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Like Pokémon Go, Pikmin Bloom will encourage players to get outside and explore their neighborhoods. Only now, instead of catching Pidgey and Rattata, you&#8217;ll collect seedlings and create a squad of Pikmin. The more you walk, the more Pikmin you&#8217;ll collect. These plant-animal hybrid creatures come from Nintendo&#8217;s strategy and puzzle game franchise of the same name.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225271" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Pikmin Bloom marks the sixth installment in the Pikmin video game series. There are many different types of Pikmin to interact with, and as you walk alongside them, you&#8217;ll leave augmented reality trails of flowers behind you. According to in-game footage in the announcement video (seen above), it looks like you can customize your avatar as a Mii.</p>
<p>Another feature that borrows from Pokémon Go is Pikmin Bloom&#8217;s monthly Community Day events. In the former, players are lured outdoors with special bonuses and rare featured Pokémon once per month, encouraging people to get outside and befriend fellow players. Niantic hasn&#8217;t released details, but the company said that it will host monthly Community Day events for Pikmin as well to plant and play together.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Pokémon Go has a weekly pop-up on Monday mornings that shows you how far you&#8217;ve walked that week. But Pikmin seems more specifically geared toward encouraging movement, showing the routes you walked and the steps you took at the end of every day.</p>
<p>The last time the two companies released a game together, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/01/pokemon-go-and-the-april-fools-joke-that-made-billions/">shattered expectations</a> &#8212; so, no pressure to our floral friends. Even if Pokémon Go doesn&#8217;t feel as ubiquitous as it did in summer 2016, it&#8217;s making Niantic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/after-community-backlash-pokemon-go-reinstates-a-covid-safety-and-accessibility-feature/">more money than ever</a>, netting over $1 billion in 2020. But it doesn&#8217;t quite seem like there&#8217;s as much to do yet in Pikmin Bloom as there is in Pokémon Go or Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. So, this game might be geared toward a more casual crowd who just want to see some pretty pixels while they walk &#8212; no shiny-hunting and raid battle coordination here … at least not yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.vistaprint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vistaprint</a> has built a name for itself in providing printing and marketing services for consumers, sole traders and small businesses. Now it is making a pair of acquisitions as it looks for better ways to square up to the opportunity to serve SMBs with digital services. The company is acquiring online graphic design editor <a href="https://crello.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crello</a> and an online graphic design editor that competes against Canva — and its parent company, stock photo repository <a href="https://depositphotos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Despositphotos</a> — for a total price of $85 million.</p>
<p>Along with the acquisitions, Vistaprint is rebranding as just &#8220;Vista&#8221; and will be launching a new service powered by Crello called VistaCreate.</p>
<p>The moves come as part of a wider $250 million investment that Vista, which is currently based in Ireland and is part of publicly traded Cimpress (and which has a number of other design brands under its umbrella), has been making into reviving and updating its platform and brand, which also included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/printing-giant-vistaprint-acquires-99designs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buying 99designs</a>, a marketplace to source designers and their work, a year ago. It also recently linked a partnership with Wix to enable tighter integrations between its services and Wix&#8217;s website building services.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225203" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The plan is not to move away from print but to augment it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our north star is to be a partner for SMBs in digital print and design,&#8221; said Florian Baumgartner, EVP and president, international, of Vista, in an interview this week. Vista does not disclose how many customers it has currently except to note that it is in the &#8220;millions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crello, based out of Cyprus, appeared to be a bootstrapped company, but it had grown to a substantial size since being founded in 2017. The company also has &#8220;millions&#8221; of customers, and more specifically, it added 3 million this year alone, spanning some 150 countries. Its users create more than 1 million projects each month.</p>
<p>Depositphotos does not disclose its user numbers but says that it holds some 220 million royalty-free photos and other graphics created by some 100,000 contributors. The company is based out of New York and had raised just under $6 million, with investors including TMT Investments in London.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Canva, now valued at $40 billion, is the big elephant in the room for companies like Vista longer term. The company has the capital, and the firepower, to build new products on a newer platform to address the needs of modern businesses. (Its latest frontier: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/canva-is-getting-into-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Video</a>.)</p>
<p>That does not rule out more incumbent players creating a new playing field for themselves by consolidating disparate design services on to their own platforms, however.</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<p>Vadim Nekhai, who had been the CEO of Despositphotos, is taking on a new role as VP of VistaCreate and believes there is life yet left in the incumbent.</p>
<p>“Over 20 years ago, VistaPrint invented online design and publishing tools for print marketing materials to empower small businesses to create attractive designs without having to learn complex software,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;VistaCreate brings the same simplicity to social media and other forms of digital design and Depositphotos brings a vast library of high-quality imagery, videos and music. We look forward to being part of the Vista team as we continue to innovate together to help small businesses look and feel professional both online and offline.”</p>
<p><em>Updated to correct that Vista is not Dutch, but Irish.</em></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Mergers and acquisitions activity is at an all-time high — global mergers and acquisitions have already broken 2020 levels with about $4.4 trillion worth of deals as of October 2021. So how can startups, especially early-stage startups, get in on the action?</p>
<p>The answer is a growth strategy that takes both inorganic and organic growth into account, never relying on one more than the other. In my role as a growth equity expert and venture capital investor for more than 20 years, I’ve seen companies leverage these different kinds of growth to their advantage — and their downfall.</p>
<p>Essentially, businesses can grow in two ways: Organic and inorganic. For our purposes, organic growth refers to internal efforts to increase revenue, like speeding up output, expanding product offerings, building infrastructure and customers, and hiring staff. Inorganic growth is driven by mergers with or acquisitions by other companies or joint ventures.</p>
<p>Organic growth tends to be slower, whereas inorganic growth often acts as a booster shot, propelling companies forward. Startups are currently harnessing both to drive innovation and market growth, but not all growth is created equal, and one is not mutually exclusive from the other.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Gone are the days (mostly) where a significant portion of acquisitions failed, but that mindset still clouds our perception of deals.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Inorganic growth has traditionally been a strategy to accelerate the development of businesses in slower-growth industries, like media companies. For more software-focused firms, the new technology or customers acquired via a merger or acquisition helps it leapfrog its competitors. It is essential for founders and CEOs to understand exactly when inorganic growth makes sense in the current glut of M&amp;A activity, and how to take a thoughtful, balanced approach to growing your business sustainably.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Biotech startup <a href="https://www.immunai.com/">Immunai</a> has been on a roll when it comes to funding. The company that set out to create an atlas of the human immune system <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/immunai">in 2018</a> had raised about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/immunai-raises-60m-as-it-expands-from-improving-immune-therapies-to-discovering-new-ones-too/">$80 million by February 2021</a>. On Wednesday, the company announced another significantly larger round: a $215 million series B.</p>
<p>Immunai has been building a massive data set of clinical immunological information. It combines genetic information, along with other data like epigenetic changes or proteomics (the study of proteins), to map out how the immune system functions. Then machine learning is applied to identify what targets might be useful for drugmakers, what drugs might cause toxic reactions, and ultimately predict how a patient might respond to a potential treatment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/immunai-gets-series-a-funding-for-genomics-database-advancements/">Immunai claims</a> this data set, called the Annotated Multi-omic Immune Cell Atlas, AMICA, is the largest in the world.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224911" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This round, which was led by Koch Disruptive Technologies, with participation from Talos VC, 8VC, Alexandria Venture Investments, Piedmont, ICON and others, brings the company’s total funding to $295 million.</p>
<p>Noam Solomon, Immunai’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch this massive jump in funding comes down to a major change in the type of insights AMICA has yielded.</p>
<p>The platform is currently being used to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1074-2">develop and refine</a> cell therapies for neuroblastoma in conjunction with the Baylor College of Medicine. Solomon also says the company is working to publish a paper showing it can identify specific gene targets that tell whether a patient will respond to certain therapies.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Solomon says, the company has been able to move from simply showing correlative data to causative data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Probably a year ago we were showing strong correlative data — that certain insights we have can explain relationships between certain genes and cells,” he says. “Today we have more causal inference results. We are able to show that things we are doing with our functional genomic platform are actually causing certain results.”</p>
<p>Let’s be clear: Immunai <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/nfx-backed-pepper-bio-emerges-from-stealth-with-tools-to-hone-in-on-complex-diseases/">is far from the only company</a> looking to harness cell-level data and put it into action. There are plenty of companies, large and small, playing in the same space. Immunai stands apart, per Solomon, for two reasons.</p>
<p>First is the sheer <i>size</i> of the dataset Immunai is building. Immunai has been collaborating with over 30 companies and academic institutions (Memorial Sloan Kettering, Harvard, Stanford and the Baylor College of Medicine, to name a few). But the company has also diversified the types of biological data it&#8217;s collecting, analyzing and managing through two major acquisitions this year.</p>
<p>In March, Immunai acquired <a href="https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=271957">Dropprint Genomics</a>, a company working on methods to perform single-cell sequencing at scale for an undisclosed amount. Solomon adds Dropprint had made “interesting progress on autoimmunity.&#8221; Over the summer, Immunai <a href="https://www.immunai.com/press/gen-nebion-news">acquired</a> Nebion, a Swiss company that had spent 13 years building gene expression data sets. They also had about 70 external partnerships with hospitals and institutions, notes Solomon.</p>
<p>Both acquisitions “really accelerated the size of the database,&#8221; says Solomon. However, M&amp;A strategy remains to acquire complementary technologies. Immunai’s data acquisition strategy, going forward, is still largely built on creating more partnerships.</p>
<p>The second reason Solomon believes Immunai stands out comes down to its handling of all this information. Solomon calls Immunai an engineering-first company, because he’s just as interested in building the infrastructure to <i>support </i>the data set as it is about the data itself.</p>
<p>It’s also why, he notes, about 50% of the company’s 120-person workforce is coming from pure tech or engineering backgrounds.</p>
<p>“I think there are very few companies in the space that are trying to do more than create a small data set and apply sophisticated machine learning tools,” he says. “Our approach is the opposite. We believe we need to build a robust database that we will be able to feed and grow, with the data engineering tools to make sure that our algorithms can run on 100,000 samples.”</p>
<p>This round will be used to bring in more employees and to keep enriching the immunological data set (and back-end infrastructure that can support it) at the company’s disposal.</p>
<p>From a business perspective, it also means the company is less dependent on up-front payments with future partners. The new financing shifts the company’s focus.</p>
<p>“We don’t have a reliance on stronger upfront payments. We care much more about success-based payments,” Solomon said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tokyo space startup <a href="https://gitai.tech/en/">Gitai Japan</a> successfully conducted a technology demonstration of its autonomous robotic arm inside the International Space Station last week, a key milestone as the company prepares to provide robotics as a service in space.</p>
<p>The S1 robotic arm performed two tasks: operating cables and switches, and assembling structures and panels. These tasks — common crew activities — can be used in a general-purpose way for a range of in-space activities. The successful demo raised what NASA calls the “technology readiness level” of the Gitai robot to TRL 7. There are nine TRLs in total and hitting all of them will be critical for Gitai commercializing its robots.</p>
<p>The demonstration was performed inside space company Nanoracks’ Bishop Airlock, the world’s first (and only) commercial airlock to be attached to the exterior of the station. Nanoracks — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/voyager-nanoracks-and-lockheeds-starlab-is-the-latest-sign-that-the-low-earth-orbit-economy-is-coming/">which announced plans last week to launch a fully private commercial space station with Voyage Space and Lockheed Martin</a> — also furnished on-orbit operations, data downlink and the launch opportunity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225207" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Gitai’s robotic arm was sent to orbit aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule, part of the launch company’s 23<sup>rd</sup> Commercial Resupply Services Mission at the end of August. The Japanese startup is developing robots for a range of general purposes in space, including on-orbit servicing of spacecraft, construction or manufacturing tasks. The next step for the company is to test the Gitai robot outside the ISS.</p>
<p>“The success of this investigation proves that the GITAI robot can be a solution for space agencies and commercial space companies looking for versatile, dexterous, relatively safe (less exposure to life threatening risks for humans) and inexpensive labor force,” NASA said in a tech demo update. “Providing this option furthers the goals of commercialization of space.”</p>
<p>Gitai doesn’t want to just build robotic arms, however. The company’s long-term vision sees robots as key tools for building space colonies on the surface of the moon or even Mars. This robotic workforce could be the answer to accelerating human presence in off-world environments. Earlier this year, the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/28/space-startup-gitai-raises-17-1m-to-help-build-the-robotic-workforce-of-commercial-space/">closed a $17.1 million Series B</a> funding round, to hire and accelerate the development of a separate satellite servicing tech demo set to take place in 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ro.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ro</a>, one of the most valuable privately owned health tech startups, isn’t subtle about its mission to deliver vertically integrated, affordable healthcare with consumers in mind.</p>
<p>And while a patient-centric healthcare system is undoubtedly overdue, Ro is first dealing with a massive challenge: its own inability to monetize meaningfully outside of Roman, its erectile dysfunction vertical. Stagnating ARR, and Ro’s need to grow into its recently-landed<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2021/03/22/digital-health-startup-ro-raised-500-million-at-5-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $5 billion valuation,</a> has created an environment for employees that paints a picture of a company struggling to find new avenues of growth and integrations of acquisitions.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke to ten current and former Ro employees on the condition of anonymity, due to fear of retaliation or of impact on future employment, about the work environment at Ro. These employees detailed a low-morale work environment, due in part to the way that leadership sets frantic strategy and refuses basic feedback. They say tensions have led to employee churn across all teams.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224492" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to LinkedIn, there have been several departures across all departments over the past few months, including high-profile positions like head of data, head of partnerships and head of product management. Eight people out of Ro’s 11-person customer service operations team have quit due to culture, the majority leaving after only being at the company for five months, employees say.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">After contacting Ro for comment, TechCrunch obtained a company-wide e-mail that Ro sent to staff about this article, saying that it “aims to paint Ro in a negative light.” The email prompted </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">more staff to reach out to TechCrunch, also on condition of anonymity, to confirm their experience of Ro’s troubling environment.</span></p>
<p>“Every time I’m stressed out about work, I come back to the same realization: we’re selling dick pills, we’re not curing cancer, we’re not becoming a patient’s first call,” a current employee told TechCrunch. “[Erectile dysfunction] is where we make all our money.”</p>
<h2>&#8220;Everything was going toward Roman&#8221;</h2>
<p>Ro started out by selling erectile dysfunction medication to men. Founder Zachariah Reitano, who goes by Z, launched the company after firsthand dealing with the broken and stigmatized ED patient experience. Four years later, Reitano, along with co-founders Saman Rahmanian and Robert Schutz, have grown the company&#8217;s ambitions rapidly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the years, Ro has launched a number of different services, including Rory, a digital health clinic for women; Zero, a smoking cessation treatment service; Ro Pharmacy, which offers low prices on generic medications; and more nascent products like Ro Skincare and a health guide to beat WebMD.</p>
<p>Investors have taken notice. The health tech unicorn has raised nearly $900 million in venture capital to date, attracting top-tier venture capital firms, including Dragoneer Investment Group, SignalFire, FirstMark, General Catalyst and Initialized Capital. Ro’s most recent round, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/ro-raises-500m-to-grow-its-remote-and-in-home-primary-care-platform/">a $500 million Series D</a>, triggered an acquisition spree: In less than a year, the company has acquired Workpath, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/ro-buys-kit-a-17-month-old-startup-that-offers-at-home-health-testing/">Kit</a> and, most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Modern Fertility.</a> It’s even <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-roman-health-m-a/telehealth-company-ro-explores-deal-to-go-public-sources-idUSKBN29W30R" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exploring a potential IPO</a>.</p>
<p>While Ro has expanded its product lineup and wooed ready investors, several former and current employees paint a different picture. Roman, Ro’s erectile dysfunction vertical, is the core of Ro’s business, they say, which puts the company in an uncomfortable spot where it is overly reliant on Viagra, an out-of-patent generic drug that is facing race-to-the-bottom competition from other providers. The company’s overall ARR has flattened at a time when much of health tech has skyrocketed in the wake of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, Ro denied this, saying that ARR is currently greater at $300 million and has not stagnated, but didn’t give a time frame or further details. Employees, meanwhile, say they were told that the sputtering ARR growth was because of Ro’s investment in acquisitions and hiring, not lack of success — <a href="https://www.hingehealth.com/hinge-health-raises-series-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even as other health tech companies</a> touted growing revenue. Hims &amp; Hers, Ro’s closest competitor, said in its Q2 earnings that revenue climbed <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210811005825/en/Hims-Hers-Health-Inc.-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">69% year over year.</a></p>
<p>Ro has not yet been able to successfully make meaningful money beyond its erectile dysfunction drug, which accounts for a significant — some say up to half — of Ro’s revenue. No other Ro product has ever come close to that initial success. Ro confirmed that Roman constitutes half of its revenue, but said that non-Roman has grown more than 130% year over year, without specifics.</p>
<p>“If you look at all of the marketing spend, everything was going towards Roman,” said a former employee. Ro denies this, claiming that over 20% of its marketing spend year to date was dedicated to non-Roman brands. Put differently, it confirmed that close to 80% of marketing spend was dedicated to Roman.</p>
<p>This tension trickled down to how Ro prioritized new business verticals, which employees say it knew it needed but simultaneously didn’t put money behind.</p>
<p>“I noticed this pattern of leaders being very hyper focused, very hyper vigilant on a launch, getting a team together, and then not hearing about that launch later,” the employee continued. “But I also took it as, Ro was in telehealth and there are a lot of barriers and hoops that need to happen in order for a launch to be successful.”</p>
<h2>&#8220;We want to jack the valuation of this company up ASAP so we can IPO soon&#8221;</h2>
<p>As Ro has tried to expand beyond its one-hit wonder, a former employee says the resulting “identity crisis” has created a culture of launch fast, fail fast for new product lines, which hurts consumers and employee morale.</p>
<p>“Everything we launched [in 2020] was a complete failure,” a former employee said. “As they started to get these funding rounds, you would burn yourself out for a month, you launch it, and it would do nothing because there’s a fancy article and complete failure.”</p>
<p>One employee said that Ro’s at-home COVID-19 tests, which had a landing page and still has an active waiting list, never officially launched, thanks to pushback from Ro’s medical team. Business Insider wrote <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/digital-health-startup-ro-future-relies-on-testing-2021-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about the early efforts.</a> Ro confirmed that no tests have been sold, because they are yet to be approved by the FDA.</p>
<p>Employees say that other projects that have struggled are Ro Pharmacy, a mail order pharmacy for generic medications. Ro has been vocal about a recent push into operating its own pharmacies. In a previous interview, Reitano told TechCrunch, that the company will have 10 pharmacies by the end of 2021 and 15 by the end of 2022. Internally, the growth metrics for Ro’s pharmacy efforts have stopped being reported to the entire staff.</p>
<p>Another vertical that has struggled is Ro Skincare, <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/ro-dips-skincare-new-prescription-dermatology-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a prescription dermatology line</a> that was launched in May 2020 but has seen little adoption. Ro’s weight management service, Plenity, hasn’t been shut down, but similarly is struggling to get customers to stick to the product.</p>
<p>Ro denies these struggles, claiming that all three verticals will do “tens of millions of dollars in revenue in 2021” and none have been sunsetted. The company added that Plenity is growing 1,500% year over year, but it’s unclear what metrics or benchmarks are being used since <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/north-america/ro-launch-new-weight-management-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that product’s 2019 launch.</a></p>
<p>A current employee says that Zero, Ro’s smoking cessation product, has been shut down for two years and has no employees staffed on the project. Ro denied this, saying that Zero is still available on <a href="http://quitwithzero.com/">QuitWithZero.com</a> and through Roman and Rory.</p>
<p>Over the past year, rapid acquisitions have only added to the growing chaos.</p>
<p>“Each acquisition felt like it came out of nowhere,” a recently resigned employee interviewed by TechCrunch, said. “We’ve never really integrated with any of our companies that we’ve acquired; so what are we doing this for? The focus [of the company] would shift a lot because of these acquisitions, and, leaders would say ‘this is a growth company, that’s what happens.’”</p>
<p>Some employees started to feel like the deals were just a smokescreen, done for publicity as long-time products within Ro’s suite of services were struggling. Leadership felt focused on marketing the products before they were even integrated into the platform. “Packaging is packaging, are we actually delivering something people want?” the employee continued.</p>
<p>Another employee told TechCrunch that Workpath, which was acquired in December 2020 for its home-based care services, was used for Ro’s in-home vaccination service and then tossed aside.</p>
<p>Some interviewees say that Modern Fertility, a reproductive health company, felt like an acquisition “for optics” than for actual change, given the fact that Rory, Ro’s vertical for women’s healthcare, has been given little to no investment. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/?tpcc=ECTW2020">The acquisition was controversial </a>to begin with, as some noted the pattern of women-focused healthcare companies getting acquired by a male-led company &#8212; <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/05/25/ro-modern-fertility-womens-health-tech/">instead of the opposite. </a></p>
<p>Another former employee says that Rory always struggled; “because, quite frankly, no one has ever put any time and effort into it because it is not selling dick pills.” Until recently, Rory was led by Rachel Blank. She recently left to start <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/allara-pcos-ro-rachel-blank/">her own company in women’s hormonal health</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Ro previously claimed</a> that Rory was growing 300% year over year before the Modern Fertility acquisition. A current employee says that last year Roman was routinely getting 2,000 new members a day, while Rory often got around four.</p>
<p>“If you look at what happened to all of Ro’s brands, why would you want to be acquired by Ro?” a former employee said. “That’s why I worry about the people on Modern Fertility, because they’ve built such a wonderful product and team and they’re now being folded into this weird culture of unrealistic expectations.”</p>
<p>Modern Fertility co-founder Carly Leahy responded to a request for comment by saying “The Ro team has been incredibly welcoming to Modern Fertility and we continue to be energized by what we can do for women’s health together.” She also said that there are no planned departures from Modern Fertility’s executive team.</p>
<p>Employees felt differently. Acquisitions felt like Ro’s leadership was resorting to external reliance on production innovation, rather than investing in newer or pre-existing teams.</p>
<p>“What changed was the focus moved from growing a business to clearly ‘we want to jack the valuation of this company up ASAP so we can IPO soon,’” a former employee said. “It no longer mattered what individual employees were doing or who was there; it just mattered that we set this strategy.”</p>
<h2>The &#8220;Amazon of healthcare&#8221;</h2>
<p>One employee said that they knew it was time to leave Ro when the co-founders began to circulate a new focus for the company: become the ‘Amazon of healthcare.’ The multinational e-commerce giant is one of the biggest tech companies in the world, but has also long been accused of <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/25/amazon-drivers-pee-bottles-union/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruthless</a> <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/09/my-wife-was-dying-of-brain-cancer-my-boss-at-amazon-told-me-to-perform-or-quit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treatment</a> of its workers in pursuit of profit.</p>
<p>The comparison is more than a theoretical hope: Senior leadership bought a book written by two former Amazon executives, “Working Backwards,” with the intent of replicating Amazon’s culture and leadership strategies.</p>
<p>Several employees detailed incidents of micro-management that didn’t allow employees to express their opinions, ranging from questioning the efficacy of a new product line to being told to never ask to move their seat. One employee said they weren’t allowed to meet with other managers without asking their own for approval. It wasn’t uncommon for employees to be told they weren&#8217;t “Ro-first” if they disagreed with leadership’s vision on a certain sub-brand, they said.</p>
<p>The failures amid integrations and other business verticals weren’t addressed, which many employees say caused they and their co-workers to burn out.</p>
<p>“I think that was the part that was really frustrating for employees,” a former employee told TechCrunch. “I knew if I complained in a Culture Amp [employee satisfaction] survey, my department was going to get a ‘talking to’ &#8212; not about how to fix this problem, but more how to make sure there’s not going to be a negative story about this in the press.&#8221;</p>
<p>To illustrate its culture, a Ro spokesperson pointed to “extremely high engagement scores” from an internal<a href="https://www.cultureamp.com/"> Culture Amp</a> survey last fall. They also noted the following: Ro was recognized as one of Inc.&#8217;s Best Workplaces in 2020 and 2021, Forbes&#8217; list of America&#8217;s Best Startup Employers, as well as on Fortune&#8217;s Best Workplaces in Healthcare, Best Workplaces in New York, Best Workplaces for Millennials and Best Medium Sized Workplaces lists for 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re proud of the culture, team and the company we have built and the impact we’re having on the lives of our patients,” the spokesperson wrote in a statement. “We are incredibly excited for what&#8217;s ahead, including our recent investments in fertility, mental health and in-home care, which will allow us to help more people with more of their healthcare needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>While employees say this has created a culture of mass departures and low morale, Ro chalked it up to the “great resignation” happening across industries. The company said that its voluntary turnover is 8% year to date, meaning fewer than 30 employees have left since the beginning of the year &#8212; significantly less than macro-trends. An analysis using LinkedIn, and corroboration by former and current employees, suggests that dozens more have left the company. Furthermore, a current employee cast doubt on the percentage, saying that there is a sense within the company that more are leaving. Last week, HR sent managers an email about &#8220;the great resignation&#8221; across the country and urged leaders to be more supportive of their direct reports.</p>
<p>“There’s just a feeling of every time you turn around, someone is saying ‘Monday is my last day,’” they said. “It’s like we hire one person, and two other people leave.”</p>
<p>Reitano was not made available for further comment. In an email to Ro staff about this article, Reitano wrote that “We want the bar for Ro to be extremely high” and that “Ro isn’t for everyone.” He also urged employees to submit a ticket to the People team if they have feedback or need additional resources.</p>
<h2>Performance matters</h2>
<p>Of the employees who have recently left, many explained how conflicted it felt to leave a company that had a great mission but fell short in execution.</p>
<p>“Everyone there comes for the right intention, for wanting to save the world and wanting to improve access to healthcare,” a former employee told TechCrunch. “And then you realize, once you’re there, that it’s really just about making sure that you’re first to market with a cheap drug that can be sent to people. It feels icky.”</p>
<p>One employee, who left a few years ago, worked at the company before it became a well-known unicorn. The micromanagement and “paranoid secretiveness” from leadership eventually made them leave. “I always thought it wasn’t Ro. That I was the issue. That maybe I’m being impatient or don’t know how stuff works here or I was not fitting in,” they said.</p>
<p>Ro isn’t claiming to invent breakthrough technology &#8212; most of its business is making it easier for consumers to access generic drugs and services &#8212; and thus some of its aggressive focus on marketing feels warranted. Ultimately, however, Ro’s issue is its inability to replicate the success of Roman across other verticals, taking a toll on the employees that are working on its staff.</p>
<p>“The first year that I was there, I was like the happiest person on earth,” a recently resigned employee said. “The piece that needs to be recalibrated is what is the end vision? What do you mean when you say a vertically integrated, patient-centered health system? And are the actions moving you toward that? And that’s ultimately why I left, because I didn’t feel like what was being said externally was actually happening internally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple finally put itself on equal footing with rivals by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/02/this-week-in-apps-tiktok-shops-for-advertisers-microsoft-makes-app-store-changes-apples-apps-get-reviews/">allowing users</a> to rate and review its own, first-party apps <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/29/rate-and-review-apple-iphone-built-in-apps/">for the first time</a> this fall, amid increased regulatory pressure ahead of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/25/report-apple-very-likely-to-face-antitrust-lawsuit-from-us-department-of-justice/">a likely antitrust investigation.</a> Although some of Apple&#8217;s apps had been available to download separately, they had never been able to be reviewed. And <a href="https://appfigures.com/resources/insights/apple-pre-installed-app-ratings">some didn&#8217;t fare well</a>, as it turned out &#8212; like Mail, News and Podcasts, for example, which started off under three stars. Now, Apple has opened up a few more first-party apps to the App Store for ratings and reviews, including the Phone app, Messages, Photos, Safari and others.</p>
<p>The change was first spotted by developer <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/">Kosta Eleftheriou</a>, who has been a prominent figure in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/">pushing</a> for App Store reforms, particularly on the matter of App Store <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">scammers</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apple just added more of their built-in apps on the App Store, which you can now rate &amp; review: <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/x3PoRpu80k">https://t.co/x3PoRpu80k</a> <a href="https://t.co/HylTXYOcRp">pic.twitter.com/HylTXYOcRp</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224916" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1453229435969277960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Citing <a href="https://appfigures.com/">Appfigures</a> data, Eleftheriou noted a number of Apple apps have now become available to rate and review with iOS 15.1. This includes several default apps, like Clock, Phone, Messages, Camera, Photos, Apple Health and Safari. It also includes Apple Watch-enabled apps like Workout, World Clock, Find Devices and Heart Rate. (Users on iOS 14.x may be able to see the apps but won&#8217;t be able to rate and review them, he noted.)</p>
<p>This change could allow Apple to independently update its default apps outside of iOS updates as it does now. This is a tactic Google follows with many of its core Android features and functions, which have their own <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/cluster?clp=igM4ChkKEzU3MDAzMTM2MTg3ODYxNzc3MDUQCBgDEhkKEzU3MDAzMTM2MTg3ODYxNzc3MDUQCBgDGAA%3D:S:ANO1ljLC8CY&amp;gsr=CjuKAzgKGQoTNTcwMDMxMzYxODc4NjE3NzcwNRAIGAMSGQoTNTcwMDMxMzYxODc4NjE3NzcwNRAIGAMYAA%3D%3D:S:ANO1ljKF24s">Play Store listings</a>.</p>
<p>Appfigures confirmed to us the apps appear to have been added as separate listings on October 25, independently of the latest iOS update. As many consumers are likely unaware of the apps&#8217; listings at this time, they have few reviews. For instance, the Phone app only has six ratings so far, they pointed out.  Messages has just a handful of ratings, as well, but they&#8217;re positive, giving the app 4.7 stars. (See below)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2225151" style="width: 414px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225151" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2225151" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apps-ranks.jpg?w=404" alt="" width="404" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apps-ranks.jpg 761w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apps-ranks.jpg?resize=89,150 89w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apps-ranks.jpg?resize=178,300 178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apps-ranks.jpg?resize=404,680 404w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apps-ranks.jpg?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225151" class="wp-caption-text">Chart shows global ratings so far.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://appfigures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Appfigures </a><a href="https://appfigures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="screen-reader-text"> (opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Oddly, Safari &#8212; which has four ratings, so far&#8211; has an age rating of only 4+ for its web browser, while its rivals like Chrome and Firefox are rated 17+, as are other web browsers.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how well these apps hold up as more people discover they can rate and review Apple&#8217;s default apps. Hopefully, by opening themselves up to consumer feedback, Apple will be motivated to make the changes users want to see in these built-in apps and get alerted earlier to possible bugs as they arise.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>After trying to find an H-1B job to immigrate to the United States for several years, I took a senior software engineer position with a company in Canada. </strong></p>
<p><strong>My dream is to immigrate to Silicon Valley to start my own venture. Any advice?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Eager Entrepreneur</strong></p>
<p>Dear Eager,</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your experience. In honor of National Immigrants Day, I paid homage in my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/094-celebrating-national-immigrants-day-october-28th/">podcast</a> to the immigrants who come to the United States to pursue their dreams and help shape so many of the things I appreciate about our country. Research consistently shows that immigrants &#8212; particularly immigrant entrepreneurs like you, through your fortitude, grit and determination &#8212; create ventures that lead to innovation, job creation and economic growth in the United States.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://data.newamericaneconomy.org/en/fortune500-2021/#exploratory_tool">2020 report by the New American Economy</a>, 44% of Fortune 500 companies, which includes both public and private entities, were founded by immigrants or their children. Together, those companies generated $6.2 trillion in revenue in the fiscal year 2020, which is greater than the GDP of many countries, including Japan, Germany and the U.K.</p>
<p>Although U.S. immigration policy does not make it easy for people to come to the United States to live the life of their dreams, it’s still possible. As you may know, most U.S. work visas and statuses require an employer, which could be your own startup.</p>
<p>As always, I recommend that you consult an immigration attorney who can help you structure a personalized immigration strategy based on your specific goals surrounding your vision and ideal timeline. Below are some options to consider with your immigration counsel.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<h2>L-1 visa for intracompany transferees</h2>

If you continue to work for your current employer in Canada for at least one year and your employer is willing to sponsor you, your employer could transfer you to its office or operation in the United States, or you can set up an office for your employer either on an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/l-1a-visa-intracompany-transferee-executives/">L-1A visa</a> for intracompany managers and executives or an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/l-1b-visa-intracompany-transferee-specialized-knowledge/">L-1B visa</a> for intracompany specialized knowledge workers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Webflow has raised more than $200 million and become a household name in the world of web design, creation and hosting. What makes Webflow special is that it has been a pioneer in the no-code space, allowing everyday, non-engineer folks to build websites without writing a single line of code.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this has caught the attention of investors and consumers alike. That includes CapitalG&#8217;s Laela Sturdy, who joined the Webflow board during the company&#8217;s massive Series B fundraise.</p>
<p>So, it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re absolutely <em>thrilled</em> to have Webflow co-founder and CEO Vlad Magdalin and CapitalG partner Laela Sturdy join us on <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-live-with-capitalg-and-webflow?ref=80f041f2a9f3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wednesday, November 3, at 12 p.m. PDT/3 p.m. EDT for an upcoming episode of TechCrunch Live (REGISTER FOR FREE)</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224377" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">TechCrunch Live</a> is a weekly event series at TechCrunch that is focused on helping founders build better venture-backed businesses.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced a preview of <a href="https://developer.android.com/12L" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android 12L</a>, which may sound like a new version of Android, but Google calls it &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">a special feature drop that makes Android 12 even better on large screens.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea here is to provide users on tablets, foldables and Chrome OS laptops &#8212; anything with a screen above 600 dp &#8212; with an improved user interface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The developer preview of <a href="https://developer.android.com/12L" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android 12L</a> is now available for developers who want to give it a try, as well as a new Android 12L emulator and support for it in Android Studio. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225059" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But 12L is also for phones, Google says, confusing no one. Since you won&#8217;t really see most of the new features there, though, the focus right now is on other devices, with beta enrollments for Pixel devices launching later in the preview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Google calls it a &#8220;feature drop&#8221; and &#8220;feature update&#8221; in its announcement today, we&#8217;re not looking at a full fork of Android for these devices the way Apple split up iOS and iPadOS. Instead, it&#8217;s an update for large-screen devices that introduces additional multitasking tools and an optimized user interface. By default, Android 12L should also make apps look better on these devices, too. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225070" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225070" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2225070" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png" alt="" width="1024" height="820" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png?resize=768,615 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png?resize=680,545 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png?resize=1536,1231 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2225070" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Specifically, this means Google refined how <span style="font-weight: 400;">notifications, quick settings, lock screen, overview and the home screen look on large screens. System apps on Android 12L have also been optimized. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What&#8217;s probably most interesting here is the new multitasking features, with a new taskbar that is a bit reminiscent of iPadOS. Android already supported split-screen mode on tablets, but Google notes that it&#8217;s now more discoverable. You simply drag and drop an icon from the taskbar onto the screen to invoke it. This also means every app on Android is now enabled to support split-screen mode (something that developer previously had to opt-in to).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225069" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-3.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225069" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2225069 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-3.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="640" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2225069" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google plans to release 12L early next year, &#8220;in time for the next wave of Android 12 tablets and foldable.&#8221; We should probably expect to hear a lot about Android tablets and foldable at MWC then.</p>
<p>In addition to Android 12L, Google also today announced new features in OS and Play for developers to better support these devices. These include updates to its <a href="https://m3.material.io/foundations/adaptive-design/foldables/compositions">Material Design guidance</a> for large-screen devices, but also updates to Jetpack Compose to make it easier to build for these machines and to ensure that apps can more easily adapt to various screen orientations and sizes. Android Studio is also getting a resizable emulator to help developers test their apps on a wider variety of screen sizes and a new visual linting tool to surface UI warnings and suggestions when the layout has issues.</p>
<p>As for Google Play, the company will now check apps against its <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/large-screens-app-quality&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1635357399454000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2jQo0QmGf9Oo99MstS3xmf">large screen app quality guidelines</a> and its search rankings will take the results of this into account. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">For apps that are not optimized for large screens, we’ll start warning large screen users with a notice on the app’s Play Store listing page,&#8221; Google says. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company saw 900% growth over the past 12 months and will be using the new funding to support that growth and new innovation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.daring.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daring Foods</a> closed on $65 million in Series C funding Wednesday as the plant-based chicken startup launches its products into 3,000 Walmart stores nationally.</p>
<p>Daring offers four plant-based chicken products, including Original, Lemon &amp; Herb, Cajun and Breaded, that looks, cooks and tastes like its chicken counterpart.</p>
<p>CEO Ross Mackay told TechCrunch that the goal of the company is to provide a product that can be “a true one-to-one substitute for chicken” that is also healthy. Daring’s product contains just five ingredients compared to some of its competitors that have a blend of 30 to 40 ingredients, and it also is high in protein and lower in calories than traditional chicken, he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225042" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5eiqBfYdH8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/daring-foods/">Daring Foods will offer healthy, tasty plant-based chicken</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Daring Foods will offer healthy, tasty plant-based chicken&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/daring-foods/embed/#?secret=5eiqBfYdH8" data-secret="5eiqBfYdH8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Eighty percent of people changing to a plant-based diet do it for health reasons,” Mackay added. “They want to be able to trust the ingredient profile, and at Daring, we can say absolutely it is healthy.”</p>
<p>TechCrunch last visited with Mackay in 2019, about a year after the company was founded and it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/daring-foods/">received a $10 million investment</a> from Rastelli Foods Group. Back then, the company was young, with just one product and fewer than 10 employees.</p>
<p>Today, the company’s new funding, led by Founders Fund, is the third investment into the company during the past 12 months, Mackay told TechCrunch. Joining Founders Fund is existing investor D1 Capital Group and new athlete and celebrity investors including Naomi Osaka, Cameron Newton, Steve Aoki and Chase Coleman.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Following this latest round, the company has now raised over $120 million. Its Series A, led by Maveron, was raised last September, and its B round, led by D1 Capital, was announced in May.</p>
<p>Daring Foods’ products can be found in Whole Foods, Sprouts and Kroger, with Wegmans and Albertsons coming soon, Mackay said. With the addition of Walmart, its distribution has doubled to 6,000, including online markets like Gopuff and Imperfect Foods, and is also being served in some restaurants across the country.</p>
<p>The company saw 900% growth over the past 12 months and will be using the new funding to support that growth and new innovation. In addition, the company grew to 60 employees. Mackay says Daring remains focused on plant-based chicken and has plans for new product launches, some in the coming months and others in the next year.</p>
<p>Daring’s growth is in line with what is going on in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/plant-based-foods-market-to-hit-162-billion-in-next-decade-projects-bloomberg-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global plant-based foods</a> market, which is poised to be a $162 billion market by 2030.</p>
<p>“I don’t think this is a trend, but the future of food, and we are excited to lead in chicken,” Mackay said. “More brands can step into the category, and the innovation going on in the space is super exciting. Capital plowing into the industry is showing the growth trajectory, and at the end of the day, the consumers win.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://delta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Air Lines</a>, in partnership with TSA PreCheck, today announced an expansion of how it uses biometrics to let passengers drop their bags, go through security and board their plane by simply showing their face. For now, the newest part of this, the PreCheck bag-drop experience, is a pilot that&#8217;s only available in Atlanta and for Delta&#8217;s SkyMiles frequent flier program members who are also registered for TSA pre-check.</p>
<p>The project builds and expands upon the work <a href="https://news.delta.com/delta-launches-first-domestic-digital-identity-test-us-providing-touchless-curb-gate-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the airline has done</a> at its Detroit hub and for its international flights out of Atlanta. But now it includes a facial recognition-powered bag-drop experience, too.</p>
<p>In Atlanta, where Delta and the TSA are running this pilot, members of Delta&#8217;s SkyMiles frequent flier program who are also TSA pre-check members now get their own self-service PreCheck bag-drop area. There, passengers who opt in to the program (which they have to do every time they check in to a flight on the Delta app) simply walk up to the new bag-drop machines, scan their face, which will validate who they are through the TSA&#8217;s database, and the machine will print out their baggage label for them. Once they attach the label, they set the bag on the belt and the new automated bag-drop machines weigh the bag and use cameras to check its size.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224260" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Forbes noted that this only works for regular roller bags, suitcases and duffle bags. It&#8217;s essentially the bag-drop area for frequent fliers who know what they are doing.</p>

<p><span class="">Currently, about a quarter of Atlanta-based Delta fliers are already qualified to drop off their bags this way. Since the experience is linked to a SkyMiles account, this may also incentivize a few people to sign up for Delta&#8217;s frequent flier program, too, which then gives it new ways to market to those fliers as well.</span></p>
<p>In trying out the experience firsthand, the promise of a 30-second bag drop seemed quite achievable. The facial recognition, with the mask briefly removed, takes a few seconds. Attaching the luggage tag probably took longer than anything else.</p>
<p>For now, Delta set up a small space for this with only four machines, but Forbes noted that if capacity becomes an issue, the airline already has plans for a second bag-drop area elsewhere in the airport.</p>
<p>The new bag-drop machines also feature affordances for the visually impaired and, in case there&#8217;s any confusion about who you are, a boarding pass scanner.</p>
<p>From bag drop, it&#8217;s off to the PreCheck line, where there&#8217;s another facial scan and then the boarding gate, for yet another one. If all goes well, you never need to get out a boarding pass or ID (but you should bring an ID anyway, of course).</p>

<p>By default, the use of biometrics raises some privacy questions. Delta stresses that it only takes the image to send it to the TSA to validate your identity. And to be fair, if you opt in to PreCheck or Global Entry, the TSA already knows what you look like and when you travel. Forbes also noted that Delta itself doesn&#8217;t touch any of the biometric data but leaves that up to its partners who provide the technology for it. The security of their technology has been validated by the government, but we all know that there is no system that is guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve now crossed the U.S. border a number of times this year, mostly using Global Entry, which at this point fully relies on facial recognition, too. It felt a bit odd the first time, but since Homeland Security already has all of my information, it became a non-issue and simply got me on my way to my connection faster. Using the Delta system from curbside to boarding felt quite similar (and not having to touch anything is a nice bonus in the age of corona).</p>
<p>Still, not everybody is going to be willing to make these tradeoffs. For them, nothing really changes. All of this is opt-in, after all.</p>
<p>For now, this is a somewhat exclusive partnership between Delta and the TSA, at least for the current pilot program. Other airlines are surely already working on something similar (United is a likely next adopter, despite its partnership with CLEAR). I would expect Delta to expand on this throughout its various customer touchpoints in the airport and others to follow suit soon.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and President Joe Biden’s larger domestic policy package garnered national interest because of the bipartisan struggles and brief periods of unity for the United States.</p>
<p>Now, in the passed legislation, there is $100 million <a href="https://www.constructiondive.com/news/infrastructure-technology-funding/604766/">earmarked</a> over five years to “accelerate the deployment of digital construction technologies such as 3D modeling software and digital project management platforms,” thanks to the <a href="https://infrastructurecoalition.org/">Coalition for Smarter Infrastructure Investments</a>.</p>
<p>“President Biden believes we must produce, here at home, the technologies and goods that meet today’s challenges and seize tomorrow’s opportunities,” the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/">said</a> in a fact sheet.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224349" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Yet while the sweeping package &#8212; which aims to boost the economy, reduce carbon emissions and narrow economic inequality &#8212; gets off the ground, we in the private sector know infrastructure on this level will need robust changes that incorporate emerging technologies during design and construction, or much of the construction will only hamper our major cities and hubs.</p>
<p>Recent technological advances truly do have the ability to aid an industry that has been beaten down by the pandemic and then global supply chain shortages. New York City alone lost an <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/18/74k-nyc-construction-jobs-lost-during-pandemic/">estimated</a> $9.8 billion in construction activity and 74,000 jobs because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, over 73 cargo ships could not dock at major ports within Los Angeles and Long Beach because of a backup in offloading goods. The uptick in some material prices and these delays lead to shortages, causing new tensions in supply-chain business relationships, making it more important than ever to complete major infrastructure projects on time.</p>
<p>The infrastructure bill would add $488 billion to the U.S. GDP by 2027 with just the additional $153.7 billion slated for new highway, bridge and public transit investment, <a href="https://www.artba.org/2021/09/22/infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-iija-would-provide-major-u-s-economic-boost-new-analysis-reveals/">according to ARTBA</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The full bipartisan bill contains $550 billion in new spending; the $1.2 trillion figure comes from including additional funding normally allocated each year for highways and other infrastructure projects. The new spending <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/10/senate-infrastructure-bill-what-is-in-it/">includes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>$110 billion for roads and bridges.</li>
<li>$66 billion for railroads.</li>
<li>$65 billion for the power grid.</li>
<li>$65 billion for broadband.</li>
<li>$55 billion for water infrastructure.</li>
<li>$47 billion for cybersecurity and climate change.</li>
<li>$39 billion for public transit.</li>
<li>$25 billion for airports.</li>
<li>$21 billion for the environment.</li>
<li>$17 billion for ports.</li>
<li>$11 billion for safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>What the Smarter Infrastructure Coalition and I know from our respective fields is that within that list, there is north of $500 billion that is about to be dedicated to infrastructure projects that still use outdated methods, hurting return on investment and eventually the next generation of taxpayers who will foot this bill.</p>
<p>With this kind of spending and need for accountability, it’s time to harness the power of algorithms and call on AI for greater accountability. Machine learning tools can examine huge volumes of data for patterns. Varying sizes of construction companies will be looking for solutions to manage applications, mobile devices and a range of other collaborative tools to ensure projects land on time and on budget.</p>
<p>We’ve all seen the success that firms like Uber, Amazon and Airbnb have built on their ability to analyze vast amounts of data. It may have taken longer for a hands-on industry like ours to adapt, but now AI is realizing massive savings in construction by reducing the cost of equipment and manpower while also helping to spot delays and recommend improvements with accuracy and scale previously not possible.</p>
<p>Piping insulation might sound like a small thing, but there are a million “small things” that make up these projects and need tech enablement to save taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>In an example from my work with Doxel, a multibillion-dollar project from a global oil and gas company saved millions and avoided a three-week delay because computer vision was able to immediately prioritize corrective action when piping systems had not been properly installed.</p>
<p>Essentially, when digital surveying and our algorithms caught the fact that insulation had not been installed according to the plan, we saved that company money by opening the plant on time, avoiding sending home thousands of workers at that plant.</p>
<p>Even before the infrastructure bill was announced, there was a global uptick in appetite for major infrastructure projects because they provide jobs and then positive ongoing economic impact for the regions where they are implemented. Boots on the ground waned, however, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/08/economy/construction-worker-shortage/index.html">and are reaching new lows</a> &#8212; perhaps because of stigma attached to the work, or maybe because of vocational fads and new adult education learning patterns.</p>
<p>What is abundantly clear is that tech-enabled surveillance and daily project reporting are simply imperative for the infrastructure bill’s success to stimulate our GDP. Construction is a power player on the world stage, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-55293920110303">representing</a> 13% of global GDP, but construction has seen a meager productivity growth (1% annually), largely because of fragmented solutions and lack of tech adoption, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-equity-and-principal-investors/our-insights/rise-of-the-platform-era-the-next-chapter-in-construction-technology">according to McKinsey</a>.</p>
<p>According to the same report’s <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/infrastructure-productivity">Infrastructure Productivity Guidelines</a>, streamlining delivery (e.g., investing heavily in the early stages of project planning and design) can save up to $400 billion annually and accelerate timelines of large construction projects.</p>
<p>We currently have the ability to precision-track job-site progress with the use of cameras and lidar devices, in addition to the ability to connect progress to budget and schedule to predict delays and cost overruns when job-site conditions stray from the plan. We can augment worker presence by freeing up time previously spent on job-site walks, in addition to providing critical progress reports with contextualized insights weekly — and much more.</p>
<p>After 2022, a boom in U.S. construction is inevitable and will play a significant role in reviving a battered global economy. Let’s not be afraid to use technology, when properly managed and deployed, to empower the limited workers we will have available to us to be more productive and avoid the costly pitfalls from the schedule delays that so many huge infrastructure projects in the U.S. have been dogged by in the past.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Abacus.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abacus.ai</a> wants to build an AI platform that simplifies machine learning model creation, while still leaving room for power users. Today the company announced a $50 million Series C. At the same time, it announced that the platform was expanding to include computer vision use cases.</p>
<p>Tiger Global led the round, with participation from Coatue, Index Ventures and Alkeon Capital. With today&#8217;s investment, the company says that it has raised over $90 million in less than 30 months. The most recent funding prior to this was the company&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/abacus-ai-raises-another-22m-and-launches-new-ai-modules/"> $22 million Series A</a> last November.</p>
<p>Abacus co-founder and CEO Bindu Reddy, whose background includes stints at Google and AWS, says the company is trying to create a complete AI platform. &#8220;We have this end-to-end AI/ML platform where the unique thing is we have these vertically integrated solutions, which are kind of specific to common enterprise AI use cases. So think of things like churn reduction or lead scoring or personalization,&#8221; Reddy told me.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224965" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>She says that this enables companies which lack a dedicated data science team to build machine learning models with the help of the platform. &#8220;With Abacus, you have all the pieces and modules that a standard AI platform like SageMaker has, but it is customized for each of those use cases,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>With this approach, you choose a vertical, point to a data set and Abacus builds the model for you. This is sometimes known as AutoML. For companies that have data science teams, and have already built a model, they can use that model instead of one provided by Abacus, giving a complete experience depending on the customer&#8217;s requirements.</p>
<p>The approach puts Abacus in competition with the major cloud vendors and with startups like DataRobot, the Boston AutoML startup that has raised $1 billion, but she believes that Abacus has been able to simplify the model production process more than the cloud companies, and while she acknowledges that DataRobot is a competitor, she says her company&#8217;s ability to offer those vertical solutions is a big differentiator.</p>
<p>One of those vertical solutions is computer vision, and as part of today&#8217;s news, the company also announced new computer vision use cases, including image detection, classification and segmentation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Abacus, which was founded in 2019, currently has 45 employees. With the new capital, the plan is to double that number by year&#8217;s end. As they build up, she says it&#8217;s important to add women and build a diverse company, and Abacus has an internship for high school girls to show them that STEM is an exciting career proposition, something she says that she hopes to expand because the industry needs to attract more girls and women.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think one of the things we need to do is to increase that pool dramatically because one of the problems we definitely have is women [going to places] where there&#8217;s 80-90% men and saying, &#8216;We don&#8217;t even want to do this. Why would I want to work with a bunch of dudes?&#8217; So we have to increase that pool. We need that balance. So we try very hard. We also reach out to women PhDs because we also have a research science department, and we want to make sure that we are also encouraging women researchers in the AI space,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s platform seems to be working in the market, with 10,000 users on the platform, who have created over 30,000 models to date. While Reddy didn&#8217;t want to discuss specific paying customer numbers, she did share that companies like 1-800-Flowers, Flex and Recorded Books are using models in production built on the Abacus platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is rolling out the ability for kids, teens and their parents to request to have pictures deleted from the company&#8217;s image search results.</p>
<p>The new privacy option was one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">many changes the company announced in August</a> in an effort to preemptively build in additional protections for users under the age of 18. Google&#8217;s other planned safeguards include making video uploads private by default, and disabling and weeding out some &#8220;overly commercial&#8221; YouTube kids content, including unboxing videos.</p>
<p>Anyone under the age of 18 or their parent or guardian can ask Google to remove an image from appearing in search results by <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/10949130?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filling out this request form</a>. You&#8217;ll need to specify that you&#8217;d like Google to remove &#8220;Imagery of an individual currently under the age of 18&#8221; and provide some personal information, the image URLs and search queries that would surface the results.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224934" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe this change will help give young people more control over their digital footprint and where their images can be found on Search,&#8221; the company <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/giving-kids-and-teens-more-control-over-their-images-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Google says that it will review all requests and follow up with additional verification questions where needed. The company will provide a notification when images in question are removed, so you won&#8217;t be left waiting.</p>
<p>In many countries, including the U.S., there is no national legal framework addressing the &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221; online. The EU&#8217;s sweeping privacy ruleset known as GDPR, widely regarded as the gold standard for strong privacy regulation, gives people recourse to request that some kinds of online identifying information be removed, including photos.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s new request tool is helpful and available globally, but stops short of the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/article-17-right-to-be-forgotten/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requirements that GDPR enforces</a>. In Google&#8217;s case, to request that a photo be removed the person in question must be under the age of 18. GDPR goes further by requiring internet companies to remove images of an individual at their request if they were a minor at the time the image was uploaded.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google announced the image removal option and a suite of other changes as the company and its peers in the tech industry come under increased regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. On Tuesday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">YouTube testified before the Senate Commerce Committee</a> about efforts it takes to protect young, vulnerable users on its video platform, touting the recently announces changes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors CEO Mary Barra is “pretty confident” that the driver will be out of Cruise vehicles by 2022, as the company looks to enter early commercial operations for autonomous robotaxi and delivery services.</p>
<p>Her comments reiterate a timeline outlined earlier this month by Cruise CEO Dan Ammann at the automaker’s investor day. The guidance from Barra, made during an earnings call with investors Wednesday, comes as several autonomous vehicle companies prepare to launch commercial services or expand existing ones.</p>
<p>One key to Cruise’s success relative to other autonomous vehicle developers is its vertical integration with GM, one of the largest car manufacturers in North America.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224985" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“[Cruise’s] vertical integration with GM is the key differentiator,” she said. “That seamless integration of the technology, along with leveraging Ultium, as well as our manufacturing capability are a huge value.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/cruise-waymo-get-ok-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/">Cruise received its &#8220;driverless deployment permit&#8221;</a> from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, a key approval to start accepting compensation for driverless rides. Only one more permit remains, from the California Public Utilities Commission, until the company can launch its commercial robotaxi service in San Francisco.</p>
<p>“As we speak, Cruise is just one state-level approval away from full regulatory approval to charge customers for rides in San Francisco, and it is still the only company with a permit to provide full driverless ride-hail service in the city,” Barra said.</p>
<p>Her comments were made as part of the automotive giant’s second-quarter earnings call. GM announced revenues of $26.8 billion, a 25% fall from $35.5 billion in the same quarter in 2020. The decline was largely due to the ongoing shortage of semiconductors, which have halted production and decreased dealer inventory.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GM also reported a net income of $2.4 billion in the third quarter, down from a year-ago third-quarter earnings of $4.1 billion.</p>
<p>“The quarter was challenging due to continuing semiconductor pressures,” Barra said in a letter to shareholders.</p>
<p>However, despite the weak earnings, GM executives remained bullish on the year’s outlook overall, telling investors that full-year earnings would be at the high end of its adjusted guidance of $11.5 billion and $13.5 billion.</p>
