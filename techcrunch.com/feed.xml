										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As businesses continue to look for better ways to work more efficiently, a pioneer in the space of low-code tools to help automate how apps work together is announcing a round of funding on the back of impressive early traction.</p>
<p>Berlin-based <a href="https://n8n.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">n8n</a> &#8212; which provides a framework for both technical and non-technical people to synchronize and integrate data and workflows &#8212; has raised a $12 million in a Series A round of funding.</p>
<p>The startup plans to use the money to continue expanding its team, which now numbers 60 people, and to expand its platform and the services it provides to users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, n8n can help link up and integrate data and functions between more than 200 established applications, as well as any custom apps or services that you might be using in your specific organization. And since launching in October 2019, the startup has picked up an impressive 16,000 users &#8212; including both developers and &#8220;citizen developers&#8221; (those whose jobs might be described as non-technical but they are not afraid to be more hands-on in trying to build in ways to work better).</p>
<p>Now it wants to make the service easier for more of the latter group to get stuck in with using it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are still seen as a technical product and less of one for citizen developers,&#8221; founder and CEO Jan Oberhauser said in an interview. &#8220;Our plan is to make n8n simpler to use, so that it&#8217;s much easier to adopt. We want to give everyone technical superpowers, whether it&#8217;s the marketing team or the IT department.&#8221; That means for example building not just chatbots but more intelligent ones, or creating new ways of visualizing data in Slack or something else altogether. And n8n&#8217;s platform can also be used to build automation within products for example to monitor performance and flag when something might need maintenance.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Felicis Ventures, with Sequoia Capital, firstminute Capital and Harpoon Ventures also participating. Sequoia and firstminute <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/n8n-a-fair-code-workflow-automation-platform-raises-seed-from-sequoia-as-vc-firm-steps-up-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-led n8n&#8217;s seed round about a year ago</a>, which also included participation from Eventbrite&#8217;s Kevin Hartz, Supercell&#8217;s Ilkka Paananen, and unnamed early employees of Google and Zendesk, among others. The startup has now raised around $14 million and is not disclosing valuation.</p>
<p>There are a number of low-code and no-code startups on the market today and many of them have been seeing a surge of in interest in the last year. It&#8217;s a trend I suspect was brought about in no small part by the arrival of Covid-19.</p>
<p>The pandemic not only led to more people working remotely and relying on apps and other cloud-based services to get what they needed to do done, but in many cases it led organizations to refocus on how they were working, and what could be improved. In some cases, it also has meant a severe tightening of belts, and so companies are needing to do more with less human power, another factor leading to more proactive efforts to use software to get more out of&#8230; software.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s meant more strain on IT teams, and that too has led to more people within departments themselves getting proactive in improving their own workflows.</p>
<p>Other startups in the space include <a href="https://bryter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bryter</a> (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/berlins-bryter-raises-66m-more-to-take-its-no-code-tools-for-enterprises-to-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a $66 million Series B</a> earlier this month) and <a href="https://genesis.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genesis</a> (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/genesis-raises-45m-to-expand-its-fintech-focussed-low-code-platform-to-more-verticals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $45 million in March</a>), along with <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sequoia-buys-shares-in-elusive-startup-zapier-at-multibillion-dollar-valuation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zapier</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/airtable-is-now-valued-at-5-77b-with-a-fresh-270-million-in-series-e-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airtable</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/rows-formerly-dashdash-raises-16m-to-build-and-populate-web-apps-using-only-spreadsheet-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rows</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/london-based-gyana-raises-3-9m-for-a-no-code-approach-to-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gyana</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/ushur-raises-25m-for-its-no-code-platform-to-build-customer-communication-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ushur</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/creatio-raises-68m-as-the-low-code-space-keeps-attracting-huge-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creatio</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/easysend-raises-16m-from-intel-more-for-its-no-code-approach-to-automating-b2c-interfaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasySend</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/captivateiq-raises-46m-for-its-no-code-sales-commissions-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CapivateIQ</a>, some of which are coming to the market with a variety of solutions targeting a set of generic tools, while others are building solutions for more narrow use cases.</p>
<p>In the case of n8n, the company might be considered a &#8220;pioneer&#8221; in the space not just because of its focus on the growing area of low-code tools, but because of how it views the world of software.</p>
<p>[gallery type="slideshow" ids="1958989,1958987,1958986"]</p>
<p>The basic approach n8n is taking is around the idea of &#8220;fair code.&#8221; This is somewhat similar to open-source, and is analogous to a freemium-style model for the concept. The code is available in a <a href="https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public repository</a> and the idea is that this will never disappear (one issue many enterprises face on the bleeding edge of tech: companies and their services sometimes shut down). However, n8n itself limits how much it can be used for free, before users start to pay to use it so that n8n can monetize its work, which it does in the form of consulting and integration services. (In the case of n8n, that limit <a href="https://community.n8n.io/t/doubts-about-fair-code-license/2502" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks to be up to a limit of $30,000</a> in support services revenues.)</p>
<p>Oberhauser was an early proponent of the concept of n8n and he <a href="https://faircode.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">runs a site</a> dedicated to spreading the word. (You can also read about the different approaches to fair code, and some of what led to the creation of the concept, <a href="https://fosspost.org/fair-code-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.)</p>
<p>While basic and limited access to the code will remain free, and even as a company like n8n aims to make it easier and easier for non-developers to build integrations, there will be areas that need attention to make those services accessible to the people within an organization. For starters, there is the issue of setting up the basic integration connectors, especially in cases where the software a company is using is proprietary or customized.</p>
<p>There is also another issue that is likely to become more prominent as low-code and no-code tools continue to grow in popularity, and that is security. While IT departments may not have oversight of every single integration, but neither will the security teams, which means that new data vulnerabilities might well become more commonplace, too. For all of these reasons, n8n is betting that there will still be some integration and consulting involved in implementation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost every company needs help connecting outside and internal systems, to make it easier for people to get started,&#8221; Oberhauser said.</p>
<p>Aydin Senkut, founder and managing partner of Felicis Ventures, who led the round, said that what attracted him to n8n was the extensibility of the platform &#8212; that it could be applied not just for app integration and workflow automation in those apps but a much wider set of use cases &#8212; and the very early traction of 16,000 users that it&#8217;s picked up with very little fanfare, a sign that the service has some stickiness and usefulness to it.</p>
<p>And the fact that it lets developers &#8212; &#8220;citizen&#8221; or otherwise &#8212; play with so many options is also a key part of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;W<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">e feel that data is the new oil, and one of the special things here is not just low or no-code <em>per se</em>, but how n8n is making it seamless and easy to connect tens or even hundreds of apps.&#8221; Senkut said that it reminded him a little of Felicis&#8217; early investment in Plaid. &#8220;Essentially, the more data and APIs you have the more valuable the company can be. I think to measure the potential of a company, look at the APIs. If you can connect disparate things together, that is key.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to building a successful startup, biotech and hardware happen to be two of the most difficult verticals in the tech industry. But Oura is doing it anyway.</p>
<p>The health and fitness tracking ring has been used in a number of studies around COVID-19 and been worn by NBA and WNBA players to help prevent outbreaks in the league. Oura has raised nearly $50 million from investors including Lifeline Ventures, Bold Capital Partners and Forerunner.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re thrilled to have Forerunner&#8217;s Eurie Kim and Oura CEO Harpreet Rai join us on a forthcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-forerunner-and-oura">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kim is herself a former entrepreneur and joined Forerunner in 2012. She sits on the boards of companies like The Farmer’s Dog, Curology, Attabotics, Oura Ring, Eclipse, Juni, among others, and found herself on the Midas Brink List in 2020.</p>
<p>Rai, for his part, is CEO at Oura, where he leads a team of over 150 employees. Before Oura, Rai was a portfolio manager at Eminence Capital for nine years.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-forerunner-and-oura">Extra Crunch Live</a>, the duo will talk about how Oura went about raising its $28 million Series B round and why Kim took a bet on the startup. We&#8217;ll also ask about tactical advice for founders looking to fundraise and grow their businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku is alerting its customers that they may lose access to the YouTube TV channel on its platform after negotiations with Google went south. The company alleges that Google is attempting to use its monopoly power to insist on unfair, anticompetitive terms with regard to how Roku handles search results for YouTube content, customer data and more. The email also urges Roku customers to reach out to Google to voice their concerns.</p>
<p>Details of the spat were first reported by <a href="https://www.axios.com/roku-google-youtube-tv-dispute-525316c1-4d66-44e3-a96a-40db7b10e05b.html">Axios</a>.</p>
<p>Roku says Google continues to ask for special treatment on Roku&#8217;s streaming media player platform, which today includes a dedicated search results row for YouTube that appear after a customer performs a universal voice search. Roku claims YouTube over a year ago threatened to remove the YouTube app if Roku didn&#8217;t comply with this particular demand. It now wants to ask Google to not preference its own service in the search results, as it believes this row doesn&#8217;t serve its customer base well. The row returns YouTube results at the top of the search results page, even when this isn&#8217;t relevant to what the customer was searching for in the first place, Roku explains.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition, Google is adding on to its earlier demands with a new series of requests to only show only YouTube or YouTube Music search results when the YouTube app is open &#8212; even overriding Roku user preferences to do so. Today, Roku allows its customers to set their own preferred music service provider for their music requests. Google&#8217;s ask that if a user presses the Roku voice search button while YouTube is open, that query returns only YouTube results. That means YouTube Music would play any music request, and YouTube search results would appear for any other request.</p>
<p>Roku says this also disadvantages the customer because it doesn&#8217;t honor the user&#8217;s preferences &#8212; like if their preferred music service is Roku, for example. Also, Roku couldn&#8217;t even use the search results to tell the customer if they&#8217;ve already paid for the content being requested &#8212; like showing them a movie they&#8217;ve already bought on another service or one of their paid subscriptions that carries the title.</p>
<p>There are other concerning demands as well, including asks for customer data that goes outside the realm of industry standard practices, Roku told TechCrunch. Roku says this data isn&#8217;t available to any other partners and it doesn&#8217;t want to share it with Google, either.</p>
<p>Finally, Google wants to reserve the right to ask for new certification requirements, as needed, for carrying YouTube &#8212; changes that could impact the cost of Roku&#8217;s hardware. By increasing the specs &#8212; say, asking for a faster processor speed or more memory &#8212; Google could close the gap between Roku&#8217;s low-end $29 device with Google&#8217;s new $50 Chromecast with Google TV. Roku admits Google has asked for those sorts of hardware changes before, but it now wants that in the YouTube TV agreement, too.</p>
<p>More broadly, Roku is concerned how Google is leveraging YouTube as it asks for these changes, even though the agreement being negotiated is YouTube TV. It says its deal with YouTube is not up for renewal at this time. We understand Google may have also issued similar requests to some TV platforms, but not larger companies like Apple (for Apple TV).</p>
<p>&#8220;Google is attempting to use its YouTube monopoly position to force Roku into accepting predatory, anti-competitive and discriminatory terms that will directly harm Roku and our users,&#8221; a Roku spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Given antitrust suits against Google, investigations by competition authorities of anti-competitive behavior and Congressional hearings into Google’s practices, it should come as no surprise that Google is now demanding unfair and anti-competitive terms that harm Roku’s users,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>Roku declined to say whether or not it would bring its complaints before antitrust investigators, noting that, for now, its focus on closing the deal for YouTube TV.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s common to see carriage disputes when contracts come up for renewal, those tend to involve requests for more money to allow a platform &#8212; like a pay TV provider, for example &#8212; to continue to carry a channel or group of channels. In this case, Roku says its not asking for any change in economic terms.</p>
<p>In the email sent to customers this morning at 6 AM, Roku says it won&#8217;t accept Google&#8217;s terms and its &#8220;anticompetitive requirements to manipulate your search results, impact the usage of your data, and ultimately cost you more.&#8221;</p>
<p>The full letter is below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Roku Customer,​</p>
<p>We are sending this email to update you on the possibility that Google may take away your access to the YouTube TV channel on Roku. Recent negotiations with Google to carry YouTube TV have broken down because Roku cannot accept Google’s unfair terms as we believe they could harm our users. ​</p>
<p>Ensuring a great streaming experience at an exceptional value is the core of our business. We will always stand up for our users, which is why we cannot accept Google&#8217;s unfair and anticompetitive requirements to manipulate your search results, impact the usage of your data and ultimately cost you more. ​</p>
<p>While we are deeply disappointed in Google’s decision to use their monopoly power to try and force terms that will directly harm streamers, we remain committed to reaching an agreement with Google that preserves your access to YouTube TV, protects your data and ensures a level playing field for companies to compete. We encourage you to contact Google and urge them to reach an agreement to continue offering YouTube TV on Roku and to follow standard industry practices pledging not to require access to sensitive search data or to manipulate your search results. ​</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The two founders of Crusoe Energy think they may have a solution to two of the largest problems facing the planet today &#8212; the increasing energy footprint of the tech industry and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the natural gas industry.</p>
<p>Crusoe, which uses excess natural gas from energy operations to power data centers and cryptocurrency mining operations, has just raised $128 million in new financing from some of the top names in the venture capital industry to build out its operations &#8212; and the timing couldn&#8217;t be better.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/climate/methane-leaks-united-nations.html">Methane emissions are emerging as a new area of focus</a> for researchers and policymakers focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and keeping global warming within the 1.5 degree targets set under the Paris Agreement. And those emissions are just what Crusoe Energy is capturing to power its data centers and bitcoin mining operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The reason why addressing methane emissions is so critical in the short term is because these greenhouse gases trap more heat than their carbon dioxide counterparts and also dissipate more quickly. So dramatic reductions in methane emissions can do more in the short term to alleviate the global warming pressures that human industry is putting on the environment.</p>
<p>And the biggest source of methane emissions is the oil and gas industry. In the U.S. alone roughly 1.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas is flared daily, said Chase Lochmiller, a co-founder of Crusoe Energy. About two thirds of that is flared in Texas with another 500 million cubic feet flared in North Dakota, where Crusoe has focused its operations to date.</p>
<p>For Lochmiller, a former quant trader at some of the top American financial services institutions, and Cully Cavmess, a third generation oil and gas scion, the ability to capture natural gas and harness it for computing operations is a natural combination of the two men&#8217;s interests in financial engineering and environmental preservation.</p>

About 100 million dollars worth of natural gas burns off per month because a pipeline system isn&#8217;t in place yet to capture and safely transport it . The Three Affiliated Tribes on Fort Berthold represent Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nations. It&#8217;s also at the epicenter of the fracking and oil boom that has brought oil royalties to a large number of native americans living there.

<p>The two Denver natives met in prep-school and remained friends. When Lochmiller left for MIT and Cavness headed off to Middlebury they didn&#8217;t know that they&#8217;d eventually be launching a business together. But through Lochmiller&#8217;s exposure to large scale computing and the financial services industry, and Cavness assumption of the family business they came to the conclusion that there had to be a better way to address the massive waste associated with natural gas.</p>
<p>Conversation around Crusoe Energy began in 2018 when Lochmiller and Cavness went climbing in the Rockies to talk about Lochmiller&#8217;s trip to Mt. Everest.</p>
<p>When the two men started building their business, the initial focus was on finding an environmentally friendly way to deal with the energy footprint of bitcoin mining operations. It was this pitch that brought the company to the attention of investors at Polychain, the investment firm started by Olaf Carlson-Wee (and Lochmiller&#8217;s former employer), and investors like Bain Capital Ventures and new investor Valor Equity Partners.</p>
<p>(This was also the pitch that Lochmiller made to me to cover the company&#8217;s seed round. At the time I was skeptical of the company&#8217;s premise and was worried that the business would just be another way to prolong the use of hydrocarbons while propping up a cryptocurrency that had limited actual utility beyond a speculative hedge against governmental collapse. I was wrong on at least one of those assessments.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Regarding questions about sustainability, Crusoe has a clear standard of only pursuing projects that are net reducers of emissions. Generally the wells that Crusoe works with are already flaring and would continue to do so in the absence of Crusoe’s solution. The company has turned down numerous projects where they would be a buyer of low cost gas from a traditional pipeline because they explicitly do not want to be net adders of demand and emissions,&#8221; wrote a spokesman for Valor Equity in an email. &#8220;In addition, mining is increasingly moving to renewables and Crusoe’s approach to stranded energy can enable better economics for stranded or marginalized renewables, ultimately bringing more renewables into the mix. Mining can provide an interruptible base load demand that can be cut back when grid demand increases, so overall the effect to incentivize the addition of more renewable energy sources to the grid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other investors have since piled on including: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lowercarbon Capital, DRW Ventures, Founders Fund, Coinbase Ventures, KCK Group, Upper90, Winklevoss Capital, Zigg Capital and Tesla co-founder JB Straubel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company now operate 40 modular data centers powered by otherwise wasted and flared natural gas throughout </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado. Next year that number should expand to 100 units as Crusoe enters new markets such as Texas and New Mexico. Since launching in 2018, Crusoe has emerged as a scalable solution to reduce flaring through energy intensive computing such as bitcoin mining, graphical rendering, artificial intelligence model training and even protein folding simulations for COVID-19 therapeutic research.</span></p>
<p>Crusoe boasts 99.9% combustion efficiency for its methane, and is also bringing additional benefits in the form of <a href="https://dakotacarrier.com/crusoe-dcn-collaboration/">new networking buildout at its data center and mining sites</a>. Eventually, this networking capacity could lead to increased connectivity for rural communities surrounding the Crusoe sites.</p>
<p>Currently, 80% of the company&#8217;s operations are being used for bitcoin mining, but there&#8217;s increasing demand for use in data center operations and some universities, including Lochmiller&#8217;s alma mater of MIT are looking at the company&#8217;s offerings for their own computing needs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s very much in an incubated phase right now,&#8221; said Lochmiller. &#8220;A private alpha where we have a few test customers&#8230; we&#8217;ll make that available for public use later this year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Crusoe Energy Systems should have the lowest data center operating costs in the world, according to Lochmiller and while the company will spend money to support the infrastructure buildout necessary to get the data to customers, those costs are negligible when compared to energy consumption, Lochmiller said.</p>
<p>The same holds true for bitcoin mining, where the company can offer an alternative to coal powered mining operations in China and the construction of new renewable capacity that wouldn&#8217;t be used to service the grid. As cryptocurrencies look for a way to blunt criticism about the energy usage involved in their creation and distribution, Crusoe becomes an elegant solution.</p>
<p>Institutional and regulatory tailwinds are also propelling the company forward. Recently New Mexico passed new laws limiting flaring and venting to no more than 2 percent of an operator&#8217;s production by April of next year and North Dakota is pushing for incentives to support on-site flare capture systems while Wyoming signed a law creating incentives for flare gas reduction applied to bitcoin mining. The world&#8217;s largest financial services firms are also taking a stand against flare gas with BlackRock calling for an end to routine flaring by 2025.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Where we view our power consumption, we draw a very clear line in our project evaluation stage where we’re reducing emissions for an oil and gas projects,&#8221; Lochmiller said. </span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>This weekend had a key story, earnings are on the way, and there is a huge number of funding rounds to talk about. Ready?</p>
<ul>
<li>The Indian government&#8217;s move to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/india-orders-twitter-to-take-down-tweets-critical-of-its-coronavirus-handling/">remove a number of social media posts</a> critical of its handling of COVID-19 was the key news item this weekend. As the country&#8217;s healthcare system buckles, and deaths spike, the move by the current administration to censor the Internet was just about as bad a look you could imagine. At least in terms of a tech response.</li>
<li>Also this weekend conversation continued about Substack&#8217;s recent push to hire away well-known writers from traditionally-respected publications continued, with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-times-responds-to-the-substack-boom-2021-4">Insider reporting</a> that six-figure offers to join the paid newsletter platform are the norm.</li>
<li>This morning we&#8217;re focused on the impending earnings deluge. Major American tech companies, along with some key social media and ecommerce names will report, giving us a look into how tech companies performed in the first quarter of 2021. We already know that the venture market was hot during the period. How business fared, however, is less clear.</li>
<li>On the funding round beat, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/mighty-networks-raises-50m-to-build-a-creator-economy-for-the-masses/">Mighty Networks raised $50 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/indias-lead-school-raises-30-million-to-reach-more-students/">LEAD School raised $30 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/yc-backed-kidato-raises-1-4m-seed-to-scale-its-online-school-for-k-12-students-in-africa/">Kidato raised $1.4 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/robo-advisor-stashaway-gets-25m-series-d-led-by-sequoia-capital-india/">StashAway stashed away $25 million</a>, and <a href="https://containerjournal.com/news/news-releases/kyligence-raises-70-million-series-d-funding-round/">Kyligence put together a $70 million Series D</a> of its own.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Honest Company also set an early IPO price range after we stopped recording. More to come on the IPO front. Chat Wednesday!</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Those of us who read a lot of tech and business publications have heard for years about the cybersecurity skills gap. Studies often claim that millions of jobs are going unfilled because there aren’t enough qualified candidates available for hire.</p>
<p>I don’t buy it.</p>
<p>The basic laws of supply and demand mean there will always be people in the workforce willing to move into well-paid security jobs. The problem is not that these folks don’t exist. It’s that CIOs or CISOs typically look right past them if their resumes don’t have a very specific list of qualifications.</p>
<p>In many cases, hiring managers expect applicants to be fully trained on all the technologies their organization currently uses. That not only makes it harder to find qualified candidates, but it also reduces the diversity of experience within security teams — which, ultimately, may weaken the company’s security capabilities <em>and</em> its talent pool.</p>
<p>At Netskope, we take a different approach to staffing for security roles. We know we can teach the cybersecurity skills needed to do the job, so instead, there are two traits we consider more important than specific technical expertise: One is a hunger to learn more about security, which suggests the individual will take the initiative to continuously improve their skills. The other is possession of a skill set that no one else on our security team has.</p>
<h2>Overemphasis on technical skills creates an artificial talent shortage</h2>
<p>To understand why I believe our approach has helped us build a stronger security team, think about the long-term benefits of hiring someone with a specific security skill set: How valuable will that exact knowledge be in several years? Probably not very.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Even the most basic security technologies are incredibly dynamic. In most companies, the IT infrastructure is currently in the midst of a massive transition from on-premises to cloud-based systems. Security teams are having to learn new technologies. More than that, they are having to adopt an entirely new mindset, shifting from a focus on protecting specific pieces of hardware to a focus on protecting individuals and applications as their workloads increasingly move outside the corporate network.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple this morning announced a sweeping plan to invest north of $430 billion over the next five years. The company says the deal involves “economic benefits” in all 50 states and would create, all told, 20,000 additional jobs in the United States over that time period.</p>
<p>The plan is an extension of one it announced in 2018, raising the original $350 billion goal by 20%. At the center of the announcement is the long anticipated creation of an additional campus in North Carolina. That involves a $1 billion investment in the Research Triangle, including 3,000 jobs that will focus on emerging fields like machine learning and AI.</p>
<p>“Innovation has long been North Carolina’s calling card and Apple’s decision to build this new campus in the Research Triangle showcases the importance of our state’s favorable business climate, world-class universities, our tech-ready workforce, and the welcoming and diverse communities that make so many people want to call North Carolina home,&#8221; state leaders said in <a href="https://governor.nc.gov/news/advisory-governor-legislative-leaders-hold-availability-after-announcement-new-apple-campus">a joint statement</a>. &#8220;This announcement will benefit communities across our state and we are proud to work together to continue to grow our economy and bring transformational industries and good paying jobs to North Carolina.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has also outlined a $100 million fund for community and schools in the surrounding Raleigh-Durham area, as well as a $110 million spend on infrastructure.</p>
<p>“At this moment of recovery and rebuilding, Apple is doubling down on our commitment to US innovation and manufacturing with a generational investment reaching communities across all 50 states,” Tim Cook said in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years/">a release tied to the news</a>. “We’re creating jobs in cutting-edge fields — from 5G to silicon engineering to artificial intelligence — investing in the next generation of innovative new businesses, and in all our work, building toward a greener and more equitable future.”</p>
<p>Other US operation initiatives have been outlined for the company’s native California, as well as Colorado, Texas, Washington and Iowa. California gets the biggest initial boost here, with 5,000 more employees being added to its San Diego office and 3,000 more for Culver City. Indiana, Kentucky and Texas has already begun adding positions as part of the $5 billion Advanced Manufacturing Fund the company launched in 2017.</p>
<p>The news comes a week after Wisconsin announced plans to dramatically scale back the creation of a Foxconn plant set to manufacture flatscreen TVs. During his presidency, Donald Trump had called the planned factory, “the eighth wonder of the world,” and central to his plans to return manufacturing to the U.S. while courting various high profile tech executives, including Cook.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mseq.vc/">Main Sequence</a>, the venture firm founded by Australia’s national science agency, announced today a new $250 million AUD (about $194.3 million USD) fund to invest in deep-tech startups. This is Main Sequence’s second fund and its oversubscribed raised included returning investors Horizons Ventures, Hostplus, Lockheed Martin, Temasek, private investors from Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and Mutual Trust, and family offices.</p>
<p>Launched in 2017 by government agency CSIRO (the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation), Main Sequence now manages a total of $490 million AUD, including the CSIRO Innovation Fund. The firm works closely with scientists and researchers to commercialize their technology through its “venture science” model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It starts by identifying challenges, then brings together scientists, a team, industry partners and investors to launch startups. Main Sequence’s second fund will look at issues including healthcare accessibility, increasing the world’s food supply, industrial productivity and space. One major focus will be decarbonization and addressing climate change, and that investment area will be led by Main Sequence partner Martin Duursma.</p>
<p>“Especially in the deep tech space, you don’t always have a company for every problem you’re trying to solve. So in addition to backing great founders who are working in one of our thesis areas, we will create companies to solve the problems and we do that as a partnership instead of on our own,” Main Sequence partner Mike Zimmerman told TechCrunch. Its works with universities, CSIRO’s networks of 3,500 scientists across different sectors and other research agencies to find potential founders.</p>

<p>“We&#8217;ll work with a research organization, get an entrepreneur-in-residence in and work with them. Something that is quite different is we’ll also work with industry partners,” Zimmerman added. “We’ll partner with an industry leader and get them fully committed and on the cap table from day one. The idea is that you can go faster when you have all these parties together and everyone is on the cap table.”</p>
<p>For example, Main Sequence helped launched v2food, a plant-based meat company, in January 2019. By October 2019, v2food had started shipping its products to Burger King in Australia, after spending about $2 million AUD. V2food’s other investors include Horizons Ventures, Temasek, Sequoia Capital China and China Renaissance.</p>

<p>“Companies are moving very quickly out of Australia and into China and other parts of Asia, all from the venture science model,” said Zimmerman. “Now that we have locked that down as a methodology, we’ve done several venture science deals already and will be a doing a lot more of that.”</p>
<p>Other Main Sequence portfolio companies include telehealth software platform Coviu, subterrenean drone technology developer Emesent, IoT satellite connectivity startup Myriota and quantum computing firmware designer Q-CTRL.</p>
<p>Main Sequence’s close relationship with CSIRO also gives its startups access to the agency’s ecosystem of research and facilities, including ones that can be used to produce new food tech, synthetic biology or laser tuning. Some of the things the new fund will focus on include ingredients and flavorings for plant-based meat, reversing climate change, agricultural tech for more sustainable farming practices, and synthetic biology like enzymes that can be used for the “circular economy,” or breaking down waste products into new materials.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced last week an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-is-expanding-spotify-partnership-with-new-boombox-project/">expanded partnership</a> with streaming music service Spotify that would bring a new way to listen to music or podcasts directly within Facebook&#8217;s app, which it called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-is-expanding-spotify-partnership-with-new-boombox-project/">Project Boombox</a>. Today, the companies <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-26/share-explore-and-discover-music-and-podcasts-via-spotify-in-the-facebook-app/">are rolling out this integration</a> via a new &#8220;miniplayer&#8221; experience that will allow Facebook users to stream from Spotify through the Facebook app on iOS or Android. The feature will be available to both free Spotify users and Premium subscribers.</p>
<p>The miniplayer itself is an extension of the social sharing option already supported within Spotify&#8217;s app. Now, when Spotify users are listening to content they want to share to Facebook, they&#8217;ll be able to tap the existing &#8220;Share&#8221; menu (the three dot-menu at the upper right of the screen) and then tap either &#8220;Facebook&#8221; or &#8220;Facebook News Feed.&#8221;</p>
<p>When a user posts an individual track or podcast episode to Facebook through this sharing feature, the post will now display in a new miniplayer that allows other people who come across their post to also play the content as they continue to scroll, or reshare it. (Cue MySpace vibes!)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div style="width: 1920px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-2143498-1" width="1920" height="1080" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Boombox-Project-Landscape.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Boombox-Project-Landscape.mp4">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Boombox-Project-Landscape.mp4</a></video></div></p>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s paid subscribers will be able to access full playback, the company says. Free users, meanwhile, will be able to hear the full shared track, not a clip . But afterwards, they&#8217;ll continue to listen to ad-supported content on Shuffle mode, just as they would in Spotify&#8217;s own app.</p>
<p>One important thing to note here about all this works is that the integration allows the music or podcast content to actually play from within the Spotify app. When a user presses play on the miniplayer, an app switch takes place so the user can log into Spotify. The miniplayer activates and controls the launch and playback in the Spotify app &#8212; which is how the playback is able continue even as the user scrolls on Facebook or if they minimize the Facebook app altogether.</p>
<p>This setup means users will need to have the Spotify mobile app installed on their phone and a Spotify account for the miniplayer to work. For first-time Spotify users, they&#8217;ll have to sign up for a free account in order to listen to the music shared via the miniplayer.</p>
<p>Spotify notes that it&#8217;s not possible to sign up for a paid account through the mini-player experience itself, so there&#8217;s no revenue share with Facebook on new subscriptions. (Users have to download the Spotify app and sign up for Paid accounts from there if they want to upgrade.)</p>
<p>The partnership allows Spotify to leverage Facebook&#8217;s reach to gain distribution and to drive both sign-ups and repeat usage of its app just as the Covid bump to subscriber growth<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/25/spotify-expected-to-report-subscriber-slowdown-covid"> may be wearing off</a>. However, it&#8217;s still responsible for the royalties paid on streams, just as it was before, the company told TechCrunch, because its app is the one actually doing the streaming. It&#8217;s also fully in charge of the music catalog and audio ads that play alongside the content.</p>
<p>For Facebook, this deal means it now has a valuable tool to keep users spending time on its site &#8212; <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nielsen-the-amoung-of-time-people-spend-on-facebook-is-declining-2018-9">a metric that has been declining</a> <a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/nielsen-facebook-declining-in-u-s-and-on-desktop/">over</a> the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40541656/chances-are-youre-spending-24-less-time-on-facebook">years</a>, reports have indicated.</p>
<p>Spotify and Facebook have a long history of working together on music efforts. Facebook back in 2011 had been planning an update that would allow music subscription users to engage with music directly on Facebook, much like this. But those plans were <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110920/facebooks-big-f8-plans-get-dialed-back-just-a-bit/">later dialed back</a>, possibly over music rights&#8217; or technical issues. Spotify had also been one of <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/why-netflix-spotify-and-others-are-friending-facebook/">the first media partners on Facebook&#8217;s ticker,</a> which would show you in real-time what friends were up to on Facebook and other services. And Spotify had once offered <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-stop-or-limit-spotify-sharing-on-facebook/">Facebook Login</a> as the default for its mobile app. Today, as it has for years, Spotify users on the desktop can see what their Facebook friends are streaming on its app, thanks to social networking integrations.</p>
<p>The timing for this renewed and extended partnership is interesting. Now, both Facebook and Spotify have a mutual enemy with Apple, whose <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22254815/facebook-apple-privacy-ios-14-lawsuit">privacy-focused changes</a> are impacting Facebook&#8217;s ad business and whose investments in Apple Music and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">Podcasts</a> are a threat to Spotify. As Facebook&#8217;s own music efforts in more recent years have shifted towards partnership efforts &#8212; like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/facebook-will-launch-officially-licensed-music-videos-in-the-us-starting-this-weekend/">music video integrations</a> enabled by music label <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/21/facebook-and-universal-music-groups-new-partnership-will-allow-for-user-gen-videos-with-licensed-music-new-social-features/">agreements</a> &#8212; it makes sense that it would turn to a partner like Spotify to power a new streaming feature that supports Facebook&#8217;s broader efforts around monetizable tools and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">services</a> aimed at the creator economy.</p>
<p>The miniplayer feature had been tested in non-U.S. markets, Mexico and Thailand, ahead of its broader global launch today.</p>
<p>In addition to the U.S., the integration is fully rolling out to users in Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, South Africa, Thailand, and Uruguay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More M&amp;A activity is underway in the red-hot field of cybersecurity. In the latest development, private equity giant Thoma Bravo is buying <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proofpoint</a>, the SaaS security vendor, for <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/26/2216810/0/en/Proofpoint-Enters-Definitive-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-Thoma-Bravo-in-12-3-Billion-Transaction.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$12.3 billion in cash</a>.</p>
<p>Proofpoint is traded publicly on the Nasdaq exchange and as of its closing price on Friday, it had a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFPT?p=PFPT&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap of $7.5 billion</a>. This bid, which will see the company go private, is a big hike on its latest share price. The deal has been endorsed by Proofpoint&#8217;s board. If approved by shareholders, it will close in Q3 of this year.</p>
<p>The news comes at the same time that Proofpoint had <a href="https://investors.proofpoint.com/investors/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Proofpoint-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released its Q1 earnings</a>, in which it reported revenues of $287.8 million, up 15% versus $249.8 million for the quarter a year ago — and also beating analysts&#8217; expectations, which on average were expecting revenues of $281.6 million, according to Yahoo Finance data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It also however reported a GAAP net loss of $45.3 million, working out to a loss per share of $0.79. That&#8217;s narrowed from a net loss of $66.8 million a year ago, but is still a net loss. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $31.5 million, or $0.49 per share, the company said.</p>
<p>The acquisition news is coming in the wake of Proofpoint making a number of acquisitions of its own over the years. Its deals have included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/07/proofpoint-acquires-cloudmark-for-100m-in-cybersecurity-consolidation-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudmark</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/european-investor-nordiceye-wins-big-with-proofpoints-60-million-offer-for-weblife/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weblife</a>, <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/newsroom/press-releases/proofpoint-enters-definitive-agreement-acquire-observeit-225-million-cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OberserveIT</a>, and <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/05/06/1817856/0/en/Proofpoint-Enters-into-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Meta-Networks-Boosting-Cloud-Security-Capabilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Networks</a>, all deals valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But at the same time, it is also facing up against not only a growing pool of cybersecurity competitors, but also cyber threats — exacerbated in no small part by the huge shift the world has seen to cloud services, remote working and more transactions carried out online.</p>
<p>Proofpoint CEO Gary Steele said in a statement the acquisition to go private will allow the company to be &#8220;more agile with greater flexibility to continue investing in innovation, building on our leadership position and staying ahead of threat actors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is probably best known for email-based security tools, which remains a very significant business, especially when you consider how so many breaches start with what appear to be innocent emails but are in reality malicious intent vectors, hiding bad actors, dodgy links and more for malicious hackers to worm their way into bigger networks via unassuming individuals.</p>
<p>But as those who watch the security space know, the threat goes well beyond those kinds of breaches, and so Proofpoint has also increasingly moved into other applications and services managed in the cloud.</p>
<p>Its competitors include the likes of Symantec, Mimecast, Trend Micro and Barracuda. Analysts project that security-as-a-service (the <em>other</em> kind of SaaS) will be worth some $26 billion by 2025, growing at a rate of 19% on average in the years between now and then.</p>
<p>Thoma Bravo has tapped into that trend, as a significant acquirer of security businesses over the years. It will be worth watching how and if it leverages that in relation to this latest deal to acquire Proofpoint.</p>
<p>Its acquisitions have included the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/thoma-bravo-completes-3-9b-sophos-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophos for $3.9 billion</a>, a <a href="https://www.thomabravo.com/press-releases/thoma-bravo-to-acquire-majority-interest-in-logrhythm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority stake in LogRhythm</a>, and <a href="https://www.imprivata.com/company/press/imprivata-agrees-be-acquired-thoma-bravo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paying $544 million for Imprivata</a> — an asset it planned to exit last year reportedly for $2 billion <a href="https://www.pehub.com/thoma-bravo-shuts-down-imprivata-process-as-covid-19-fears-fuel-market-volatility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until it called off the sale</a> (it had been proceeding just as the Covid-19 pandemic was taking off).</p>
<p>Alongside Silver Lake, Thoma Bravo took SolarWinds private in a<a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/company/press-releases/solarwinds-to-be-acquired-by-silver-lake-and-thoma-bravo-in-a-transaction-valued-at-6010-per-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $4.5 billion deal</a> before listing it again. It also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/15/solarwinds-russia-breach-stock-trades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attracted some controversy</a> for selling shares just ahead of SolarWinds disclosing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/fbi-nsa-says-hacks-on-us-federal-agencies-likely-russian-in-origin/">a supply chain attack</a>, affecting nine federal agencies and hundreds of companies, later attributed to Russia&#8217;s SVR foreign intelligence service. Thoma Bravo said it was unaware of the information at the time.</p>
<p>“Proofpoint has achieved tremendous outcomes for customers around the world, and we’re excited to partner with this talented team at a moment when organizations need innovative solutions to navigate an increasingly treacherous cybersecurity environment,” said Seth Boro, a managing partner at Thoma Bravo, in a statement. “Proofpoint’s opportunity as a privately held company is incredibly compelling, and we look forward to working closely with them to drive continued business growth and deliver world-class advanced threat protection to even more customers in even more ways.”</p>
<p>“Proofpoint has established itself as a true powerhouse in the cybersecurity sector due to its innovative suite of market-leading products and impressive customer base of leading companies around the world,” added Chip Virnig, a partner at Thoma Bravo. “As the sophistication of cyberattacks continues to increase, Proofpoint is delivering the most effective solutions to help organizations protect their data and people across digital platforms. We look forward to partnering with the talented Proofpoint team and leveraging Thoma Bravo’s significant security and operational expertise to help accelerate the Company’s growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.signaladvisors.com">Signal Advisors</a> is building a specialized financial platform for financial advisors, and the company is announcing it raised a $10 million Series A led by  Brian Ru and Hemant Taneja at General Catalyst. This funding is on top of the $6 million seed round it raised in 2020 from Detroit Venture Partners, Ludlow Ventures, General Catalyst, and others.</p>
<p>In a released statement, new board member and managing partner at Michigan-based Annox Capital Robert Mylod, puts it well: &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a lot of capital investment in technologies that promise to replace financial advisors. But the bigger opportunity, by far, is to build technology that empowers advisors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Signal was founded following CEO Patrick Kelly&#8217;s career as a financial advisor. In this capacity, he discovered the need for an end-to-end platform for financial advisors, specifically those independent and offering annuities and life insurance. Signal&#8217;s solution allows these advisors to bypass traditional distributors and simplify the sale of annuities. The company says its product can track commissions in real-time and advance payout ahead of carrier payments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We started with annuities because advisors simply don&#8217;t have great options for this technology today,&#8221; said Pat Kelly, Co-Founder and CEO of Signal Advisors, in a press release. &#8220;But that&#8217;s just the beginning. We want to provide independent financial advisors with an integrated platform. Whatever their needs, whatever their clients need, the technology and service can provide a seamless experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s led by Patricia Bubner, Gabrial Levesque Tremblay, and Samet Yidrim, who between them have over thirty years working in bioprocessing and the biopharmaceuticals industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A little over a month ago, Orbillion held its first public tasting event where meats mixed with its elk, beef, and sheep were on offer straight from the petri dish to the table.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were immediately struck by Orbillion’s focus on high-end, flavorful, hard-to-find meats like lamb, elk, wagyu beef, and bison, their strong science, business, and engineering backgrounds, and the fact that they are so focused on flavor that they literally have a Master Butcher on their advisory board,” said Ali Rohde, GP at Outset Capital, an early-stage venture fund run by Rohde along with repeat entrepreneurs Kanjun Qiu and Josh Albrecht. “Lab-grown meat is the future, and Orbillion Bio is already paving the way.” </span></p>
<p>The company said it would use the cash to bring its first product, a Wagyu beef offering, to pilot production.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.mightynetworks.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mighty Networks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a platform designed to give creators and brands a dedicated place to start and grow communities, has closed on $50 million in a Series B funding round led by Owl Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziff Capital Partners and LionTree Partners also participated in the financing, along with existing backers Intel Capital, Marie Forleo, Gretchen Rubin, Dan Rosensweig, Reid Hoffman, BBG Ventures and Lucas Venture Group. The investment brings Palo Alto-based Mighty Networks’ total raised since its 2017 inception to $67 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mighty Networks founder and CEO Gina Bianchini &#8212; who started the company with Tim Herby and Thomas Aaron &#8212; is no stranger to building nurturing environments for community building. Previously, she was the CEO and co-founder of Ning, where she led the company’s rapid growth to three million Ning Networks created and about 100 million users around the world in three years. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Mighty Networks, Bianchini’s goal is to build “a creator middle class” founded on community memberships, events and live online courses.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basically we have a platform for people to create communities the way that they would create e-commerce stores,” she told TechCrunch. “So what Shopify has done for e-commerce, we&#8217;re doing for digital subscriptions and digital payments where the value is around a community that is mastering something interesting or important together, and not just content alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s flagship Business Plan product is aimed at new creators with the goal of giving them an easy way to get started with digital subscriptions, Bianchini said. Established brands, organizations and successful creators use the company’s Mighty Pro plan to get everything Mighty Networks offers on their own branded iOS, iPad and Android apps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mighty Networks &#8212; which operates as a SaaS business &#8212; has seen impressive growth. In 2020, ARR climbed by “2.5x” while annual customer growth climbed by 200%. Customers are defined as paying creators who host their community, courses and events on their own Mighty Network. The company also saw a 400% annual growth in payments, or rather in subscriptions and payments where a creator or brand will sell a membership or an online course.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2143727" style="width: 585px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2143727" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2143727" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mc-home_live_device.png?w=300" alt="" width="575" height="387" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mc-home_live_device.png 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mc-home_live_device.png?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mc-home_live_device.png?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mc-home_live_device.png?resize=768,517 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mc-home_live_device.png?resize=680,458 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mc-home_live_device.png?resize=1536,1034 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mc-home_live_device.png?resize=2048,1379 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mc-home_live_device.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2143727" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mighty Networks</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic was actually a boon to the business, as well as the fact that it launched live events last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were able to help many businesses quickly move online &#8212; from yoga studios to leadership speakers and consultants &#8212; and now that the world is coming back, they’ll be able to use the features that we’ve built into the platform from day one around finding members, events and groups near them, as well as making everything via not just the web but mobile apps,” Bianchini said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the startup’s goals is to help people understand that they don’t need massive amounts of followers (such as 1 million followers on TikTok) to be successful creators. For example, a creator charging 30 people for a subscription that amounts to around $1,000 a year can still pull in $30,000 a year. So while it’s not huge, it’s certainly still substantial &#8212; hence the company’s intent to build a “creator middle class.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mighty Networks has more than 10,000 paying creators, brands and coaches today. Users include established creators and brands such as YouTube star Adriene Mishler, Xprize and Singularity University founder Peter Diamandis, author Luvvie Ajayi Jones, comedian Amanda Seales, Girlboss founder Sophia Amoruso and brands such as the TED conference and wellness scheduling platform MINDBODY.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Content alone will kill the creator economy,” Bianchini said. “We can’t build a thriving creator movement on an exhausting, unfair dynamic where content creators rent audiences from big tech platforms, are required to produce a never-ending stream of content and get paid pennies for it, if they get paid at all. Creators need to own their own community on the internet, where members meet each other and get results and transformation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owl Ventures Managing Director Amit Patel said his firm was impressed by Mighty Networks before it even met the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No company in this space has more loyal, passionate believers, and when we saw firsthand that creators could successfully build paid communities and online courses on a Mighty Network with as few as 30 members, we wanted to be a part of unlocking this creator middle class for a million more creators,” Patel said in a written statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital on product development across media types, payment options and expansion into new markets. </span></p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://trypico.com">Pico</a>, a New York startup that helps online creators and media companies make money and manage their customer data, announced that it had launched an upgraded platform and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/pico-2-0/">raised $6.5 million</a> in new funding. Essentially, the company is building what it considers to be an operating system for the creator market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cuckoo Internet, which is aiming to be an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/cuckoo-internet-closes-seed-funding-to-disrupt-uk-broadband-market/">insurgent</a> startup in the broadband provider space in the UK, has closed a $6 million investment round led by RTP Global, along with participation from JamJar Investments. It will also launch on price-comparison site uSwitch.</p>
<p>RTP Global was an early backer of Yandex, Delivery Hero, and Datadog. JamJar has backed Bulb, Deliveroo, Tails and Oatly. Other individual investors in the round included former executives of Monzo and Stripe,</p>
<p>Cuckoo’s pitch is that it has a simple broadband offering, suppling a single 67 Mb/s fibre deal on a monthly rolling contract with “no hidden fees” it says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement Alexander Fitzgerald, Founder and CEO at Cuckoo, said: “The broadband market is broken and consumers are being ripped off every day. The importance of fast, reliable and affordable broadband has come into sharper focus with millions of people working from home over the past year. We’re excited that this funding will enable us to help tens of thousands of people across the country make their broadband simple, for good.”</p>
<p>Gareth Jefferies, Partner at RTP Global, said: “Consumer broadband is one of the largest markets yet one of the most poorly served. Consumers are fatiguing of customer-hostile pricing practices, inflexible contracts and deliberately awful customer service, and just as we have seen in insurance, energy and banking, we will see a number of challenger providers come in to eat incumbents&#8217; lunch with differentiated product packagings and a fresh respect for their customers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://faculty.ai/">Faculty</a>, a VC-backed artificial intelligence start-up, has won a tender to work with the NHS to make better predictions about its future requirements for patients, based on data drawn from how it handled the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In December 2019, Faculty raised a $10.5M Series A funding round from UK-based VCs Local Globe, <a href="https://www.gmgventures.co/">GMG Ventures</a>, and, Jaan Tallinn, one of Skype’s founding engineers, giving it a valuation of around $100 million.</p>
<p>Faculty will work with NHS England and NHS Improvement to build upon the Early Warning System (EWS) it developed for the service, during the pandemic. Based on Bayesian hierarchical modeling, Faculty says the EWS uses aggregate data (for example, COVID-19 positive case numbers, 111 calls, and mobility data) to warn hospitals about potential spikes in cases so they can divert staff, beds, and equipment needed. This learning will now be applied across the whole of the service, for issues other than the pure pandemic response, such as improving service delivery and patient care and predicting A&amp;E demand and winter pressures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Faculty also worked with NHSX as a partner for the NHS AI Lab, which developed the National Covid-19 <a href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/blogs/using-chest-imaging-ai-support-covid-19-research-and-development/">Chest Imaging Database (NCCID)</a>.</p>
<p>Faculty has also <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/11/29/home-office-partner-faculty-raises-fresh-cash-investors-pile/">reportedly</a> worked with the UK Home Office to apply AI to its database of terrorists, as well as the BBC and easyJet.</p>
<p>I asked Richard Sargeant, COO of Faculty, if he thought Faculty was the &#8216;Palantir for the UK&#8217; (Palantir has also worked with the NHS during the pandemic: “We are, I believe, a really effective and scalable AI company, not just for the UK but we&#8217;re working in the US and in Europe, Asia. I think we will continue to scale. We’re growing, and we&#8217;re going to grow because I believe that AI can make things better for the citizens, for customers. Palantir doesn&#8217;t really do AI, they do data engineering in a big way. And we&#8217;ve seen them be effective in the NHS. I think Faculty kind of stands on its own.”</p>
<p>He said that Faculty has a different role to Palantir: &#8220;Palantir has helped with the data pipelines, and they&#8217;re using their software to pull a lot of data together, but really they&#8217;re not a machine learning organization, their specialism is in gathering data together. Data across the NHS is rather an archipelago. It&#8217;s in hundreds of different places, and being able to gather together makes it much easier to do machine learning, both centrally and at a local level. One of the things that sets the early warning system apart is not just the use of machine learning, but the use of explainability to give clinicians and managers, some understanding of why the models are forecasting the results that they are, which is relatively cutting edge stuff, and that&#8217;s the stuff that Faculty specializes in that Palantir doesn’t.”</p>
<p>I asked him why Faculty had attracted VC when, typically, VCs invest in startups that have scalable products: “It’s a good question and it&#8217;s something that we often get asked. I see Faculty as a little bit different from your classic software as a service business, and from a consultancy. AI isn&#8217;t a &#8216;once and done&#8217; product, and neither is it something that people create from scratch every time. But there are core components of what we do, that we can use again and again, but also the models themselves are always bespoke…  it&#8217;s a combination of the bespoke, and the common, or generic together, that makeup Faculty, and that&#8217;s a bit different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faculty is not a stranger to controversy over its government contracts. Last year it was revealed that a a UK cabinet minister <a href="https://www.digitalhealth.net/2020/11/cabinet-minister-owned-90000-shares-in-faculty-at-time-of-nhsx-contract/">owned</a> £90,000 of shares in Faculty, when it was awarded a £2.3m contract from NHSX to help run the NHS Covid-19 Data Store.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s plan to introduce its digital currency is getting a lot of help from its tech conglomerates. JD.com, a major Chinese online retailer that competes with Alibaba, said Monday that it has started paying some staff in digital yuan since January, the virtual version of the country&#8217;s physical currency.</p>
<p>China has been busy experimenting with digital currency over the past few months. In October, Shenzhen, a southern city known for its progressive economic policies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/china-digital-yuan-shenzhen/">doled out 10 million yuan</a> worth of digital currency to 500,000 residents, who could then use the money to shop at certain online and offline retailers.</p>
<p>Several other large Chinese cities have followed Shenzhen&#8217;s suit. The residents in these regions has to apply through selected banks to start receiving and paying by digital yuan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The electronic yuan initiative is a collective effort involving China&#8217;s regulators, commercial banks and technology solution providers. At first glance, the scheme still mimics how physical yuan is circulating at the moment; under the direction of the central bank, the six major commercial banks in China, including ICBC, distribute the digital yuan to smaller banks and a web of tech solution providers, who could help bring more use cases to the new electronic money.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2143566 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-2.48.43-PM.png" alt="" width="264" height="306" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-2.48.43-PM.png 996w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-2.48.43-PM.png?resize=129,150 129w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-2.48.43-PM.png?resize=259,300 259w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-2.48.43-PM.png?resize=768,890 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-2.48.43-PM.png?resize=587,680 587w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-2.48.43-PM.png?resize=43,50 43w" sizes="(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px" /></p>
<p>For example, JD.com partnered up with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) to deposit the digital income. The online retailer has become one of the first organizations in China to pay wages in electronic yuan; in August, some government workers in the eastern city of Suzhou also began getting paid in the digital money.</p>
<p>Across the board, China&#8217;s major tech companies have actively participated in the buildout of the digital yuan ecosystem, which will help the central government better track money flows.</p>
<p>Aside from JD.com, video streaming platform Bilibili, on-demand services provider Meituan and ride-hailing app Didi have also begun accepting digital yuan for user purchases. Gaming and social networking giant Tencent became <a href="http://www.nbd.com.cn/articles/2021-04-25/1714746.html">one of the &#8220;digital yuan operators&#8221;</a> and will take part in the design, R&amp;D and operational work of the electronic money. Jack Ma&#8217;s Ant Group, which is undergoing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">a major overhaul</a> following a stalled IPO, has also joined hands with the central bank to work on <a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2021-04-25/doc-ikmxzfmk8898412.shtml">building out the infrastructure</a> to move money digitally. Huawei, the telecom equipment titan, debuted a wallet on one of its smartphone models that allows users to spend digital yuan instantaneously even if the device is offline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An Indian startup that is helping <a href="https://blog.leadschool.in/notes-from-my-journey-of-creating-a-level-playing-field-for-students-in-small-town-india">digitize and transform affordable private schools</a> to better serve students from middle and low-income groups of families said on Monday it has raised $30 million in a new financing round as it looks to scale its efforts in the world’s second most populous nation.</p>
<p>GSV Ventures and WestBridge led the Series D financing round of the Indian startup, which has raised over $69 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="https://leadschool.in/">LEAD School</a>, founded by couple Sumeet Mehta and Smita Deorah in 2012, has developed an integrated system to help K-12 schools with the curriculum they teach, how they teach them, secure books and other resources from vendors, and better evaluate the learning outcome.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup began its journey by <a href="https://blog.leadschool.in/early-influences-shaping-values">setting up its own schools in rural areas</a> in India to identify the challenges that students and teachers faced. A key insight it found was that students struggled with english and needed years-worth of learning to be able to just fully understand any other subject, most of which were taught in english.</p>
<p>“We were always data centric. We measured our performance based on student data. How well our classes looked was not a criteria for success,” said Deorah in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Schools and educators have always known how to measure learning outcome. It&#8217;s not new and fairly researched. Whether that&#8217;s the core of what you are gunning for, or if it is the scale that you are going after is an organizational choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that bet is paying off. Even an average student in a LEAD School-powered institution today has over 75% mastery on all subjects and attains over 1.5-year of English learning, said Deorah. &#8220;This is not a small cohort data,&#8221; she added. (Even since the pandemic, the figure has only changed to 70%.)</p>
<p>Over the years, LEAD School has started to work with affordable private schools. Deorah said the startup&#8217;s original mission statement &#8212; to work with schools to empower students from low-income families &#8212; remains intact even as it scales and that its strategy to partner with schools has helped it serve more students.</p>
<p>Amid the global pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to shut schools last year, LEAD School’s offering has proven even more useful to schools. The startup, which today caters to over 2,000 schools and 800,000 students, grew by 3X last year, it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;LEAD School is rapidly emerging as a paradigm for transforming K-12 education. Based in India and partnered with affordable school owners (a segment that is larger than the entire US K-12 system), LEAD serves over 800,000 students today,&#8221; said Deborah Quazzo, Managing Partner at GSV Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;LEAD has experienced tremendous growth because of its consistent delivery of high academic outcomes to students and high ‘return on education’ to teachers, school owners and parents. GSV is honored to be investing in an organization that is changing the life trajectory of so many students.”</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to strike more partnerships and reach 25,000 schools in the next five years.</p>
<p>India is home to over 250 million students. In recent years, scores of startups have started to explore ways to provide high-class and more affordable education to fractions of these students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Globally, GSV is known as a specialised edtech fund that backs innovation oriented education companies. We hope to benefit from their deep insights and leverage their network to bring more innovation to our students in India. WestBridge has been a great partner and their continued support shows their faith in the difference we are making to our schools and students,&#8221; said LEAD School&#8217;s Mehta in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A database of about 20 million alleged BigBasket users has leaked on a well-known cybercrime forum, months after the Indian grocery delivery startup confirmed it had faced a data breach.</p>
<p>The database includes users&#8217; email address, phone number, address, scrambled password, date of birth, and scores of interactions they had with the service. TechCrunch confirmed details of some customers listed in the database &#8212; including those of the author.</p>
<p>A BigBasket spokesperson shared the following statement, &#8220;This article / social media post refers to an alleged data breach in Nov-2020 and not something that has happened recently. The reason we know it&#8217;s not recent is that the article /social media post mentions the release of hashed passwords. We had eliminated all hashed passwords from our system and moved to a secure OTP-based authentication mechanism quite some time back. Also, our site does not collect or store any sensitive personal data of customers like credit card details. So customer data continues to be safe and no further action needs to be taken by customers.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch has asked BigBasket if the startup has any words for the personal details &#8212; email address, physical address, phone number etc &#8212; of the users that has leaked.</p>

<p>The startup <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/alibaba-backed-bigbasket-suffers-major-data-loss-in-cyberattack">confirmed in November</a> last year that it had suffered a data breach after reports emerged that hackers had siphoned off <a href="https://cybleinc.com/2020/11/07/bigbasket-indias-leading-online-supermarket-shopping-allegedly-breached-personal-details-of-over-20-million-people-sold-in-darkweb/">information of 20 million customers</a> from the platform.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has asked one BigBasket co-founder whether the startup ever disclosed the data breach to customers.</p>
<p>A hacker who goes by the name ShinyHunters published the alleged BigBasket database &#8212; and made it available for anyone to download &#8212; on a popular cybercrime forum over the weekend.</p>
<p>In newer posts on the forum, at least two threat actors claimed that they had decoded the hashed passwords and had put them up for sale. ShinyHunters didn’t immediately respond to a text requesting comment.</p>
<p>The incident comes weeks after Indian conglomerate Tata Group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tata-group-reaches-agreement-to-buy-majority-stake-in-bigbasket/">agreed to acquire BigBasket</a>, valuing the Indian startup at over $1.8 billion.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have three kids. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I moved them from private schools to homeschooling because that was the next option to give them the same quality of education but at an affordable price,&#8221; Gichuru told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That was when I started noticing the other challenges private schools had.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First is the overcrowded nature of these schools. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, public schools have a teacher-to-student ratio of 1:50 while private schools are at 1:20.  &#8220;Depending on how much you pay for school fees. The more prestigious the school, the smaller the teacher-to-student ratio. That for me was a big indicator that you want to have a small number of students per teacher,&#8221; added Gichuru.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there&#8217;s the issue of long and tiring commutes for students. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gichuru tells me that kids going to private schools in Nairobi would have to wake up by 5 a.m., prepare to get on the bus at 6 a.m.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get to school at 7 a.m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any homeschooling model, Gichuru had teachers come to his house to teach his kids what they&#8217;d </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordinarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> learn in school</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when the pandemic hit, he had to find another alternative by building a platform around Zoom for these teachers to continue delivering lessons for his kids</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By September, the platform had opened up to accommodate 10 more children outside his home. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, the number of students in its learning-from-home program increased to 30 students</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is easy to see why the product is catching on with parents. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the pandemic, video services like Zoom have become the norm for the middle class in Africa with high internet accessibility</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, cutting commute time helps to spend more time with family while reducing costs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2143527" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2143527" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2143527" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-143.png?w=680" alt="Kidato" width="680" height="288" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-143.png 1346w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-143.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-143.png?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-143.png?resize=768,325 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-143.png?resize=680,288 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-143.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2143527" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kidato</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building an online school for kids while capitalizing on the advantages of parents&#8217; new remote work culture also got the Kenyan startup accepted into Y Combinator in January</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since then, Kidato has onboarded more than 50 students and claims to be growing at a 100% quarter on quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gichuru says Kidata wants to ensure better learning outcomes in smaller personalized class sizes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also offering the same international curriculum but with an average of 1:5 teacher-student ratio</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has also implemented after-school programs like robotics and chess, art, coding, and debate classes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they are usually found among students from affluent schools; however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they are being democratized by Kidato to the more than 700 registered students using its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Canada, Kenya, Malawi, Switzerland, Tanzania, UK, United States, and UAE pay $5 per lesson, the company revealed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidato wants to make learning fun and gratifying. According to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gichuru, the business trains its 300-plus teachers on how to make classes interactive by using the context of arcade games like Minecraft and Roblox to tailor lessons taught to students in different subjects</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Drawing from our understanding about how these platforms work and how kids learn from them, we have built-in behavior reward mechanisms such as lesson merits into our teaching methods resulting in interesting and enjoyable virtual classes,&#8221; an excerpt from the statement read</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what happens when Kidato meets a demand and supply problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While its product seems appealing for students, will Kidato find enough qualified teachers to meet the growing demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? The CEO holds that his company has it figured out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most private schools shut down during the lockdowns. Though some are beginning to re-open </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gradually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they are embarking on a recovery process with increased school fees and reduced teachers&#8217; salaries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has presented a big opportunity for Kidato as it currently has a waitlist of 3,000 teachers who are being swayed by Kidato&#8217;s promise of better pay</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the long run, this number creates a pipeline for 15,000 students.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Kidato doesn&#8217;t incur infrastructural costs like real estate, a feature common with traditional schools</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the revenue made from students doesn&#8217;t go into any extreme costs, which means more money for teachers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our teachers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are paid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at least one and a half times more than the average teacher in a private school, and that has driven a great supply of teachers to us</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidato&#8217;s revenue split with teachers is 70/30; teachers take the larger percentage. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gichuru adds that if teachers combine their efforts in both normal and afterschool classes, they can earn an average of $2,000 per month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2143523" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2143523" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2143523" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210424_145634.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="568" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210424_145634.jpg 852w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210424_145634.jpg?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210424_145634.jpg?resize=300,251 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210424_145634.jpg?resize=768,642 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210424_145634.jpg?resize=680,568 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210424_145634.jpg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2143523" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sam Gichuru</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One would&#8217;ve thought that a challenge Kidato would be facing despite its progress would be internet and power but that&#8217;s not the case</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is the skepticism of whether Kidato can offer socialization for the students. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To solve that, Kidato is adopting an offline approach by leveraging the connections of corporates and align its after-school classes to include monthly educational field trips</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to show them how well kids socialize on our platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are partnering with companies that can make it possible to take these kids to plantations, factories, planetariums,&#8221; the CEO added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidato is Gichuru&#8217;s second stint at Y Combinator. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entrepreneur who founded one of Kenya&#8217;s well-known incubator Nailab, also co-founded recruitment platform, Kuhustle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company which seems to be in pilot mode at the moment, took part in Y Combinator Fellowship program in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidato has some high expectations given the CEO&#8217;s experience and as the only edtech startup in this current batch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company, also backed by an Ivy league university endowment fund </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will use t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he seed financing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for growth and product development as it hopes to replace brick-and-mortar schools</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Gichuru&#8217;s words regarding the company&#8217;s future, he said, &#8220;in the next couple of years, we want to have the biggest online school for K-12 students.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investment app <a href="https://www.stashaway.sg/">StashAway</a> has raised a $25 million Series D led by Sequoia Capital India, with participation from returning investors Eight Roads Ventures and Square Peg. After regulatory approvals for the funding are completed, Sequoia Capital India managing director Abheek Anand will join StashAway’s board of directors as part of the round.</p>
<p>StashAway does not disclose how many investors use its robo-advisor app, but it surpassed $1 billion assets under management in January. It currently has operations in in five markets: Singapore, Malayasia, the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong, and is preparing to launch in Thailand.</p>
<p>Its Series D brings StashAway’s total paid-up capital to about $61.4 million. The new funding will be used on expanding StashAway’s product and engineering teams to continue feature and product development. Founded in September 2016, the company will also offer to buy back up to $3 million in stock options from its employees. Co-founder and chief executive officer Michele Ferrario told TechCrunch that many of StashAway’s employees have been with the company since the start, so this gives its team members a chance to cash out stock options that have vested while creating a more compelling compensation package for recruiting talent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>StashAway’s products include services for retail investors that focus on wealth-building or specific goals like retirement or buying a house and StashAway Simple, a cash account that can earn a projected rate of 1.2% per annum and allows funds be withdrawn within one to three business days. Its management fees are between 0.2% to 0.8% a year.</p>
<p>Ferrario said that StashAway’s core market is people aged 30 to 45, who are earning enough money to save or invest, but also have obligations like saving for retirement or their childrens’ education. People under 30 account for a smaller portion of StashAway’s assets under management, but are still a significant part of its user base because the app doesn’t require minimum investments, making it accessible to people who recently graduated or are just starting their careers. While StashAway has built an reputation for attracting first-time investors, about 20% of its assets under management come from high-net-worth individuals.</p>
<p>“This is something we didn’t think would happen at the beginning, but then we realized that some of the problems we’re solving are also significant problems for high-net-worth individuals as well,” said Ferrario. “If you have less than $10 million to $15 million in wealth, the services you receive from private banks are not particularly sophisticated or personalized. So we offer a more sophisticated investment at a lower cost.”</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the company launched StashAway WorkPlace, a platform for employers to provide benefits like pensions and vesting schedules. StashAway WorkPlace grew out of the Financial Wellness Program, a set of seminars and workshops on financial planning and investing that has been used in Singapore by about 200 companies, including Salesforce, Twitter, Netflix and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Since StashAway launched its app in 2017, more robo-advisors have emerged in the same markets it serves. For example, Syfe also caters to new investors. Other investment apps in Singapore include Endowus, Kristal.AI and AutoWealth.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DVn4PMouCl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/singapore-based-syfe-a-robo-advisor-with-a-human-touch-raises-18-6-million-led-by-valar-ventures/">Singapore-based Syfe, a robo-advisor with a human touch, raises $18.6 million led by Valar Ventures</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Singapore-based Syfe, a robo-advisor with a human touch, raises $18.6 million led by Valar Ventures&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/singapore-based-syfe-a-robo-advisor-with-a-human-touch-raises-18-6-million-led-by-valar-ventures/embed/#?secret=DVn4PMouCl" data-secret="DVn4PMouCl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the main ways StashAway differentiates is its proprietary asset allocation framework, which looks at how each asset class performs under specific economic conditions, measures uncertainty with leading indicators and patterns in economic data, and adjustments to expected returns based on an asset’s valuation relative to its economic fair value. The company says it has outperformed benchmarks since launching in 2017. At the end of March, its portfolios outperformed their same-risk benchmarks (proxied by MSCI World Equity Index and FTSE World Government Bond Index), with annualized returns ranging from 16.5% (for the highest-risk portfolio) to 4% (the lowest-risk portfolio).</p>
<p>Ferrario said the app also emphasizes customer service, with phone calls typically answered in less than eight seconds, and an in-app WhatsApp link that connects users to a human service representative instead of sending them through a chatbot first.</p>
<p>But StashAway’s main competitor is still traditional banks instead of other investment apps. “In the five countries we are in, there is approximately $5 trillion of personal financial wealth. In Singapore alone, it is around $1.1 trillion,” Ferrario said. A large portion of that cash, or about $400 billion, sits in savings accounts. “That’s money that’s not working for whoever owns it,” he added.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Anand said, “StashAway is growing rapidly as it fulfills an obvious gap in the digital wealth management space, especially in areas where its competitors may be lacking: an easy-to-use platform, robust client relationships and a very sophisticated investing framework. StashAway has built trust with its client base by navigating them through market volatility while providing strong returns.”</p>
