										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s no secret that NFTs have been a hot space for crypto speculators in the Ethereum ecosystem to diversify their holdings, and while some see a golden opportunity to shill bad art to suckers, other believe that NFT-based gaming is destined for the mainstream and that products that nail the mechanics early-on will earn the spoils.</p>
<p>Parallel, a sci-fi card game based on the Ethereum blockchain, has had a more meteoric rise than most crypto projects and investors have noticed. The platform tells TechCrunch they&#8217;ve raised $50 million at a half-billion dollar valuation from crypto VC firm Paradigm. Previous investors include YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley, Focus Labs, OSS Capital and Yunt Capital, among others.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best crypto games will be the ones that can go beyond first-party content and inspire a community of players and developers to build on the game itself. We were impressed by <span class="il">Parallel</span>&#8216;s unique approach and fervent early community, and excited to support them for their next stage of growth,&#8221; Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang said in an email.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221023" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The project is based around a fantasy storyline about humanity&#8217;s escape from space following an apocalyptic attempt to resolve a global energy crisis. Unlike some of the other highly valuable pixelated NFT projects like CryptoPunks, Paralell&#8217;s art style is focused on realism &#8212; through a science fiction lens, of course.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221518" style="width: 253px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221518" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2221518" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png" alt="" width="243" height="365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221518" class="wp-caption-text">An NFT from Parallel&#8217;s upcoming drop</p></div></p>
<p>The sci-fi NFT card game caught fire in August after its first pack drop amid a massive surge in NFT speculation. According to crypto tracker Cryptoslam, the platform did nearly $105 million in transaction volume. One of the titles &#8220;Masterpiece&#8221; cards sold for $1.1 million worth of the Ethereum cryptocurrency. Even as sales fell to just over $11 million in September, a huge month like that can go do big things for the long-term value of an NFT project as rarer purchases made during that time that are held onto long-term can establish steadier baseline price floors for new assets minted on-chain.</p>
<p>Nothing stress tests a system like thousands of tech-savvy speculators trying to break down said system in order to get filthy rich. As a result, NFT &#8220;drops&#8221; have been plagued by every kind of nightmarish scenario. So far things have gone pretty well for Parallel which has built up its own drop system, but with its next drop just days away and the potential value of those cards moving higher, plenty of eyes are centered on how smoothly things go.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The game element of the project doesn&#8217;t actually exist yet, the early funding has been used to build it out. Parallel takes a substantial 10% royalty on NFT sales with half of that going towards in-game prize pools and the rest going to the company. That money can mean bigger revenues for the core platform down the line, but when the entry-point to a game swells to a few thousand dollars, the nature of the &#8220;game&#8221; becomes something different entirely. Balancing a market that tempts investors with rarity but is also friendly to new users has been a big challenge for NFT gaming projects to tackle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku shared <a href="https://www.roku.com/blog/update-on-youtube-tv">a progress update</a> today on its ongoing contract dispute with Google related to its attempt to renew the carriage agreement for YouTube TV, Google&#8217;s live TV streaming service. In April, Roku <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/roku-removes-youtube-tv-from-its-channel-store-following-failed-negotiations/">removed</a> the YouTube TV app from its channel store so it was no longer available to new Roku subscribers, but took steps to ensure that existing subscribers could continue to use the service. Today, Roku says it has still not been able to come to a deal with Google, and warns customers that Google could choose to remove YouTube TV from the Roku platform.</p>
<p>YouTube, however, says the breakdown of the negotiations doesn&#8217;t mean YouTube TV&#8217;s existing customers on Roku will be impacted.</p>
<p>Though its partnership agreement will terminate in December, YouTube tells TechCrunch that exiting users on existing Roku devices will still be able to use both YouTube TV and the YouTube app. However, new Roku devices won&#8217;t be able to carry either of the apps, it said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221816" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Roku earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/roku-removes-youtube-tv-from-its-channel-store-following-failed-negotiations/">made the details of its contract dispute public</a>, saying that Google had been asking for special treatment with regard to how its services are integrated into Roku&#8217;s operating system. While the agreement under discussion is related to YouTube TV, Google was also asking for preferential ranking of YouTube content in Roku&#8217;s search results and permissions to override default settings when the YouTube app is open, it said. For instance, if a Roku customer had YouTube open and used voice search to ask for music, Google wanted YouTube Music to play the request, even if the customer had set Pandora as their preferred music app.</p>
<p>Roku also alleged earlier this year that Google was asking for more data on Roku customers than it provides other developers, and said Google threatened to increase the hardware spec requirements for YouTube TV, which would ensure Roku&#8217;s lower-end and more competitively priced players would not be able to access it.</p>
<p>Google has consistently pushed back on Roku&#8217;s statements,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/roku-removes-youtube-tv-from-its-channel-store-following-failed-negotiations/"> saying it had not made requests</a> to &#8220;access user data or interfere with search results.&#8221; The company also shamed Roku for turning to customers in an attempt to sway the negotiations in its favor and said all its requests were about providing a good user experience.</p>
<p>Essentially, today&#8217;s update is to let Roku&#8217;s customers know that no progress has yet been made with the negotiations, and to alert them that Google could later take a more punitive action, if it chose. Roku may be right to warn customers that YouTube TV could one day be pulled from its platform, but it&#8217;s also a risk to share that sort of information this close to the holiday shopping season when consumers are in the market for new streaming devices. (After all, Roku just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/roku-debuts-new-streaming-stick-4k-bundles-software-update-with-voice-and-mobile-features/">released</a> a pair of new Streaming Stick 4K devices and a refreshed Roku Ultra LT, a Walmart-exclusive version of its high-end player.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That Roku would warn customers of a possibility of a removal that even Google says isn&#8217;t yet happening is an indication of how dirty these negotiations have gotten.</p>
<p>Roku&#8217;s arguments seem to largely boil down to what sort of rights it has to dictate how its own software works as the platform provider. That means determining how search results are displayed, what sort of data is shared with its app developers, and how apps are meant to behave, according to its own guidelines.</p>
<p>These are the same sort of rules Apple and Google make for their own platforms. But although Roku is the platform in this scenario, it doesn&#8217;t put itself on the side of the tech giants who are accused of abusing their monopoly power &#8212; it paints itself as the victim, having to bow to Google&#8217;s demands or risk losing access to Google&#8217;s must-have apps, like YouTube and YouTube TV. And of course, Google competes directly with Roku via Chromecast.</p>
<p>But Roku is not some indie developer trying to fight back against tech giants who are trying to destroy its business. It&#8217;s a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ROKU/key-statistics/">multi-billion</a> dollar company that&#8217;s <a href="https://nscreenmedia.com/android-tv-market-share/">claimed a larger slice of the U.S. steaming market</a> than Google&#8217;s own Chromecast.</p>
<p>YouTube told TechCrunch it has been negotiating in good faith with Roku and alleges Roku is still making baseless claims that cause alarm among their mutual users. The company reiterated that it has made no requests to access user data or interfere with search results.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since our negotiations with Roku earlier this year, we’ve continued to work with them to find a resolution that benefits our mutual users,&#8221; a YouTube spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roku has once again chosen to make unproductive and baseless claims rather than try to work constructively with us. Since we haven’t been able to continue our conversations in good faith, our partnership for all new Roku devices will unfortunately end on December 9. We are, however, giving Roku the ability to continue distributing both YouTube and YouTube TV apps to all existing users to make sure they are not impacted,&#8221; they added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If I went to Stanford and worked with some YC-backed startups, chances are that I’ll find it relatively easy to find one or two co-founders, get millions in funding and build a billion-dollar company.</p>
<p>However, as someone who grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, and studied at the University of Nigeria, those chances are much slimmer, and it’ll be hard to find the same resources to build a successful company.</p>
<p>When Y Combinator began Startup School as an in-person program for early-stage founders launching a company, it catered to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/16/startup-school/">first set</a> of privileged founders. But it then decided to level the playing field a bit by taking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/y-combinators-startup-school-relaunches-to-be-ready-when-you-are/">the program online</a> so founders from other parts of the world could participate.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221278" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The free program, which provides a similar curriculum to YC’s main content used during its biannual startup batches, amassed more than 300,000 participants.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.startupschool.org/">Startup School</a> has a Q&amp;A session every Monday where new members of the program join in for the first time. After several meetings, those in charge of the program noticed they needed to solve another problem.</p>
<p>“The most common question we get is where do I find a co-founder? How do I find the right co-founder? How to find a tech co-founder? So it was just very obvious to us that it’s a huge problem for people,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherynli">Catheryn Li</a>, product engineer at Y Combinator, said in an interview. “I think something like 20% of our active founders are actively looking for a co-founder and that’s across our 300,000 founders.”</p>
<p>So, the team began testing a co-founder matching platform with some early users in January this year and it went live in July.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When aspiring founders come to the platform, they describe themselves and the kind of co-founder they need. The platform then offers a pool of candidates who might be a good fit for the aspiring founder. If their requirements overlap and mutual interest exist on both ends, a connection is made.</p>

<p>For example, if an aspiring founder with an engineering background is looking for a sales/marketing co-founder, the other person would have to be a sales and marketing co-founder interested in an engineering co-founder.</p>
<p>In the three and half months YC’s co-founder matching platform has been live, more than 16,000 co-founder profiles have been created. These founders have sent 130,000 matching invites; with a 25% acceptance rate, the platform has made 33,000 matches.</p>
<p>Although it’s too early to determine the platform’s long-term results, TechCrunch spoke with Li and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katmanalac">Kat Mañalac</a>, YC’s head of outreach, to discuss a few short-term trends &#8212; some surprising and some not.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The matching platform received profiles from 146 countries &#8212; 40% from the U.S. and 60% from 145 countries.</p>
<p>The pandemic and a new work-from-home culture have fundamentally changed how founders think about location when choosing a co-founder. Assuredly, it is an incidental attribute &#8212; according to the report, 50% of the founders do not care where their co-founder resides.</p>
<p>“When we started creating this platform, we assumed that it’d be really important for someone to find a co-founder that’s nearby so that they can meet up in person,” Li said. “But it turns out people don’t care about that anymore.”</p>
<p>Further breakdown of founders’ location shows some similarity between a typical YC batch and the countries represented in the matching program.</p>
<p>For instance, the biggest representative outside the U.S. (both in this matching platform and YC’s most recent batch) is India. The South Asian country accounts for 14% of the profiles, followed by the U.K., Canada and Nigeria.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a continental breakdown looks like this: North America, 46%; Asia, 23%; Europe, 21%; Africa, 6%; South America, 3%; and Australia, 2%.</p>
<p>But matches performed on the platform tell a different story as founders have found partners in close proximity. Of the matches made so far, 55% are founders located in the same country, 69% are between founders in the same continent, while 61% of matches are from founders located within three time zones of one another.</p>
<h2>Shared interests and skills</h2>
<p>If founders care less about the location of their business partners, then what do they care about the most? Per the report, 79% of the profiles want their co-founder to commit to a certain number of hours for a few weeks into a project, while 74% prefer to have shared interests with their co-founder.</p>
<p>Shared interests, in this case, are synonymous with the industries or sectors generally known in the startup world, from blockchain and e-commerce to fintech and hardware.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221425" style="width: 644px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221425" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2221425" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png?w=634" alt="YC co-founder matching platform" width="634" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png 2782w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png?resize=140,150 140w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png?resize=280,300 280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png?resize=768,824 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png?resize=634,680 634w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png?resize=1432,1536 1432w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png?resize=1909,2048 1909w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221425" class="wp-caption-text">YC co-founder matching platform</p></div></p>
<p>Profiles are allowed to select several interests on the matching platform and the most selected ones are almost identical to the categories on a typical YC batch: 36% of the founders selected B2B/enterprise; 34% picked consumer; 34% chose AI; 32% indicated an interest in the marketplace category; while 29% chose fintech and e-commerce.</p>
<p>To build in any of these sectors, founders need skill, and on the matching platform, five skills are held in high regard &#8212; product, design, engineering, sales and marketing, and operations.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising which skill is in the highest demand: engineering. According to the report, 63% of founders on the platform want a co-founder who does engineering. Even engineering founders want engineering co-founders: 44% of engineering founders prefer an engineer co-founder, the report said.</p>
<p>For other skills, 42% of founders want a product person; 39% prefer a design co-founder; 37% are better off if they find a co-founder who does sales and marketing; while 28% want a co-founder skilled in operations.</p>
<h2>More work to be done for underrepresented founders</h2>
<p>A widespread consensus held in the startup world is that it’s best to work with someone you’ve known for a while, maybe a friend or colleague, when looking for a co-founder.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/02/how-to-pick-a-co-founder">article by Harvard Business Review</a> in 2011 says, “a long-term relationship can help you leapfrog the learning curve of the close collaboration, which can sometimes take years to develop.”</p>
<p>On the surface, YC’s co-founder matching platform does not seem to regard this advice. One Twitter user called it “co-founder dating” and said YC lecturers in Startup School frown on the idea.</p>
<p>But Li explains that the matching platform has a pretty different model from other co-founder dating platforms.</p>
<p>“I do think that the typical advice that you should have met your co-founder a long time ago is less about the length of time and more about the fact that you are really comfortable working with them and you understand their working styles,” she said.</p>
<p>She adds that YC recommends that when two profiles match, they should not become co-founders immediately in the program. Instead, YC presents an opportunity for them to figure out each other’s personality and compatibility by pitching them with a trial project to work on for weeks or even months together.</p>
<p>In the project, clearly defined scopes and expectations are set so matched profiles can figure out each other’s working styles and compatibility.</p>
<p>Though it’s too early to say, the model seems to be working. Of the thousands of companies founded on the platform, 50 of them applied to the Y Combinator Summer batch &#8212; and three got in.</p>
<p>One of the startups is Sequin, a fintech that builds a debit card for women to build credit. The founders, Vrinda Gupta and Mark Thomas were some of the early testers of the matching platform.</p>
<p>CEO Gupta is one of the 13% of profiles that identify as a woman. The percentage reflects the global underrepresentation of female founders, but Mañalac believes YC’s matching platform will help close that gap.</p>
<p>“How to find a co-founder is one of the most common questions we get, especially from women who are solo founders. And, so we’re hoping that this is one way that we can help increase the pipeline of women that can start companies and get funding.”</p>
<p>She also hopes more aspiring underrepresented founders in international markets get to know about the platform. That way, they “can <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">meet more people who are interested in building and hopefully one day start a company with them.”</span></p>
<p>YC alumni also see value from the platform. Li recounted an instance where a female founder from the winter batch this year got a technical co-founder via the matching platform &#8212; barring her, over 150 alumni are using the platform to find new co-founders with whom they can start a new company.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">NVIDIA has unveiled its next-generation cloud gaming platform called GeForce Now RTX 3080 with &#8220;desktop-class latency&#8221; and 1440p gaming at up to 120 fps on PC or Mac. The service is powered by a new gaming supercomputer called the GeForce Now SuperPod and costs double the price of the current <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-nows-price-increase-new-features-180648780.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">Priority tier</a>.</p>
<p>The SuperPod is &#8220;the most powerful gaming supercomputer ever built,&#8221; according to NVIDIA, delivering 39,200 TFLOPS, 11,477, 760 CUDA Cores and 8,960 CPU Cores. NVIDIA said it will provide an experience equivalent to 35 TFLOPs, or triple the Xbox Series X, roughly equal to a PC with an 8-core CPU, 28GB of DDR4-3200 RAM and a PCI-GEN4 SSD.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-10%2F9fb8f9d0-325d-11ec-bf9c-44ba371e8c1d&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=e0b28f14066b4ff146d91f1f0ceb12b9bebe8aa1" alt="NVIDIA launches GeForce Now RTX 3080-class gaming at up to 1440p 120fps" data-uuid="44dbf143-8ef2-3271-9d6c-1ec0ca74a0a9" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NVIDIA</div>
</figure>
<p>As such, you&#8217;ll see 1440p gaming at up to 120fps on a Mac or PC, and even 4K HDR on a shield, though NVIDIA didn&#8217;t mention the refresh rate for the latter. It&#8217;ll also support 120 fps on mobile, &#8220;supporting next-gen 120Hz displays,&#8221; the company said. By comparison, the GeForce Now Priority tier is limited to 1080p at 60 fps, with adaptive VSync available in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-nows-price-increase-new-features-180648780.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">latest update</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221858" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s also promising a &#8220;click-to-pixel&#8221; latency down to 56 milliseconds, thanks to tricks like adaptive sync that reduces buffering, supposedly beating other services and even local, dedicated PCs. However, that&#8217;s based on a 15 millisecond round trip delay (RTD) to the GeForce Now data center, something that obviously depends on your internet provider and where you&#8217;re located.</p>
<p>NVIDIA&#8217;s claims aside, it&#8217;s clearly a speed upgrade over the current GeForce Priority tier, whether you&#8217;re on a mobile device or PC. There&#8217;s a price to pay for that speed, though. The GeForce Now premium tier started at $50 per year and recently doubled to $100, which is already a pretty big ask. But the RTX 3080 tier is $100 for six months (around double the price) &#8220;in limited quantities,&#8221; with Founders and priority early access starting today. If it lives up to the claims, it&#8217;s cheaper than buying a new PC, in any case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As investors race to capitalize on surging interest in cryptocurrencies, startups are getting creative in how they onboard a generation of crypto users to their first wallets.</p>
<p><a href="https://worldcoin.org/">Worldcoin</a> is perhaps one of the most audacious efforts to bribe the world to embrace their currency. The startup, founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Alex Blania, wants to put a crypto wallet (and some of their currency) onto every human&#8217;s smartphone, but in order to do so they have to build a way to determine whether someone is a unique human. Worldcoin is aiming to make their proof-of-personhood network in the least dystopian way possible, that being said, it still requires scanning a billion people&#8217;s eyeballs with a 5-pound chromatic sphere called &#8220;The Orb&#8221;.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221838" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221838" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221838" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg 4344w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221838" class="wp-caption-text">Alex Blania (left and Sam Altman.

<p>The internet has developed with a very amorphous mesh of user networks. Bot networks operate alongside real people using their real identities, alongside users impersonating real people, alongside pseudonymous users. This can be a recipe for misaligned user incentives, as modern social media platforms have showcased, but when it comes to finance it can also be a recipe for fraud and inequality. Worldcoin wants to avoid all of that while ensuring equitable distribution of their currency, ensuring that each human on earth only signs up for one wallet in their network.</p>
<p>Worldcoin CEO Alex Blania tells TechCrunch that the currency is part of a larger effort to drive a more unified and equitable global economy driven by the internet economy, something cryptocurrencies notably haven&#8217;t nailed in their first several years.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Worldcoin] started with a discussion that universal basic income will eventually be something that is very important to the world, and in general, getting access to the internet economy will be much more important than is obvious at this point,&#8221; Blania says.</p>
<p>The Worldcoin coin itself is a &#8220;Layer 2&#8221; Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that leverages the security of the Ethereum blockchain while having its own economy. Blania says Worldcoin chose to build on top of Ethereum largely because of its developer network, which he hopes will also adopt Worldcoin. While plenty of crypto proponents want Bitcoin to become most people&#8217;s first exposure to cryptocurrencies, Blania sees too many scalability issues with the currency compared to an Ethereum Layer 2.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Bitcoin isn&#8217;t scalable to billions of people,&#8221; Blania says. &#8220;As we see today, it&#8217;s very expensive because transactions are slow.&#8221;</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-29/sam-altman-s-worldcoin-will-give-free-crypto-for-eyeball-scans">Bloomberg</a> wrote up early details of the company&#8217;s launch, which Blania notes was &#8220;pretty annoying,&#8221; acknowledging that what Worldcoin is doing is a complicated process with plenty of intricacies but that he&#8217;s confident his company will be able to communicate these to its global user base as it heads towards launch.</p>
<p>Speaking of which&#8230; <em>The Orb</em>?</p>
<p>The crypto startup has one of the more comically rigorous user acquisition flows, licensing their Orb cameras to contractors across the globe who manually go through the person of verifying each and every new user on the network in every city of every country on every continent of the globe.</p>
<p>In its most basic form, the company&#8217;s proof-of-personhood onboarding flow works by capturing an image of a person&#8217;s iris with the Orb, converting that image into a hash code (a process Worldcoin says can&#8217;t be reversed), checking with a database to ensure that a hash associated with that iris hasn&#8217;t already been uploaded, and, if it is unique, saving the hash while allowing users to generate a wallet in their app, which the Orb scans a QR code from. What this amounts to is a network of verified users that is tied to pseudonymous wallet codes rather than real names, and a database that is filled with hashes rather than actual eyeball photos, privacy efforts Blania hopes that Worldcoin can communicate clearly as it rapidly onboards users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221839" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221839" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221839" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg 2571w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221839" class="wp-caption-text">An Orb onboarding session in Indonesia</p></div></p>
<p>Blania says that on average contractors have been able to onboard over 700 users per Orb per week in early testing across four continents: South America, Asia, Africa and Europe. They currently have 30 prototype devices out in the field and hope to add hundreds more in the coming months, before ultimately shipping thousands of Orbs per month (if all goes to plan). What does seem apparent, is that users in the US might be waiting for a while to get their quality time with a Worldcoin Orb.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be that we delay launch in the United States until we have more clarity around the regulatory environment here,&#8221; Blania notes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all an arduous process, but setting up millions of users with their first crypto wallets while simultaneously building out a network of verified internet users via the blockchain, sounds like something that many crypto investors would break their piggy banks for. As Worldcoin launches, unique users will be given a share of the digital currency (whether that is a flat rate or dollar-pegged amount isn&#8217;t final, but it sounds like it will be the latter). All-in-all 80% of the Worldcoin supply will be given to users onboarded to the service, while 10% will be reserved for the company with the remaining 10% going to the organization&#8217;s investors.</p>
<p>One of the major issues with giving users free money is that they tend to spend it. Blania says that they will make efforts to ensure users can&#8217;t immediately liquidate the entirety of their sign-up reward as Worldcoin scales its network and utility.</p>
<p>And speaking of investors, Worldcoin is launching with $25 million in funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from Coinbase, Reid Hoffman, Day One Ventures, Multicoin, FTX&#8217;s Sam Bankman-Fried and Variant&#8217;s Jesse Walden, among others. The investment was made at a $1 billion valuation, but the unicorn signifier largely seems meaningless here as Blania tells me the company and its IP will eventually be converted into a foundation. Investors are bankrolling the startup to get access to the 10% pool of investor capital in the Worldcoin token.</p>
<p>&#8220;The equity of the company itself should not matter at all, basically,&#8221; Blania says.</p>
<p>Ultimately, gaining attention for yet another new cryptocurrency is a massive challenge, onboarding billions of users is another one, as is ensuring their proprietary hardware can decipher billions of eyeballs in drastically different onboarding environments. Worldcoin has plenty of huge challenges ahead of it and some that likely won&#8217;t be obvious until there are more orbs in the wild. Some of these issues can likely be solved by having access to ever-flowing investor capital, but other issues will simply arise from communicating how all of this (pretty complicated) stuff works.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s launch blog seems to communicate it all pretty well: &#8220;Nothing like this has ever been done before and the outcome is uncertain.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://socraticworks.com/">Socratic</a>, an early-stage startup that wants to bring data to bear on a developer-focused task management system, announced a $3 million seed investment today from Unusual Ventures, Overtime.vc and a couple of industry angels. The company is also opening up public beta of the software starting today.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Socratic received the investment in May 2020. It has been operating in stealth and is announcing the funding today for the first time.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Nolan Wright says that he wants to build a new kind of task management system by using data to drive decisions. &#8220;Socratic is the first task management system that has been built from the ground up to use data and data science to help individuals and teams work better,&#8221; Wright explained.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221822" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It does this by letting developers work as they normally do, while Socratic works behind the scenes tracking all the critical data. &#8220;We then turn that around and give you insights into how you work and how you can work better,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The product is focused on developers and team leads, but Wright says that he also wants to give engineering executives more insight into what&#8217;s happening inside their organizations. &#8220;We also want to design it for executives, so we also try to answer some of the more important questions that engineering leaders are trying to ask,&#8221; he said. That could be related to whether more personnel would solve a productivity problem, as an example.</p>
<p>While the software is using internal tooling to track most of this information, it could obviously benefit from linking to other work systems, and the first such integration is with GitHub. &#8220;We not only do things like automation related to the integration like automatically moving tasks based on commits, but we also extract a lot of data from the git repository to actually provide insights like how long code reviews are taking, how long is it taking to merge features in general and what things need to be reviewed,&#8221; Wright said.</p>
<p>The company has only six employees, including the founders, with plans to add four more by the end of the year. Wright says the team is diverse already and he plans to try to keep it that way. &#8220;We have a really diverse group already, and it&#8217;s important for us. It&#8217;s about just getting different perspectives on things and so it&#8217;s just kind of who we are&#8230;and it&#8217;s an antidote to narrow thinking,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The software has been in private beta with around 10 design partners. As they open it for public beta today, the plan is for full launch sometime next year. Although this approach could be applied to many different work groups beyond developers, as an early-stage startup, the company has decided to focus on the software development process for starters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The whole gun on a robot thing was a question we’ve been barreling toward since the first practical quadrupedal robots arrived. Last week, that came to an inevitable head when a Ghost Robotics system was spotted at a tradeshow sporting a remote-controlled sniper rifle designed by a company called SWORD.</p>
<p>This is a question Boston Dynamics has worked hard to distance itself from. Understandably so &#8212; creating war machines is generally considered bad PR. That they &#8212; along with much of the robotics industry &#8212; were, in part, bootstrapped by DARPA funding and now create robots that people liken to scary sci-fi movies certainly complicates things.</p>
<p>I discussed Boston Dynamics’ approach to addressing the use of Spot for purposes of intimidation and violence in last week’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/actuator-8/">column</a>. I also talked a bit about my own feelings around mounting guns to the backs of robots (again, I’m against it and death machines generally). Ahead of writing the piece, I also reached out to Ghost Robotics, though only heard back after it was published.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221219" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I’ve since spoken to the company’s CEO Jiren Parikh about the system he refers to as “a walking tripod,” a nod to the fact that Ghost doesn’t design the payload &#8212; in this case, the SWORD Defense Systems Special Purpose Unmanned Rifle (SPUR). There are a lot of important ethical questions here. A walking tripod? Perhaps. But ultimately, there are questions of where the buck stops? The robotics company? The company that produces the payload? The end user (i.e. the military)? All of the above?</p>
<p>Important questions we need to address as we’re facing down a potential army of gun-strapped robotic dogs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191371" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191371" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2191371" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191371" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</p></div></p>

<p><strong>Let’s start with the question of autonomy.</strong></p>
<p>The robots themselves are not using any type of autonomy or AI for targeting weapon systems. SWORD, who makes the system, I can’t speak for. From what I know, that weapon is a manual-firing trigger. Even the targeting is done by a human behind the scenes. Firing the trigger is fully human-controlled.</p>
<p><strong>Is full autonomy a line the company doesn’t want to cross in this scenario?</strong></p>
<p>We don’t make the payloads. Are we going to promote and advertise any of these weapon systems? Probably not. That’s a tough one to answer. Because we’re selling to the military, we don’t know what they do with them. We’re not going to dictate to our government customers how they use the robots.</p>
<p>We do draw the line on where they’re sold. We only sell to U.S. and allied governments. We don’t even sell our robots to enterprise customers in adversarial markets. We get lots of inquiries about our robots in Russia and China. We don’t ship there, even for our enterprise customers.</p>
<p><strong>Does the company reserve the right to make sure the robots aren’t used for applications that you don’t support?</strong></p>
<p>In a sense, yes. We have full control. Everyone has to sign a licensing agreement. We don’t sell the robots to anyone we don’t want to. We only choose to sell them to U.S. and allied governments that we feel comfortable. We just have to recognize that military customers don’t disclose everything that they’re doing. If they need to use that robot for specific purposes for national security or to keep a war fighter out of harms way, we’re all for that.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221223" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221223" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221223" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SPUR-5.png" alt="" width="1024" height="881" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SPUR-5.png 1395w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SPUR-5.png?resize=150,129 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SPUR-5.png?resize=300,258 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SPUR-5.png?resize=768,661 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SPUR-5.png?resize=680,585 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SPUR-5.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221223" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SWORD</p></div></p>
<p><strong>The vetting is in the customers [Ghost] chooses, rather than the applications the customers use those robots for?</strong></p>
<p>That’s correct. We’ve had people call to use these robots for fighting videos or putting together a reality show for crazy stuff the robots would do. Without naming names, we decline. We think that’s not tasteful. The robot is a serious tool. It’s a tool for inspections, security and all sort of military applications.</p>
<p><strong>As far as what we saw [last week] in the photos, is there a timeline?</strong></p>
<p>They’re expecting to do field testing on that sniper kit in late-Q1 of next year.</p>
<p><strong>In this specific case, what is the nature of the deal? The DoD has an individual deal with you and SWORD?</strong></p>
<p>There’s no deals. This is just a long-gun company that believes there’s a market opportunity for this. They developed on their own dime and we thought it was a compelling payload. There’s no customers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218459" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218459" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2218459" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png" alt="An aircraft flying" width="1024" height="582" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png 1256w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218459" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reliable Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>Okay, that’s it for the war dogs (for this week, at least). Let’s move from land operations to sea and sky. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/reliable-robotics-going-up-in-the-world/">First off is Reliable Robotics</a>, a Bay Area-based autonomous cargo-plane company that just raised $100 million. The Series C round brings the four-year-old firm’s total funding to $130 million, in Reliable’s bid to effectively move the autonomous trucking model into the skies.</p>
<p>Speaking of unmanned aerial vehicles, Wing just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/walgreens-will-deploy-wing-drone-deliveries-in-the-dallas-fort-worth-area/">announced</a> the beginning of what could amount to a big push into U.S. drone deliveries. Following successful pilots in Australia and a small town in Virginia, the Alphabet division announced a partnership with Walgreens to bring autonomous deliveries to the greater Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220625" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220625" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2220625" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220625" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alphabet</p></div></p>
<p>Wing told us the following about its efforts on the regulatory side of things:</p>
<blockquote><p>In April of 2019, Wing became the first drone operator to be certified as an air carrier by the Federal Aviation Administration, allowing us to deliver commercial goods to recipients miles away, and we got an expanded version of that permission to launch in Virginia in October 2019. Now, we’re working toward permissions for this expansion, and we’ll be conducting test flights and demonstrating our new capabilities in the area in the coming weeks as part of that process. Prior to launching our service in DFW, we will work with authorities at the local, state and federal levels to secure all the appropriate permissions.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2219735" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219735" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2219735" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/saildrone-fleet.jpg" alt="Several Saildrone vessels float in formation on the ocean." width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/saildrone-fleet.jpg 1504w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/saildrone-fleet.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/saildrone-fleet.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/saildrone-fleet.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/saildrone-fleet.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/saildrone-fleet.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219735" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Saildrone</p></div></p>
<p>On the water-front comes another $100 million Series C. This one is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/saildrone-catches-a-100m-c-breeze-to-build-more-robo-boats/">for Saildrone’s autonomous boats</a>, which are being deployed to collect data for scientific purposes. The company has already deployed a sizable fleet of its uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs), which have traveled around half a million miles, collectively.</p>
<p>Lastly, an interesting piece <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/business/restaurants-robots-workers.html">from The New York Times</a> about the adoption of robotic waiters amid pandemic-related staff shortages. That part isn’t all that’s interesting in and of itself. What is, however, is that the wait staff has reported an increase in tipping, as a result. From the piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>Servi saved wait staff and bussers from having to run back and forth to the kitchen and gave overworked servers more time to schmooze with customers and serve more tables, which led to higher tips.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a small vindication of what robotics companies have been suggesting for a while &#8212; that autonomous systems won’t replace existing jobs, but rather augment them and fill in the gaps companies can’t with current headcount. That certainly seems to be the case on a shorter timeline when, frankly, these systems are incapable of replacing people outright. There’s a question around whether this is a step toward full automation, but in the near term, there’s something to be said for freeing up humans to do more humane things.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook Messenger <a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/10/21/your-video-calls-just-got-a-lot-more-exciting-with-new-interactive-ar-experiences/">is rolling out</a> new augmented reality (AR) experiences to video calls and Messenger Rooms, the platform’s videoconferencing feature. The company notes that the new “Group Effects” feature will be coming to Instagram soon.</p>
<p>Group Effects work for everyone on the video call, as Facebook says it’s aiming to make AR effects a shared experience. Users can now choose from a library of more than 70 group effects, including a game where you compete to build the best burger the fastest.</p>
<p>To check out the new Group Effects, start a video call or create a room, tap the smiley face to open the effects tray and then select group effects. From there, you’ll be able to select an AR experience that will be applied to everyone on the call.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221762" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Additionally, Facebook says it’s expanding access to its Spark AR API at the end of the month to let more creators and developers build group effects.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221765" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221765" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2221765" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook-messenger-ar.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook-messenger-ar.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook-messenger-ar.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook-messenger-ar.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook-messenger-ar.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook-messenger-ar.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook-messenger-ar.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook-messenger-ar.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221765" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>“Group Effects provide a more engaging and interactive way to connect with your friends. They also support the creator community and give people more ways to express themselves,” the company said in a <a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/10/21/your-video-calls-just-got-a-lot-more-exciting-with-new-interactive-ar-experiences/">blog post.</a></p>
<p>Facebook Messenger is also rolling out new “suggested word effects” that will trigger an animation within the chat. For instance, now when you send standalone messages like “goodnight” or “congrats,” you’ll see an option to create a word effect for that term. Facebook first launched word effects in August for special holidays and inside jokes but is now expanding the feature to include everyday phrases. Suggested word effects are rolling out to all iOS users and will be available on Android in the coming weeks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is also launching new James Bond “soundmojis” following the release of “No Time to Die” in theatres. There are also new chat themes, including a “care” theme and ghostly Halloween themes. Facebook Messenger will also roll out four haunted world AR effects in time for Halloween.</p>
<p>Group AR in Messenger arrives as the company is clearly making a bigger push around &#8220;metaverse&#8221; efforts in general, and is in keeping with the theme of creating shared virtual experiences.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Unity, the platform that develops 2D and 3D content for mobile phones, tablets, PCs, consoles and augmented and virtual reality devices, launched a beta version of <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/gaming-services"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unity Gaming Services</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> &#8212; a new platform that provides everything game creators need such as backend, monetization, user acquisition and player engagement. The updated version promises to make it easier for developers to launch cross-platform, multiplayer games &#8212; a <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/mobile-gaming/2021-gaming-spotlight/">growing</a> segment of the market that includes hit titles like Roblox, Genshin Impact and Fortnite, among others.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The new platform is available globally, with more than 100 developers on the platform, Ingrid Lestiyo, senior vice president and general manager, Operate Solutions at Unit told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The new tools will include things developers need to build live games of any size, including the ability to sync their game logic with Unity&#8217;s backend services without needing to go through a platform release process. Among the tools provided are those that enable multiplayer gameplay, like those for connecting players, creating lobbies, matching online players, enabling in-game voice and chat, and more. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221709" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“This is simple. We are the fastest way to make cross-platform multiplayer games, and getting your multiplayer game live is clicks away through the Unity editor,” Lestiyo told TechCrunch. “We also make it easy for teams of any size to mix-and-match products to best suit their needs. Our products are also interoperable with one another, which makes for both a better developer and player experience.” </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Developers will also get an overview of their game&#8217;s performance and be able to see actionable insights in one place. And they&#8217;ll be able to monetize and grow their game with tools that help with in-app purchases, ads and user acquisition. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“No matter how complex their tools or content, they can now monitor their game’s performance in a single, connected interface,” Lestiyo said. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unity Game Services is open to all developers for free during its beta period and developers only pay as they scale. It&#8217;s available for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac and Windows. Console support is currently on an invite-only basis but will be made available soon, Lestiyo said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ac_N59a7_Os?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lestiyo declined to comment on any potential partnership deals at this stage, but said it encourages teams and studios of all sizes to try out the new Unity Gaming Services Platform. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Our mission to enable success for our developers, who today are managing an increasingly complex new reality that needs to meet growing player demand for cross-platform multiplayer games and at the same time requires tremendous cloud networking expertise and presents technical and operational challenges far beyond game design itself,” Lestiyo said. “With such growing player demand for cross-platform multiplayer games, Unity Gaming Service reduces the barrier to entry for developers to launch more multiplayer games that collectively will expand the size of the industry, and titles available for play.” </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unity has more than 3.4 billion monthly active users as of June 2021, Unity claimed. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a blinding flash of humility, TMTG allows that taking on public cloud and fintech infrastructure giants is more a "long-term" goal, not something it intends to get busy on right away.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Now out of office, news regarding former President Donald Trump has been rather lacking from TechCrunch&#8217;s pages. He&#8217;s back.</p>
<p>News broke yesterday that <a href="https://www.tmtgcorp.com/">Trump Media &amp; Technology Group</a>, a concern formed to take on a host of major technology and media companies, <a href="https://www.tmtgcorp.com/press-releases/announcement-10-20-2021/">plans to go public</a> via a merger with a SPAC. The blank-check company in question, Digital World Acquisition Corp., <a href="https://www.accesswire.com/viewarticle.aspx?id=663216">recently raised $287.5 million</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The merger of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group &#8212; TMTG from here on out &#8212; and Digital World will sport &#8220;an initial enterprise value of $875 Million,&#8221; with the potential for another $825 million in capital &#8220;depending on the performance of the stock price post-business combination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Per the release disclosing the transaction, &#8220;Trump Media &amp; Technology Group’s growth plans initially will be funded by DWAC’s cash in trust[.]&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220368 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Yeah, I&#8217;ll bet.</p>
<p>The former president has apparently decided that funding the company that bears his name would be too expensive, so he&#8217;s leveraging a SPAC to underwrite the effort.</p>
<p>Regardless of how we feel about <em>that</em>, we have to take this news item seriously. Because when the name of the company says &#8220;Media &amp; Technology,&#8221; it apparently means it. An <a href="https://tmtgcorp.com/static/tmtg-company-overview-f6cfb16513c78a61681aea3bbdae7a78.pdf">overview of the TMTG company</a> shows huge aspirations &#8212; if limited evidence of actual progress. A quarter-billion dollars will certainly help.</p>
<p>First, some notes on the money in the deal. And then an overview of what TMTG wants to build.</p>
<h2>Are we being punished?</h2>
<p>Yes. Clearly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded by entrepreneur Parker Conrad in 2013, the HR company Zenefits was quickly anointed one of the fast-growing companies in Silicon Valley, with a valuation that soared to $4.5 billion within three years. Then it began to fall apart. The company was discovered to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/williamalden/zenefits-under-scrutiny-for-flouting-insurance-laws#.ca87pxy0l">face compliance issues</a>. Conrad was forced to resign. And Zenefits&#8217;s valuation was slashed in half, with more than 60% of the company&#8217;s employees laid off over numerous rounds afterward.</p>
<p>If Conrad wallowed in self-pity afterward, he didn&#8217;t do it long. Within months of leaving Zenefits in 2016, he formed <a href="https://www.rippling.com/">Rippling</a>, a company originally focused on the process of onboarding employees but that has since come to manage all aspects of employee data, from payroll and benefits, to the apps employees use, to a device management platform that enables Rippling&#8217;s customers to retrieve, wipe clean, and store employee computers when staffers part ways with a company.</p>
<p>In fact, there are now so many lines of revenue that Rippling just closed on $250 million in fresh funding led by Sequoia Capital Global Equities and Global Growth, with participation from earlier backers Greenoaks, Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Initialized, YC, and Threshold Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221525" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The round brings Rippling&#8217;s total funding to $450 million. It also values Rippling at $6.5 billion, making it more valuable than Zenefits ever was before it sold a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2021/03/18/zenefits-once-worth-45-billion-does-deal-with-private-equity-firm-that-gives-it-control/?sh=57a949123873">controlling interest</a> earlier this year to a private equity firm.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wvhGtF9eb0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/rippling-launches-computer-inventory-management-as-more-workers-remain-remote/">Rippling launches computer inventory management as more workers remain remote</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rippling launches computer inventory management as more workers remain remote&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/rippling-launches-computer-inventory-management-as-more-workers-remain-remote/embed/#?secret=wvhGtF9eb0" data-secret="wvhGtF9eb0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Conrad thinks it could easily grow from here. Asked if Rippling has received interest from an acquirer like, say Microsoft, he says the &#8220;right analog&#8221; for Rippling <em>is</em> Microsoft. &#8220;Our view is that Rippling is not just going to double in the future, but maybe grow by some much, much larger multiple over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conrad largely credits Rippling&#8217;s &#8220;compound&#8221; model, wherein instead of focus narrowly on one smaller software sector, it has, from its outset, focused on growing numerous business lines simultaneously that share components and can be easily integrated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s an approach that Rippling can execute by pulling founders into the fold, says Conrad, who offers that of Rippling&#8217;s now roughly 800 employees, 47 are former founders and many are in general manager type roles where they enjoy both financial security and the autonomy that they cherish.</p>
<p>(They build new business lines in-house; Rippling isn&#8217;t an acquisitive outfit, Conrad makes clear.)</p>
<p>That compound approach also enables Rippling to sell a bundled system of its offerings to customers on a mostly per-seat basis.</p>
<p>The way that Rippling is structured means more diversified revenue, too, which is something that investors, such as Sequoia, like to see.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all beginning to add up, according to Conrad. He says that Rippling &#8212; which sells to teams as small as two people and as large as 1,000-plus &#8212; has more than doubled its number of customers over the last year and that it now enjoys 2.7 times the annual recurring revenue it saw a year ago, even while he declines to be more specific about how much revenue that equals.</p>
<p>Explains Conrad: &#8220;I made that mistake the last time around [at Zenefits], and I predicted where our revenue was gonna go, and then we didn&#8217;t get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for how investors arrived at that $6.5 billion figure exactly, Conrad figuratively throws up his hands. &#8220;Man, you&#8217;re asking the wrong person. I see one deal every two years, which is the fundraising that we do as a company, [whereas] I know that investors are seeing multiple deals a week.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I want to do,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is just go out and put our best foot forward in a fundraising process. I studiously never have an opinion about what the price of the company should be and [instead] let investors tell me what they think is a fair price.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for readers looking to understand how the company is built differently than was Zenefits in its earliest years, Conrad says the they are nearly exact opposites from a foundation perspective.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the biggest mistake that we made at Zenefits was that it was almost too easy for us to close customers early on, and that led to this fear that the biggest risk that we faced was that other companies were going to swoop in, and so that what we needed to do is we needed to just take all of the oxygen out of the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conrad believed at the time that &#8220;at some level of scale, there would be network effects in the business, and we&#8217;d have to get very large to get there.&#8221; Toward that end, the company did administrative work for its clients internally with an eye toward automating those processes afterward.</p>
<p>But &#8220;it&#8217;s much harder to automate a process once you&#8217;ve scaled it out, than it is if you start with automation,&#8221; recalls Conrad now. Indeed, the &#8220;the automation ended up just being way harder than we expected, it took much longer and in the meantime, [because] we were doing [a lot] manually meant that we were upside down from a gross margin perspective . . . and that&#8217;s when a lot of things started to come apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile at Rippling, he says, &#8220;We just had this absolute prohibition on any in-house manual [work] for the longest time. There wasn&#8217;t even customer support. I was personally doing, and the engineering team was personally doing, all of the customer support until [we&#8217;d generated] several million dollars in ARR.&#8221;</p>
<p>It meant that for the first two years, Rippling was &#8220;basically me and like 50 engineers,&#8221;he says. &#8220;But what we built was really software, and it it makes for a much better, much more robust product, and we&#8217;re we&#8217;re now way out on the other extreme of the distribution of SaaS companies, where we&#8217;re just relentless about pruning any operational function and trying to replace it with with software.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that ultimately,&#8221; he says, &#8220;it&#8217;s a much more robust place to be from a product perspective.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the digital world, many professional service firms are still working to get caught up &#8212; especially the smaller players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><a href="https://www.b12.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">B12</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that is focused on helping those smaller professional service organizations such as law and accounting firms or mortgage brokerages more easily accept online payments and build a digital presence in general, announced it has raised $15.7 million in funding led by Tola Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breyer Capital, General Catalyst, Naval Ravikant and others also put money in the round, which brings B12&#8217;s total funding to $28.1 million.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221334" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B12 co-founder and CEO Nitesh Banta is a former investor at General Catalyst &#8212; having worked at the firm from 2010 to 2015. He teamed up with MIT grad Adam Marcus in 2015 to found B12 with the mission of helping small professional service firms “own their digital identity and customer relationships” and give people a way to buy services online. It does things like help these firms with building a website, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">effective SEO, email marketing/automation, online scheduling and, of course, online payments and invoicing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banta said he was inspired to start the company because his own father was a small business owner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based B12 markets itself as an “all-in-one solution that helps professional services firms establish, run, and grow their business online.” It claims to get customers set up within 30 days and help them compete against larger online platforms such as LegalZoom, Better and Fiverr. Banta likens B12 to Shopify and Toast helping stores and restaurants, respectively, compete with the likes of Amazon and DoorDash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe small firms deserve to succeed online,” the executive told TechCrunch.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a trend I&#8217;ve seen more broadly and we think professional services is the next category that needs an SMB enabler, and that&#8217;s really what we&#8217;re trying to do.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2221346" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221346" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2221346 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/B12.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/B12.jpg 4170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/B12.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/B12.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/B12.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/B12.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/B12.jpg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/B12.jpg?resize=2048,1364 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/B12.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221346" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> B12</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far more than</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 150,000 companies have signed up for B12 and the startup has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“thousands” of paying customers. Revenue has grown “over 50x” since the company’s 2016 funding. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From January to August 2021, monthly payment volume on B12 has increased “15.2x,” according to Banta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a SaaS company, B12 makes money by selling its software via a subscription &#8212; starting at $29 a month and up to $599, depending on what a customer signs up for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, B12’s model has evolved as the pandemic accelerated digital everything, including payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For a long time, we&#8217;ve really focused on this web presence space and we&#8217;re super excited to share with the world this payments feature as being a really unique way for this segment to work with their customers online,” Banta told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Catalyst Managing Director Larry Bohn has been a believer in B12 since its early days. The firm first invested in the company in 2016, leading its $12.4 million funding round. He said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his firm had a long history with the founding team of B12 (particularly Banta) and believed they “have proven to be effective operators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also have a lot of experience in this industry, having led investments in Big Commerce and more, and believe that B12 is uniquely positioned to help professional service businesses with their digital transformation,” he wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his view, the company’s model is unique in that it helps professional service businesses grow online by using artificial intelligence “to power their go-to-market model of service,” which Bohn said gives companies “the latest technology, but with a radically easy approach to implementation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron Fleishman, partner at Tola Capital, agrees that B12 sets up and activates firms to give their clients &#8220;a seamless experience&#8221; &#8212; from signing contracts with eSignatures to paying online for services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B12 plans to use the new financing to accelerate growth, do some hiring and continue building out its product suite. In conjunction with announcing its latest raise, the startup is also revealing today a new “Client Engagement” product designed to help professional services firms connect with clients, offer services and automate administrative tasks “so they can sell online from a centralized platform.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA has been encouraging private industry to replace the aging ISS with a commercial successor for quite a while now, and while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/axiom-space-raises-130-million-for-its-commercial-space-station-ambitions/">Axiom Space has already expressed its intent</a> to do so eventually, a new consortium made up of Nanoracks, Voyager Space and Lockheed Martin now say they&#8217;ll create the &#8220;first-ever free-flying commercial space station,&#8221; with planned operation to begin in 2027.</p>
<p>The new space station will be called &#8220;Starlab,&#8221; a name that recalls the third-ever U.S. space station, Skylab. Starlab will host a crew of four astronauts, and will be much smaller than the ISS — offering about a third of that station&#8217;s total pressurized space for human occupancy. The smaller size means that the group building the station expect it to be able to be sent up to orbit in a single launch, rather than piecemeal in parts like the existing ISS and Chinese space station.</p>
<p>This team has ample experience in in-space operations, with Nanoracks (which is now majority owned by Voyager) having designed and built a number of elements used today in the ISS. Voyager will be providing strategic guidance and capital investment to the project, while Lockheed Martin will be the primary manufacturer of Starlab, as well as the integrator putting together the various technical pieces of the puzzle.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221697" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The primary component of the station will be an inflatable habitat module created by Lockheed, alongside a docking node for visiting cargo and crew ferry spacecraft, as well as a robotic arm like the one found on the space station for assisting with cargo and payload manipulation outside of the station.</p>
<p>Potential crew will include public and private researchers, manufacturers and scientists, as well as commercial customers like space tourists, the company has said. NASA&#8217;s intent with private stations is to become one client among many, in order to make continuous occupation of space more sustainable for the agency while making the most of public funds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://viaseparations.com/">Via Separations</a> is a startup from a couple of MIT material science engineers who figured out a way to reduce the amount of energy required in a manufacturing process, resulting in lower carbon creation, lower energy usage and lower costs. Today, the company announced a $38 million Series B.</p>
<p>The round was led by NGP ETP, a firm that focuses on investments that lower carbon emissions. In addition, 2040 Foundation participated, along with existing investors The Engine, Safar Partners, Prime Impact Fund, Embark Ventures and Massachusetts Clean Energy Center.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Shreya Dave says the company hopes that by reducing carbon in the manufacturing process, they can help consumers make more green buying choices because the things they buy will have resulted in less carbon creation during manufacturing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221650" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Basically our vision is if we can decarbonize that supply chain infrastructure, then we don&#8217;t have to rely on consumers having to make a decision between the thing that they want and how to do good for the planet,&#8221; she told me.</p>
<p>The Via solution sits in a shipping container in the middle of the manufacturing process and acts as a filtration system for whatever is being produced. Dave uses a pasta pot analogy to describe how the filtering process works. &#8220;Instead of going into a pot where the water gets boiled off using heat, it goes through a strainer, where we [apply] pressure in order to force it through a filter like a pasta strainer,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>She said that has a couple of advantages. First of all, it reduces the amount of energy required because it&#8217;s using electricity instead of heat, which is using 90% less energy than a heat-based process. What&#8217;s more, because the process is using electricity, if you can get that from renewable energy, then you&#8217;re both electrifying and improving the energy efficiency of the process.</p>
<p>As an early startup building a complex solution, Via has decided to concentrate on the $5 billion pulp paper industry for now, but the technology could be more broadly applicable in other industries like petrochemicals, food and beverages, and pharmaceuticals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has been working on three pilot projects, but the goal is to eventually offer this solution as a service, which reduces overall capital costs for customers and puts the maintenance burden on the company instead of the customer. They are also building a software monitoring solution to keep an eye on their products as they get deployed to help customers maximize impact and catch any maintenance issues early.</p>
<p>Via spun out from MIT in 2017 and today has 23 employees with a goal of reaching 30 by the end of the year. As a diverse founding team, Dave says she and co-founder and CTO Brent Keller want to build a diverse group of employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;My philosophy is that there is a diverse candidate for every job opportunity that we&#8217;re hiring for, but there&#8217;s also a reality of resource constraints. And so we try to allocate our resources to get the widest perspective,&#8221; she said. That may mean hiring based on potential, rather than experience. She says they have also implemented rigorous anti-bias training in the hiring process.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup idea has its roots in research that Dave and Keller were doing as graduate students at MIT with their professor Jeffrey Grossman, who is chief scientist at the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;My co-founder and I were working on water filtration membranes and looking at how to take salt out of the water to make that process cheaper, better, faster. What we learned is that what we had invented didn&#8217;t have a lot of application in water, but had a lot of potential for chemical manufacturing for this raw material, for stuff that wasn&#8217;t water,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p>When they launched the company, they ended up shifting their focus to industrial manufacturing, which is much more impactful from a greenhouse gas perspective, a point that is particularly important to the founders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://newrelic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NewRelic</a>, the observability platform, has made an acquisition and is launching a new service on the back of it to bring a new dimension into bigger strategy to bring developers and operations closer together. It has acquired <a href="https://www.codestream.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CodeStream</a>, an application that works within integrated developer environments to let developers write related notes to each other alongside the code itself.</p>
<p>NewRelic has integrated it already with NewRelic One, its full-stack data analysis platform covering metrics, events and logs, and will be launching a new service within that called NewRelic CodeStream. It is also announcing a partnership with Microsoft to integrate the new product into its own IDEs and other chat and collaboration products such as VS Code, Visual Studio, Teams and GitHub.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal have not been disclosed except that it was &#8220;competitive&#8221; according to Peter Pezaris, the co-founder and CEO of CodeStream. CodeStream was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/08/codestream-wants-to-move-developer-chat-straight-to-the-source-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of the Y Combinator Winter 2018 cohort</a>, it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/16/codestream-lets-you-collaborate-and-talk-directly-in-vs-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised around $3 million</a>, and was/is being used by tens of thousands of developers, including people at Microsoft, Hearst, Atlassian, Zenefits and a number of others.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221643" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>(It also already worked, as an independent startup, with Visual Studio and VS Code, along with JetBrains. It also supports <span class="bright-bold">pull requests</span><strong> </strong>from GitHub, BitBucket and GitLab, <span class="bright-bold">issue management</span> from Jira, Trello, Asana and 9 others, observability from New Relic One and Pixie, and provides <span class="bright-bold">code discussion</span> that ties it all together, integrated with Slack, MS Teams, email, and in-editor notifications. It seems that all of this will continue to be supported with the Microsoft integrations becoming deeper.)</p>
<p>The combined company will have 750 businesses as customers.</p>
<p>The deal underscores a few trends in the world of DevOps. First, there is some consolidation underfoot, and NewRelic, positioning itself as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/new-relic-launches-developer-platform-to-build-custom-apps-on-top-of-new-relic-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">platform</a>, is looking to bring more functionality into its toolset.</p>
<p>That would also have meant potentially a more challenging sell for CodeStream over time, too, since customers naturally might want to buy observability and communication tools together, as well as see their functionalities become closer over time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Working with <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span> was a no-brainer because of the strategic alignment we saw between our two companies,&#8221; Peter Pezaris, CEO and co-founder of CodeStream, told TechCrunch. &#8220;I am fortunate to have worked with the same team of founders for the past 26 years, having founded, built, and sold four companies in that time. In every case, we have been able to scale more quickly and unlock more value within the larger company, so this is a particularly exciting time for us.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Our team also felt an alignment with <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span>’s values and determined that we could actually accelerate our mission by joining forces with <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span> &#8212; aligning with the resources, team and customer base that <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span> has built-in. Our team at CodeStream was also very impressed with the <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span> One platform, and felt that our solution could make it even better for developers to not only extend code collaboration but also unlock the power of telemetry data and observability right in the IDE.&#8221;</p>
<p>CodeStream also fits into that consolidation mix by giving NewRelic an important entry point into the second trend that this deal touches on.</p>
<p>That second trend is that collaboration is the name of the game these days in enterprise software. That also very much goes for developers, who are working across disparate geographies and often spaces of time on projects, and need better ways of communicating their thinking and additional notes to each other now and in the future.</p>
<p>As Romain pointed out when covering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/16/codestream-lets-you-collaborate-and-talk-directly-in-vs-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CodeStream&#8217;s integration with VS Code</a>, a number of applications now feature &#8220;conversation&#8221; channels for those creating content to talk in more detail in the margins about what is going on, and Slack (or another equivalent) should not have to be the default component for that, and that especially counts if you can build something that specifically suits users&#8217; needs more specifically.</p>
<p>In the case of the new launch today, NewRelic says that those interested in trying out the service can sign up for NewRelic One for a free trial. The CodeStream product allows users not only to write notes to each other in the margins of the code, but to create a stream that will let those reading jump directly from a chat note to the line of code in question.</p>
<p>The third trend is the ongoing expansion of DevOps as a salient category in enterprise software. The move to bigger projects, more developers, new IT architectures and technologies and new security and other challenges has all led to a gradual elevation of developers as a critically important component of how organizations are run and how they grow.</p>
<p>That has in turn led to an ever-growing business for services built to cater to them. NewRelic, citing estimates from Redpoint, says that the observability market alone has a total addressable market of $35 billion and is seeing double-digit growth annually.</p>
<p>“Developer workflows are the backbone of all modern companies, and observability as an engineering practice presents a future where these essential developer workflows are fueled by data  – not mere opinion,” said <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span> CEO Bill Staples in a statement. “To accelerate this shared mission to make observability a data-driven daily practice for every engineer, we are bringing production telemetry and collaboration tools to where developers create and flow — the IDE. By launching <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span> CodeStream and joining forces with Microsoft, we are excited to deliver a truly developer-centric experience to millions of developers across our shared communities.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;DevOps is fundamentally about tightening the orchestration between developers and operations folks,&#8221; added Buddy Brewer, GM of New Relic, in a note to TechCrunch. &#8220;Which is why CodeStream stood out to us. As the leading company working to tackle code collaboration for developers, they’ve made it their mission to get technical teams understanding and communicating more efficiently about their code. With CodeStream, developers can discuss their code right in their development environment and save those discussions to build a referenceable, evolving knowledge base. Normally, developers would engage in a clunkier process of copy/pasting  specific lines of code into Slack, Teams, or whatever chat function they are using, and explaining the context and their question, which creates a ton of friction and time loss across teams.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is also the rationale behind why Microsoft is also teaming up with the company, although to me it does leave a question hanging, which is whether Microsoft will try to get more directly involved in this aspect of developer services itself over time. It would make sense, considering how many environments where it is going to be integrating this particular solution.</p>
<p>“Developers are essential to helping organizations in every industry accelerate the use of <span class="il">new</span> capabilities. Our goal at Microsoft is to provide a wide range of services to address the real-world needs of customers,” said Scott Guthrie, executive vice president, Cloud + AI, Microsoft, in a statement. “With partners like <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span>, it&#8217;s exciting to see comprehensive integration support with <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span> CodeStream, spanning multiple Microsoft platforms and products: VS Code, Visual Studio, .NET, GitHub, Microsoft Teams and Azure DevOps, to name a few. Tighter collaboration between development projects and improved connections between existing applications are just some of the benefits <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span> CodeStream will provide to the developer community.&#8221;</p>

According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/apple-will-force-unvaccinated-office-workers-to-get-tested-daily?sref=10lNAhZ9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the tech giant will start requiring all unvaccinated corporate employees to be tested for COVID-19 every time they have to work in the office instead of working from home. Back in September, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vaccination-status-report-185408210.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">reported</a> that Apple asked employees to share their vaccination status voluntarily. Those who refuse to share their vaccine status will also have to undergo daily testing, while vaccinated office workers will only have to do rapid testing once a week.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s retail store employees, however, won&#8217;t be subjected to daily tests despite having consumer-facing jobs. Unvaccinated staff members are required to be tested twice a week. Like Apple&#8217;s office workers, vaccinated staff will only have to undergo weekly rapid testing. It&#8217;s unclear if the tech giant will ever issue a COVID-19 vaccine mandate, but the Biden administration previously gave all federal contractors a December 8th deadline to require all their employees to be inoculated against the virus. As <em>Bloomberg</em> notes, Apple sells products to the US government.</p>
<p>For now, Apple has reportedly given employees an October 24th deadline to report and show proof of their vaccination status, so it could implement the new rules starting on November 1st. Unvaccinated employees will have to pick-up at-home rapid tests from Apple offices and stores, do the test themselves and then report their results through an internal app.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221665" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify has already invested <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/spotify-continues-its-podcast-shopping-spree/">around $1 billion</a> in podcasting between its acquisitions, exclusive deals, and other partnerships. Now, it wants people to do more than just listen &#8212; it wants them to watch, too. The company announced today it&#8217;s opening up access to a new tool for creators that will allow them to begin publishing their video podcasts to its service. The tool will be provided by the company&#8217;s podcast creation platform Anchor, and expands on <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/spotify-continues-its-podcast-shopping-spree/">the global launch of video podcasts last year</a> which encompassed only a select group of creators.</p>
<p>At the time, Spotify said its debut lineup of video podcasts included Spotify Originals and Exclusives, as well as some third-party podcasts. But there wasn&#8217;t a way for any creator to publish video to the service. Instead, they would have to turn to other video platforms, like YouTube.</p>
<p>Now, that&#8217;s changing. With Anchor, creators will be able to upload their videos through their account, similar to how they create and publish audio episodes today. Once published, fans can listen to the podcasts across platforms, including through the Spotify mobile app, desktop app, web player, and on most smart TVs and game consoles. Creators will also be able to monetize their videos as they do their audio podcasts through the use of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/spotifys-podcasts-subscriptions-service-is-now-open-to-all-u-s-creators/">subscriptions</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221335" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While creators can set their pricing and determine what a subscription includes, Spotify suggests subscriptions could provide access to exclusive video content or even unlock the video portion of the creator&#8217;s podcasts. The video podcasts can also incorporate the creator&#8217;s existing advertising partnerships and soon, they&#8217;ll support the newer <a href="https://anchor.fm/ads">Automated Ads</a>, too.</p>
<p>While Spotify is officially opening up access to Anchor creators, the feature is being rolled out gradually. That means interested creators will have to sign up for a <a href="http://anchor.fm/video">waitlist</a> for the time being.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Spotify&#8217;s video lineup will include video podcasts from its Originals and Exclusives, like The Ringer’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0KsFDwCqXyZS1M8dh0tp76?si=VI_zn5L8QTmwQsi14jStFA&amp;nd=1">Higher Learning with Van Lethan and Rachel Lindsay</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4rOoJ6Egrf8K2IrywzwOMk?si=VO4mgUQhS0umteOlOUSQRg&amp;nd=1">The Joe Rogan Experience</a>; and it will include other video creators who will now publish on Spotify, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClFSU9_bUb4Rc6OYfTt5SPw">Philip DeFranco</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jasminechiswell?lang=en">Jasmine Chiswell</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5l8IBkxX6pgPPfEL6AI57O?si=btHwk1KRRgqQtOL6p_PG2w&amp;nd=1">The WAN Show</a>,<br />
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1zsZEElOM8NBrgVvZ48gsO?si=9mfQm8WuTiqOr-N6yl7qyQ&amp;nd=1">Juicy Scoop with Heather McDonald</a>, and more to come.</p>
<p>Spotify has tried and failed to expand into video in years past. Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/11/spotifys-first-original-videos-are-boring-behind-the-music-cartoons/">first efforts in original video</a> half a decade ago largely flopped, and the company shelved its video plans for some time. But more recently, the company signaled its potential interest in returning to video when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/spotify-is-buying-the-ringer-to-boost-its-sports-podcast-content/">acquired</a> sports network The Ringer, which <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/02/spotify-is-buying-the-ringer-expanding-its-podcast-footprint-and-dipping-its-audio-toes-into-plain-old-text/">came with</a> a YouTube-based video operation. It then went on to make more deals that could translate to video, like the one with <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/addison-rae-podcast-spotify-exclusive-1234709818/">TikTok star, turned Netflix actress, Addison Rae.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The expansion of video to more podcast creators directly follows news that YouTube is now also considering investing further in its own podcasting efforts. Bloomberg this month <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-05/youtube-looks-to-hire-its-first-executive-focused-on-podcasts">reported</a> the company is hiring its first executive focused on podcasts. This may have encouraged Spotify to promote its own video podcasting efforts, even though the actual access to start uploading is still blocked by a waitlist.</p>
<p>Currently, to find video content on Spotify, you&#8217;ll need to navigate to the episode page from the show you want to watch, then hit play to start the episode. From the play bar at the bottom of the screen, you can tap to view the video in full-screen mode. You can then choose to either listen or watch the program, depending on what you&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t yet an easy way to see all the podcasts that are video-enabled, however. Spotify also declined to share how many podcasts would be available as videos at launch, but said it expected to have rolled out access to &#8220;thousands&#8221; by year-end.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three months after announcing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/yummy-raises-4m-aims-to-be-super-app-of-venezuela/">$4 million seed round</a>, Venezuelan delivery super app Yummy is back with an $18 million Series A round that will accelerate the company’s proposed expansion throughout Latin America.</p>
<p>Anthos Capital led the latest round, with additional participation from JAM Fund, whose founder Justin Mateen was an investor in the seed round.</p>
<p>Yummy was started by Vicente Zavarce in 2020 and has amassed over 200,000 registered users so far. He came to the United States for school and stayed to work in marketing roles at Postmates, Wayfair and Getaround before starting Yummy. The app, which includes both delivery and ridesharing, can be downloaded for free, and the company charges a delivery fee or merchant fee.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221113" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>“We can’t wait to be live in every city in Venezuela with both Yummy Delivery and Yummy Rides, and continue our expansion across LatAM,” Zavarce said via email. “We want to become a part of everyone’s daily life and put the local economy in the hands of our users, while creating a way to earn in U.S dollars for thousands of Yummers and drivers.”</p>
<p>The company launched this month in Peru and Chile. Yummy plans to have 50 active dark stores in each country by the end of 2022, touting that it will be able to deliver more than 2,000 products in less than 15 minutes.</p>
<p>It is already processing over 340,000 monthly transactions in Venezuela, with a consistent growth of over 35% for the past four months. Yummy already has a network of over 5,000 drivers across its delivery and ridesharing operation across 12 cities in Venezuela that make this possible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Jenny Fielding, managing director of Techstars and one of the founders of The Fund, said the organization was started in 2018 by a group that pooled its network, capital and resources to take a community-driven approach to angel investing. The Fund overall has invested in 140 companies.</p>
<p>This is The Fund’s first investment vehicle focused on female founders.

<p>On the investment committee for The Fund XX are Ragini Holloway, senior vice president of people at Affirm; Allison Stoloff, an investor at Hanaco Ventures and a former operator with previous roles at Knotel, Oscar and Facebook; Gabriela Isturiz, founder of eBillingHub and Bellefield Systems; and Sylvia Kuyel, vice president of revenue at JumpCloud.</p>
<p>Stoloff says the fund is specific about investing in companies that are not only women-led, but also where women are the CEO.</p>
<p>“They also have to be venture-backable and tech-enabled,” she added. “We believe women are building $1 billion businesses, and we have an advantage in finding them. We get to see deals before venture capitalists, and our secret sauce is our network of LPs that helps us get to know amazing founders.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While it has become easier for someone to become an angel investor, they noticed that women weren’t showing up on top-10 lists of the most active syndicates on investment platforms like AngelList, even though women make up 22% of angel investors, Kuyel said. She believes this suggests that women don’t make as many investments, and when they do, it is in fewer dollars.</p>
<p>The Fund XX is sector-agnostic, and the group has not yet made its first investment. Its focus is building a community that will remove these hurdles and unlock opportunities for both investors and startups, as well as attracting new women to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>“For at least 50% of LPs, this is their first time making an investment,” Stoloff said. “Even though women may not have done this before, they are two times more likely to invest in other women. This is going to have long-term positive effects and bring more women investors into the ecosystem.”</p>
