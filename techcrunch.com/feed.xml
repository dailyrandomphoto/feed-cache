										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a large win for the Korean startup ecosystem, dating powerhouse Match Group <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/match-group-to-acquire-hyperconnect-301225320.html">announced this afternoon</a> that it would buy social networking company Hyperconnect for a combined cash and stock deal valued at $1.73 billion.</p>
<p>Hyperconnect, which is projected to have $200 million in revenue in 2020 (up 50% from 2019) according to the company, offers two apps — Azar and Hakuna Live — which allow users to connect to each other across language barriers. The two are complementary, with Azar focused on one-to-one video chats and Hakuna Live focused on the online live broadcast market. In their press statement, the companies noted that 75% of Hyperconnect’s revenue originates in Asia.</p>
<p>It’s the largest acquisition to date by Match Group, which also owns the popular dating apps Tinder and Hinge along with many other assorted properties.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One theme of the acquisition and Hyperconnect’s story is technology. The company built what it describes as “<a href="https://hyperconnect.com/en/tech/">the first mobile version</a>” of <a href="https://webrtc.org">WebRTC</a>, a now well-developed standard that is designed to offer resilient peer-to-peer connections between users without relying on a company to serve as a middleman server.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="r5Psvy0trb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/28/1123773/">The WebRTC Race Begins Today</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The WebRTC Race Begins Today&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/28/1123773/embed/#?secret=r5Psvy0trb" data-secret="r5Psvy0trb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For instance, a video chat between two participants would be transmitted directly between the two of them using WebRTC, without the video being broadcast through Hyperconnect&#8217;s servers. That&#8217;s designed to improve reliability by removing latency while also reducing the cost of bandwidth for the service to Hyperconnect. WebRTC is now a well-deployed open-source standard, with companies <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/webrtc-the-technology-that-powers-google-meet-hangout-facebook-messenger-and-discord-cb926973d786">such as Google using it in products like Google Meet</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to its innovative work on WebRTC, Hyperconnect built infrastructure to support two users who speak and text in different languages to interact with each other directly through its apps using real-time translation. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/hyperconnect">In a marketing post on Google Cloud</a>, Hyperconnect is a marquee customer of the cloud service’s speech, real-time translation and messaging APIs.</p>
<p>In the companies’ joint press statement, both sides emphasized R&amp;D and engineering as key wins for the deal. That begs the question then what Match Group is looking to build with its massive new purchase? While the group has largely confined itself to dating, live broadcast and other media verticals may well be in its sights once it acquires the technology from Hyperconnect.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close in 2021Q2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://openocean.vc/">OpenOcean</a>, a European VC which has tended to specialise in big data-oriented startups and deep tech, has reach the €92 million ($111.5 million) mark for its third main venture fund, and is aiming for a final close of €130 million by mid-way this year. LPs in the new fund include the European Investment Fund (EIF), Tesi, pension funds, major family offices and Oxford University’s Corpus Christi College.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katya-almasque-vc/?originalSubdomain=uk">Ekaterina Almasque</a> — who has already led investments in IQM (superconducting quantum machines) and <a href="https://jobs.sunrise.io/">Sunrise.io</a> (multi-cloud hyper-converged infrastructure) and is leading the London team and operations for the firm — has been appointed as general partner. Before joining, Almasque was a managing director at Samsung Catalyst Fund in Europe, led investments in Graphcore’s processor for Artificial Intelligence, Mapillary’s layer for rapid mapping and AIMotive’s autonomous driving stack.</p>
<p>The enormous wealth of data in the modern world means the next generation of software is being built at the infrastructure. Thus, the fund said it would invest primarily at the Series A level with initial investments of €3 million to €5 million, across OpenOcean’s principle areas of artificial intelligence, application-driven data infrastructure, intelligent automation and open source.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>OpenOcean’s team includes Michael “Monty” Widenius, the “spiritual father” of MariaDB, and one of the original developers of MySQL, the predecessor to MariaDB; Tom Henriksson, who invested in MySQL and MariaDB; as well as Ralf Wahlsten and Patrik Backman.</p>
<p>Tom Henriksson, general partner at OpenOcean, commented: “Ekaterina… brings an immense amount of expertise to the team and exemplifies the way we want to support our founders. Fund 2020 is an important step for OpenOcean, with prestigious LPs trusting our approach and our knowledge, and believing in our ability to identify the very best data solutions and infrastructure technologies in Europe.”</p>
<p>Almasque said: “The next five years will be critical for digital infrastructure, as breakthrough technologies are currently being constrained by the capabilities of the stack. Enabling this next level of infrastructure innovation is crucial to realising digitisation projects across the economy and will determine what the internet of the future looks like. We’re excited by the potential of world-leading businesses being built across Europe and are looking forward to supporting the next generation of software leaders.”</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch she added: “It&#8217;s very rare to find such a VC so deep in the stack which also invested in one of the first unicorns in Europe and really built the open source ecosystem globally. So for me, this was absolutely an interesting team to join. And what OpenOcean was doing since inception in 2011 was very unique among pioneering ecosystems, such as big data analytics… and it remains very pioneering, pushing the frontiers in artificial intelligence and now quantum computing. This is what really attracts me, and I think there is a very, very big future.”</p>
<p>In an interview Henriksson told me: “What we are seeing is that our economy is shifting more and more towards the digital, data-driven economy. It started with few industries, but now we see a larger shift, including new industries like healthcare, like manufacturing.”</p>
<p>Asked about the effects of the pandemic on the sector, he said: “Obviously we see a lot of startups who are plugging into things like the UiPath platform. This is very relevant for the pandemic. Because the companies that had started automating strongly before the pandemic hit… they&#8217;ve actually accelerated and they find benefits for their teams and organisations and actually the people are happier because they have better automation technologies in place. The ones that didn&#8217;t start before [the pandemic hit] they&#8217;re a little behind now.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA has <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-contract-to-launch-initial-elements-for-lunar-outpost">announced</a> that SpaceX will take two major parts of the Gateway lunar orbiter that will function as a pit stop for future moon missions. The Power and Propulsion Element and Habitation and Logistics Outpost — which together will form the first usable lunar space station — will go up in 2024 on a Falcon Heavy, with an estimated price tag of $332 million.</p>
<p>The Falcon Heavy, which provides a far larger lift capacity than SpaceX&#8217;s now commonly used Falcon 9, has only had two commercial launches since its successful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Bd8lN0gwN0">test launch in early 2018</a> (with Starman and a Tesla Roadster, you may remember). Arabsat-6A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/trifecta-spacex-launches-first-mission-on-falcon-heavy-and-lands-all-three-boosters/">launched in April of 2019</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/spacex-successfully-launches-falcon-heavy-rocket-with-two-flight-proven-booster-cores/">STP-2 a few months later</a>, but since then the Heavy hasn&#8217;t seen any action. (Several missions are planned for the next year, however.)</p>
<p>NASA&#8217;s selection of the launch vehicle as the one that will bring these two crucial components to lunar orbit is a huge endorsement, however, and may actually snowball into more work down the line if the agency&#8217;s own Space Launch System continues to be delayed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The PPE and HALO, as the two pieces are called, provide the essentials for a self-sustaining lunar orbital habitat: essentially the pressurized cabin and the power source that keeps it operational and allows maneuvering. So you could say they&#8217;re fundamental.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also big, and can&#8217;t be sent up in 10 different pieces on smaller rockets. But there are precious few heavy launch vehicles available — and it looks like they decided that SpaceX&#8217;s was the best bet, having flown three successful missions already.</p>
<p>This mission is valued at $332 million in launch and related costs, so it&#8217;s a serious investment that will require a lot of collaboration between SpaceX, NASA, Northrop Grumman (which is building the HALO) and Maxar (making the PPE).</p>

Not particularly roomy, but you can&#8217;t beat the view. Image: NASA</p></div></p>
<p>For now launch is set for no earlier than may of 2024, but that date may (and in fact is highly likely to) slip as various delays accrue. The whole Artemis program is experiencing a period of reality alignment, and while new target dates haven&#8217;t been given for all the ambitious plans made during the last four years, few of the old ones have been repeated the way they were as recently as last fall. Nevertheless even a five or six-year plan to return to the moon&#8217;s surface is still quite ambitious, considering — as has become the standard NASA refrain — &#8220;we&#8217;re going there to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll likely hear more about the new timeline as the agency comes to grips with it itself over the next few months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has upended many aspects of urban life but perhaps the most visible upheaval is to citydwellers&#8217; social lives, with curfews calling time on traditional night life across much of the Western world and social distancing putting a chilly spin on opportunities for getting together with people outside your usual circle. Who knew leaving the house was going to seem like such a mission?</p>
<p>Opportunities to escape the city entirely &#8212; such as by jetting off somewhere &#8212; remain severely limited or even impossible right now, depending on where you live. And for many urbanites COVID-19 may feel as if it&#8217;s turned the advantages of city living on its head, despite lockdowns generally not being as hard-line as they were at times last year and vaccines now (slowly) being rolled out.</p>
<p><a href="https://sharifyapp.com/en/">Sharify</a> is a startup that reckons it can help with the weird flatness of pandemic city living. It&#8217;s a real-time events app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/sharify-la-ciudad-está-viva/id1361789529">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.sharifyapplabs.sharify&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a>) that wants to bring back a little of the serendipitous joy of urban living by making it easier to discovery things going on around you — maybe even just a few blocks away. To do this it&#8217;s combined real-time event listings with a map view (via the medium of emoji-style icons plus filters) to quickly and cheerfully surround you with stuff that&#8217;s happening in the vicinity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CjcOwQ291U"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/23/work-trips-are-making-a-5-billion-comeback/">Work trips are making a $5 billion comeback</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Work trips are making a $5 billion comeback&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/23/work-trips-are-making-a-5-billion-comeback/embed/#?secret=CjcOwQ291U" data-secret="CjcOwQ291U" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Though the business idea predates COVID-19, Sharify isn&#8217;t blind to the changes wrought by the pandemic. And the app displays a star icon next to events that are deemed COVID-19 &#8216;safe’ &#8212; a subtle promotion meaning the organizer has measures in place to reduce the risk of contagion, such as controlling venue capacity, providing disinfectant hand gel and ensuring tables/seating are safety spaced. (Which may well be legal requirements for a venue to be open for business, of course.)</p>
<p>At the same time, the app lets users share their own meeting plan with other users &#8212; potentially encouraging a bunch of strangers to meet up to play some music or hang out in the park or whatnot &#8212; so its appropriateness for the pandemic moment in which we find ourselves does depend on how you use it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s open to social swings or roundabouts, you could say. (And limits on when/how clubs and bars can open may well be pushing a socially oriented and app-savvy demographic toward alternative ways (and tools) to mingle with strangers.)</p>
<p>More broadly, Sharify invites users to rethink the concept of travel and trips &#8212; asking them to refocus their attention and energy on discovering entertaining things to do without having to go far or plan far ahead. Because, well, what else can anyone really do right now? Apart from stay at home ofc.</p>
<p>The app does have two &#8216;view&#8217; modes: One for events geared towards locals and/or a dedicated &#8216;tourist&#8217; view to cater to those wanting to do more typical sightseeing &#8212; though content for the latter is obviously thinner on the ground at the moment. (And, well, &#8216;tourism&#8217; as a concept is starting to feel rather quaint and old-fashioned vs properly exploring your own backyard.)</p>
<p>Officially Sharify is launched in Barcelona, Madrid and New York City &#8212; but says it&#8217;s &#8220;expanding quickly&#8221; and touts being &#8220;present&#8221; in 25+ cities around the world (presumably with a lighter events cadence vs those three).</p>
<p>I tested the app in Barcelona and quickly found a bunch of local events that looked interesting &#8212; at least compared to another night of thumbing through the Netflix catalogue &#8212; from a Banksy art exhibition, to a stand up comedy show (in English!), lots of theatre, a bunch of markets, yoga classes and a skateboarding event all going on within, at most, a couple of miles and days from where I&#8217;ve been spending the vast majority of my time for, like, almost a whole entire year.</p>
<p>Just the act of seeing stuff <em>still going on</em> in a city which, frankly, hasn&#8217;t felt very familiar or open for much of anything for close to 12 months was a bit of an eye opener.</p>

<p>After so much time locked down indoors maybe we all need a bit of a nudge/visual reminder that life is still going on &#8212; and socializing is still possible (with appropriate safety measures and distancing) &#8212; beyond the front door and away from the Zoom screen (or any other screen tbh). Even if I&#8217;m not about to sign up for everything I spotted in the app. But feeling like I <em>could</em> is almost exciting enough.</p>
<p>As well as providing key details about each event (when, where, any website etc), Sharify lets you signal an intent to go that&#8217;s visible to other users by &#8216;joining&#8217; an event. It also hosts per event chat where those who have joined are invited to &#8220;talk to people who join the plan&#8221; &#8212; which is another neat little nudge to get users excited about going to a local thing, maybe without their usual friend group in tow.</p>
<p>Sharify isn&#8217;t disclosing how many users it has but it says it has 100,000+ monthly event views (3K+ daily), and 5,000+ events every month. (On Google Play the app has had 10,000+ installs.)</p>
<p>Where users create their own plans to advertise to others it touts an impressively high &#8220;join&#8221; rate of 95%. (Albeit saying you&#8217;re going to something you found via an app isn&#8217;t the same as actually turning up.)</p>
<p>To encourage users to discover and attend others&#8217; events, Sharify displays a smilie face on the map in locations where several people are up for &#8216;sharing plans&#8217; &#8212; listing the number of people theoretically up for joining in stuff around there and nudging you to &#8216;create a plan in this area&#8217; to tap into that potential guest pool.</p>
<p>It also lets you drill down to check out micro profiles of these (public) socially interested locals &#8212; displaying a first name, perhaps a photo and any &#8216;interests&#8217; if they&#8217;ve chosen to select some from its curated lists of culture, hobbies, sports and social activities etc. (Happily there&#8217;s no option to message individual users via their profile so no fear of stupid in-app spam.)</p>
<p>Location-based and social sharing is not new, of course. Indeed, it’s an idea that&#8217;s been around the tech block so many times the sound of a &#8216;real-time events map&#8217; probably triggers a fuzzy feeling of &#8216;haven&#8217;t I seen this before somewhere?’ The deja vu may be real but context is ever shifting, is the point. Or, to put it another way, here and now, in an open-ended pandemic, going about finding something to do probably looks and feels quite a bit different to how you did it, pre-March 2020.</p>
<p>Put simply: Best laid plans are toast. Friends who don&#8217;t live in the same city are likely reachable only on Zoom or by text. And at very least you’re dealing with hard limits on how far you can range for your entertainment in time and space.</p>
<p>Local and/or virtual is the new global, all of a sudden. So Sharify reckons its real-time events map is just the ticket/tonic in this curtailed context &#8212; by cheerfully surrounding you with nearby stuff to do. The 2017-founded startup says it&#8217;s been growing &#8220;despite&#8221; the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re stuck at home, and we saw all the Netflix series. Is there any plan near my home for this afternoon? Event agendas simply don&#8217;t work in this user case. That&#8217;s why we built a real-time map,&#8221; says co-founder and CEO Gemma Prenafeta. &#8220;And the problem we will face in some months from now: I&#8217;m not stuck at home anymore. Where do I find new events easily?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As Sharify is a collaborative platform, we let people share their own events for free, we scrape different event sources such as Google and Tiqets, and we highlight those businesses that want to promote themselves,&#8221; she adds, giving a succinct explainer on how the app populates the map view with stuff to do.</p>
<p>Social maps aren&#8217;t new, of course &#8212; and features like Snap Map, which was added to Snap&#8217;s social network via its acquisition of Zenly, certainly has a bit of overlap (while Sharify&#8217;s smiley octopus logo on a yellow background has more than a little of Snap&#8217;s ghost in look and feel), though Snap Map is more obviously focused on friends&#8217; location and social sharing vs Sharify being about event discovery, first and foremost. (Friends may follow from this real-life socializing, is the suggestion.)</p>
<p>There are also event discovery network startups (like calendar-focused IRL). But, again, with such a glance-friendly map view, Sharify is paying closer attention to immediacy/hyper-local event discovery vs IRL &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/streaming-events-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/streaming-events-calendar/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612983354970000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2ZAgydUaVguFCdskQ8rbG150y3A">pivoted to helping people surface virtual events</a> as the pandemic shuttered lots of real world events last year and has since focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/now-with-over-10m-monthly-users-irl-turns-its-events-website-into-a-social-network/">building out its own social network</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Now with over 10M monthly users, IRL turns its events website into a social network&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/now-with-over-10m-monthly-users-irl-turns-its-events-website-into-a-social-network/embed/#?secret=gIU6tzq8Mm" data-secret="gIU6tzq8Mm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;immediacy&#8217; factor is key at Sharify, as you can see what&#8217;s happening, in real-time,&#8221; says Prenafeta. &#8220;We say going to a local event is a kind of &#8216;Local Trip&#8217;. Traveling before was about taking flights, now it&#8217;s about taking a Bird or a eCooltra to an event nearby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether mapping real-time events is a standalone business or a feature/tool that could just be added to a dominant platform/social network is perhaps a more pressing question for this fledgling startup. And it&#8217;s notable that tech (and mapping) giant Google added a &#8216;Community Feed&#8217; to Maps late <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-maps-takes-on-facebook-with-its-own-news-feed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-maps-takes-on-facebook-with-its-own-news-feed/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612983354970000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGvMhNyTTXE8I0LwcjFbb4BXX__JQ">last year</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook has also had an &#8216;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/events/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612983354970000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGeY3dtzOSQTWT1x__S1Q5FpMimIw">Events Near Me</a>&#8216; feature on its platform for years. Albeit, anything listed inside its walled garden has to contend with all the baggage Facebook brings with it. So an indie app with a fresh approach should have a chance to attract users who wouldn&#8217;t be caught dead on Facebook (even in a pandemic).</p>
<p>Sharify has certainly come up with a really effortless way to spark a sense of possibility &#8212; to <em>feel</em> like you can cut through the monotony of lockdown life &#8212; just by firing up a super simple overview of stuff going on around you.</p>
<p>It then layers on some more powerful tools that are designed to help you find others to do stuff with, which adds a subtle but maybe deeper hook in these socially distanced times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Life is still pretty locked down, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s more important than ever to know what&#8217;s open and what isn&#8217;t, close to our house,&#8221; suggests Prenafeta. And, well, it&#8217;s pretty hard to argue with that.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s looking beyond the pandemic too &#8212; back to more normalcy and anticipating helping local businesses announce their reopenings, once that&#8217;s possible. The team is &#8220;currently working on a seed investment round to prepare for the post-pandemic momentum&#8221;, she says.</p>
<p>So far the Barcelona-based startup has raised a pre-seed and an angel round led by IESE Group, per Prenafeta &#8212; with a total of €501,000 (~$600k) invested to date into what has turned out to be a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/23/location-vs-communication/">contextually fresh twist</a> on the old <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/24/die-solomo-die/?_ga=2.181080743.1271714929.1612696774-1757155993.1533833482">SoMoLo</a> trend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hyundai Motor Group is back with a new &#8220;walking car&#8221; robot that can use its wheels to roll along a path or stand up and navigate tougher terrain on its legs. This time, the concept is designed to carry cargo and is small enough to be carried by a drone.</p>
<p>The TIGER robot — short for transforming intelligent ground excursion robot — is the first &#8220;uncrewed&#8221; ultimate mobility vehicle (UMV) concept to come out of New Horizons Studio, the Mountain View, California facility that is home to Hyundai Motor Group&#8217;s UMV development. Tiger follows in the wheeled-footsteps of Elevate, a larger concept vehicle designed to carry people that the company unveiled in 2019 at the CES tech trade show.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111210" style="width: 1182px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111210" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2111210 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg" alt="Hyundai walking elevate robot" width="1172" height="649" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg 1172w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1172px) 100vw, 1172px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2111210" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot/Hyundai</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While concepts don&#8217;t always translate into real products, New Horizons Studio head John Suh told TechCrunch that his aim is to bring Tiger to life &#8220;as soon as possible,&#8221; adding that it would likely be a five-year process.</p>
<p>Suh said the team will spend the next two years focused on solving some core technical problems to establish a baseline design. In 2023 and 2024, the team will get to the beta-product stage and advanced testing will begin before finally becoming a product customers can buy.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s version of the Tiger is based on a modular platform architecture, just like its larger cousin. The robot has a leg and wheel locomotion system, 360-degree directional control, a storage bay that can carry goods and a range of sensors for remote observation. It&#8217;s also designed to connect to a drone, which can charge the robot while flying it to its destination.</p>
<p>The Tiger has two modes that are deployed depending on the terrain. On smoother, less complex surfaces, the robot&#8217;s legs retract and the vehicle uses all four wheels to move. If the vehicle gets stuck or faces an obstacle like a small wall, berm or log, it can stand up, lock the wheels and then walk.</p>
<p>This is the first version of Tiger — known as X-1 for experimental — suggesting New Horizons will be bringing out more variants in the future. This one was created in partnership with engineering design software company Autodesk and concept design firm Sundberg-Ferar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What, you are no doubt asking, is a worm a blob? Well, it’s a blob of worms, obviously. More specifically, it’s a blob of California blackworms. It’s not a flock, nor a swam nor a school. It’s a big, undulating mass of a Lumbriculus variegatus tangled up, but somehow moving as one.</p>
<p>Roboticists, of course, have a long, storied history of drawing inspiration from nature. This time out, a team <a href="https://www.newswise.com/articles/collective-worm-and-robot-blobs-protect-individuals-swarm-together?ta=home">at Georgia Tech</a> studied the aforementioned worm blob in hopes of learning gaining insight into its unusual form of locomotion. The researchers believe they can apply some of the learnings to rethink the way robots move.</p>
<p>The team published its findings in an academic journal earlier this month. According to the research, the blobs &#8212; which range from 10 to 50,000 individual organisms &#8212; are a kind of survival mechanism to adapt to things like changing temperatures. A few individuals are capable of moving the larger group, with around two or three being required to move a group of five.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed-vimeo embed breakout embed--video" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/510314087" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The researchers set up a series of six 3D-printed robots with two arms and two light sensors a piece. Mesh and pins on the arms allowed the robots to become entangled with one another.</p>
<p>“Depending on the intensity, the robots try to move away from the light,” researcher Yasemin Ozkan-Aydin said in a release tied to the news. While there was no direct communication between the robots, they effectively operated as a group. “They generate emergent behavior that is similar to what we saw in the worms.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111163" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111163" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2111163" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111163" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Georgia Tech</p></div></p>
<p>The scientists think that sort of collective action can be applied to make individual robots more collaborative and cohesive units. “Often people want to make robot swarms do specific things, but they tend to be operating in pristine environments with simple situations,” Professor Daniel Goldman says of the research. “With these blobs, the whole point is that they work only because of physical interaction among the individuals. That’s an interesting factor to bring into robotics.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reddit raises more funding, Shopify expands payments to Facebook and a study suggests that the Apple Watch might be able to predict COVID diagnoses. This is your Daily Crunch for February 9, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Reddit raises $250M</strong></p>
<p>This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/reddit-raises-250-million-in-series-e-funding/">latest funding announcement</a> comes after Reddit has returned to the headlines, with the WallStreetBets subreddit playing a crucial role in the spectacular rise and fall of GameStop shares (along with other stocks). The company also ran a five-second Super Bowl ad on Sunday, consisting of a single static image.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reddit announced the round in a blog post that said the money comes from “existing and new investors&#8221; and will allow the company to &#8220;make strategic investments in Reddit including video, advertising, consumer products and expanding into international markets.”</p>
<p><strong>The tech giants</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/shopify-expands-its-payment-option-shop-pay-to-its-merchants-on-facebook-and-instagram/">Shopify expands its payment option, Shop Pay, to its merchants on Facebook and Instagram</a> — This is the first time Shop Pay will be made available outside of Shopify’s own platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/cd-projekt-red-hit-by-ransomware-attack-refuses-to-pay-ransom/">CD Projekt hit by ransomware attack, refuses to pay ransom</a> — “We have already secured our IT infrastructure and begun restoring data,” the game company said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Amazon, Microsoft and IBM have each elevated people who ran their cloud divisions to the CEO role.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Amazon announced last week that founder and CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">Jeff Bezos planned to step back</a> from overseeing operations and shift into an executive chairman role, it also revealed that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/"> AWS CEO Andy Jassy</a>, head of the company&#8217;s profitable cloud division, would replace him.</p>
<p>As Bessemer partner Byron Deeter <a href="https://twitter.com/bdeeter/status/1356806032836628483?s=20">pointed out on Twitter</a>, Jassy&#8217;s promotion was similar to Satya Nadella&#8217;s ascent at Microsoft: in 2014, he moved from executive VP in charge of Azure <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/04/microsofts-new-ceo-is-officially-satya-nadella/">to the chief exec&#8217;s office</a>. Similarly, Arvind Krishna, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/incoming-ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-faces-monumental-challenges-on-multiple-fronts/">who was promoted to replace Ginni Rometti</a> as IBM CEO last year, also was formerly head of the company&#8217;s cloud business.</p>
<p>Could Nadella&#8217;s successful rise serve as a blueprint for Amazon as it makes a similar transition? While there are major differences in the missions of these companies, it&#8217;s inevitable that we will compare these two executives based on their former jobs. It&#8217;s true that they have an awful lot in common, but there are some stark differences, too.</p>
<h2>Replacing a legend</h2>
<p>For starters, Jassy is taking over for someone who founded one of the world&#8217;s biggest corporations. Nadella replaced Steve Ballmer, who had taken over for the company&#8217;s face, Bill Gates. Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says this notable difference could have a huge impact for Jassy with his founder boss still looking over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of similarity in the two situations, but Satya was a little removed from the founder Gates. Bezos will always hover and be there, whereas Gates (and Ballmer) had retired for good. [ … ] It was clear [they] would not be coming back. [ … ] For Jassy, the owner could [conceivably] come back anytime,&#8221; Mueller said.</p>

<p>But Andrew Bartels, an analyst at Forrester Research, says it&#8217;s not a coincidence that both leaders were plucked from the cloud divisions of their respective companies, even if it was seven years apart.</p>
<p>&#8220;In both cases, these hyperscale business units of Microsoft and Amazon were the fastest-growing and best-performing units of the companies. [ … ] In both cases, cloud infrastructure was seen as a platform on top of which and around which other cloud offerings could be developed,&#8221; Bartels said. The companies both believe that the leaders of these two growth engines were best suited to lead the company into the future.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://matefertility.com/">Mate Fertility</a>, the new Los Angeles startup launching today with $2.8 million in financing, has a mission to create a more inclusive network of family planning services for people struggling with the high cost and low availability of fertility clinics around the country.</p>
<p>Founded by serial entrepreneur Oliver Bogner and his brother Gabriel, Mate was born from both brothers&#8217; struggles with trying to start a family. For Oliver, that was when he and his partner were looking at IVF as a way to screen for the BRCA1 gene from her embryos after she found out that she was a carrier. Meanwhile, Gabriel, an IVF baby who is a member of the LGBTQ community, felt that the services for family planning weren&#8217;t always accepting of the gay community.</p>
<p>&#8220;IVF<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and surrogacy were the only options for me to have kids,&#8221; the younger Bogner said. &#8220;And the queer community has been locked out of these services. It became my mission to democratize healthcare for my community.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once Oliver started doing research into the market and discovered that there were only 460 fertility clinics in the U.S. and that over 80% were concentrated in five major metropolitan areas, he knew there was an opportunity for a new business.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111177" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111177" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2111177" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111177" class="wp-caption-text">Mate Fertility co-founders Gabriel and Oliver Bogner. Image Credit: Mate Fertility</p></div></p>
<p>The Bogner brothers enlisted famed reproductive endocrinologist Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg, who trained under the British doctors that pioneered In Vitro Fertilization, to come on board and together the three men launched Mate Fertility.</p>
<p>The co-founders have enlisted an impressive array of financiers to back their business, boasting an investor base that includes Andy Dunn, the founder of Bonobos; Peter Pham, the co-founder of the LA-based consumer-focused company incubator, Science; Patrick Schwarzenegger; Brian Schwartz; the investors behind Roman, Allbirds and Caspar, Rosecliff Ventures; Pure Imagination Brands; Mana Ventures; and Maschmeyer Group Ventures.</p>
<p>Mate is launching first in Oklahoma City, where two legacy providers are charging anywhere from 10% to 15% above the national average for family planning services. &#8220;We&#8217;re going in at anywhere from 50% to 60% lower costs than they are,&#8221; said Oliver Bogner.</p>
<p>The company said it would offer egg freezing services for as low as $5,000 and IVF for $9,400*, while the national average for IVF cycle costs ranges from $15,000 to $18,000, including medication.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re still making healthy margins that allow us to operate the business. It’s not a matter of these procedures costing more. These 460 clinics are allowed to radically mark up the process,&#8221; said the elder Bogner. &#8220;One of these clinics is making approximately 1,000% profit margin on every procedure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Given the fact that the company estimates roughly 18% of the U.S. population will face some fertility issue, the need for more clinics &#8212; setting aside the lower costs &#8212; would be enormous.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We need 3,000 clinics to properly serve our population; today we have 460. There’s a huge gap in care,&#8221; said Bogner. </span></p>
<p>The company is working with the architects behind Dry Bar, Heitler Houstoun, to design its clinics in an effort to popularize and destigmatize the services.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were really intrigued by Oliver and Gabe. In terms of what the biggest risks are… you’re not playing around. You’re not creating software, you’re creating life,&#8221; said Adam Struck, the founder of Mate Fertility&#8217;s lead investment firm, Struck Capital. &#8220;The ultimate KPI which is success rate for our patients is top tier. There’s a lot that Mate is doing to ensure that some of the best medical personnel in the world are part of the Mate mission.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Mate Fertility offers modern EHR platforms, an e-pharmacy, proven protocols, payment assistance and digital patient and provider portals for services that include IVF, genetic screening, egg freezing, surrogacy and LGBTQ family building treatments, the company said.</p>
<p>Its first locations will be clinics in Oklahoma City, Anchorage, Alaska; Bakersfield, California; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Austin, Texas; and Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>*An earlier version of this story cited the company&#8217;s IVF price as $8,000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Although the popular audio chat platform <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a> today includes a way to share your upcoming hangouts and events across social media, the resulting link that displays is fairly boring. A new link-sharing tool called <a href="https://clublink.to/">ClubLink</a> can help. The tool allows hosts to better promote their events by offering a more customized social media preview featuring a photo that includes the room name, who&#8217;s attending, the date and time (using the host&#8217;s time zone) and even profile icons of the hosts themselves.</p>
<p>The tool was built by two Germany-based colleagues, online marketer <a href="https://twitter.com/Jens_Polo">Jens Polomski</a> and coder and digital marketer, <a href="https://twitter.com/spekulatius1984">Peter Thaleikis.</a></p>
<p>Polomski says he came up with the idea last month because he kept seeing Clubhouse links shared on Twitter and thought they just didn&#8217;t look that good.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I noticed many people share &#8212; especially on Twitter &#8212; because Clubhouse has this built-in sharing feature,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But the preview image is not well-optimized and lacks any relevant information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polomski reached out to Thaleikis and convinced him to help build a better version.</p>
<p>Their resulting <a href="https://clublink.to/">ClubLink</a> tool is simple to use. You just paste in your Clubhouse event link on the ClubLink website, and it automatically generates the ClubLink you can use. It&#8217;s a similar process as to how URL shorteners like tinyurl.com work, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111124" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111124" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111124" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="496" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg 2186w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=768,560 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=680,496 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1120 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1493 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111124" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ClubLink</p></div></p>
<p>In ClubLink&#8217;s case, though, it&#8217;s doing a bit more than just returning a shorter URL. The tool visits the Clubhouse link provided and takes a screenshot to help create the image &#8212; but it&#8217;s not scraping data from Clubhouse, Polomski says. The tool also renames the image file it creates to include the host&#8217;s name for better discoverability and, perhaps, for better search engine optimization in the future.</p>
<p>In fact, the SEO aspects of the ClubLink URLs were considered when the tool was built, given its creators have digital marketing backgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re taking care that the technical SEO background from the links are as good as possible &#8212; and that&#8217;s something Clubhouse, right now, didn&#8217;t do,&#8221; notes Polomski. However, he notes that it&#8217;s too soon to tell how well those efforts have paid off, as the first ClubLink URLs were just launched last week and only a few have been indexed by Google so far.</p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve created the link on the ClubLink website, you&#8217;re directed to a page where you have the option to immediately share it out to Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Being able to publicize your rooms in advance is a important way to build a following on the audio-based social network, so likely many hosts will begin to put this new tool to use in the days ahead.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one example of a ClubLink in action:</p>

<p>Of course, sharing a link while you&#8217;re in a room is useful too &#8212; especially if you&#8217;ve landed in a great room you think others should know about. Clubhouse, in its most recent update, noted that you&#8217;re now able to click the &#8220;+&#8221; sign while in a room to get a link that you can post to social media. Unfortunately, these &#8220;room&#8221; links don&#8217;t work yet in the ClubLink tool, but the team said they&#8217;re already discussing a solution for that.</p>
<p>ClubLink is one of now several small tools that&#8217;s popped up in recent days to offer expanded functionality and new features for Clubhouse power users.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also come across the Clubhouse Bio Creator at <a href="https://clubhousebio.xyz/">clubhousebio.xyz</a>, which helps people perfect their profile bio on the desktop, then copy it over to Clubhouse on their phone. Other popular tools help users make their profile picture stand out, like <a href="https://www.clubhouseglow.com/">Clubhouse Glow</a>, <a href="https://avatar.lvwzhen.com/">Clubhouse Avatar Maker</a> and <a href="https://www.thriveepic.com/clubhouse">Thriveepic</a>&#8216;s Canva template.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Last year, in the midst of a particularly spiky U.S. presidential election campaign, a startup called <a href="http://sentropy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentropy</a> emerged <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/sentropy-emerges-from-stealth-with-an-ai-platform-to-tackle-online-abuse-backed-by-13m-from-initialized-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from stealth with an AI-based platform</a> aimed at social media and other companies that corralled people together for online conversation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sentropy had built a set of algorithms, using natural language processing and machine learning, to help these platforms detect when abusive language, harassing tendencies and other harmful content was coming around the bend, and to act on those situations before they became an issue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today, the startup is unveiling a new product, now aimed at consumers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Using the same technology that it originally built for its enterprise platform, <a href="https://protect.sentropy.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentropy Protect</a> is a free consumer product that detects harmful content on a person&#8217;s social media feed and, by way of a dashboard, lets a person have better control over how that content and the people producing it are handled.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Starting initially with Twitter, the plan is to add more social feeds over time, based initially on which services provide APIs to let Sentropy integrate with them (not all do.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sentropy CEO John Redgrave said the consumer product launch is not a pivot but an expansion of what the company is building.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The idea is that Sentropy will continue to work with enterprise customers &#8212; its two products in that department are called <span class="il">Sentropy</span> Detect, which provides API-based access to its abuse detection technologies; and <span class="il">Sentropy</span> Defend, a browser-based interface that enables end-to-end moderation workflows for moderators.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But at the same time, the Protect consumer product will give people an added option &#8212; whether or not Sentropy is being used by a particular platform &#8212; to take the reins and have more hands-on control over their harassment graph, as it were.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We always had deep conviction of going after the enterprise as a start, but Sentropy is about more than that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Cyber safety has to have both enterprise and consumer components.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s refreshing to hear about startups building services that potentially affect millions of people also being cognizant of how individuals themselves want to keep an element of self-determination in the equation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s not just, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s your choice if you use service X or not,&#8221; but a grasp of the concept that when someone chooses to use a service, especially a popular one, there should be and can be more than just a hope that the platform will always be looking out for that user&#8217;s best interests, by providing tools to help the user do that, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And it&#8217;s not a problem that is going away, and that goes not just for the hottest platforms today, which are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/tiktok-expands-community-guidelines-rolls-out-new-well-being-focused-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">continuing to look for ways to handle complex content</a> &#8212; but also on emerging platforms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The recent popularity of Clubhouse, for example, highlights not just new frontiers in social platforms, but how, for example, those new models &#8212; with Clubhouse based on &#8220;rooms&#8221; for conversations and a reliance on audio rather than written text for interactions &#8212; are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/as-tech-darling-clubhouse-grows-so-does-scrutiny" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">handling issues of harassment and abuse</a>. Some striking examples so far point to the problem being one that definitely needs addressing before it grows any bigger.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Protect is free to use today, and Redgrave said that Sentropy is still working on deciding how and if it will charge for it. One likely scenario will be that Protect might come in freemium tiers: a free and limited product for individuals with &#8220;pro&#8221; services featuring enhanced tools, and perhaps a tier for companies who are managing accounts on behalf of one or several high-profile individuals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, services like Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, YouTube and many others have made a big point over the years &#8212; and especially recently &#8212; to put in more rules, moderators and automated algorithms to help identify and stop abusive content in its tracks, and to help users report and stop content before it gets to them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But if you are one of the people who gets targeted regularly, or even occasionally, you know that this is often not enough. Sentropy Protect seems to be built with that mindset in mind, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Indeed, Redgrave said that even though the company had consumers on its roadmap all along, its strategy was accelerated after the launch of its enterprise product last year in June. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We started getting pinged by people saying, &#8216;I get abused online. How can I get access to your technology?'&#8221; He recalled that the company realized that the problem was at once bigger and more granular than Sentropy could fix simply by working its way through a list of companies, hoping to win them over as customers, and then successfully integrating its product.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We had a hard decision to make then,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;Do we spend 100% of our time focused on enterprises, or do we take a portion of our team and start to build out something for consumers, too?&#8221; It decided to take the latter route.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the enterprise side, Sentropy is continuing to work with social networks and other kinds of companies that host interactions between people &#8212; for example, message boards connected to gaming experiences or dating apps. It&#8217;s not publicly disclosing any customer names at the moment, but Redgrave describes them as primarily smaller, fast-growing businesses, as opposed to larger and more legacy platforms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sentropy&#8217;s VP of product, Dev Bala &#8212; who has previously been an academic, and also worked at Facebook, Google and Microsoft &#8212; explained that bigger, legacy platforms are not outside of Sentropy&#8217;s remit. But more often than not, they are working on bigger trust and safety strategies and have small armies of engineers in-house working on building products.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While larger social networks do bring in third-party technology for certain aspects of their services, those deals will typically take longer to close, even in urgent cases such as around working with online abuse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;I think abuse and harassment are rapidly evolving to be an existential challenge for the likes of Facebook, Reddit, YouTube and the rest,&#8221; Bala said. &#8220;These companies will have a 10,000 person organization thinking <em>just</em> about trust and safety, and the world is seeing the ills of not doing that. What&#8217;s not as obvious to people on the outside is that they are also taking a portfolio approach, with armies of moderators and a portfolio of technology. Not all is built in-house.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We believe there is value from Sentropy for these bigger guys but also know there are a lot of optics around companies using products like ours. So we see the opportunities of going earlier, in cases where the company in question is not a Facebook, and having a less sophisticated approach.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a sign of the changing tides and sentiment in the market. It seems that the tackling of abuse and content is starting to get taken seriously as a business concept. And so Sentropy is not the only company tackling this opportunity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Two other startups &#8212; one called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/spectrum-labs-raises-10m-for-its-ai-based-platform-to-combat-online-toxicity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectrum Labs</a>, and another called <a href="https://l1ght.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">L1ght</a> — have also built a set of AI-based tools aimed at various platforms where conversations are happening to help those platforms detect and better moderate instances of toxicity, harassment and abuse.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spectrum Labs raises $10M for its AI-based platform to combat online toxicity&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/spectrum-labs-raises-10m-for-its-ai-based-platform-to-combat-online-toxicity/embed/#?secret=X9piSctN3D" data-secret="X9piSctN3D" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">Another, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/block-party-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Block Party</a>, is also looking to work across different social platforms to give users more control over how toxicity touches them, and has, like Sentropy, focused first on Twitter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Protect, after content is detected and flagged, users can set up wider, permanent blocks against specific users (who can also be muted through Protect) or themes, manage filtered words, and monitor content that gets automatically flagged for being potentially abusive, in case you want to override the flags and create &#8220;trusted&#8221; users. Tweets get labelled when they are snagged by Sentropy by the type of abuse (for example, threat of physical violence, sexual aggression or identity attacks).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since it&#8217;s based on a machine-learning platform, Sentropy then takes all of those signals, including the tweets that have been flagged and uses them to teach Protect to identify future content along those same lines. The platform is also monitoring chatter on other platforms all the time, and that too feeds into what it looks for and moderates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you&#8217;re familiar with Twitter&#8217;s own abuse protection, you&#8217;ll know that all this takes the situation several steps further than the controls Twitter itself provides.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">This is still a version one though. Right now, you don&#8217;t see your full timeline through Protect, so essentially it means that you toggle between Protect and whatever Twitter client you are using. Some might find that onerous, although on the other hand Bala noted that a sign of Sentropy&#8217;s success is that people will actually let it work in the background and you won&#8217;t feel the need to constantly check in.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Redgrave also noted that the service is still exploring how to add in other features, such as the ability to also filter direct messages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Audi revealed Tuesday the 2022 e-tron Quattro GT and its higher-performing sibling the RS e-tron GT — flagships of the German automaker&#8217;s growing electric vehicle portfolio and its first departure from the crossovers and SUVs that have so far dominated the lineup.</p>
<p>The Audi e-tron GT and RS are the third and fourth all-electric vehicles in the company&#8217;s U.S. portfolio, following the 2018 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/the-audi-e-tron-suv-is-an-electric-shot-at-tesla/">e-tron SUV</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/audis-next-all-electric-vehicle-the-e-tron-sportback-is-a-coupe-suv/">e-tron Sportback</a> that debuted in 2019. The Audi Q4 e-tron — another SUV — will be the automaker&#8217;s fifth electric vehicle. All of these e-tron models are part of Audi&#8217;s plan to launch more than 30 electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids by 2025.</p>
<p>&#8220;This car is a new, very progressive interpretation of the classical GT,&#8221; <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">Marc Lichte, head of Audi design, said in Tuesday&#8217;s presentation.</span> &#8220;That means proportions like a super sports car, and the usability of a real four-seater. And that&#8217;s something completely new.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2111035" style="width: 4971px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111035" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2111035 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg" alt="audi gt" width="4961" height="3310" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg 4961w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4961px) 100vw, 4961px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2111035" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Audi</p></div></p>
<p>The e-tron GT, which goes into production this spring and will hit the U.S. market this summer, packs in performance and luxury in its sporty package. The base e-tron GT has two motors that produce the equivalent of 469 horsepower — or 522 hp with &#8220;overboost&#8221; — and can travel an estimated 238 miles on the 93.4-kilowatt battery. Under the European WLTP standard, the e-tron GT range is 298 miles.</p>
<p>The RS e-tron has the same front motor as the entry-level GT, but has a more powerful rear motor. Together, the motors can produce 590 horsepower and up to 637 horsepower with overboost. As a result, the RS e-tron GT can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.1 seconds and has a 155 mph top track speed, the company said. The RS has an estimated EPA range of 232 miles.</p>
<p>The company has yet to receive an official EPA estimate for either variant.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The vehicles also have an 800-volt electrical architecture — the same that is in the Porsche Taycan. That architecture allows the e-tron GT, like the Taycan, to replenish its battery from 5% to 80% in 22.5 minutes, one of the quickest charging rates in the industry. </span></p>
<p>The e-tron GT shares more than just the <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">800-volt electrical architecture with Porsche. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Audi and Porsche, which are both </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">VW Group companies, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">co-developed the e-tron GT and the Taycan. The two vehicles also have the same chassis and J1 EV battery platform. </span></p>
<p>Inside, the e-tron GT comes standard with a 12.3-inch Audi virtual cockpit digital instrument cluster and a central 10.1-inch touchscreen, where drivers can control music, navigation and other controls as well as electric vehicle-specific features such as searching for charging stations. Owners can opt for an upgrade and add a head-up display as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111042" style="width: 4971px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111042" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2111042 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg" alt="audi etron gt" width="4961" height="3243" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg 4961w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg?resize=768,502 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg?resize=680,445 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg?resize=1536,1004 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg?resize=2048,1339 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4961px) 100vw, 4961px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2111042" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Audi</p></div></p>
<p>The vehicle also comes standard in a leather-free interior featuring recycled materials, including an artificial suede called Dinamica, although a Nappa leather option is also available as an upgrade.</p>
<p>All of this performance and luxury comes at a price. The base model of the e-tron GT quattro starts at $99,900, followed by a higher trim level priced at $107,100. The RS e-tron GT starts at $139,900. Those prices push even higher for those that opt for the additional features, notably the company&#8217;s Matrix LED headlights, which are only available in Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aerion has been working on ushering in a new era of commercial supersonic flight for nearly a decade now, and the company just revealed that it has signed a new partnership with NASA to put that experience to use in the pursuit of supersonic point-to-point travel &#8212; the technical name for putting to use the kind of high-speed flight typically associated with space launches for helping people move very quickly from one place on Earth to another.</p>
<p>The new collaboration comes via the Space Act Agreement, which basically allows NASA to enlist the aid of private companies to help it achieve its various goals. NASA has been developing high-Mach, supersonic aircraft technologies for some time now, in particular through its arrangement with Lockheed Martin to build and fly the X-59 QueSST, a demonstrator aircraft that will show how supersonic craft can also operate relatively quietly, with so-called &#8220;low-boom&#8221; capabilities that avoid the loud sonic booms produced by most supersonic vehicles when they break the sound barrier.</p>
<p>NASA announced a similar partnership under the Space Act Agreement with Virgin Galactic last year, with the goal of helping the agency develop technologies that will assist in the eventual deployment of sustainable supersonic commercial flight. Aerion&#8217;s team-up with the agency will focus specifically on studying commercial flight capabilities in speeds ranging between Mach 3 and Mach 5, with a focus on propulsion and thermal management systems, power generation and technologies for use in the passenger and crew cabins.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Aerion&#8217;s own high-speed commercial aviation efforts are currently on track to see its AS2 private jet for business customers enter production in 2023, which will set the stage for its AS3 commercial supersonic passenger aircraft to follow after that.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t Aerion&#8217;s first team-up with NASA: The two have collaborated twice previously on similar projects, with the first collaboration begun way back in 2012. Now that Aerion&#8217;s closer to actual production, it&#8217;s likely that both partners will gain a lot toward their mutual goals of helping the U.S. develop commercially viable and sustainable supersonic passenger flight technologies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a popular misconception that the cryptocurrency industry is a realm of rogue tech-bro cowboys. But the reality is many of the most ambitious entrepreneurs in fintech are betting big on institutional bitcoin adoption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the case with Lebanese-American venture capitalist Soona Amhaz of Volt Capital, whom </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/soona-amhaz/?sh=d61d1ae1bd2f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently listed as one of the most influential people in Silicon Valley. She discovered bitcoin through Reddit, back when she was an engineering student at the University of Michigan. Now her firm has invested in 11 crypto startups and is working alongside institutional players like TD Ameritrade, Cumberland and CMT Digital as part of the </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chicagos-trading-firms-look-to-defi-with-new-alliance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago DeFi Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CDA). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where institutions are at now is they&#8217;re looking to back quality founders in the space early on. They&#8217;re looking to be market makers for a lot of these [crypto] projects, and they&#8217;re looking to help with integrations and partnerships between decentralized finance [DeFi] projects and more established financial firms,” Amhaz said. “They see where the puck is going and the smart ones are getting ahead of the curve.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to “DeFi,” Amhaz said the term includes bitcoin and the variety of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain-based systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gaining popularity among day traders during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specific DeFi projects that are gaining more traction now include automated market makers (AMMs), stablecoins and platforms for decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregation, lending and derivatives,” Amhaz said. “Recent DeFi projects simply offer more avenues to use bitcoin as a productive asset, not just a reserve asset.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, most institutions have preferred indirect exposure to cryptocurrency. Goldman Sachs alum </span><a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/juthica-chou-on-the-first-physically-settled-bitcoin-futures"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juthica Chou</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who co-founded the derivatives exchange LedgerX back in 2013, pioneered the physically settled bitcoin futures that are now mainstay offerings among firms like </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bakkt-goes-live-with-options-cash-settled-futures-products"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bakkt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/education/bitcoin/cme-bitcoin-futures-frequently-asked-questions.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CME Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Futures contracts and bitcoin options offer a way for institutions to bet on the price of bitcoin without actually owning bitcoin directly. A cash-settled product means the buyer is paid in dollars, such as getting $10,000 when the option to buy at $10,000 expires, instead of getting paid in bitcoin. Rumor has it the asset management giant</span><a href="https://decrypt.co/54787/blockrock-to-start-cash-settled-bitcoin-futures-trading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> BlackRock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will soon become the next player offering bitcoin futures products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, many institutions are willing to forgo some profits in exchange for lower risk. One of the most popular institutional product providers, </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1588489/000156459021001769/gbtc-8k_20210115.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reportedly saw $1.2 billion in fresh investor funds in January 2021. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m still bullish on options and derivatives,” Chou said, adding there’s enough demand from institutions for trust shares like GBTC, bitcoin options and even prospective exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to all generate substantial wealth in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The environment has way more infrastructure than we had back in 2013,” Chou said. “There’s security infrastructure and best practices for custodians, auditing infrastructure &#8230; banking is another great example. Compared to 2013, the difference between where we were and where we are today is night and day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regards to GBTC, in particular, insatiable demand for shares with lower risks than custodying bitcoin leads to </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/08/30/grayscale-the-worlds-largest-bitcoin-and-crypto-asset-manager-has-a-massive-premium-problem/?sh=35f6e26d46a2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sky-high premiums</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sometimes up to </span><a href="https://www.thestreet.com/etffocus/market-intelligence/osprey-bitcoin-trust-gbtc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">100% </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">more expensive than buying cryptocurrency directly. That’s why Valkyrie CEO Leah Wald launched her own Texas-based asset management firm in 2020. According to </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-to-female-founders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she was one of roughly 800 women founders who raised capital last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was really difficult to raise during a pandemic&#8230; not being able to organically expand my network,” Wald said. “I couldn’t have a meeting with someone even if I wanted to. And so much of seed investing is trusting in the team; trust built through high-quality, in-person conversations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet by January 2021, her startup had raised an undisclosed seed round from angel investors like Coinbase alum Charlie Lee, then applied to the </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841175/000138713121001118/valkyrie-s1_012221.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securities and Exchange Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for permission to launch a bitcoin ETF. Chou said such a bitcoin ETF would boost the whole ecosystem because it would “open access for people who are already users brokers or securities services.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/more-bitcoin-futures-etf-proposals-withdrawn-after-sec-pushback"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETF proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been rejected over the years, starting with a proposal by </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7938cc88-911e-11e8-b639-7680cedcc421"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2013. However, Wald says now she believes there’s never been better timing for an ETF to get approved. Among futures and options, trust shares and ETFs, all these products have different regulatory shapes that allow them to be redeemed faster, or traded in different ways, than the underlying asset, bitcoin, could be at-scale. Generally speaking, institutions seek indirect ways to gain exposure to these nascent, and often lucrative, crypto markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bitcoin’s market cap has grown large enough that it may have finally surpassed an important threshold in the minds of the regulators,” Wald said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe the biggest reason the regulators were nervous about approving a bitcoin ETF in 2017 was concerns around custodial solutions and security. And I agree with that. We’re much closer to better security and custody now with institutional-grade options.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wald added that both Valkyrie&#8217;s bitcoin trust shares and prospective ETF are structured to reduce volatility and premiums.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted to create a more transparent product. I wanted our product to trade closer to the net asset value [NAV],” Wald said. “We’re the only bitcoin trust launching an ETF fund so everyday investors can buy exposure to bitcoin.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This propensity among women entrepreneurs using cryptocurrency isn’t restricted to American tech bubbles. According to Toya Zhang, head of marketing at the Hong Kong-based crypto and futures exchange </span><a href="https://www.aax.com/en-US/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, women make up 25% of her platform’s users and a third of the top users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our biggest market is in Russia. Other than Russia, our biggest markets are Hong Kong, Korea, Indonesia and India,” Zhang said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asian women are more often the one to take care of finances. If you look at stock investment user groups in China and Hong Kong, women are more than half of them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The highly specialized crypto landscape is quickly gaining diversity, compared to other financial sectors. At India’s Coinswitch.co exchange, women reportedly make up </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/why-bitcoin-bulls-are-betting-on-explosive-growth-in-india"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50% of around 25,000 users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, depending on the specific region. Women also make up at least </span><a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/gemini-survey-finds-over-40-of-uk-crypto-investors-are-women-2021-01-29"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of British cryptocurrency users, according to a survey by the crypto exchange </span><a href="https://www.gemini.com/state-of-uk-crypto"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gemini</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across borders, the clear gender disparity may be associated with net worth rather than any lack of interest. In 2018, the World Bank estimated women only held </span><a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/gender/publication/unrealized-potential-the-high-cost-of-gender-inequality-in-earnings"><span style="font-weight: 400;">38%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of capital wealth. Plus, Crunchbase tallied just </span><a href="https://about.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Funding-To-Female-Founders_Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15,379 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies, less than 20% of startups that raised capital, that had women founders from 2009-2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond startups, there are also several companies like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the New York Digital Investments Group (NYDIG), where women executives took the helm in order to innovate on established brokerage models.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December 2020, the insurance company </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/169-year-old-insurer-massmutual-invests-100-million-in-bitcoin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> purchased $100 million in bitcoin and acquired NYDIG equity, a move that signaled a bullish outlook on institutional demand for bitcoin exposure in 2021. Then, on February 8, 2021, Elon Musk’s publicly traded car company Tesla validated the institutional thesis by buying </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.5 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worth of bitcoin. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GQJEdGyp3t"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/">Tesla buys $1.5B in bitcoin, may accept the cryptocurrency as payment in the future</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tesla buys $1.5B in bitcoin, may accept the cryptocurrency as payment in the future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/embed/#?secret=GQJEdGyp3t" data-secret="GQJEdGyp3t" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2021, the greater acceptance of bitcoin by traditional investors and allocators is really exciting,” said NYDIG president Yan Zhao. “We’ll give banks and wealth managers the ability to offer bitcoin products and exposure. We’ll handle the back end.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhao said her bitcoin-focused firm has roughly $4 billion under management, including derivatives, and is currently courting prospective clients like private banks and various asset managers. Her firm is open to exploring ideas like a bitcoin ETF or trust shares, she said, but isn’t interested in Ethereum-based DeFi products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve made a conscious decision to focus on bitcoin,” Zhao said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, Chou was skeptical about many of the Ethereum-based DeFi options available today, while remaining cautiously optimistic about the future of DeFi derivative options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Crypto-native products are important because that’s how you can really harness the power of not having centralized authorities involved to facilitate the transaction,” Chou said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, now traditional options offer indirect access to cryptocurrency gains. At the same time, cryptocurrency itself is experimentally being used to offer comparable, yet more accessible, financial products. These DeFi products are designed for new functionality, not just price exposure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile in California, from network scaling crusader Elizabeth Stark, CEO of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/lightning-labs-just-raised-millions-from-jack-dorsey-and-others-to-supercharge-blockchain-transactions/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE5w4MrN3UQLWMn8PlG-ApRxDhOCX3C1snTwHUUrBsAezZq31nU8quwq43TqAuWgdHM9q9XITBzxypKIs-Cmnp_K0iF8JAMH3O3PWEu4GTQizdJwpiHMhCmFq0Rx-AIL0WmBh4gmUSH12VdCaRP_m0k-SnmfTZ6yQzi9WH67XdaO"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightning Labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to Amhaz at Volt Capital, the next generation of bitcoin whales may look remarkably different from Silicon Valley’s past unicorn-building bros. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The face of our industry looks different than how the tech industry looked in the early 90s or how finance has looked since forever,” Amhaz said. “We&#8217;re starting at a higher, more informed baseline. So, although there&#8217;s still work to be done here, I&#8217;m optimistic.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Oldsmar is a small town in Florida that became the center of the cyber world this week when a hacker broke into its drinking water supply and tried to poison it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the nightmare scenario that the security community has warned for years, one that could kill thousands by targeting the critical infrastructure that we all rely on. The hacker gained access to a computer at the water facility used for running remote control software TeamViewer, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-florida-idUSKBN2A82FV">according to Reuters</a>, and jacked up the levels of sodium hydroxide, aka lye, which would have made the water highly toxic to drink.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not known what security was in place to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to the critical system. Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said in <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/pinellas/2021/02/08/someone-tried-to-poison-oldsmars-water-supply-during-hack-sheriff-says/">a press conference</a> that there were fail-safes and alarms in place to prevent tainted water from reaching residents, and as a result there was little risk to the population of some 15,000 residents.</p>
<p>But suffice to say, running remote control software in a facility that controls the local water supply is a disaster waiting to happen. These networks are supposed to be isolated from the internet to prevent this exact scenario. But you can look for clues in this <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-florida-idUSKBN2A82FV">Reuters report</a>: The water facility is a public utility owned by the town and has its own internal IT staff.</p>
<p>Gualtieri, in his remarks, said: &#8220;The important thing is to put everyone on notice.&#8221; He&#8217;s not kidding; it&#8217;s a similar picture to a lot of small-town America, where much of these facilities are under-resourced and underfunded. Robert Lee, founder and chief executive at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/dragos-series-c-industrial-systems-security/">industrial security startup Dragos</a>, set the context:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hiring, workforce development, culture shifts, working within national priorities and regulations, state and local regulations, resourcing other areas that are organizational challenges, modernizing infrastructure beyond &quot;cyber&quot;, etc. There&#39;s not 1 easy answer tech or not</p>
<p>&mdash; Robert M. Lee (@RobertMLee) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertMLee/status/1358882431516999682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The FBI confirmed it has been called in to investigate. But what&#8217;s unlikely to change any time soon is that small towns are underfunded and <a href="https://twitter.com/hacks4pancakes/status/1358877332988166147">don&#8217;t get the resources</a> that other critical infrastructure gets. In the end, a TeamViewer subscription will be cheaper than a person&#8217;s salary, and there is no greater incentive to cut costs than during a pandemic.</p>
<p>On with the rest of Decrypted.</p>

<p>As COVID-19 vaccines begin to roll out, ransomware actors are hitting back. NBC News this week revealed two hospitals that were hit by data-stealing ransomware. After the hospitals <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hackers-post-detailed-patient-medical-records-two-hospitals-dark-web-n1256887">refused to pay</a> the ransom, the hackers started to publish highly sensitive health and medical data stolen from the hospital networks.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[“We intend to build the Standard Oil of renewable energy,” said James McGinniss, the co-founder and chief executive of David Energy, in a statement announcing the company&#8217;s new $19 million seed round of debt and equity funding.  McGinniss&#8217; company is aiming to boost renewable energy adoption and slash energy usage in the built environment by [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We intend to build the Standard Oil of renewable energy,” said James McGinniss, the co-founder and chief executive of <a href="https://www.davidenergy.com/">David Energy</a>, in a statement announcing the company&#8217;s new $19 million seed round of debt and equity funding. </span></p>
<p>McGinniss&#8217; company is aiming to boost renewable energy adoption and slash energy usage in the built environment by creating a service that operates on both sides of the energy marketplace.</p>
<p>The company combines energy management services for commercial buildings through the software it has developed with the ability to sell energy directly to customers in an effort to reduce the energy consumption and the attendant carbon footprint of the built environment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s software, Mycor, leverages building demand data and the assets that the building has at its disposal to shift user energy consumption to the times when renewable power is most available, and cheapest. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a novel approach to an old idea of creating environmental benefits by reducing energy consumption. Using its technology, David Energy tracks both the market price of energy and the energy usage by the buildings it manages. The company sells energy to customers at a fixed price and then uses its windows into energy markets and energy demand to make money off the difference in power pricing.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the company needed to raise $15 million in a monthly revolving credit facility from Hartree Partners. So it could pay for the power its customers have bought upfront.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2039325" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2039325" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2039325" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg 6800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2039325" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>There are a number of tailwinds supporting the growth of a business like David Energy right now. Given the massive amounts of money that are being earmarked for energy conservation and energy efficiency upgrades, companies like David, which promise to manage energy consumption to reduce demand, are going to be huge beneficiaries.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Looking at the macro shift and the attention being paid to things like battery storage and micro grids we do feel like we’re launching this at the perfect time,&#8221; said McGinniss. &#8220;We&#8217;re</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offering [customers] market rates and then rebating the savings back to them. They’re getting the software with a market energy supply contract and they are getting the savings back. B</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ringing that whole bundled package together really brings it all together.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>In addition to the credit facility, the company also raised $4.1 million in venture financing from investors <span style="font-weight: 400;">led by Equal Ventures and including Operator Partners, Box Group, Greycroft, Sandeep Jain and Xuan Yong of RigUp, returning angel investor Kiran Bhatraju of Arcadia and Jason Jacobs’ recently launched My Climate Journey Collective, an early-stage climate tech fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Renewable energy generators are fundamentally different in their variable, distributed, and digitally-native nature compared to their fossil fuel predecessors while customer loads like heating and driving are shifting to electricity consumption from gas. The sands of market power are shifting and incumbents are poorly-positioned to adapt to evolving customer needs, so there’s a massive opportunity for us to capitalize.” </span></p>
<p>Founded by McGinniss, Brian Maxwell and Ahmed Salman, David Energy raised $1.5 million in pre-seed financing back in March 2020.</p>
<p>As the company expands, its relationship with Hartree, an energy and commodities trading desk, will become even more important. As the startup noted, Hartree is the gateway that David needs to transact with energy markets. The trader provides a balance sheet for working capital to purchase energy on behalf of David&#8217;s customers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Renewables are causing fundamental shifts in energy markets, and new models and tools need to emerge,” said Dinkar Bhatia, co-head of North American Power at Hartree Partners. “James and the team have identified a significant opportunity in the market and have the right strategy to execute. Hartree is excited to be a commodity partner with David Energy on the launch of the new smart retail platform and is looking forward to helping make DE Supply the premier retailer in the market<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">,&#8221; said McGinniss.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David now has</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> retail electricity licenses in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts and is looking to expand around the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;David Energy stands to reinvent the way that hundreds of billions of dollars a year in energy are consumed,&#8221; said Equal Ventures investor Rick Zullo. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business model creativity and finding ways to change user behavior with new models is just as important if not more important than the technology innovation itself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Zullo said his firm pitched David Energy on leading the round after years of looking for a commercial renewable energy startup. The core insight was finding a service that could appeal not to the new construction that already is working with top-of-the-line energy management systems, but with the millions of square feet that aren&#8217;t adopting the latest and greatest energy management systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finding something that will go and bring this to the mass market was something we had been on the hunt for really since the inception of Equal Ventures,&#8221; said Zullo.</p>
<p>The innovation that made David attractive was the business model. &#8220;There is a landscape of hundreds of dead companies,&#8221; Zullo said. &#8220;What they did was find a way to subsidize the service. They give away at low or no cost and move that in with line items. The partnership with Partree gives them the opportunity to be the cheapest and also the best for you and the highest margin regional energy provider in the market.&#8221;</p>

<h1>AGENDA</h1>
<h2>Wednesday, March 3</h2>
<p><strong>State of the Union with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Parul Koul (Google)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Grace Reckers (Office and Professional Employees International Union)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Clarissa Redwine (NYU)</a></strong></p>
<p>Labor unions have been fairly uncommon in tech. That’s finally starting to change in recent years, as workers have pushed to organize at some the industry’s biggest companies, from Alphabet to Kickstarter. Parul Koul (Google), Grace Reckers (Office and Professional Employees International Union) and Clarissa Redwine (NYU) will join us to discuss the growing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the Next Unicorn with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Arlan Hamilton (Backstage Capital)</a></strong></p>
<p>Arlan Hamilton, the founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, has raised more than $12 million to back 150 companies led by underrepresented founders. In this session, Hamilton will discuss how she vets the biggest opportunities in investment, and how to disrupt in a positive way.</p>
<p><strong>The Path Forward for Essential Tech Workers with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Vanessa Bain (Gig Workers Collective)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Jessica E. Martinez (National Council for Occupational Safety and Health)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Christian Smalls (The Congress of Essential Workers)</a></strong></p>
<p>Gig workers and warehouse workers have become essential in a pandemic-ravaged economy. In California, a law went into effect earlier this year that makes gig workers independent contractors. Meanwhile, Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama are actively seeking to form a union to ensure better protections at the workplace. You’ll hear from workers and organizers about what’s next for gig workers and tech’s contractor workforce, and what battles lie ahead for these essential workers.</p>
<p><b>Identifying and Dismantling Tech&#8217;s Deep Systems of Bias with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Haben Girma (Disability Justice Lawyer)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Mutale Nkonde (AI for the People)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Safiya Umoja Noble (UCLA)</a></b></p>
<p>Nearly every popular technology or service has within it systems of bias or exclusion, ignored by the privileged but obvious to the groups affected. How should these systems be exposed and documented, and how can we set about eliminating them and preventing more from appearing in the future? AI for the People&#8217;s Mutale Nkonde, disability rights lawyer Haben Girma and author of &#8220;Algorithms of Oppression&#8221; Safiya Umoja Noble discuss a more inclusive future.</p>
<p><b>Founders in Focus with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Tracy Chou (Block Party)</a></b></p>
<p>We sit down with the founders poised to be the next big disruptors in this industry. Here we chat with Tracy Chou of Block Party, which works to protect people from abuse and harassment online.</p>
<p><b>The Role of Online Hate and Where Social Media Goes from Here with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Naj Austin (Somewhere Good and Ethel&#8217;s Club)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Jesse Lehrich (Accountable Tech)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Rashad Robinson (Color of Change)</a></b></p>
<p>Toxic culture, deadly conspiracies and organized hate have exploded online in recent years. We’ll discuss how much responsibility social networks have in the rise of these phenomena and how to build healthy online communities that make society better, not worse.</p>
<p><strong>Networking Break</strong></p>
<p>With our virtual platform, attendees can network via video chat, giving folks the chance to make meaningful connections. CrunchMatch, our algorithmic matching product, will be available to ensure you’re meeting the right people at the show, as well as random matching for attendees who are feeling more adventurous.</p>
<p><b>Demystifying First-Check Fundraising with First-Check Investors with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Brian Brackeen (Lightship Capital)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Astrid Scholz (Zebras Unite)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Sydney Thomas (Precursor Ventures) </a></b></p>
<p>There are so many ways to finance your startup that don’t include Y combinator or a traditional fund. In this stacked panel, founders will hear from a trio of decision-makers about how to leverage unconventional communities and resources to get the first dollars they need to execute.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting of the Minds with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Wade Davis (Netflix)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Bo Young Lee (Uber)</a></strong></p>
<p>Diversity and inclusion as an idea has been on the agenda of tech companies for years now. But the industry still lacks true inclusion, despite best efforts put forth by heads of diversity, equity and inclusion at these companies. We’ll seek to better understand what’s standing in the way of progress and what it’s going to take to achieve real change.</p>
<p><b>Access All Areas: Designing Accessibility from Day One with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Cynthia Bennett (Carnegie Mellon University)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Srin Madipalli (formerly of Accomable and Airbnb)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Mara Mills (NYU)</a></b></p>
<p>The session will examine the importance of ensuring accessible product design from the beginning. We’ll ask how the social and medical models of disability influence technological evolution. Integrating the expertise of disabled technologists, makers, investors, scientists, software engineers into the DNA of your company from the very beginning is vital to the pursuit of a functioning and equitable society. And could mean you don’t leave money on the table.</p>
<p><b>Creating New Opportunities for Formerly Incarcerated People with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Jason Jones (The Last Mile)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Deepti Rohatgi (Slack)</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">and Aly Tamboura (Chan Zuckerberg Initiative)</a></b></p>
<p>Reentering society after having been incarcerated presents challenges few of us can understand. In this panel, we will examine the role tech can play in ensuring pathways to employment for returned citizens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LiveRamp has <a href="https://liveramp.com/blog/liveramp-to-acquire-datafleets/">acquired DataFleets</a>, a fresh young startup that made it possible to take advantage of large volumes of encrypted data without the risk or fuss of decrypting or transferring it. LiveRamp, an enterprise data connectivity platform itself, paid more than $68 million for the company, a huge multiple on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/datafleets-keeps-private-data-useful-and-useful-data-private-with-federated-learning-and-4-5m-seed/">DataFleet&#8217;s $4.5 million seed</a> announced just last fall.</p>
<p>DataFleets saw the increasing need for sensitive data like medical or financial records to be analyzed or used to train machine learning models. Not only are such databases bulky and complex, making transfers difficult, but allowing them to be decrypted and used elsewhere opens the door to errors, abuse and hacks.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DataFleets keeps private data useful and useful data private with federated learning and $4.5M seed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/datafleets-keeps-private-data-useful-and-useful-data-private-with-federated-learning-and-4-5m-seed/embed/#?secret=9VGpg8YGNe" data-secret="9VGpg8YGNe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s solution was essentially to have software on both sides of the equation, the data provider (perhaps a hospital or bank) and the client (an analyst or AI developer), and act as a secure go-between. Not for the sensitive data itself, but for the systems of analysis and machine learning models that the client wanted to set loose on the data. This allows the client to perform an automated task on the data, such as harvesting and comparing values or building an ML model, without ever having direct access to it.</p>
<p>Clearly this approach seemed valuable to LiveRamp, which provides a number of data connectivity services to major enterprise customers, household names in fact. They announced in their earnings statement last night that they paid $68 million up front for DataFleets, though that price does not reflect the various other incentives and deferred payments that many such deals involve, and in this case seem likely to remain private.</p>
<p>The deal will probably result in the retiring of the DataFleets brand (young as it was), but their various customers will probably make the trip to LiveRamp. The most recent of those is HCA Healthcare, a major national provider that just announced a COVID-19 data sharing consortium that would be using DataFleets&#8217;s services. That&#8217;s a pretty powerful validation for an approach just commercialized late last year, and a nice catch for LiveRamp to add to its healthcare client collection.</p>
<p>For its part LiveRamp plans to use its augmented services to expand its operations and offerings in Europe, Asia and Latin America over the coming year. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/lets-close-the-gap-and-finally-pass-a-federal-data-privacy-law/">The company has also called for a federal data privacy law</a>, something that hopefully that will be achieved under the new administration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commercial real estate industry is facing its share of challenges, considering the fact that so many people are working from home (and not in offices) and retail is riding a slippery slope as more people shop online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But from downturns, opportunity emerges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter <a href="https://www.optiolend.com">OptioLend</a>, a new startup that wants to help individual investors take advantage of opportunities in commercial real estate by connecting them with “the best possible” lenders. The Columbus, Ohio-based company launched its marketplace Tuesday after months of operating in private beta.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new platform uses an AI-powered algorithm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and a database of more than 9,500 capital sources</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help prospective real estate borrowers in search of debt financing find lenders “with the best terms.” In other words, the company’s self-proclaimed mission is to become the “LendingTree for commercial real estate.” (For the unacquainted, Charlotte, North Carolina-based LendingTree is an online marketplace that provides c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">onsumers multiple offers from several lenders for things like mortgage, student and personal loans.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel Lowery, a former LendingTree executive who built the back end of that company’s platform, helped build out the OptioLend portal serving in a technical advisor capacity along with former data scientists at IBM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once an investor applies for a loan, OptioLend identifies up to 20 lenders best suited for that application based on recent lending history and other criteria. Borrowers and brokers can negotiate and close deals from within the company’s platform via the mostly automated process, the company claims. But it’s also launching “with a concierge service of experienced capital advisors” to help guide users who need help during the loan procurement process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get off the ground, OptioLend last year raised about $1 million in seed funding led by the <a href="http://www.schottycapital.com">Schottenstein Family Office</a> with participation from Loud Capital and MLG Ventures. For context, the Schottenstein family is one of the largest private real estate owners in the country.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Valon closes on $50M a16z-led Series A to grow mobile-first mortgage servicing platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/valon-closes-on-50m-a16z-led-series-a-to-grow-mobile-first-mortgage-servicing-platform/embed/#?secret=QUhcBaBI9R" data-secret="QUhcBaBI9R" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Richard Geisenfeld said there’s a plethora of lenders that can lend at that price point, whereas there is “a relatively small pool of capital sources” that focus on deals above $10 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Capital markets are experiencing a 50% surge in refis and new loans as the markets start to rebound from COVID,” he said. “And as existing loans start coming due, we think we’re in a perfect timing to roll out. Properties are going to be repurposed, and are already starting to be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while OptioLend can work with institutions and individual investors, it’s more focused on the latter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutions have a lot of choices,” Geisenfeld said. “Individual investors do not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geisenfeld said he comes from a family of developers and himself has closed about $1.7 billion worth of transactions in 44 states as founder of Capital Commercial Partners. He’d been representing the Schottenstein family for nearly 20 years before the concept behind OptioLend emerged.</span></p>
<p>As an experiment prior to the formation of OptioLend, the family office had reached out to more than 50 lenders in an effort to finance the purchase of a small single tenant, triple net portfolio. They were surprised to discover that the interest rates varied as much as a full percentage point.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every time we did a deal with them, we’d hear anecdotally there were better [loan] rates out there and they agreed that we needed to create some kind of efficiency and automation,” Geisenfeld told TechCrunch. “So I went to one of my colleagues and asked ‘how do we change the paradigm from the traditional methodology?’ And that’s the problem we’re out to solve &#8212; by increasing an investor’s access to capital by 10 times in 10 minutes.”</span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GBAkbba9vD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/vc-investment-in-proptech-can-yield-profits-and-change-lives/">VC investment in proptech can yield profits and change lives</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup says it not only helps investors with new loan applications, but it can also help them refinance existing assets. Its sweet spot is on transactions in the middle market &#8212; in the $1 million to $10 million range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OptioLend will work with commercial real estate and mortgage brokers alike either by allowing them to use the platform directly or to refer property owners to it. Their incentive for referrals is earning up to 50% of the original fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Schottenstein, principal of Schottenstein Family Office, noted in a written statement that in today’s market, borrowers with limited access to capital sources sometimes sign onto loan terms with interest rates “as much as 100 basis points higher than they have to.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;OptioLend’s ability to get deals in front of multiple lenders quickly helps ensure that borrowers are getting the best terms possible,” he added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aurora has reached a deal with Toyota and auto-parts supplier Denso to develop and test vehicles equipped with the self-driving startup&#8217;s technology, beginning with a fleet of Toyota Sienna minivans.</p>
<p>Engineering teams from Aurora and Toyota will work together to design and build the self-driving Sienna minivans with an aim to start testing a fleet by the end of 2021, the companies said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The announcement follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">Aurora&#8217;s acquisition</a> of Uber Advanced Technologies Group, which spun out from Uber in 2019 after the unit raised $1 billion in funding from Toyota, Denso and SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund. The acquisition, which closed January 20, was a complex deal in which Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora. Uber now holds a 26% stake in the combined company. Toyota also has a minority stake in Aurora as a result of the acquisition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The partnership announced Tuesday is similar &#8212; at least in part &#8212; to an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/27/toyota-invests-500-million-into-uber/">agreement reached in 2018</a> between Toyota and Uber to bring an on-demand autonomous ride-hailing service to market. Under that deal, which included a $500 million investment by Toyota, the companies agreed to integrate Uber ATG&#8217;s self-driving technology into the Sienna minivans for use in Uber&#8217;s ride-hailing network. The vehicles later could be owned and operated by third-party fleet managers, Toyota and Uber ATG said at the time.</p>
<p>Aurora co-founder and chief product officer Sterling Anderson emphasized that this is a new partnership and not just an extension of Toyota&#8217;s agreement with Uber ATG.</p>
<p>Toyota and Aurora declined to disclose details such as the size of the team or whether there were financial incentives tied to the deal, making it difficult to determine the scope of the collaboration.</p>
<p>However, Aurora describes this as a long-term strategic deal and laid out an ambitious vision for a partnership that extends far beyond testing. Aurora said that the joint development work in 2021 will lay the groundwork for the mass production and launch of these vehicles with Toyota on ride-hailing networks, including Uber&#8217;s. Aurora said it will also explore mass production of autonomous driving components with Denso and the creation of a services platform with Toyota that could manage financing, insurance and maintenance of the self-driving vehicles.</p>
<p>Anderson noted that the development of these commercial downstream services such as fleet management has become increasingly important for the company following its agreement with trucking firm PACCAR and now Toyota.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need a vehicle, we need a driver and we need support services,&#8221; Anderson said in a recent interview. &#8220;One of the areas that we&#8217;re exploring with Toyota as part of this, is the scaled deployment of Toyota-built vehicles, powered by the Aurora driver, supported by a combination of Aurora&#8217;s support services as well as Toyota&#8217;s network. This is one of the areas where Toyota&#8217;s scale becomes so significant to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The path from testing to commercialization is a long one, riddled with potential speed bumps, including technical and regulatory challenges, competing with rivals over skilled workers and raising enough capital. Achieving these doesn&#8217;t always equate to success as operating an autonomous ride-hailing network has its own set of hurdles. The upshot: Aurora&#8217;s partnership with Toyota is no guarantee.</p>
<p>Still, locking in a partnership with a large automaker is still important for Aurora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Toyota has an unparalleled legacy, engineering expertise, leadership and ability to deliver high-quality, affordable and reliable vehicles,&#8221; Aurora co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson wrote in a blog post Tuesday. &#8220;They&#8217;re also the preferred vehicle brand for transporting riders on ride-hailing networks, so we&#8217;re excited and honored to work with them to unlock driverless mobility services with the Aurora Driver.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urmson added that Aurora&#8217;s development work on highway driving to support its first commercial product, a driverless truck, &#8220;will also be critical for safely moving people, as a significant fraction of ride-share bookings today require the ability to drive over 50 mph.&#8221;</p>
