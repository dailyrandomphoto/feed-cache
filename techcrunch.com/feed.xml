										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well this is big. The UK&#8217;s competition regulator looks set to get an emergency brake that will allow it to stop Google ending support for third party cookies, a technology that&#8217;s currently used for targeting online ads, if it believes competition would be harmed by the depreciation going ahead.</p>
<p>The development follows an investigation opened by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into Google&#8217;s self-styled &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>The regulator will have the power to order a standstill of at least 60 days on any move by Google to remove support for cookies from Chrome if it accepts a set of legally binding commitments the latter has offered &#8212; and which the regulator has today issued a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/992975/Notice_of_intention_to_accept_binding_commitments_offered_by_Google_publication.pdf">notification of intention to accept</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The CMA could also reopen a fuller investigation if it&#8217;s not happy with how things are looking at the point it orders any standstill to stop Google crushing tracking cookies.</p>
<p>It follows that the watchdog could also block Google&#8217;s wider &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217; technology transition entirely &#8212; if it decides the shift cannot be done in a way that doesn&#8217;t harm competition. However the CMA said today it takes the &#8220;provisional&#8221; view that the set of commitments Google has offered will address competition concerns related to its proposals.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now opened a consultation to see if the industry agrees &#8212; with the feedback line open until July 8.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s chief executive, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The emergence of tech giants such as Google has presented competition authorities around the world with new challenges that require a new approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s why the CMA is taking a leading role in setting out how we can work with the most powerful tech firms to shape their behaviour and protect competition to the benefit of consumers.</p>
<p class="last-child">&#8220;If accepted, the commitments we have obtained from Google become legally binding, promoting competition in digital markets, helping to protect the ability of online publishers to raise money through advertising and safeguarding users’ privacy.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/our-commitments-privacy-sandbox/">blog post</a> sketching what it&#8217;s pledged &#8212; under three broad headlines of &#8216;Consultation and collaboration&#8217;; &#8216;No data advertising advantage for Google products&#8217;; and &#8216;No self-preferencing&#8217; &#8212; Google writes that if the CMA accepts its commitments it will &#8220;apply them globally&#8221;, making the UK&#8217;s intervention potentially hugely significant.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s perhaps one <em>slightly unexpected</em> twist of Brexit that it&#8217;s put the UK in a position to be taking key decisions about the rules for global digital advertising. (The European Union is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">working on new rules for how platform giants can operate</a> but the CMA&#8217;s intervention on Privacy Sandbox does not yet have a direct equivalent in Brussels.)</p>
<p>That Google is choosing to offer to turn a UK competition intervention into a global commitment is itself very interesting. It may be there in part as an added sweetener &#8212; nudging the CMA to accept the offer so it can feel like a global standard setter.</p>
<p>At the same time, businesses do love operational certainty. So if Google can hash out a set of rules that are accepted by one (fairly) major market, because they&#8217;ve been co-designed with national oversight bodies, and then scale those rules <em>everywhere</em> it may create a shortcut path to avoiding any more regulator-enforced bumps in the future.</p>
<p>So Google may see this as a smoother path toward the sought for transition for its adtech business to a post-cookie future. Of course it also wants to avoid being ordered to stop entirely.</p>
<p>More broadly, engaging with the fast-paced UK regulator could be a strategy for Google to try to surf over the political deadlocks and risks which can characterize discussions on digital regulation in other markets (especially its home turf of the U.S. &#8212; where there has been a growing drumbeat of calls to break up tech giants; and where Google specifically now faces <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/google-justice-department-antitrust-trial-date/">a number</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-antitrust-lawsuit-new-york-colorado-35-states-search/">antitrust investigations</a>).</p>
<p>The outcome it may be hoping for is being able to point to regulator-stamped &#8216;compliance&#8217; &#8212; in order that it can claim it as evidence there&#8217;s no need for its ad empire to be broken up.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s offering of commitments also signifies that regulators who move fastest to tackle the power of tech giants will be the ones helping to define and set the standards and conditions that apply for web users everywhere. At least unless or until any more radical interventions rain down on big tech.</p>
<h2>What is Privacy Sandbox?</h2>
<p>Privacy Sandbox is a complex stack of interlocking technology proposals for replacing current ad tracking methods (which are widely seen as horrible for user privacy) with alternative infrastructure that Google claims will be better for individual privacy and also still allow the adtech and publishing industries to generate (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/google-claims-almost-no-change-in-ad-revenue-from-targeting-proposals-in-its-privacy-sandbox-but-privacy-upside-less-clear/">it claims much the same</a>) revenue by targeting ads at cohorts of web users &#8212; who will be put into &#8216;interest buckets&#8217; based on what they look at online.</p>
<p>The full details of the proposals (which include components like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/">FLoCs</a>, aka Google&#8217;s proposed new ad ID based on federated learning of cohorts; and Fledge/Turtledove, Google&#8217;s suggested new ad delivery technology) have not yet been set in stone.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Google announced in January 2020 that it intended to end support for third party cookies within two years &#8212; so that rather nippy timeframe has likely concentrated opposition, with pushback coming from the adtech industry and (some) publishers who are concerned it will have a major impact on their ad revenues when individual-level ad targeting goes away.</p>
<p>The CMA began to look into Google&#8217;s planned depreciating of tracking cookies after complaints that the transition to a new infrastructure of Google&#8217;s devising will merely increase Google&#8217;s market power &#8212; by locking down third parties&#8217; ability to track Internet users for ad targeting while leaving Google with a high dimension view of what people get up to online as a result of its expansive access to first party data (gleaned through its dominance for consumer web services).</p>
<p>The executive summary of today&#8217;s CMA notice lists its concerns that, without proper regulatory oversight, Privacy Sandbox might:</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<ul>
<li>distort competition in the market for the supply of ad inventory and in the market for the supply of ad tech services, by restricting the functionality associated with user tracking for third parties while retaining this functionality for Google;</li>
<li>distort competition by the self-preferencing of Google’s own advertising products and services and owned and operated ad inventory; and</li>
<li>allow Google to exploit its apparent dominant position by denying Chrome web users substantial choice in terms of whether and how their personal data is used for the purpose of targeting and delivering advertising to them.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the same time, privacy concerns around the ad tracking and targeting of Internet users are undoubtedly putting pressure on Google to retool Chrome (which ofc dominates web browser marketshare) &#8212; given that other web browsers have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/webkits-new-anti-tracking-policy-puts-privacy-on-a-par-with-security/">stepping up efforts</a> to protect their users from online surveillance by doing stuff like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-adds-a-tracker-blocker-to-desktop-safari/">blocking trackers</a> for years.</p>
<p>Web users hate creepy ads &#8212; which is why they&#8217;ve been turning to ad blockers in droves. Numerous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/cambridge-analytica-sought-to-use-facebook-data-to-predict-partisanship-for-voter-targeting-uk-investigation-confirms/">major data scandals</a> have also increased awareness of privacy and security. And &#8212; in Europe and elsewhere &#8212; digital privacy regulations have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/20/wtf-is-gdpr/">toughened up</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/08/ccpa-privacy-law-rocky-start/">introduced</a> in recent years. So the line of &#8216;what&#8217;s acceptable&#8217; for ad businesses to do online has been shifting.</p>
<p>But the key issue here is how privacy and competition regulation interacts &#8212; and potentially conflicts &#8212; with the very salient risk that ill-thought through and overly blunt competition interventions could essentially lock in privacy abuses of web users (as a result of a legacy of weak enforcement around online privacy, which allowed for rampant, consent-less ad tracking and targeting of Internet users to develop and thrive in the first place).</p>
<p>Poor privacy enforcement coupled with banhammer-wielding competition regulators does not look like a good recipe for protecting web users&#8217; rights.</p>
<p>However there is cautious reason for optimism here.</p>
<p>Last month the CMA and the UK&#8217;s Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO) issued a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2619797/cma-ico-public-statement-20210518.pdf">joint statement</a> in which they discussed the importance of having competition <em>and</em> data protection in digital markets &#8212; citing the CMA&#8217;s Google Privacy Sandbox probe as a good example of a case that requires nuanced joint working.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Or, as they put it then: &#8220;The CMA and the ICO are working collaboratively in their engagement with Google and other market participants to build a common understanding of Google’s proposals, and to ensure that both privacy and competition concerns can be addressed as the proposals are developed in more detail.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Although the ICO&#8217;s record on enforcement against rights-trampling adtech is, well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">non-existent</a>. So its preference for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/adtech-scores-a-pandemic-pause-from-uk-privacy-oversight/">regulatory inaction</a> in the face of adtech industry lobbying should off-set any quantum of optimism derived from the bald fact of the UK&#8217;s privacy and competition regulators&#8217; &#8216;joint working&#8217;.</p>
<p>(The CMA, by contrast, has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/uks-competition-watchdog-still-eyeing-facebooks-giphy-buy/">very active in the digital space</a> since gaining, post-Brexit, wider powers to pursue investigations. And in recent years took <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/uks-cma-launches-investigation-into-digital-advertising-and-its-potential-harm-to-consumers/">a deep dive look at competition in the digital ad market</a>, so it&#8217;s armed with plenty of knowledge. It is also in the process of configuring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">a new unit</a> that will oversee a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">pro-competition regime</a> which the UK explicitly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">wants to clip the wings of big tech</a>.)</p>
<h2>What has Google committed to?</h2>
<p>The CMA writes that Google has made &#8220;substantial and wide-ranging&#8221; commitments vis-a-vis Privacy Sandbox &#8212; which it says include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A commitment to develop and implement the proposals in a way that avoids distortions to competition and the imposition of unfair terms on Chrome users. This includes a commitment to involve the CMA and the ICO in the development of the Proposals to ensure this objective is met.</li>
<li>Increased transparency from Google on how and when the proposals will be taken forward and on what basis they will be assessed. This includes a commitment to publicly disclose the results of tests of the effectiveness of alternative technologies.</li>
<li>Substantial limits on how Google will use and combine individual user data for the purposes of digital advertising after the removal of third-party cookies.</li>
<li>A commitment that Google will not discriminate against its rivals in favour of its own advertising and ad-tech businesses when designing or operating the alternatives to third-party cookies.</li>
<li>A standstill period of at least 60 days before Google proceeds with the removal of third party cookies giving the CMA the opportunity, if any outstanding concerns cannot be resolved with Google, to reopen its investigation and, if necessary, impose any interim measures necessary to avoid harm to competition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google also writes that: &#8220;Throughout this process, we will engage the CMA and the industry in an open, constructive and continuous dialogue. This includes proactively informing both the CMA and the wider ecosystem of timelines, changes and tests during the development of the Privacy Sandbox proposals, building on our <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/&quot;}">transparent approach to date</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will work with the CMA to resolve concerns and develop agreed parameters for the testing of new proposals, while the CMA will be getting direct input from the ICO,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s commitments cover a number of areas directly related to competition &#8212; such as self-preferencing, non-discrimination, and stipulations that it will not combine user data from specific sources that might give it an advantage vs third parties.</p>
<p>However privacy is also being explicitly baked into the competition consideration, here, per the CMA &#8212; which writes that the commitments will [emphasis ours]:</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 5">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote><p>Establish the criteria that must be taken into account in designing, implementing and evaluating Google’s Proposals. These include the impact of the Privacy Sandbox Proposals on: <strong>privacy outcomes and compliance with data protection principles</strong>; competition in digital advertising and in particular the risk of distortion to competition between Google and other market participants; the ability of publishers to generate revenue from ad inventory; and user experience and control over the use of their data.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">An ICO spokeswoman was also keen to point out that one of the first commitments obtained from Google under the CMA&#8217;s intervention &#8220;focuses on privacy and data protection&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>In a statement, the data watchdog added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The commitments obtained mark a significant moment in the assessment of the Privacy Sandbox proposals. They demonstrate that consumer rights in digital markets are best protected when competition and privacy are considered together.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we outlined in our recent <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2619797/cma-ico-public-statement-20210518.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2619797/cma-ico-public-statement-20210518.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623490085578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEawKF7Uo2PEY4sREPqa_n_x6fo1A">joint statement</a> with the CMA, we believe consumers benefit when their data is used lawfully and responsibly, and digital innovation and competition are supported. We are continuing to build upon our positive and close relationship with the CMA, to ensure that consumer interests are protected as we assess the proposals.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This development in the CMA&#8217;s investigation raises plenty of questions, large and small &#8212; most pressingly over the future of key web infrastructure and what the changes being hashed out here between Google and UK regulators might mean for Internet users everywhere.</p>
<p>The really big issue is whether &#8216;co-design&#8217; with oversight bodies is the best way to fix the market power imbalance flowing from a single tech giant being able to combine massive dominance in consumer digital services with duopoly dominance in adtech.</p>
<p>Others would say that breaking up Google&#8217;s consumer tech and Google&#8217;s adtech is the only way to fix the abuse &#8212; and eveything else is just fiddling while Rome burns.</p>
<p>Google, for instance, is still in charge of proposing the changes itself &#8212; regardless of how much pre-implementation consultation and tweaking goes on. It&#8217;s still steering the ship and there are plenty of people who believe that&#8217;s not an acceptable governance model for the open web.</p>
<p>But, for now at least, the CMA wants to try to fiddle.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, in parallel, the UK government and CMA are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">speccing out a wider pro-competition regime</a> that could result in deeper interventions into how Google and other platform giants operate in the future. So more interventions are all but guaranteed.</p>
<p>For now, though, Google is probably feeling pretty happy for the opportunity to work with UK regulators. If it can pull oversight bodies deep down in the detail of the changes it wants to make that&#8217;s likely a far more comfortable spot for Mountain View vs being served with an order to break its business up &#8212; something the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/uks-competition-regulator-asks-for-views-on-breaking-up-google/">CMA has previously taken feedback on</a>.</p>
<p>Google has been contacted with questions on its Privacy Sandbox commitments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bangalore-based neobank Open is in advanced stages of talks to raise about $100 million, according to two sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Temasek, the Singaporean government&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund, and General Atlantic are positioning to co-lead the Series C financing round, which values the Indian startup at pre-money $600 million, the sources told TechCrunch, requesting anonymity as the matter is private. Open was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/indias-open-neo-bank-raises-30-million-to-help-businesses-automate-their-finances/">valued at about $150 million</a> in its Series B funding round two years ago.</p>
<p>Existing investor Tiger Global, PayPal, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/paypal-is-shutting-down-domestic-payments-business-in-india/">shuttered its domestic operations in the world’s second largest internet market</a> early this year, as well as Google and Amazon are in talks to participate in the new round, the sources said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indian news outlet Economic Times <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/amazon-google-and-visa-are-open-to-neo-banking/articleshow/83321544.cms">first reported</a> about the size of the imminent round and identified Google and Amazon as probable investors earlier this week. The round hasn&#8217;t closed yet so terms may change and not all investors may end up backing Open. The startup&#8217;s founder and chief executive Anish Achuthan declined to comment.</p>
<p>Open operates as a neobank that offers nearly all the features of a bank with additional tools to serve the needs of businesses. The startup offers its clients services such as automated account, payment gateway, credit cards, automated bookkeeping, cash flow management, and tax and compliance management solutions.</p>

<p>Realizing the opportunity that they can’t tap the entire market, several banks in India have in recent years started to collaborate with fintech startups to expand their reach in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banks are doing their best to defend their turf by focusing on several fronts – eco system building (led by HDFC Bank), open approach to fintech partnerships (led by ICICI Bank), overall digital experience as an acquisition tool (led by Kotak and Axis) etc. But [they] continue to play catchup as they lack the focus/ expertise in each channel (Banking super apps and APIs are fast becoming hygiene). Fintech revenues are already ~10% of private banks’ fee income, but could grow &gt;3x in the next 3 years,&#8221; wrote analysts at Bank of America in a report late last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banks no doubt want to own the pipe and relationships, but are unlikely to succeed except in very specific segments,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>In recent months, however, some banks have begun to <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/05/neobanks-run-into-a-big-bank-problem/">reevaluate their engagement strategy with neobanks</a>, Indian news and analysis publication the CapTable reported last month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beauty and wellness businesses have come roaring back to life with the decline of Covid-19 restrictions, and a startup that&#8217;s built a platform that caters to the many needs of small enterprises in the industry today is announcing a big round of funding to grow with them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fresha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fresha</a> &#8212; a multipurpose commerce tool for independent wellness and beauty businesses such as hair, nail and skin salons, yoga instructors and more, based first and foremost around a completely free subscription platform for those businesses to schedule bookings from customers &#8212; has picked up $100 million.</p>
<p>Fresha plans to use the funds to expand the list of countries where it operates, to grow the categories of companies that use its services (mental health practitioners is one example; fitness is another), and to build more services complementing what it already provides, helping customers do their work by providing them with more insights and data about what they do already. It will also be making acquisitions to expand its customer base.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>General Atlantic is leading this Series C, with Huda Kattan, Michael Zeisser of FMZ Ventures, and Jonathan Green of Lugard Road Capital also participating, along with past investors Partech, Target Global and FJ Labs.</p>
<p>Fresha has raised $132 million to date, and it&#8217;s not disclosing its valuation. But as a point of reference, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/shedul-b-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed its Series B</a> (as Shedul; the company rebranded in February 2020), it was valued at $105 million.</p>
<p>Chances are that figure is significantly higher now.</p>
<p>Fresha&#8217;s current range of services include a free-to-use platform for booking appointments; free software for managing accounts; a payments service that includes both a physical point of sale and digital interface; and a wider marketplace both to provide goods to the businesses (B2B); and for the businesses to sell goods to customers (B2C).</p>
<p>The London-based company has 50,000 business customers and 150,000 stylists and professionals in 120+ countries (mostly in the U.K., the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Europe), with some 250 million appointments booked to date.</p>
<p>And while many businesses did have to curtail how they operated (and in some countries had to stop operating altogether) Fresha found that it was attracting a lot of new business in part because of its &#8220;free&#8221; model that meant customers didn&#8217;t have to pay to maintain a booking platform at a time when they weren&#8217;t taking bookings, but could use Fresha to generate revenues in other ways (such as through the sale of goods, vouchers for future services, and more.)</p>
<p>So in a year when you might have thought that a company based around providing services to industries that were hard hit by Covid would have also been hard-hit, in fact Fresha saw a 30x increase in card payment transactions versus the year before, and more than $12 billion worth of booking appointments made on its platform.</p>
<p>In a market that is very crowded with tech companies building platforms to book beauty (and other) services and to manage the business of independent retailers &#8212; they include giants like Lightspeed POS, as well as smaller players like Booksy (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/booksy-raises-70m-war-chest-to-acquire-salon-appointment-apps-expand-internationally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also recently raised</a>) and <a href="https://www.styleseat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StyleSeat</a> but also players like Square and PayPal, and many others &#8212; the core of Fresha&#8217;s offering is a booking platform built as a totally free product.</p>
<p>Why free? To attract more users to its other services (such as payments, which do come at a price), and because co-founders William Zeqiri (CEO) and Nick Miller (product chief) &#8212; pictured above, respectively left and right &#8212; think this the only way to build a business like this in a crowded market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that software is a commodity,&#8221; said Zeqiri in an interview. &#8220;A lot of our competitors are beating each other on price to the bottom. We wanted to consolidate the supply side of the software, gather data about the businesses, how they use what they use.&#8221;</p>
<p>That data led, first, to identifying the need for and building out software and launching its B2B and B2C marketplaces, and the idea is that it will likely lead to more products as it continues to mature, whether its better analytics for its current customers so that they can better price or develop their services accordingly; or entirely new tools for new categories of users.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the services that it already provides like payments have taken off like a shot, not least because they&#8217;ve served a need for any virtual transactions like selling vouchers or items.</p>
<p class="p1">Miller noted that while a lot of its customers actually interface with tech with a lot of reluctance &#8212; they are the essence of &#8220;physical&#8221; retailers when you think about it &#8212; they also found themselves having to use more digital services simply because of circumstances. &#8220;Looking back at what happened, tech adoption accelerated for our customers,&#8221; said Miller. He said that current customers usage for the point-of-sale systems and online payments is roughly equal.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Fresha&#8217;s investor list is notable for its strategic mix and might shed some light on how it grows. Kattan, a &#8220;beauty influencer&#8221; and the founder of Huda Beauty, is investing by way of HB Investments, a strategic venture arm; while Zeisser&#8217;s FMZ focuses on &#8220;experience economy&#8221; investments today, but he himself has a long history working at tech companies building marketplaces, including years with Alibaba as head of its U.S. investment practice. These speak to areas where Fresha is likely interested in expanding its reach &#8212; more marketplace activity; and perhaps more social media angles and exposure for its customers at a time when social media really has become a key way for beauty and wellness businesses to market themselves.</p>
<p>“Fresha has emerged as a leader powering the beauty and wellness industry,” said Aaron Goldman, Global Co-head of financial services and MD at General Atlantic, in a statement. “William, Nick and the Fresha team have built a product that is resonating with the market and creating long-term value through the intersection of its payments, software and marketplace offerings. We are thrilled to be partnering with the company and believe Fresha has significant opportunity to further scale its innovative platform.”</p>
<p>“I’ve witnessed first-hand the positive impact Fresha has for beauty entrepreneurs,&#8221; added Kattan. &#8220;The company is a force for good in the growing community of beauty professionals around the globe, who are increasingly adopting a self-employed approach. By making top business software accessible without any subscription fees, Fresha lets professionals focus on what they do best — offering great experiences for their customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tiger Global is in talks to lead a $30 million round in Indian edtech startup Classplus, according to sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The new round, which includes both primary investment and secondary transactions, values the five-year-old Indian startup at over $250 million, two sources told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The new round follows another ~$30 million investment that was led by GSV recently, one of the sources said. The new round hasn&#8217;t closed, so terms may change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Classplus &#8212; which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/03/classplus-coaching-centers-teachers-online/">built a Shopify-like platform for coaching centers</a> to accept fees digitally from students, and deliver classes and study material online &#8212; also raised $10.3 million in September last year from Falcon Edge’s AWI, cricketer Sourav Ganguly and existing investors RTP Global and Blume Ventures. That round had valued Classplus at about $73 million, according to research firm Tracxn.</p>
<p>Classplus didn’t respond to a request for comment. Sources requested anonymity as the matter is private.</p>
<p>As tens of millions of students — and their parents — embrace digital learning apps, Classplus is betting that hundreds of thousands of teachers and coaching centers that have gained reputation in their neighborhoods are here to stay.</p>
<p>The startup is serving these hyperlocal tutoring centers that are present in nearly every nook and cranny in India. &#8220;Anyone who was born in a middle-class family here has likely attended these tution classes,” Mukul Rustagi, co-founder and chief executive of Classplus, told TechCrunch last year.</p>
<p>“These are typically small and medium setups that are run by teachers themselves. These teachers and coaching centers are very popular in their locality. They rarely do any marketing and students learn about them through word-of-mouth buzz,” he said then.</p>
<p>Rustagi had described Classplus as “Shopify for coaching centers.” Like Shopify, Classplus does not serve as a marketplace that offers discoverability to these teachers or coaching centers and instead it offers a way for these teachers to leverage its tech platform to engage with customers.</p>
<p>This year, Tiger Global has backed &#8212; or in talks to back &#8212; about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">two dozen startups in India</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla finally held the long-awaited, and once rescheduled, &#8220;delivery event&#8221; for its ultra-fast Model S Plaid at its factory in Fremont, California. The electric vehicle company will begin with 25 deliveries on Friday evening, expanding to several hundred cars per week and a thousand cars per week in the next quarter, CEO Elon Musk said at the event.</p>
<p>There were no huge surprises with the newest iteration of the Model S, which features a new battery pack design, an improved heat pump, carbon over-wrapped rotors on the motors and a new record for drag coefficient of 0.208, a figure that Musk emphasized as perhaps a poke at up-and-comer Lucid Motors. The Lucid Air, which is slated to go into production later this year, has a drag coefficient of 0.21.</p>
<p>While wielding a sledgehammer as prep for &#8220;breaking a few records,&#8221; Tesla Model S designer Franz von Holzhausen kicked off the event, introducing Musk himself, who drove a shiny black Model S around the test track, gliding right onto stage to the dulcet sounds of dubstep.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is nine years since we delivered the first model S, the first car produced here in Fremont, so almost a decade, and I think we&#8217;ve really taken it to a whole new level with Plaid,&#8221; said Musk to an audience of adoring fans. &#8220;Some of you may know that our product plan is stolen from <em>Spaceballs, </em>we&#8217;ve gone Plaid speed. So&#8230;why make this really fast car, that&#8217;s crazy fast and everything, and I think there is something that&#8217;s quite important to the future of sustainable energy, which is that we&#8217;ve got to show that an electric car is the best car, hands down. It&#8217;s gotta be clear, like, man, sustainable energy cars can be the fastest cars, can be the safest cars, can be the most kick ass cars in every way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four-door electric sedan goes from 0 to 60 in 1.99 seconds, which Musk says breaks the two-second barrier that no production car has ever been able to break. It produces 1,020 horsepower, has a top speed of 200 miles per hour (with the proper tires) and can complete a quarter mile in 9.23 seconds, according to Musk and the company&#8217;s website. The battery can travel 390 miles on a single charge, but Musk added the car can go to 412 miles with the dual motor configuration (The Model S Plaid has a tri-motor set up). The improved charging speed gives drivers 187 miles of range in just 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The new Model S also has a new battery pack, but Musk didn&#8217;t elaborate past that detail. He spent considerable time describing the carbon-sleeved rotors for the motor, which Musk claims is a first for a production electric motor due to the difficulty of pulling it off. The end result is a motor that goes up to 20,000 RPM.</p>
<p>The new heat pump that powers the Plaid&#8217;s HVAC system has 30% better cold weather range and requires 50% less energy for cabin heating and freezing conditions, meaning little degradation in cold weather, said Musk.</p>

<p>The interior of the Model S also has a number of updates, some that have already been revealed, including a yoke steering wheel — which has raised eyebrows and has the attention of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — a panoramic main screen and ventilated front seats. The GPU is apparently at the level of a PlayStation 5. (TechCrunch noticed that someone was playing CD Projekt Red&#8217;s Cyberpunk 2077 in the vehicle at one point during the event).</p>
<p>The software of the car is designed to learn from the driver&#8217;s behavior, adapting to the driver&#8217;s needs so that if, say, you tend to back out of your driveway in a certain way, the car geocodes to that location and eventually does that action for you via the autopilot system.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll just keep minimizing the amount of input that you need to do until the car just read your mind,&#8221; said Musk.</p>
<p>The first deliveries of the vehicle, which starts at $129,990, come the same week<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/06/elon-musk-officially-hits-the-brakes-on-tesla-model-s-plaid/"> Musk officially announced plans to cancel production of the Model S Plaid+</a>, what was meant to be a faster version of the Plaid version of the Model S. Tesla stoped taking pre-orders for the vehicle on its website back in May, prompting speculation that the Plaid+ was off the table.</p>
<p>“Model S goes to Plaid speed this week,” Musk tweeted on Sunday. “Plaid+ is canceled. No need, as Plaid speed is just so good.”</p>
<p>Musk described driving it as akin to powering a spaceship in a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1398504702988390400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1398504702988390400%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2021%2F06%2F06%2Felon-musk-officially-hits-the-brakes-on-tesla-model-s-plaid%2F">tweet</a> due to the car&#8217;s indescribable &#8220;limbic resonance,&#8221; whatever that means.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">The aircraft unveiled on Thursday is not what would take to the skies should the company reach commercial operation in 2024. However, Archer’s Head of Certification Eric Wright told TechCrunch that starting with an autonomous vehicle allows the company to move through the testing process more efficiently.</p>
<p>“The [two-seater] Maker aircraft is a stepping stone in the path to certification,” Wright explained. He said it was a “a testbed that really helps us to increase our knowledge and awareness on say, the flight control systems and the electric propulsion and the things that we&#8217;re putting into the certified aircraft, and to help the [Federal Aviation Administration] gain confidence in that design as we as we put it through its paces, and of course, they will be involved in in watching that development occur.”</p>
<p>Both Maker and the unnamed five-seater aircraft bear similarities in their specs: both have a “tilt-rotor” design, meaning that of the total 12 rotors on the aircraft, the front six can tilt position. This tilting mechanism is what allows the aircraft to ascend vertically like a helicopter and move forward like an airplane.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two also have six independent battery packs each for safety purposes, as the rest of the batteries should operate even in the case that one fails. It’s these batteries that give the crafts a 60-mile range at 150 miles per hour. While the two-seater design has a 40-foot wingspan and clocks in at around 3,300 pounds, the larger aircraft will likely weigh more, Wright said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164862" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164862" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2164862" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/archer-maker2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="559" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/archer-maker2.jpg 1678w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/archer-maker2.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/archer-maker2.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/archer-maker2.jpg?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/archer-maker2.jpg?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/archer-maker2.jpg?resize=1536,838 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/archer-maker2.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164862" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://archer.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archer <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The Palo Alto-based company also said it anticipates Maker will generate only 45 decibels of sound from 2,000 feet. The noise specification is especially important for electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) companies that have air taxi aspirations. Mass adoption will only likely be acceptable – both by the public and by regulators – if the aircraft is sufficiently quiet.</p>
<p>Archer had been slowly trickling information on Maker over the past few months, including releasing a high-quality rendering of the two-seater after the company announced it had landed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/">a $1 billion order with United</a>. (The release of those renders helped trigger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/wisk-aero-sues-archer-aviation-for-alleged-patent-infringement-trade-secret-theft/">a lawsuit</a> from rival eVTOL developer Wisk Aero alleging trade secret misappropriation.) The event on Thursday marks the first time the public has been able to see an actual aircraft from the startup that’s valued at $3.8 billion.</p>
<p>When asked why the debut aircraft is autonomous, Wright said it would help the company move more efficiently through the testing and validation process. “By making the vehicle autonomous you can do things quicker without having the pilot in the aircraft actually having to fly it,” Wright said. “So you can look at the response that the aircraft has to the inputs, from an autonomous standpoint, much quicker, much more efficiently.”</p>
<p>While it may be years yet that autonomous air taxis are ferrying people across cities, Archer, like other eVTOL developers, does see autonomy in its long-term blueprint – as operational aircraft, rather than simply facilitating a larger certification process.</p>
<p>“If we&#8217;re going to have a really large impact on transportation, I think it&#8217;s really difficult to think about doing that in a piloted way really long term,” Archer CEO Brett Adcock told TechCrunch in a separate interview. “I think piloted is for sure the right way to enter the market as relates to getting into the airspace and getting certified and making that happen, basically, right away. And then I think over time, in order to drive up safety for both passengers and the network, it&#8217;s really going to be important to move to autonomous airspace. So I think [autonomy] is inevitable to the extent the industry scales really well and gets big.”</p>
<p>The three-year-old startup aims to launch commercial operations in 2024 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/archer-aviation-aims-to-launch-network-of-urban-air-taxis-in-los-angeles-by-2024/">starting in Los Angeles and Miami</a>. The company’s system simulation team is using a simulation tool called Prime Radiant to determine where to place its vertiports. That team is led by the former head of data science at Uber Elevate, Uber’s air mobility arm that was later sold to Joby Aviation in December 2020.</p>
<p>Adcock also said the company’s had conversations with ride-sharing companies about working together to integrate the first- and last-mile car trips that will inevitably be needed with the air taxi routes.</p>
<p>In advance of the proposed 2024 launch date, Goldstein said the company is working with its partner, the automaker Stellantis, on two facilities: one that would deliver traditional aerospace volumes in the hundreds of aircraft per year, and a future facility that would build an even higher volume.</p>
<p>Archer has similar manufacturing needs as an automaker, Goldstein said, &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">where we use lightweight carbon fiber for a lot of the parts, we have electric motors, batteries all that like autos do.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After years of speculation, Didi Chuxing, China&#8217;s ride-sharing behemoth, finally unveiled its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764757/000104746921001194/a2243272zf-1.htm#dl10201_selected_consolidated_financial_data">IPO filing</a> in the U.S., giving a glimpse into its money-losing history.</p>
<p>Didi didn&#8217;t disclose the size of its raise. Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/didi-ipo/update-2-chinas-didi-reveals-us-ipo-filing-sets-stage-for-blockbuster-new-york-float-idUSL3N2NS42U">reported</a> the company could raise around $10 billion at a valuation of close to $100 billion, though The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/didi-chuxing-chinas-ride-hailing-giant-unveils-u-s-ipo-filing-11623355962">cited</a> a valuation upward of $70 billion. Uber&#8217;s market cap currently exceeds $90 billion.</p>
<p>Cheng Wei, Didi&#8217;s 38-year-old founder owns 7% of the company’s shares and controls 15.4% of its voting power before the IPO, according to the prospectus. Major shareholders to reap returns are SoftBank Vision Fund, which owns 21.5% of the company, Uber with 12.8% and Tencent at 6.8%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The nine-year-old company, which famously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/didi-chuxing-confirms-it-is-buying-ubers-business-in-china/">acquired Uber&#8217;s China operations in 2016</a>, is more than a ride-hailing platform now. It has a growing line of businesses like bike-sharing, grocery, intra-city freight, financial services for drivers, electric vehicles and Level 4 robotaxis, which it defines as &#8220;the pinnacle of our design for future mobility&#8221; for its potential to lower costs and improve safety.</p>
<p>Didi set up an autonomous driving subsidiary that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/softbank-pours-500m-into-didi-in-chinas-biggest-autonomous-driving-round/">banked $500 million from SoftBank&#8217;s second Vision Fund</a> in May last year. The unit now operates a team of over 500 members and a fleet of over 100 autonomous vehicles. It&#8217;s also designing EVs for ride-hailing as China pushes taxis and ride sharing companies to phase out fossil fuel vehicles.</p>
<h2>Market dominance</h2>
<p>For the twelve months ended March, Didi served 493 million annual active users and saw 41 million transactions on a daily basis. It had 156 million monthly users in Q1, well above Uber&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/ubers-mixed-q1-earnings-portray-an-evolving-business/">98 million</a> in the period.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/pdf/web/viewer.html?file=http://www.cac.gov.cn/rootimages/uploadimg/1613923424818332/1613923424818332.pdf?filepath=ZBWvETi1XzcBKtOIkqelkJJ4Vn5uw9ZthCXJtWLSr0nQACMKH6Ejiw/UpdBYAwmsV5if6BYGd60xaZUMhKPZmjEjTcORl73kmCTdYOvdSjs=&amp;fText=%E7%AC%AC47%E6%AC%A1%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%92%E8%81%94%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E5%8F%91%E5%B1%95%E7%8A%B6%E5%86%B5%E7%BB%9F%E8%AE%A1%E6%8A%A5%E5%91%8A-0203%EF%BC%88%E6%89%93%E5%8D%B0%E7%94%9F%E6%88%90%EF%BC%89">China&#8217;s official data</a> showed the country had 365 million ride hailing users as of December, which suggests Didi commands a substantial market share.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Mobility</span> services in China have consistently accounted for over 90% of Didi&#8217;s revenues. The company has tried to expand its presence in a dozen overseas countries like Brazil, where it bought local ride-hailing business 99 Taxis. And more than 97% of Didi&#8217;s China-based mobility revenues &#8212; which also include taxi hailing, chauffeur and carpooling, a lucrative business that was revamped following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/06/didi-safety-pivot/">two deadly accidents</a> &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">came from ride-hailing between 2018 and 2020.</span></p>

<p>Third-party data also speaks to Didi&#8217;s dominance. Aurora Mobile, an app tracking firm, <a href="https://www.jiguang.cn/reports/532">showed</a> that Didi had 77.6 million active users in March. Its closest rival Geely-backed Caocao was less than one-tenth of its size.</p>
<p>Didi had been operating in the red from 2018 to 2020, when it finished the year with a $1.6 billion net loss, but managed to turn the tide in the first quarter of 2021 by racking up a net profit of $837 million. It noted that the increased profit was primarily due to investment income from the deconsolidation of Chengxin, its cash-burning grocery group buying initiative, and an equity investment disposal.</p>
<p>Revenue from Q1 also more than doubled year-over-year to $6.6 billion. Uber, in comparison, racked up $2.9 billion in revenue for the period.</p>
<p>Didi plans to spend 30% of its IPO proceeds on shared mobility, electric vehicles, autonomous driving and other technologies. 30% will go towards its international expansion and another 20% will be used for new product development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Chipmaker Nvidia is acquiring DeepMap, the high-definition mapping startup announced. The company said its mapping IP will help Nvidia&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology sector, Nvidia Drive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The acquisition is an endorsement of DeepMap’s unique vision, technology and people,” said Ali Kani, vice president and general manager of Automotive at Nvidia, in a statement. “DeepMap is expected to extend our mapping products, help us scale worldwide map operations and expand our full self-driving expertise.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the biggest challenges to achieving full autonomy in a passenger vehicle is achieving proper localization and updated mapping information that reflects current road conditions. By integrating DeepMap&#8217;s tech, Nvidia&#8217;s autonomous stack should have greater precision, giving the vehicle enhanced abilities to locate itself on the road.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">“Joining forces with Nvidia will allow our technology to scale more quickly and benefit more people sooner. We look forward to continuing our journey as part of the Nvidia team,” said James Wu, co-founder and CEO of DeepMap, in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">DeepMap &#8212; founded by former employees of Google, Apple and Baidu James Wu and Mark Wheeler &#8212; can use Nvidia Drive&#8217;s software-defined platform to scale its maps across AV fleets quickly and without using too much data storage via over-the-air updates. Nvidia will also invest into new capabilities for DeepMap as part of the partnership.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nvidia is expected to finalize the acquisition in Q3 2021.</p>

Other than that, no one knows what the car will look like or who, if anyone, will be the manufacturer, although it&#8217;s not outlandish to imagine Apple creating both the hardware and software.</p>

		Jeff Bussgang of <a href="https://www.flybridge.com/">Flybridge Capital</a> is a former entrepreneur turned venture capitalist who teaches entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">When I was at Open Market in the 1990s, our CEO gave out the recently published book &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream/dp/0060517123">Crossing the Chasm</a>&#8221; to the executive team and told us to read it to gain insight into why we had hit a speed bump in our scaling. We had gone from zero to $60 million in revenue in four years, went public at a billion-dollar market cap, and then stalled.</p>
<p>We found ourselves stuck in what author Geoffrey Moore called &#8220;the chasm,&#8221; a difficult transition from visionary early adopters who are willing to put up with an incomplete product and mainstream customers who demand a more complete product. This framework for marketing technology products has been one of the canonical foundational concepts to product-market fit for the three decades since it was first published in 1991.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Why is it that in recent years, wild-eyed optimistic VCs and entrepreneurs keep undershooting market size across the tech and innovation sector?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I have been reflecting on why it is that we venture capitalists and founders keep making the same mistake over and over again &#8212; a mistake that has become even more glaring in recent years. Despite our exuberant optimism, we keep getting the potential market size wrong. Market sizes have proven to be much, much larger than any of us had ever dreamed. The reason? Today, everyone aspires to be an early adopter. Peter Drucker’s mantra &#8212; innovate or die &#8212; has finally come to pass.</p>
<p>A glaring example in our investment portfolio is database software company MongoDB. Looking back at our Series A investment memo for this disruptive open-source, NoSQL database startup, I was struck that we boldly predicted the company had the opportunity to disrupt a subsegment of the industry and successfully take a piece of a market that could grow as large as $8 billion in annual revenue in future years.</p>
<p>Today, we realize that the company’s product appeals to the vast majority of the market, one that is forecast to be $68 billion in 2020 and approximately $106 billion in 2024. The company is projected to hit a $1 billion revenue run rate next year and, with that expanded market, likely has continued room to grow for many years to come.</p>
<p>Another example is Veeva, a vertical software company initially focused on the pharmaceutical industry. When we met the company for their Series A round, they showed us the classic hockey stick slide, claiming they would reach $50 million in revenue in five years.</p>
<p>We got over our concerns about market size when we and the founders concluded they could at least achieve a few hundred million in revenue on the backs of pharma and then expand to other vertical industries from there. Boy, were we wrong! The company filed their S-1 after that fifth year showing $130 million in revenue, and today the company is projected to hit $2 billion in revenue run rate next year, all while still remaining focused on just the pharma industry.</p>
<p>Veeva was a pioneer in “vertical SaaS” &#8212; software platforms that serve niche industries &#8212; which in recent years has become a popular category. Another vertical SaaS example is Squire, a company my partner Jesse Middleton angel invested in as part of a pre-seed round before he joined Flybridge.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/microsoft-plans-to-launch-dedicated-xbox-cloud-gaming-hardware/"><strong>Microsoft thinks it can get cloud gaming to work</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Microsoft has big plans to make cloud gaming more than whatever is left of Stadia today. Per TechCrunch, the company is preparing to “launch a dedicated device for game streaming” and wants to integrate related tech into TVs. Gamers, it’s a good time to be one of us. So long as you don’t need a new GPU.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/fintech-giant-klarna-raises-639m-at-a-45-6b-valuation/"><strong>Klarna raises $639M</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The craze to stuff capital into successful buy-now-pay-later startups continued this week, with Klarna raising a huge stack of funds at a new, greater valuation.

<li><strong>Tech culture is changing:</strong> Recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/">unrest at Medium</a> after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/working-for-social-justice-isnt-a-distraction-for-mission-focused-companies/">related issues at Coinbase</a> and Basecamp are bringing to light changing cultural expectations at startups and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/does-what-happens-at-yc-stay-at-yc/">at the well-known Y Combinator accelerator</a>. Inside these debates, it’s not hard to see growing recognition among some tech employees of the leverage that they have over their employers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>Today we’re looking at a few key funding rounds from startupland, then some fund news and a roundup of recent unicorn IPOs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/ai-startup-eightfold-valued-at-2-1b-in-softbank-led-220m-funding/"><strong>AI-powered recruiting is valuable</strong></a><strong>: </strong>That’s the lesson from Eightfold AI’s recent funding round. The company just put together a fresh $220 million round at a $2.1 billion valuation, more than double what it was worth late last year. Notably, this valuation doubling was not born from Tiger Global’s largesse, but SoftBank’s second Vision Fund. The company, TechCrunch writes, “uses deep learning and artificial intelligence to help companies find, recruit and retain workers.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/productivity-startup-time-is-ltd-raises-5-6m-to-be-the-google-analytics-for-company-time/"><strong>Say hello to analytics for how you spend your workday</strong></a><strong>: </strong>There’s a fine line between keeping tabs on your workers and looking over their shoulders too frequently. Time is Ltd just raised $5.6 million for what we described as the Google Analytics for company time. For example, if a company wanted to know how much time its staff was spending in Slack versus, say, Teams, TiL could help. So long as the startup respects individual privacy, we’re fine with this.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/bukuwarung-a-fintech-for-indonesian-msmes-scores-60m-series-a-led-by-valar-and-goodwater/"><strong>Everyone needs fintech</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Including Indonesia’s micro, small and medium businesses. Evidence of that fact is evinced by a huge $60 million Series A raised by BukuWarung, a fintech company focused on just that market. Valar Ventures and Goodwater Capital led the investment.

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/waymo-and-jb-hunt-partner-to-bring-autonomous-trucks-to-texas-in-new-pilot/"><strong>Waymo’s self-driving push continues</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Alphabet’s huge running bet on self-driving technology is partnering with J.B. Hunt Transport Services to test self-driving trucks in the busy Texas market. It’s long been thought that freight vehicles that don’t spend much time on side streets could make good early targets for self-driving tech. Let’s see. While we&#8217;re on the subject of autonomous transit, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/scale-to-launch-a-mapping-product-to-address-the-changing-needs-of-its-autonomous-driving-customers/">Scale has news</a> on the data side of the equation.</li>

The payments unicorn announced a new piece of tech today, namely the ability for its payments stack to handle sales tax both internationally and domestically. Sales tax is a huge problem, and handling it could provide Stripe with a nice edge over some of its competition.</li>

Thus ends many a technology exit to a bigco; the larger entity really wants the tech and team, but doesn’t want to keep the company’s app alive. Apple, to its credit, won’t axe Dark Sky until 2022. After that, it’s all bets off.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple announced a batch of accessibility features at WWDC 2021 that cover a wide variety of needs, among them a few for people who can&#8217;t touch or speak to their devices in the ordinary way. With Assistive Touch, Sound Control and other improvements, these folks have new options for interacting with an iPhone or Apple Watch.</p>
<p>We covered Assistive Touch when it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/apple-watch-gets-a-motion-controlled-cursor-with-assistive-touch/">first announced</a>, but recently got a few more details. This feature lets anyone with an Apple Watch operate it with one hand by means of a variety of gestures. It came about when Apple heard from the community of people with limb differences — whether they&#8217;re missing an arm, or unable to use it reliably, or anything else — that as much as they liked the Apple Watch, they were tired of answering calls with their noses.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Esfz50PG9F"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/apple-watch-gets-a-motion-controlled-cursor-with-assistive-touch/">Apple Watch gets a motion-controlled cursor with &#8216;Assistive Touch&#8217;</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple Watch gets a motion-controlled cursor with &#8216;Assistive Touch&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/apple-watch-gets-a-motion-controlled-cursor-with-assistive-touch/embed/#?secret=Esfz50PG9F" data-secret="Esfz50PG9F" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The research team cooked up a way to reliably detect the gestures of pinching one finger to the thumb, or clenching the hand into a fist, based on how doing them causes the watch to move — it&#8217;s not detecting nervous system signals or anything. These gestures, as well as double versions of them, can be set to a variety of quick actions. Among them is opening the &#8220;motion cursor,&#8221; a little dot that mimics the movements of the user&#8217;s wrist.</p>
<p>Considering how many people don&#8217;t have the use of a hand, this could be a really helpful way to get basic messaging, calling and health-tracking tasks done without needing to resort to voice control.</p>
<p>Speaking of voice, that&#8217;s also something not everyone has at their disposal. Many of those who can&#8217;t speak fluently, however, can make a bunch of basic sounds, which can carry meaning for those who have learned — not so much Siri. But a new accessibility option called &#8220;Sound Control&#8221; lets these sounds be used as voice commands. You access it through Switch Control, not audio or voice, and add an audio switch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164719" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164719" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2164719" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png" alt="Images of the process of adding an audio switch to the iPhone." width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png?resize=768,509 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png?resize=680,450 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png?resize=1536,1017 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png?resize=2048,1357 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2164719" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The setup menu lets the user choose from a variety of possible sounds: click, cluck, e, eh, k, la, muh, oo, pop, sh and more. Picking one brings up a quick training process to let the user make sure the system understands the sound correctly, and then it can be set to any of a wide selection of actions, from launching apps to asking commonly spoken questions or invoking other tools.</p>
<p>For those who prefer to interact with their Apple devices through a switch system, the company has a big surprise: Game controllers, once only able to be used for gaming, now work for general purposes as well. Specifically noted is the amazing Xbox Adaptive Controller, a hub and group of buttons, switches and other accessories that improves the accessibility of console games. This powerful tool is used by many, and no doubt they will appreciate not having to switch control methods entirely when they&#8217;re done with Fortnite and want to listen to a podcast.</p>

<p>One more interesting capability in iOS that sits at the edge of accessibility is Walking Steadiness. This feature, available to anyone with an iPhone, tracks (as you might guess) the steadiness of the user&#8217;s walk. This metric, tracked throughout a day or week, can potentially give real insight into how and when a person&#8217;s locomotion is better and worse. It&#8217;s based on a bunch of data collected in the Apple Heart and Movement study, including actual falls and the unsteady movement that led to them.</p>
<p>If the user is someone who recently was fitted for a prosthesis, or had foot surgery, or suffers from vertigo, knowing when and why they are at risk of falling can be very important. They may not realize it, but perhaps their movements are less steady toward the end of the day, or after climbing a flight of steps, or after waiting in line for a long time. It could also show steady improvements as they get used to an artificial limb or chronic pain declines.</p>
<p>Exactly how this data may be used by an actual physical therapist or doctor is an open question, but importantly it&#8217;s something that can easily be tracked and understood by the users themselves.</p>

<p>Among Apple&#8217;s other assistive features are new languages for voice control, improved headphone acoustic accommodation, support for bidirectional hearing aids, and of course the addition of cochlear implants and oxygen tubes for memoji. As an Apple representative put it, they don&#8217;t want to embrace differences just in features, but on the personalization and fun side as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.ledger.com">Ledger</a> has raised a $380 million Series C funding round led by 10T Holdings. Following today’s funding round, the company has reached a valuation of $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Other investors in the funding round include existing investors Cathay Innovation, Draper Associates, Draper Dragon, Draper Esprit, DCG, Korelya Capital and Wicklow Capital. Some new investors are joining the round, such as Tekne Capital, Uphold Ventures, Felix Capital, Inherent, Financière Agache and iAngels Technologies.</p>
<p>Ledger’s main product is a hardware wallet to manage your crypto assets. They are shaped like USB keys and feature a tiny screen to confirm transactions on the device. The reason why that screen is important is that your private keys never leave your Ledger device.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other words, if you want to store a large amount of cryptocurrencies, you don’t want to leave them on an exchange account. If someone manages to sign in, they could withdraw all your crypto assets. With a hardware wallet, you remain in control of your crypto assets.</p>
<p>The company first launched the Ledger Nano S. You have to connect the device to a computer using a USB cable. More recently, with the Ledger Nano X, you can send and receive assets from your phone as the Nano X works over Bluetooth. Ledger also provides an <a href="https://enterprise.ledger.com">enterprise solution</a> for companies that want to add cryptocurrencies to their balance sheet.</p>
<p>Overall, Ledger has sold over 3 million hardware wallets. Every month, 1.5 million people use Ledger Live, the company’s software solution to manage your crypto assets. The company even says that it currently secures around 15% of all cryptocurrency assets globally.</p>
<p>It hasn’t been a smooth ride as the company has been around for seven years. After the crypto boom of 2018, interest for hardware wallets faded away. Moreover, as the company secures expensive assets, it has also suffered from a serious data breach — <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015559320-E-commerce-and-Marketing-data-breach-FAQ">272,000 customers</a> have been affected.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to launch new products, add more DeFi features to Ledger Live and support the growth of the crypto ecosystem in general.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Growth marketers are busy today helping all sorts of startups take advantage of the market boom, but it has been a hard journey through the pandemic.</p>
<p>We caught up with Tyler Elliston, founder of growth marketing firm <a href="https://rightsideup.com/">Right Side Up</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/tyler-elliston/">occasional contributor</a> at TechCrunch, about his experiences and what he’s seeing now.</p>
<p>It’s part of our new initiative to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/">find the best growth marketers for startups</a> based on founder recommendations. (Have a recommendation to share? <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">Please fill out the survey here</a>.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Keep reading for more from Tyler about maintaining focus and resources on the right kind of growth, even when the markets are rollicking.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s been a while since we last spoke with you. How have the trends in growth marketing shifted between the beginning of the pandemic and now, as we begin to exit lockdowns?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tyler Elliston:</strong> It’s been a rollercoaster! Early in the pandemic, we saw plummeting CPMs and slashed budgets. The rebound started relatively quickly over the summer of 2020 and accelerated into the fall and now 2021.</p>
<p>First, it was e-com companies, both those with strong pre-COVID sales online and historically brick-and-mortar brands scrambling to shift online to find much-needed sales. Then many other businesses &#8212; both new and existing &#8212; emerged with new products, value propositions and positioning to survive or even thrive in the pandemic.</p>
<p>Now, we continue to see very high consumer demand broadly and a corresponding eagerness amongst brands to accelerate customer acquisition, including through paid advertising. <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/monthly-funding-recap-funding-new-unicorns-and-exits-continue-at-a-strong-pace-in-may-2021/?utm_source=cb_daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20210609&amp;utm_content=intro&amp;utm_term=content&amp;utm_source=cb_daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20210609">Very active investors</a> have been a strong tailwind with respect to budgets.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;">Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?<br />
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/">Respond to our survey</a> and help us find the best startup growth marketers!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>We&#8217;ve talked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/verified-expert-growth-marketing-agency-right-side-up/">before</a> about how you like your team to be treated as a partner rather than a vendor. How have they been able to accomplish this during the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest thing is that we were able to lean on our reputation for being a good strategic partner that serves our clients’ best interests. Because they know we’ll tell them when we don’t think they should keep paying us for something, they also trust us when we say something like “I know this sounds crazy right now, but you should increase your budget due to a shift in your demand curve and channel economics.”</p>
<p>We were proactively honest with clients about what we believed the pandemic meant for their businesses, points of view we reached through <a href="https://rightsideup.com/growth-marketing-blog/the-case-for-channel-diversification-during-covid-19/">a framework we outlined on our blog</a>. For some, that meant supporting immediate termination of our partnership for them to conserve funds. In other cases, it meant pushing them to consider leaning into their performance marketing to capitalize on the changing environment and channel economics.</p>
<p>During the recovery, many companies have looked to external agencies and consultants to fill a temporary staffing gap in a lower-risk way. Shifting attitudes toward external resourcing and the evolution of company processes and culture to support remote workers have helped us more quickly and fully integrate with our clients’ internal teams.</p>
<p><strong>In a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/verified-expert-growth-marketing-agency-right-side-up/"> previous conversation</a>, you mentioned, &#8220;We regularly tell companies, &#8216;You don’t need any growth marketing right now. Focus on product-market fit.'&#8221; How can startups tell that it’s the right time to come work with you? </strong></p>
<p>Growth marketing is an amplification tool. It shines a bright spotlight on a product or solution, believing that <em>if only people knew </em>about it, they would want it and love it. The “want it” and “love it” represent product-market fit. To measure these, we look at customer reviews, referral activity leading to organic growth, retention, product engagement, and ultimately realized and expected lifetime value.</p>
<p>Seeing good conversion rates and attractive customer acquisition costs in small-scale channel testing suggest that not only is there a group of people that love it, but that they can be reached. These are prerequisites for sustainable growth, in my view.</p>
<p><strong>If an early-stage company has limited resources, how should they prioritize their funds in regards to marketing?</strong></p>
<p>First, invest in the product to make it excellent, as judged by real, paying customers. Marketing plays a role in this iterative process of traffic acquisition, funnel measurement and feedback collection; it’s just not “growth marketing.” It’s better considered to be “go-to-market marketing,” typically staffed by a product marketer or similar.</p>
<p>Once the product is in a good place, I typically recommend at least some investment in nonpaid marketing efforts and some testing of paid advertising, most often Facebook and/or Google. It’s rare for a company to find a great scalable channel if neither of these work. They serve as bellwethers for online marketing performance, generally speaking.</p>
<p>The best nonpaid marketing investments are highly contextual on the target customer and a company’s differentiation from the competitive landscape.</p>
<p><strong>What do startups continue to get wrong?</strong></p>
<p>Focusing on growth before finding product/market fit is the biggest [thing that startups continue to get wrong]. Early-stage founders are under intense pressure to grow successfully. For all but the lucky few who find incredible early customer success, finding product-market fit requires an unbelievable dose of patience. I think this is one of the reasons we see a pattern of success among founders who are solving a problem they deeply care about personally. For them, it’s first and foremost about solving the problem for themselves, not others. It’s not about money or some notion of macro success. It’s about micro success. From there, it’s an easy jump to passionately share this solution you so desperately needed.</p>
<p>From an advertising standpoint, many companies try to run too many channels at once and expect success too quickly, leading to false negatives. Most channels are quite nuanced at this point and require both expertise and patience to crack, for most businesses.</p>
<p><strong>How do your growth marketing strategies change when working with early-stage startups as opposed to mature companies?</strong></p>
<p>With very early-stage companies, our work is typically not related to growth, per se. It’s more about getting a foundation in place (ex: pixels, tech stack, initial value props, early staffing), driving traffic through new funnels to gather early data, or setting up email campaigns. Once the product is in a good place, we are often working with a founder or first marketing hire to stand up their initial paid channels and try to get them from 0 to 1. Can we spend $5,000, $10,000, $20,000/month with a good return?</p>
<p>On the nonpaid side, it could be executing a content strategy, launching a referral program or cultivating partnerships. Once a company is spending hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars per month profitably, we are typically helping them improve channel performance, better measure the incremental impact of their spend, break through to a new level of scale, or<a href="https://rightsideup.com/growth-marketing-blog/channel-diversification-which-marketing-channels-should-you-explore-next-to-scale-your-business/"> diversify channels</a> (paid or nonpaid).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Solving the varied challenges that arise in autonomous driving is an incredibly complex task, but even attempting to get started means ensuring you have quality data that&#8217;s accurate and well-annotated. That&#8217;s where Scale comes in, having identified early on that the AV industry would require annotation of huge swaths of data, including specialized lidar imaging. Now, co-founder and CEO Alex Wang tells me at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/supercharging-self-driving-super-vision/">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> (Extra Crunch subscription required) that it&#8217;s moving into mapping with a new product that&#8217;s coming later this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our role has continued to evolve,&#8221; Wang said, regarding how it works with its transportation industry partners, which include Toyota among many others. &#8220;You know, as we work with our customers, and we solved one problem for them around data and annotational data labeling, you know, it turns out they come to us with other problems that we can then help solve as well around data management; we launched a product called Nucleus for that. A lot of our customers are thinking a lot about mapping, and how to deploy with more robust maps. So we&#8217;re building a product, I&#8217;m going to announce that probably later this month, but we&#8217;re helping to address that problem with our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite my prodding, Wang wouldn&#8217;t provide any specifics, but he did go into more detail about the challenges of mapping, and what&#8217;s lacking in existing maps available to companies working on integrating those with AV systems that include other signals, like sensor fusion and vehicle-to-infrastructure components.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I think a big question for the overall space has been that historically, the industry has relied very, very heavily on mapping — we relied very, very heavily on very high-quality, high-definition maps,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The tricky thing about the world is that sometimes these maps are wrong, and how do you deal with that? [&#8230;] How do you deal with kind of this challenge of robustness, or updates. Even, if you think about it, Google Maps, which is the best mapping infrastructure in the world, by a huge margin, you know they don&#8217;t update quickly enough for [human] drivers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wang said that the challenge isn&#8217;t all that different from the one that Scale has been actively solving for most of its existence, which is that of the data flywheel. With autonomous driving, it&#8217;s of utmost importance to be able to collect and annotate data quickly and accurately, which results in ever better collection and annotation of future data, and more reliability for the assumptions the system is making about its environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Figuring out how to deal with the real-time nature of how the world changes is one really big, one really big component,&#8221; he said. While we still have to wait to see what exactly Scale has planned, it seems safe to assume that it&#8217;s all about building confidence in maps and mapping accuracy as a key ingredient in whatever they launch.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If money is the ultimate commodity, how can fintechs &#8212; which sell money, move money or sell insurance against monetary loss &#8212; build products that remain differentiated and create lasting value over time?</p>
<p>And why are so many software companies — which already boast highly differentiated offerings and serve huge markets— moving to offer financial services embedded within their products?</p>
<p>A new and attractive hybrid category of company is emerging at the intersection of software and financial services, creating buzz in the investment and entrepreneurial communities, as we discussed at our “<a href="https://www.battery.com/newsevents/fintech-the-endgame/">Fintech: The Endgame</a>” virtual conference and accompanying report this week.</p>
<p>These specialized companies — in some cases, software companies that also process payments and hold funds on behalf of their customers, and in others, financial-first companies that integrate workflow and features more reminiscent of software companies &#8212; combine some of the best attributes of both categories.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164479" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164479" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2164479" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fintech-image-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="470" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fintech-image-1.png 1425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fintech-image-1.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fintech-image-1.png?resize=300,138 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fintech-image-1.png?resize=768,352 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fintech-image-1.png?resize=680,312 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fintech-image-1.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164479" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Battery Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>From software, they design for strong user engagement linked to helpful, intuitive products that drive retention over the long term. From financials, they draw on the ability to earn revenues indexed to the growth of a customer’s business.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Fintech is poised to revolutionize financial services, both through reinventing existing products and driving new business models as financial services become more pervasive within other sectors.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The powerful combination of these two models is rapidly driving both public and private market value as investors grant these “super” companies premium valuations &#8212; in the public sphere, nearly twice the median multiple of pure software companies, according to a Battery analysis.</p>
<p>The near-perfect example of this phenomenon is Shopify, the company that made its name selling software to help business owners launch and manage online stores. Despite achieving notable scale with this original SaaS product, Shopify today makes twice as much revenue from payments as it does from software by enabling those business owners to accept credit card payments and acting as its own payment processor.</p>
<p>The combination of a software solution indexed to e-commerce growth, combined with a profitable payments stream growing even faster than its software revenues, has investors granting Shopify a 31x multiple on its forward revenues, according to CapIQ data as of May 26.</p>
<h2>How should we value these fintech companies, anyway?</h2>
<p>Before even talking about how investors should value these hybrid companies, it’s worth making the point that in both private and public markets, fintechs have been notoriously hard to value, fomenting controversy and debate in the investment community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’ll admit it: I was the student that tipped the teacher off that half of our English class, including me, was using SparkNotes to “read” &#8220;Twelfth Night&#8221; by Shakespeare, instead of actually reading the text itself. The site, which offered summaries of books on a chapter-by-chapter basis, was the best way to review novels before a quiz &#8212; or, was the best last-minute savior if you procrastinated too much and never got around to opening the book in the first place.</p>
<p>History in mind, it makes sense that the creators of everyone’s favorite procrastination tool, SparkNotes, are getting noticed by an edtech unicorn. <a href="https://www.litcharts.com/">LitCharts</a>, an offshoot of SparkNotes, got scooped up today by a newly minted edtech unicorn, Course Hero. The price of the deal was undisclosed. That said, Course Hero last raised an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/course-hero-a-profitable-edtech-unicorn-raises-rare-cash/">$80 million Series B in August 2020</a>, and assumedly a portion of that check went to this deal.</p>
<p>The creators of SparkNotes, Ben Florman and Justin Kestler, created LitCharts as an extension of their initial success. LitCharts provides notes, definitions and translations on over 2,000 literary texts. Similar to SparkNotes, LitCharts is all about making complex passages less complex. Course Hero founder Andrew Grauer estimates that about 30% of LitCharts’ subscribers are teachers and educators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We want to make sure that we have the best solution for a specific area, and then at the right moment in time, be able to make a really authentic recommendation of another tool or another offering that can be helpful for you [as a student],” Grauer said of Course Hero’s long-term ambition. That webbing — or connecting students from one resource to another — could be one of the benefits of virtual education, because there is essentially a history log of every error, stumble and pause that a student makes as they’re going through a lesson.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dxFyTKCoVy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/to-win-post-pandemic-edtech-needs-to-start-thinking-big/">To win post-pandemic, edtech needs to start thinking big</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;To win post-pandemic, edtech needs to start thinking big&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/to-win-post-pandemic-edtech-needs-to-start-thinking-big/embed/#?secret=dxFyTKCoVy" data-secret="dxFyTKCoVy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The heart of Course Hero, says Grauer, is to create a question-and-answer platform with extreme levels of specificity for students. It sells subscriptions to students that unlock access to all of its learning and teaching content, which include course-specific material created by teachers and publishers. Naturally, a big part of Course Hero’s strategy is to offer material on common subjects that students struggle with — English being one of those subjects.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve been looking at the data on the platform, and where students are actually getting stuck the most, where they need the most help, and where they are asking the most questions,” said Grauer. “And that&#8217;s quite informative.”</p>
<p>The company has been building out its literature library for the past five to six years. With LitCharts under its wing, Course Hero is putting a significant investment in its literature library, which is chockfull of videos, illustrations and notes on texts.</p>
<p>This is Course Hero’s second acquisition in the past eight months. In October, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/course-hero-symbolab-makes-a-rare-edtech-acquisition/">Course Hero acquired Symbolab</a>, an artificial-intelligence-powered calculator that helps students answer and understand complex math questions. That deal helped bolster Course Hero’s math offering, and today’s acquisition should help Course Hero deepen its literature resources. Both of these brands will continue to operate independently — a choice that Grauer says is part of his operating thesis of supporting the &#8220;decentralized empowerment of entrepreneurs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you centralize everything, maybe there&#8217;s power to that [since] it all looks the same, but actually in doing [that too] many times … you can actually move slower and not be able to move fast and make decisions and make progress toward the goal because you&#8217;re optimizing for so many small specific use cases,&#8221; he said. The two recent startups that Course Hero acquired have been operating for over a decade, and Grauer thinks that their scale and brand power is worth keeping as is, instead of forcing into an umbrella brand.</p>
<p>Across its various platforms, Course Hero estimates that it will hit between 2 million to 3 million paid subscribers this year, up from 1 million subscribers the year prior.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a <a href="https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron/2021/06/10/conference-de-presse-en-amont-des-sommets-du-g7-et-de-lotan">press conference</a> at the Élysée Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated his focus on online regulation, and more particularly toxic content. He called for more international cooperation as the Group of Seven (G7) summit is taking place later this week in the U.K.</p>
<p>“The third big topic that could benefit from efficient multilateralism and that we’re going to bring up during this G7 summit is online regulation,” Macron said. “This topic, and I’m sure we’ll talk about it again, is essential for our democracies.”</p>
<p>Macron also used that opportunity to sum up France’s efforts on this front. “During the summer of 2017, we launched an initiative to tackle online terrorist content with then Prime Minister Theresa May. At first, and as crazy as it sounds today, we mostly failed. Because of free speech, people told us to mind our own business, more or less.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In 2019, there was a horrendous mass mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand. And you could <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/15/new-zealand-tragedy-social-media-responmse/">find multiple copies</a> of the shooting videos on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Macron invited New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, several digital ministers of the G7 and tech companies to Paris.</p>
<p>They all signed a nonbinding pledge called the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/world-leaders-ask-tech-giants-to-tackle-toxic-content-with-christchurch-call/">Christchurch Call</a>. Essentially, tech companies that operate social platforms agreed to increase their efforts when it comes to blocking toxic content — and terrorist content in particular.</p>
<p>Facebook, Twitter, Google (and YouTube), Microsoft, Amazon and <a href="https://www.christchurchcall.com/supporters.html">other</a> tech companies signed the pledge. Seventeen countries and the European Commission also backed the Christchurch Call. There was one notable exception — the U.S. didn’t sign it.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FphH1aFpb9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/world-leaders-ask-tech-giants-to-tackle-toxic-content-with-christchurch-call/">World leaders ask tech giants to tackle toxic content with Christchurch Call</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;World leaders ask tech giants to tackle toxic content with Christchurch Call&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/world-leaders-ask-tech-giants-to-tackle-toxic-content-with-christchurch-call/embed/#?secret=FphH1aFpb9" data-secret="FphH1aFpb9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“This strategy led to some concrete results because all online platforms that signed it have followed through,” Macron said. “Evidence of this lies in what happened in France last fall when we faced terrorist attacks.” In October 2020, French middle-school teacher Samuel Paty was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Samuel_Paty">killed</a> and beheaded by a terrorist.</p>
<p>“Platforms flagged content and removed content within an hour,” he added.</p>
<p>Over time, more countries and online platforms <a href="https://www.christchurchcall.com/supporters.html">announced</a> their support for the Christchurch Call. In May, President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/08/christchurch-call-biden-backs-new-zealand-stand-against-online-extremism">joined</a> the international bid against toxic content. “Given the number of companies incorporated in the U.S., it’s a major step and I welcome it,” Macron said today.</p>
<p>But what comes next after the Christchurch Call? First, Macron wants to convince more countries to back the call — China and Russia aren’t part of the supporters for instance.</p>
<p>“The second thing is that we have to push forward to create a framework for all sorts of online hate speech, racist speech, anti-Semitic speech and everything related to online harassment,” Macron said.</p>
<p>He then briefly referred to French regulation on this front. Last year, French regulation on hate speech on online platforms has been widely deemed as unconstitutional by France’s Constitutional Council, the top authority in charge of ruling whether a new law complies with the constitution.</p>
<p>The list of hate-speech content was long and broad while potential fines were very high. The Constitutional Council feared that online platforms would censor content a bit too quickly.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;French constitutional authority rejects law forcing online platforms to delete hate-speech content&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/french-constitutional-authority-rejects-law-forcing-online-platforms-to-delete-hate-speech-content/embed/#?secret=ufWaJDnzNU" data-secret="ufWaJDnzNU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But that doesn’t seem to be stopping Macron from backing new regulation on online content at the European level and at the G7 level.</p>
<p>“It’s the only way to build an efficient framework that we can bring at the G20 summit and that can help us fight against wild behavior in online interactions — and therefore wild behavior in our new world order,” Macron said, using the controversial &#8220;wild behavior&#8221; metaphor (<em>ensauvagement</em>). That term was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/world/europe/france-ensauvagement-far-right-racism.html">first popularized</a> by far-right political figures.</p>
<p>According to him, if world leaders fail to find some common ground when it comes to online regulation, it’ll lead to internet fragmentation. Some countries may choose to block several online services for instance.</p>
<p>And yet, recent events have showed us that this ship has sailed already. The Nigerian government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">suspended Twitter operations</a> in the country just a few days ago. It’s easy to agree to block terrorist content, but it becomes tedious quite quickly when you want to moderate other content.</p>
