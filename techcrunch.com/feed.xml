										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In-house legal teams play a critical role in companies, but a lot of them don’t have the same kind of technology as their counterparts in sales or finance. Instead, they often rely on email, shared inboxes and spreadsheets. <a href="https://lawvu.com/">LawVu</a> gives them a cloud-based platform to share legal advice, documents, communicate with each other or external counsel and create reports for the rest of the company, including the C-suite. “LawVu is to legal what Salesforce is to sales teams,” co-founder and chief strategy officer Tim Boyne told TechCrunch in an email.</p>
<p>The Tauranga, New Zealand-based company announced today that it has raised $17 million NZD (about $11.9 million USD) in Series A funding led by Insight Partners, the venture firm known for <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/categories/scale-up/">its ScaleUp program for growth-stage startups</a>, with participation from returning investor AirTree Ventures. Its previous funding was a seed round of about $1.8 million USD led by Shasta Ventures and AirTree, <a href="https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/2021/05/04/299583/legal-tech-startup-lawvu-closes-seed-round-led-shasta-and-airtree-ventures">announced in May</a>.</p>
<p>LawVu was founded in 2015 by Boyne, who spent over a decade working in IT and operations at law firms, and Sam Kidd, a SaaS project management expert. Since LawVu was designed for distributed teams and remote workers, adoption increased dramatically in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. LawVu’s annual recurring revenue tripled in 2020 and is continuing to grow. While it has users in 30 countries, about two-thirds of its recurring revenue now comes from the United States and Australia, with clients like Telstra, AMP, Linktree, Expedia, PwC and Instacart.</p>
<p>The company plans to hire key leadership roles in the U.S. for its global go-to-market strategy and open U.S. offices as it continues developing LawVu’s technology.</p>
<p>LawVu is used by in-house legal teams ranging from one person to more than 300. Its fastest adoption is coming from teams of five to 500 legal professionals.</p>

<p>The startup serves in-house legal teams, instead of law firms, because “in-house lawyers have very different incentives and objectives to their private practice peers. This creates a vastly different set of needs for in-house lawyers to be effective at their jobs, particularly on the technology front,” Boyne said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, private practice lawyers focus on specific projects, charging clients on time spent. In contrast, in-house lawyers have to balance “reactive work,” or what their company asks for, and “proactive work,” or anticipating the business’ needs and reducing risks.</p>
<p>LawVu’s cloud platform serves as a “legal workspace” that combines all the tech tools in-house legal teams need. For example, it lets them manage matter (or legal issues that can include advice requests, contract executions, M&amp;A transactions or litigation), contracts, documents, e-billing and outsourced work.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Legl gets $7M to help law firms upgrade to digital workflows&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/legl-gets-7m-to-help-law-firms-upgrade-to-digital-workflows/embed/#?secret=Rk06DRM9cL" data-secret="Rk06DRM9cL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For in-house legal teams, LawVu&#8217;s analytics helps the rest of their company understand exactly what they do by providing metrics using data that is usually tucked away in email inboxes or a salesperson’s files, Boyne said.</p>
<p>“Legal work is largely invisible. Unlike other industries, legal is at the very beginning of its data journey,” Boyne said. He added, “as lawyers migrate their work into our workspace, everything is able to be captured as data. For the first time, the legal function now has the ability to see demand, types of work, team capacity, future hiring needs, what law firms are performing well, even process areas to automate with other tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to helping in-house legal teams become more productive, LawVu also helps them prove their value to decision makers. Boyne explained that legal teams are often overlooked because they are viewed as cost centers which do not directly add to a company’s profit, and who come in at the end of a project or decision.</p>
<p>“Typically as a business scales really fast, the legal team can be left behind with the capacity to only fight fires and no time to engage and add much needed strategic value. If you don’t have the data to back up the value and work you are doing, it becomes very hard to get more resources when needed, be this tech or people,” Boyne said.</p>
<p>“LawVu workspace allows them to streamline their service, have information at their fingertips, deliver outcomes quickly, measure and demonstrate value, all freeing them up to truly become a valued member of the business leadership team.”</p>
<p>Insight Partners managing director Rachel Geller will join LawVu’s board. In a statement, she said, “LawVu’s global growth speaks volumes to its future as a business and ability to provide high-value outcomes to legal teams. Its combination of intuitive user experience and excellent customer feedback make LawVu stand out in the legal tech industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Siga OT Solutions, an Israeli <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> startup that helps organizations secure their operations by monitoring the raw electric signals of critical industrial assets, has raised $8.1 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>Siga’s SigaGuard says its technology, used by Israel’s critical water facilities and the New York Power Authority, is unique in that rather than monitoring the operational network, it uses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/machine-learning/">machine learning</a> and predictive analysis to &#8220;listen&#8221; to Level 0 signals. These are typically made up of components and sensors that receive electrical signals, rather than protocols or data packets that can be manipulated by hackers.</p>
<p>By monitoring Level 0, which Siga describes as the &#8220;richest and most reliable level of process data within any operational environment,&#8221; the company can detect cyberattacks on the most critical and vulnerable physical assets of national infrastructures. This, it claims, ensures operational resiliency even when hackers are successful in manipulating the logic of industrial control system (ICS) controllers.</p>
<p>Amir Samoiloff, co-founder and CEO of Siga, says: “Level 0 is becoming the major axis in the resilience and integrity of critical national infrastructures worldwide and securing this level will become a major element in control systems in the coming years.”</p>
<p>The company’s latest round of funding — led by PureTerra Ventures, with investment from Israeli venture fund SIBF, Moore Capital, and Phoenix Contact — comes amid an escalation in attacks against operational infrastructure. Israel’s water infrastructure was hit by three known cyberattacks in 2020 and these were followed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/decrypted-hackers-attempt-to-poison-florida-towns-water-supply/">an attack on the water system of a city in Florida</a> that saw hackers briefly increase the amount of sodium hydroxide in Oldsmar&#8217;s water treatment system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The $8.1 million investment lands three years after the startup secured $3.5 million in Series A funding. The company said it will use the funding to accelerate its sales and strategic collaborations internationally, with a focus on North America, Europe, Asia, and the United Arab Emirates.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa is home to more than a billion people where a majority have limited or no access to vehicle financing. In fact, the continent has the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world. In 2019, Africa had fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales. The U.S. sold more than 17 million new cars that same year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, owning a car is a luxury very few people can afford. It is a similar case across Africa where car owners often recycle used cars between themselves because of the difficulty of accessing new ones. <a href="https://moove.africa/">Moove</a>, an African mobility company with a fintech play, wants to change that and is raising $23 million in Series A to scale </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moove </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ladidelano?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAADcQ8FABjW5jO79MRu88xUjUK_mFd4LYxFc&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3Bkt9csYDZRM2gEus%2BEO0Mow%3D%3D"> Ladi Delano</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/jide-odunsi-44b9b666">Jide Odunsi</a> in 2019. In an interview with TechCrunch, Delano said he and Odunsi, whilst trying to figure out the problems to solve in Nigeria after years of running successful businesses, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> startled by the figures highlighted above: Less than a million new cars sold in an entire continent and over 17 million in the U.S. alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It became clear to us that people aren&#8217;t buying cars in Africa because there&#8217;s no access to finance. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you look anywhere else in the world, you have financing in most parts of the developed world when you try to buy a car</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s that way in the UK, or Europe and the US. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s driving mobility drive and vehicle sales,&#8221; Delano said during the interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders saw it as a huge task to address this deficit and figured that deploying an asset financing model was the go-to approach. Moove says it is democratizing vehicle ownership by employing a revenue-based vehicle financing model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this applies to only a subset of the driving population across the continent: mobility entrepreneurs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why mobility entrepreneurs instead of the overall populace? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delano tells TechCrunch that inasmuch as Moove is changing how people have access to new cars in Africa, he wants the company to solve some of the unemployment problems facing the continent, even more so in Nigeria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So instead of providing the service for individuals from all spheres of life who cannot guarantee a payback, why not target mobility entrepreneurs who would use the opportunity to work and, in turn, generate income to pay back.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobility entrepreneurs include drivers who work in the mobility space (car-hailing, ride-hailing, bus-hailing, among others). Although they make up a small part of Africans who need Moove&#8217;s services, Delano says the market for mobility entrepreneurs is enormous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moove is Uber’s exclusive car financing and vehicle supply partner in sub-Saharan Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company embeds its alternative credit-scoring technology, allowing access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite loans. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It provides loans to these drivers by selling them new vehicles and financing up to 95% of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within five days of sign up</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can choose to pay back their loans over 24, 36, or 48 months, using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Uber</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moove&#8217;s loan repayment process is more suitable to drivers than what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">traditionally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exists in the market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nigerian banks, for instance, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to collect a 10-50% deposit from drivers; Moove says it charges 5%. The net effective annual interest rate also differs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nigerian banks charge between 20 to 25%; however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Moove runs on an 8-13% rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, when you consider the tenure of a vehicle financing loan, Nigerian banks rarely give a repayment duration of more than two years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moove&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">maximum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> duration is four years. In the long run, Delano says the company wants to extend the repayment duration to five years, a span with more parity to the West</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Moove is looking to add financing to other vehicle classes and types in the coming months, including buses and trucks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Moove </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019, it didn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launch until June 2020. In a full year of operation, Moove has scaled </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggressively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With headquarters in the Netherlands, the company counts Lagos, Accra, Johannesburg as cities where it operates. Moove has over 19,000 drivers using its platform, while up to 13,000 are on its waitlist. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moove-financed cars have also completed over 850,000 Uber trips, and Delano says the company has grown 60% month-on-month since last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moove raised a $5.5 million seed round last year. The majority of the funding came from the founders and Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, c-founder of Andela and Flutterwave, and a key partner at the company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to its $23 million Series A, Moove also revealed that it raised $40 million in debt financing, bringing Moove&#8217;s total funding to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $68.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speedinvest and Left Lane Capital led the Series A round. Other investors like DCM, Clocktower Technology Ventures, thelatest.ventures, LocalGlobe, Tekton, FJ Labs, Palm Drive Capital, Roka Works, KAAF Investments, Class 5 Global, and Victoria van Lennep, co-founder of Lendable, Verod,  Kepple Africa Ventures, and one of Moove’s existing lenders, Emso Asset Management, also joined the round. Moove&#8217;s investment is the first for many of its U.S. backers in this round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With Ladi and Jide at the helm of a world-class team, and their unique approach to vehicle financing, Moove has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> established itself as one of the most exciting tech companies in Africa,” said the general partner at Speedinvest, Stefan Klestil. “The company’s expansion to three cities in under 12 months demonstrates the huge demand for vehicle financing in Africa, where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> five percent of new cars </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are purchased</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with financing, compared to 92 percent in Europe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delano and Odunsi are British-born Nigerians educated at the London School of Economics, Oxford University, and MIT. Delano has always been an entrepreneur. Odunsi, on the other hand, was an investment banker at Goldman Sachs and a management consultant at McKinsey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both reconnected years after (since parting ways in their teens) to run a venture studio called Grace Lake Partners with thick they</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have built three non-tech successful businesses in Africa in the past decade</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Moove is their first tech business, and Delano calls it the fastest-growing he has ever run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Series A funding will allow Moove to grow and expand into new markets. It gives the company ammunition to develop and launch new products and services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> geared</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> towards gaining more share in a competitive market where Nigeria&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/nigerias-autochek-raises-3-4m-for-car-sales-and-service-platform/">Autochek</a> and South Africa&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/south-africas-flexclub-adds-5m-to-seed-round-to-scale-its-car-subscription-marketplace/">FlexClub</a> are making significant strides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delano believes what gives Moove an edge over other companies is its trademark of getting drivers to access new cars instead of used ones. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also adds that the company is moving towards creating electric and hybrid vehicle fleets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He cites helping mobility entrepreneurs who need to have fuel-efficient cars and climate change as reasons for creating this new product line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how will EVs be affordable for the average Uber driver in Africa? Delano argues that with Moove&#8217;s strong bargaining power with its OEM partners and the debt financing raised, Moove can buy new EV cars and resell them at a lower price to thousands of drivers. The aim is to ensure that at least 60% of the vehicles it finances are electric or hybrid in the coming years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is also trying to drive gender inclusion by increasing the number of female drivers using its platform to 50%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One interesting bit in Moove&#8217;s imminent plans is creating wallets for drivers who do not have bank accounts to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">make and accept payments. The feature is live only in Ghana and will be coming to other markets in no distant time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Moove’s technology is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fundamentally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> changing access to mobility and empowering thousands to earn a new source of income,” said managing partner at Left Lane Capital, Dan Ahrens. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we look ahead, the potential for that technology and the Moove team to expand even further is very exciting</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They have the opportunity to become a full-service mobility fintech and expand their offerings to insurance and other financial services.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UpGrad, a Bangalore-based startup that specializes in higher education and upskilling courses, hit a valuation of $1.2 billion with a $185 million funding round Monday as global investors plow record capital into firms in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Singapore&#8217;s Temasek led the financing round while the World Bank&#8217;s International Finance Corporation and IIFL participated. The first tranche of this unnamed round &#8212; about $120 million &#8212; was completed in April this year at a valuation of over $600 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are pleased with the investor interest ever since we opened up for fundraise, and had our maiden raise from Temasek, followed by IFC and IIFL in the last 60 days,” said Ronnie Screwvala (pictured above), co-founder and chairperson of upGrad, in a statement.</p>
<p>Six-year-old UpGrad, which in recent months has pushed for expansion in international markets, offers students over 100 courses in data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain, finance, programming, and law in collaboration with universities such as Michigan State University, the IIT Madras and IIT Delhi, and Swiss School of Business Management, Geneva.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187198" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187198" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2187198 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/upgrad-india.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="541" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/upgrad-india.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/upgrad-india.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/upgrad-india.jpg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/upgrad-india.jpg?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/upgrad-india.jpg?resize=680,359 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/upgrad-india.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187198" class="wp-caption-text">UpGrad website</p></div></p>
<p>More than a million users from over four dozen nations have accessed the platform&#8217;s courses, the startup said. On its website, UpGrad says it has over 62,000 paid students.</p>
<p>UpGrad is among the scores of Indian edtech startups that has reported skyrocketing growth in recent quarters as students move online following the shutting of schools due to the pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SoftBank and Tiger Global-backed Unacademy was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/indian-edtech-unacademy-valued-at-3-44-billion-in-440-million-fundraise/">valued at $3.44 billion</a> in a $440 million fundraise it unveiled last Monday. GGV Capital-backed Vedantu is in advanced stages of talks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/india-edtech-firms-byjus-and-vedantu-not-holding-acquisition-talks/">finalize a new round</a> that is poised to crown it the unicorn title, TechCrunch reported last week. Byju&#8217;s, which has raised over $1.5 billion in the past one year or so, is India&#8217;s most valuable startup.</p>
<p>Screwvala said UpGrad will deploy the fresh funds to explore merger and acquisition opportunities. Screwvala, who pioneered the cable television business in the South Asian market and also produced several Bollywood blockbusters, sold his entertainment conglomerate UTV to Disney at an enterprise valuation of $1.4 billion in 2013.</p>
<p>UpGrad is the 21st Indian startup to become a unicorn this year, up from 11 last year. In recent quarters, high-profile investors such as Tiger Global, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Falcon Edge, and Temasek have doubled down on their bets on India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just two months after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/indonesian-crypto-exchange-pintu-gets-6m-series-a-led-by-pantera-intudo-and-coinbase-ventures/">last funding announcement</a>, Indonesian crypto assets platform <a href="https://pintu.co.id/">Pintu</a> has closed a $35 million Series A+. The new round was led by Lightspeed Ventures, with participation from returning investors like Alameda Ventures, Blockchain.com Ventures, Castle Island Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Intudo Ventures and Pantera Capital.</p>
<p>Pintu’s previous funding, a $6 million Series A led by Pantera, Intudo and Coinbase Ventures, was announced in late May. Pintu is the latest investment app in Southeast Asia to quickly raise a much larger follow-on round as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a869e9c8-a48b-45d2-9fde-3c57b4214c0e">interest in retail investing grows</a>. Other examples include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/02/bibit-raises-another-growth-round-led-by-sequoia-capital-india-this-time-for-65m/">Bibit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/ajaib-raises-65m-series-a-extension-led-by-ribbit-capital-increasing-the-rounds-total-to-90m/">Ajaib</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investment-app-syfe-raises-29-6m-series-b-led-by-returning-investor-valar-ventures/">Syfe</a>.</p>
<p>Andrew Adjiputro, Pintu’s chief operating officer, told TechCrunch that Pintu raised a Series A+, instead of a Series A extension or Series B, because its focus on product development and execution is still the same. “With the Coinbase IPO and a lot of new users onboarding, we think it’s the right time for us to raise a larger round to finance faster growth,” he said. “It’s good momentum for us to launch new products and grab the market.”</p>

<p>Pintu plans to use its Series A+ on “aggressive” hiring for all its teams and rolling out new features and products. During the first half of 2021, Pintu says app downloads grew by 3.5x through organic growth, while active traders on the platform increased by 4x.</p>
<p>The platform currently offers trades on 16 cryptocurrencies, with plans to add more coins, including NFT tokens.</p>
<p>Adjiputro said Coinbase’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/coinbase-opens-at-381-per-share-valuing-the-crypto-exchange-at-nearly-100b/">successful initial public offering in April</a> helped fuel interest in crypto trading, especially among first-time investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“They became curious and the bread and butter of our business is essentially education,” said Adjiputro. “We have a lot of education on our platform and it attracts this new breed of investors who want to learn more.”</p>
<p>While the rate of retail investment in Indonesia is still low, it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/08/27/the-rise-of-the-retail-investor-a-new-force-in-indonesias-pandemic-hit-stock-market.html">growing quickly because of a confluence of factors</a>, including people’s desire to diversify and increase their assets during the pandemic.</p>
<p>For many of Pintu’s users, the app was their first introduction to investing instead of stocks, Adjiputro said. The company recently surveyed current users, asking about the top five asset classes they invest in. Crypto came in third after mutual funds and digital gold, and before stocks at number four.</p>
<p>The preference for crypto over stocks is echoed in figures <a href="https://kr-asia.com/over-6-5-million-indonesians-bought-or-sold-crypto-in-first-5-months-of-2021-ministry-of-trade-says">released by the Indonesian Ministry of Trade</a>, which showed that as of June 2021, there were over 6.5 million crypto investors in Indonesia, or about triple the 2.2 million public equity investors in the country.</p>
<p>Pintu is a licensed crypto broker under the Indonesian Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (BAPPEBTI). It has a low minimum investment rate of 11,000 IDR, or about 75 cents USD, making it more attractive to new investors.</p>
<p>Timothius Martin, the company’s chief marketing officer, was a first-time investor when he started using Pintu. He told TechCrunch that the number one draw was accessibility. “It’s easy to start investing and also withdraw assets. In Indonesia, we are now at a stage where people have heard about crypto, about Bitcoin, are very interested and may already want to invest, but there are not many options that are easy enough for them to understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of encouraging users to make an investment when they open the app for the first time, Pintu presents them with educational materials. For example, one of its features is Pintu Academy, a collection of articles and videos. While Pintu’s target demographic is millennials, it’s also attracting older demographics, including people who have traded other assets, like stocks, but want to learn more about the fundamentals of crypto trading.</p>

<p>Adjiputro said Pintu’s focus on education is what differentiates it from other Indonesian crypto platforms like Indodax and Tokocrypto.</p>
<p>The company is getting ready to launch new features, like Pintu Earn, a crypto asset account that lets users earn interest on a variety of crypto assets, and e-wallet integration for easier deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>It’s also deciding what coins to add next. “We’re very selective in terms of the coins we introduce, because this is a platform for first-time investors and beginners, so we want to protect them, not only in terms of our UI, but also the selection of coins we have,” Martin said.</p>
<p>Pintu’s criteria for new coins include ones that have a high market cap, meaning adoption is already relatively mainstream. It also looks at how long a coin has been around and its liquidity.</p>
<p>Pintu plans to focus on expanding in Indonesia before entering other Southeast Asian markets.</p>
<p>In a statement, Lightspeed partner Hemant Mohapatra said, “Lightspeed has invested in over 17 crypto and blockchain companies globally including FTX, Blockchain.com, Offchain Labs and more. We believe crypto is at an inflection point to become an important asset class globally, and will give rise to massive companies that will become regional leaders. Pintu has created the strongest market brand, best user experience and hands down one of the strongest teams we’ve ever come across in this market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello friends! That&#8217;s what Lucas always starts off with, right?</p>
<p>Lucas is out for a few weeks, so I&#8217;ll be handling Week In Review until he&#8217;s back. TL;DR on me: I&#8217;m Greg, and I&#8217;ve been with TechCrunch for a long, long time. I joined around the time Twitter found the vowels in its name and people thought Facebook&#8217;s valuation was laughably high at $15 billion. (For reference, Facebook&#8217;s market cap broke $1 trillion last month.)</p>

<h2>The Big Thing</h2>

<p>While Zoom has been around since 2011, its growth in 2020 was just on a whole different level. The pandemic blasted Zoom into the product-name-as-a-verb hall of fame pretty much overnight, with &#8220;let’s Zoom next week&#8221; joining the ranks of &#8220;Xerox this for me?&#8221; or &#8220;Photoshop it&#8221; or &#8220;Google it.&#8221;</p>
<p>With rapid growth, of course, comes growing pains.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among these pains was a significant uptick in trolling. The idea of &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/zoombombing/">Zoombombing</a>&#8221; was born, wherein unapproved attendees crash a Zoom call and flood it with nasty images, hate speech, and whatever else they can blast out before the moderator (often unfamiliar with Zoom&#8217;s interface) figures out how to lock it down.</p>
<p>By April of 2020, Zoom had tweaked its settings to make meetings a bit less zoombomb-able by default — but by that point, a lawsuit had already been filed. <em>Fourteen</em> lawsuits were filed, in fact, and later condensed into one. The suits argued that the company hadn&#8217;t done enough to prevent Zoombombing, as well as shared user data with third parties without the user&#8217;s permission.</p>
<p>This week Zoom agreed to an $85 million settlement, along with a promise to add even more safeguards against would-be crashers. It&#8217;s an interesting example of how massive/sudden popularity can cause all new problems … but, well, considering that Zoom&#8217;s market cap went from $34 billion in March 2020 to $118 billion as of this week, I doubt anyone there is too crushed about it.</p>

<h2>Other Things</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/google-gives-the-world-its-first-glimpse-of-the-pixel-6/"><strong>Google previews the Pixel 6</strong></a></p>
<p>Google&#8217;s next flagship Android phone is coming! When? TBD. How much? Good question! The company held back an unusual number of details in its first official acknowledgement of the Pixel 6&#8217;s existence, presumably to keep the focus on the custom AI-centric system on a chip they&#8217;re building for it. We know it&#8217;s got a big ol&#8217; camera bump (or &#8220;camera bar,&#8221; as they&#8217;re calling it) and there will be two models (Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro). But beyond that, we&#8217;re stuck relying on leaked specs for now. Fortunately, said leaks have been pretty spot on thus far.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/robinhood-is-now-a-stonk/"><strong>Robinhood&#8217;s wild ride</strong></a></p>
<p>Robinhood went public this week — and, perhaps fittingly for the app that played no small role in the GameStop/AMC/etc. meme stock bonanza earlier this year, its first few days of trading have been something of a rollercoaster. It opened at $38, slipped on day one, only to rocket up to the $70s on day two. As I write this, it&#8217;s slowly heading back down to earth with a current price of around $53. As for the root cause of the volatility&#8230; as Alex Wilhelm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/robinhood-is-now-a-stonk/">put it</a>: &#8220;This happens in 2021; we just have to get used to it.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/pokemon-go-influencers-threaten-a-boycott-after-niantic-removes-covid-safety-measures/"><strong>Pokémon Go players are mad</strong></a></p>
<p>Because the fundamental concepts of Pokémon Go (Talk to strangers! Hang out in huge groups!) don&#8217;t work as well in a pandemic, Niantic tweaked a bunch of stuff last year to make the game more playable from home. Among other things, they bumped up the real-world radius in which players could interact with in-game landmarks, allowing you to do more while moving less. This week they started rolling those changes back as a &#8220;test&#8221;&#8230; and, well, people are mad. The company presumably has some data-driven reasons to revert&#8230; but from the outside, with the pandemic still ongoing, it just looks like a bad decision. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Niantic has responded to the community uproar by forming an internal team to examine the options, promising updates by September 1st.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/whatsapp-view-once-disappearing-photos-video/"><strong>WhatsApp gets self-destructing, single-view photos</strong></a></p>
<p>This week, WhatsApp embraced its inner-Snapchat with the introduction of &#8220;view once&#8221; mode, which allows users to send photos and videos that can be viewed once before they self-destruct. Be aware, though, that you probably don&#8217;t want to go and use it to send those top-secret documents (and/or butt pics); unlike Snapchat, WhatsApp won&#8217;t even give you a heads-up if the viewer takes a screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/"><strong>Amazon wants to pay you $10 to scan your palm</strong></a></p>
<p>Last year Amazon started letting customers at its checkout-free grocery stores pay for goods by waving their palm print over a biometric scanner. Now they&#8217;re paying new customers $10 to scan their print and get onboard. This story was super popular on the site this week, and I&#8217;m left wondering if it&#8217;s because people are mad about Amazon gobbling up all this biometric data or because they want the $10. Probably a bit of both.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/"><strong>Twitter kills Fleets</strong></a></p>
<p>RIP Fleets. Less than a year after Twitter decided it <em>too</em> needed to clone Snapchat Stories, the company has ditched the concept. Why? It says it hoped it would entice new users; instead, the only people using it were those who were already pretty hardcore.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/"><strong>Square buys Afterpay</strong></a></p>
<p>The buy-now, pay-later space got real big real fast, and Square wants in. This week the company announced its intent to acquire Afterpay, a company that lets you split big purchases across 6 weeks without credit checks or interest, for an earth-shattering $29 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/googles-nest-cams-and-doorbell-get-a-refresh/"><strong>Google&#8217;s new Nest cams</strong></a></p>
<p>Google&#8217;s got some new Nest camera gear coming later this month, including a few things that you might be surprised they didn&#8217;t make already — like a battery-powered outdoor camera and a motion-activated floodlight camera for your porch.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/spacex-stacks-the-full-starship-launch-system-for-the-first-time-standing-nearly-400-feet-tall/"><strong>Elon&#8217;s Big Ship</strong></a></p>
<p>The fun news: This week SpaceX put together the tallest rocket ship in history, with its fully stacked Starship rocket coming together at an absurd 390 feet tall (or 475 feet if you count the launch pad). The less fun news: It&#8217;s not going anywhere for now, as this assembly was just a fit test — put it together, take it apart, make sure nothing broke. An actual launch of this mammoth configuration isn&#8217;t expected until later this year, but it should be quite the spectacle.</p>
<h2>Extra Things</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/5-factors-founders-must-consider-before-choosing-their-vc/">Five factors founders must consider before choosing their VC</a></strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve heard it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/angellist-ventures-avlok-kohli-on-rolling-funds-and-the-busy-state-of-vc/">on repeat</a> lately: With so much capital flooding the market, now is the time for founders to be picky about who they let invest. But what things should you consider? Agya Ventures&#8217; co-founder Kunal Lunawat has a few notes, from how well a VC understands your vision, to their background, to good ol&#8217; gut instinct.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/avoid-these-common-financial-mistakes-so-your-startup-doesnt-die-on-the-vine/"><strong>Avoid these common financial mistakes so your startup doesn&#8217;t die on the vine</strong></a></p>
<p>Startups are hard enough without trying to deal with screwed up finances. In this article, Zeni founder Swapnil Shinde outlines three different financial pitfalls that are easy to fall into, but avoidable: fragmented finances, old data, and founders that don&#8217;t know when/what to delegate.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Across industries, businesses are now tech and data companies. The sooner they grasp and live that, the quicker they will meet their customer needs and expectations, create more business value and grow. It is increasingly important to reimagine business and use digital technologies to create new business processes, cultures, customer experiences and opportunities.</p>
<p>One of the myths about digital transformation is that it&#8217;s all about harnessing technology. It’s not. To succeed, digital transformation inherently requires and relies on diversity. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the result of human intelligence, enabled by its vast talents and also susceptible to its limitations.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is imperative for organizations and teams to make diversity a priority and think about it beyond the traditional sense. For me, diversity centers around three key pillars.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>People are the most important part of artificial intelligence; the fact is that humans create artificial intelligence. The diversity of people — the team of decision-makers in the creation of AI algorithms — must reflect the diversity of the general population.</p>
<p>This goes beyond ensuring opportunities for women in AI and technology roles. In addition, it includes the full dimensions of gender, race, ethnicity, skill set, experience, geography, education, perspectives, interests and more. Why? When you have diverse teams reviewing and analyzing data to make decisions, you mitigate the chances of their own individual and uniquely human experiences, privileges and limitations blinding them to the experiences of others.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			One of the myths about digital transformation is that it&#8217;s all about harnessing technology. It’s not. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Collectively, we have an opportunity to apply AI and machine learning to propel the future and do good. That begins with diverse teams of people who reflect the full diversity and rich perspectives of our world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Diversity of skills, perspectives, experiences and geographies has played a key role in our digital transformation. At Levi Strauss &amp; Co., our growing strategy and AI team doesn’t include solely data and machine learning scientists and engineers. We recently tapped employees from across the organization around the world and deliberately set out to train people with no previous experience in coding or statistics. We took people in retail operations, distribution centers and warehouses, and design and planning and put them through our first-ever machine learning bootcamp, building on their expert retail skills and supercharging them with coding and statistics.</p>
<p>We did not limit the required backgrounds; we simply looked for people who were curious problem solvers, analytical by nature and persistent to look for various ways of approaching business issues. The combination of existing expert retail skills and added machine learning knowledge meant employees who graduated from the program now have meaningful new perspectives on top of their business value. This first-of-its-kind initiative in the retail industry helped us develop a talented and diverse bench of team members.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>AI and machine learning capabilities are only as good as the data put into the system. We often limit ourselves to thinking of data in terms of structured tables &#8212; numbers and figures &#8212; but data is anything that can be digitized.</p>
<p>The digital images of the jeans and jackets our company has been producing for the past 168 years are data. The customer service conversations (recorded only with permissions) are data. The heatmaps from how people move in our stores are data. The reviews from our consumers are data. Today, everything that can be digitized becomes data. We need to broaden how we think of data and ensure we constantly feed all data into AI work.</p>
<p>Most predictive models use data from the past to predict the future. But because the apparel industry is still in the nascent stages of digital, data and AI adoption, having past data to reference is often a common problem. In fashion, we’re looking ahead to predict trends and demand for completely new products, which have no sales history. How do we do that?</p>
<p>We use more data than ever before, for example, both images of the new products and a database of our products from past seasons. We then apply computer vision algorithms to detect similarity between past and new fashion products, which helps us predict demand for those new products. These applications provide much more accurate estimates than experience or intuition do, supplementing previous practices with data- and AI-powered predictions.</p>
<p>At Levi Strauss &amp; Co., we also use digital images and 3D assets to simulate how clothes feel and even create new fashion. For example, we train neural networks to understand the nuances around various jean styles like tapered legs, whisker patterns and distressed looks, and detect the physical properties of the components that affect the drapes, folds and creases. We’re then able to combine this with market data, where we can tailor our product collections to meet changing consumer needs and desires and focus on the inclusiveness of our brand across demographics. Furthermore, we use AI to create new styles of apparel while always retaining the creativity and innovation of our world-class designers.</p>
<h2>Tools and techniques</h2>
<p>In addition to people and data, we need to ensure diversity in the tools and techniques we use in the creation and production of algorithms. Some AI systems and products use classification techniques, which can perpetuate gender or racial bias.</p>
<p>For example, classification techniques assume gender is binary and commonly assign people as “male” or “female” based on physical appearance and stereotypical assumptions, meaning all other forms of gender identity are erased. That’s a problem, and it’s upon all of us working in this space, in any company or industry, to prevent bias and advance techniques in order to capture all the nuances and ranges in people’s lives. For example, we can take race out of the data to try and render an algorithm race-blind while continuously safeguarding against bias.</p>
<p>We are committed to diversity in our AI products and systems and, in striving for that, we use open-source tools. Open-source tools and libraries by their nature are more diverse because they are available to everyone around the world and people from all backgrounds and fields work to enhance and advance them, enriching with their experiences and thus limiting bias.</p>
<p>An example of how we do this at Levi Strauss &amp; Company is with our U.S. Red Tab loyalty program. As fans set up their profiles, we don’t ask them to pick a gender or allow the AI system to make assumptions. Instead, we ask them to pick their style preferences (Women, Men, Both or Don&#8217;t Know) in order to help our AI system build tailored shopping experiences and more personalized product recommendations.</p>
<p>Diversity of people, data, and techniques and tools is helping Levi Strauss &amp; Co. revolutionize its business and our entire industry, transforming manual to automated, analog to digital, and intuitive to predictive. We are also building on the legacy of our company’s social values, which has stood for equality, democracy and inclusiveness for 168 years. Diversity in AI is one of the latest opportunities to continue this legacy and shape the future of fashion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<div data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place, with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</div>

<h3>Apple to scan for CSAM imagery</h3>
<p>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">announced</a> a major initiative to scan devices for CSAM imagery. The company on Thursday announced a new set of features, arriving later this year, that will detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in its cloud and report it to law enforcement. Companies like Dropbox, Google and Microsoft already scan for CSAM in their cloud services, but Apple had allowed users to encrypt their data before it reached iCloud. Now, Apple&#8217;s new technology, NeuralHash, will run on users&#8217; devices, tatformso detect when a users upload known CSAM imagery &#8212; without having to first decrypt the images. It even can detect the imagery if it&#8217;s been cropped or edited in an attempt to avoid detection.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on iPhone and iPad, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/new-apple-technology-will-warn-parents-and-children-about-sexually-explicit-photos-in-messages/">will roll out protections</a> to Messages app users that will filter images and alert children and parents if sexually explicit photos are sent to or from a child&#8217;s account. Children will not be shown the images but will instead see a grayed-out image instead. If they try to view the image anyway through the link, they&#8217;ll be shown interruptive screens that explain why the material may be harmful and are warned that their parents will be notified.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Some privacy advocates <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/security-researchers-alarmed-apple-csam-plans/">pushed back</a> at the idea of such a system, believing it could expand to end-to-end encrypted photos, lead to false positives, or set the stage for more on-device government surveillance in the future. But many <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-csam-detection-icloud-photos-encryption-privacy/">cryptology experts believe the system</a> Apple developed provides a good balance between privacy and utility, and have offered their endorsement of the technology. In addition, Apple said reports are manually reviewed before being sent to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).</p>
<p>The changes may also benefit iOS developers who deal in user photos and uploads, as predators will no longer store CSAM imagery on iOS devices in the first place, given the new risk of detection.</p>
<h3>In-App Events appear on the App Store</h3>

<p>Though not yet publicly available to all users, those testing the new iOS 15 mobile operating system <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/03/app-store-events-ios-ipados-15/">got their first glimpse</a> of a new App Store discovery feature this week: &#8220;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/in-app-events/">in-app events</a>.&#8221; First <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-to-introduce-a-b-testing-and-in-app-events-to-the-app-store/">announced</a> at this year&#8217;s WWDC, the feature will allow developers and Apple editors alike to showcase directly on the App Store upcoming events taking place inside apps.</p>
<p>The events can appear on the App Store homepage, on the app&#8217;s product pages or can be discovered through personalized recommendations and search. In some cases, editors will curate events to feature on the App Store. But developers will also be provided tools to submit their own in-app events. TikTok&#8217;s &#8220;Summer Camp&#8221; for creators was one of the first in-app events to be featured, where it received a top spot on the iPadOS 15 App Store.</p>

<h1>Weekly News</h1>
<h3>Platforms: Apple</h3>
<p><strong>Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/student-ids-on-iphone-and-apple-watch-expand-to-canada-and-more-us-universities/">expands support</a> for student IDs on iPhone and Apple Watch</strong> ahead of the fall semester. Tens of thousands more U.S. and Canadian colleges will now support mobile student IDs in the Apple Wallet app, including Auburn University, Northern Arizona University, University of Maine, New Mexico State University and others.</p>
<p><strong>Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/05/apple-promotes-scam-apps-app-store">was accused</a> of promoting scam apps in the App Store&#8217;s featured section.</strong> The company&#8217;s failure to properly police its store is one thing, but to curate an editorial list that actually includes the scams is quite another. One of the games rounded up under &#8220;Slime Relaxations,&#8221; an already iffy category to say the least, was a subscription-based slime simulator that locked users into a $13 AUD per week subscription for its slime simulator. One of the apps on the curated list didn&#8217;t even function, implying that Apple&#8217;s editors hadn&#8217;t even tested the apps they recommend.</p>

<p><strong>Tax changes hit the App Store.</strong> Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=o0uodgu7">announced</a> tax and price changes for apps and IAPs in South Africa, the U.K. and all territories using the Euro currency, all of which will see decreases. Increases will occur in Georgia and Tajikistan, due to new tax changes. Proceeds on the App Store in Italy will be increased to reflect a change to the Digital Services Tax effective rate.</p>
<p><strong>Game Center changes, too.</strong> Apple said that on August 4, a new certificate for server-based Game Center verification will be available via the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gklocalplayer/3516283-fetchitems">publicKeyUrl</a>.</p>
<h3>Fintech</h3>
<p><strong>Robinhood <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/03/robinhood-surges-10percent-runs-past-38-ipo-price.html">stock jumped</a> more than 24% to $46.80</strong> on Tuesday after initially falling 8% on its first day of trading last week, after which it had continued to trade below its opening price of $38.</p>
<p><strong>Square&#8217;s Cash app <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/square-booked-a-45-million-impairment-on-its-bitcoin-holdings-2021-8">nearly doubled its gross profit</a> to $546 million in Q2</strong>, but also reported a $45 million impairment loss on its bitcoin holdings.</p>
<p><strong>Coinbase&#8217;s app now lets you buy your cryptocurrency <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/iOS-Airplay-2-Support-for-iOS/idc-p/5244350/highlight/true#M235171">using Apple Pay.</a> </strong>The company previously made its Coinbase Card compatible with Apple Pay in June.</p>

<p><strong>An anonymous app called Sendit, which relies on Snap Kit to function, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/anonymous-snapchat-app-sendit-surges-with-3-5m-installs-after-snap-bans-yolo-and-lmk/">climbing the charts</a> of the U.S. App Store after Snap suspended similar apps, YOLO and LMK.</strong> Snap was sued by the parent of child who was bullied through those apps, which led to his suicide. Sendit also allows for anonymity, and reviews compare it to YOLO. But some reviews also complained about bullying. This isn&#8217;t the first time Snap has been involved in a lawsuit related to a young person&#8217;s death related to its app. The company was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57522146">also sued</a> for its irresponsible &#8220;speed filter&#8221; that critics said encouraged unsafe driving. Three young men died using the filter, which captured them doing 123 mph.</p>
<p><strong>TikTok is testing Stories.</strong> As Twitter&#8217;s own Stories integrations, Fleets, shuts down, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/tiktok-confirms-pilot-test-of-tiktok-stories-is-now-underway/">TikTok confirmed it&#8217;s testing its own Stories product</a>. The TikTok Stories appear in a left-hand sidebar and allow users to post ephemeral images or video that disappear in 24 hours. Users can also comment on Stories, which are public to their mutual friends and the creator. Stories on TikTok may make more sense than they did on Twitter, as TikTok is already known as a creative platform and it gives the app a more familiar place to integrate its effects toolset and, eventually, advertisements.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/oh-facebook-changed-its-privacy-settings-again/">again re-arranged its privacy settings</a>.</strong> The company continually moves around where its privacy features are located, ostensibly to make them easier to find. But users then have to re-learn where to go to find the tools they need, after they had finally memorized the location. This time, the settings have been grouped into six top-level categories, but &#8220;privacy&#8221; settings have been unbundled from one location to be scattered among the other categories.</p>
<p><strong>A VICE report <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k78kmv/instagram-ban-restore-service-scam">details ban-as-a-service operations</a> </strong>that allow anyone to harass or censor online creators on Instagram. Assuming you can find it, one operation charged $60 per ban, the listing says.</p>
<p><strong>TikTok merged personal accounts with creator accounts.</strong> The change means now all non-business accounts on TikTok will have access to the creator tools under Settings, including Analytics, Creator Portal, Promote and Q&amp;A. TikTok shared the news directly with subscribers of its TikTok Creators newsletter in August, and all users will get a push notification alerting them to the change, the company told us.</p>
<p><strong>Discord <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/discord-custom-profiles-about-me/">now lets users customize their profile</a> on its apps.</strong> The company added new features to its iOS and Android apps that let you add a description, links and emojis and select a profile color. Paid subscribers can also choose an image or GIF as their banner.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter Spaces <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/twitter-spaces-cohosts/">added a co-hosting option</a> that allows up to two co-hosts</strong> to be added to the live audio chat rooms. Now Spaces can have one main host, two co-hosts and up to 10 speakers. Co-hosts have all the moderation abilities as hosts, but can&#8217;t add or remove others as co-hosts.</p>

<h3>Messaging</h3>
<p><strong>Tencent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-05/tencent-resumes-new-wechat-user-signups-after-upgrades?sref=gni836kR">reopened new user sign-ups</a> for its WeChat messaging app, after having suspended registrations last week for unspecified &#8220;technical upgrades.&#8221;</strong> The company, like many other Chinese tech giants, had to address new regulations from Beijing impacting the tech industry. <a href="https://supchina.com/2021/08/02/chinas-big-tech-crackdown-a-guide/">New rules address</a> how companies handle user data collection and storage, antitrust behavior and <a href="https://pekingnology.substack.com/p/politburo-meeting-calls-for-reinforcing">other checks</a> on capitalist &#8220;excess.&#8221; The gaming industry <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3143754/chinas-video-game-crackdown-state-backed-industry-group-plays-down">is now worried</a> it&#8217;s next to be impacted, with regulations that would <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/03/tencent-netease-shares-tank-after-chinese-media-calls-gaming-opium.html">restrict gaming for minors</a> to fight addiction.</p>
<p><strong>WhatsApp is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/whatsapp-view-once-disappearing-photos-video/">adding a new feature</a> that will allow users to send photos and videos that disappear after a single viewing.</strong> The Snapchat-inspired feature, however, doesn&#8217;t alert you if the other person takes a screenshot &#8212; as Snap&#8217;s app does.

With Quora+ ($5/mo or $50/yr), subscribers can pay for any content that a creator paywalls. Creators can choose to enable a adaptive paywall that will use an algorithm to determine when to show the paywall. Another product, Spaces, lets creators write paywalled publications on Quora, similar to Substack. But only a 5% cut goes to Quora, instead of 10% on Substack.</p>

The system of live agent support is similar to in-car or in-home security and safety systems, like those from ADT or OnStar, but works with users out in the real world.

<p>Fans of decentralized social media efforts <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches">now have a new app</a>. The nonprofit behind the open source decentralized social network Mastodon released an <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone/id1571998974">official iPhone app</a>, aimed at making the network more accessible to newcomers. The app allows you to find and follow people and topics; post text, images, GIFs, polls, and videos; and get notified of new replies and reblogs, much like Twitter.</p>

<p>TikTok users are teaching each other how to switch over to the Chinese App Store in order <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMdwsFTQo/">to get ahold of the Xingtu app</a> for iOS. (An Android <a href="https://modgameapk.net/xingtu-%E9%86%92-%E5%9B%BE-apk/">version</a> is also available.) The app offers advanced editing tools that let users edit their face and body, like FaceTune, apply makeup, add filters and more. While image-editing apps can be controversial for how they can impact body acceptance, Xingtu offers a variety of artistic filters which is what&#8217;s primarily driving the demand. It&#8217;s interesting to see the lengths people will go to just to get a few new filters for their photos &#8212; perhaps making a case for Instagram to finally update its Post filters instead of pretending no one cares about their static photos anymore.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><i data-stringify-type="italic">Thanks for reading Startups Weekly. Want the weekly digest in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. </i></p>
<p>I spoke to <a href="https://twitter.com/Pickavet">my editor</a> this week about the usual: upcoming stories, the future of the podcast and the existential dread of imposter syndrome amid a year-and-a-half of extreme change. The last bit took up the majority of the conversation. Go figure!</p>
<p>Our conversation was helpful because it put words to stresses that often sit in between the lines and gave weight to small things that get hidden during a pandemic-sized year. Don’t worry, I won’t bore you with my thought loops, but I will extract a few lessons that I think are broadly applicable to Startups Weekly readers, because based on your clicks, I know you’re into tips (and earnest ones, at that):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Give yourself grace.</strong> The pandemic has been confusing, imbalanced and brought a lot of loss to a lot of people. If you feel like you’re operating at anything less than 100% right now, remember that you are operating during a time when the world feels like it’s depending on a frayed lightbulb for guidance. Before you are hard on yourself for not being productive, think about where your productivity standards are coming from, and if they are even fair in the first place.</li>
<li><strong>Your problems are not unique.</strong> While we all are diverse, nuanced individuals, we aren’t alone in a lot of what makes us human. Everyone overthinks, everyone soul searches, everyone has personal and professional insecurities that bubble up in non-obvious ways. By believing that your problems are not entirely unique, I think you’ll find yourself feeling more in control of turbulence. Which brings me to my next point …</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability is everything. </strong>Vulnerability was front and center in the first inning of the pandemic, where we were all brought into each other&#8217;s living rooms and home offices and backyards through Zoom. That vibe has somewhat faded as we’ve adapted more and more to distributed work, but it doesn’t mean we can’t try to find ways to be more vulnerable with each other. Let yourself have a voice, even in moments where it’s easier to stay quiet, because you will feel closer at the end of it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Take what you will from the above advice (or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/10-ways-founders-can-manage-their-mental-health-while-fundraising/">see these tips</a> from a fellow entrepreneur), but I think it all boils down to a belief that we should be humans first, and <em>insert job role here</em> second. It’s truly (still) an unprecedented time in this world, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/ending-the-mental-health-stigma-in-the-tech-community/">ending mental health stigma</a> in general is a worthwhile goal.</p>
<p>The rest of this newsletter is about a cyberattack on a VC firm, AfterSquare, and an EC-1 about 911. Before we get on with it, we’re excited to announce that TechCrunch is launching another newsletter!

<p>Advanced Technology Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm with $1.8 billion in assets, was hit by a ransomware attack. Cybercriminals <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/atv-venture-capital-ransomware/">stole personal information on some 300 of ATV’s limited partners</a>, also known as the people who have put millions of millions into its fund, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker/status/1422615456167366663">a scoop by Zack Whittaker. </a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>This particular attack stole key information on a hush-hush part of how venture money works. VC firms often do not disclose all of their LPs due to competitive advantage and secrecy. The firm may not want competitors to know who is backing them, while a limited partner may not want others to know where their money is going. As ransomware groups “continue to go big-game hunting,” per Whittaker, LP lists are a part of that — and other VC firms should take note.</p>

<p>Fintech lit up this week after Square <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/">bought ‘buy now, pay later’ giant Afterpay for $29 billion</a>. The deal, which is expected to go through next year, will see Afterpay integrate its services into Square’s Seller and Cash Pay ecosystems. <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann Azevedo reported the news</a> amid the sector’s heat up, and Alex Wilhelm shared <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/?tpcc=ECTW2020">why he thinks Square landed on that magic number. </a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Everyone is building their own in-house BNPL service, from Shopify (!), to PayPal to, reportedly, Apple. So, while the &#8220;Shopify should buy Affirm&#8221; theories were aplenty, reporter Ryan Lawler gave more context<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/what-squares-acquisition-of-afterpay-means-for-startups/"> on what this deal means for startups.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.baincapitalventures.com/team/matth/">Matthew Harris</a> of Bain Capital Ventures told TechCrunch that, as the BNPL space fills up, he doesn’t see “a lot of headroom/new angles in the consumer BNPL space … scale matters and it will be hard for new entrants to achieve escape velocity.”</p>
<p>Instead, he thinks there is opportunity for BNPL models to break into the B2B space, where companies can “replace/enhance traditional invoice financing and trade credit.”</p>

<p>TechCrunch Managing Editor Danny Crichton dove into the heart of 911 and emergency response in our latest EC-1 on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1/">RapidSOS.</a> The company, which has raised more than $190 million, has built an emergency response data platform that helps first responders access a firehose of data in high-intensity situations. It processes more than 150 million emergencies every year, and per Crichton, it’s almost certainly integrated into your smartphone right now.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> From the smoking-pizza-oven early years to its pivot without product design, RapidSOS’ story shows how much you can get done in a decade of stagnation from Capitol Hill.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>The Q2 earnings cycle is powering along, which means that your humble Exchange crew have been on the phone with a number of public-company CEOs working to bring you the trends and notes that matter. To that end, today we’re going to check in on Appian, Paycom and BigCommerce.</p>
<p>After that we’ll peek at fresh material that will bolster our recent dives <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/">into the BNPL world</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/do-bronze-medals-ever-make-sense-for-unicorns/">startup competition</a>. So, a grab bag today, and hopefully one full of goodies!</p>
<p>Let’s start with <strong>Appian</strong>. I got to know the company midpandemic when a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/covid-19-is-driving-demand-for-low-code-apps/">host of companies were hammering away</a>, building apps using its low-code tech. At the time Appian was worth about half of what it is today. (You can read the company’s Q2 report <a href="https://investors.appian.com/index.php/static-files/e2b1dbd4-a4c7-4987-af1d-20b97cef253f">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Since then the company has continued its cloud push, slowing shedding services revenues in favor of high-margin SaaS incomes. It’s not the only company executing a related transformation. But for our purposes today I want to talk about what comes after the basic low-code work that we spent much of 2020 digging into.</p>
<p>Appian announced that it is buying process mining firm <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lana-labs">Lana Labs</a> in conjunction with its second-quarter earnings. What’s process mining? Thanks for asking. Process mining is a software technique for finding processes inside of companies that <em>can</em> be automated. It’s all well and good to buy an RPA service for your company, but if you don’t know what you can automate, you might not wind up getting full value.</p>
<p>All this matters in the case of Appian as the company now has process mining, RPA and low-code tooling to help companies create applications under a single roof. In practice the parts work together with process mining identifying things to automate, a workflow that is then taken up by RPA and other forms of automation &#8212; AI, human &#8212; to allow companies to better get their operations in efficient order.</p>
<p>I asked Appian CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattcalkins/">Matt Calkins</a> about the difference between workflows and apps. He said that they are pretty much the same thing. This makes the low-code world a bit more grokable. How many apps could corporations really need, I’ve always wondered. The same question regarding how many workflows that companies may need to automate feels different. It feels like there’s many, many more possibilities. So, a bigger TAM.</p>
<p>Updating my thinking about low-code, this dynamic makes me more bullish on the software method if it’s more in service of helping companies digitize their operations and automate rote tasks than simply building more apps.</p>
<p>Turning the page to <strong>BigCommerce</strong>, the open-SaaS e-commerce platform has had a good few quarters, posting generally accelerating revenue growth despite Shopify’s rising global profile. It also just marked its first anniversary <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/after-shopifys-huge-quarter-bigcommerce-raises-its-ipo-price-range/">since going public</a>, so I spent a few minutes with CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brent-bellm-3b305214/">Brent Bellm</a> to chat about what he’s learned in that year, and if going public was worth it. (You can read the company’s Q2 report <a href="https://investors.bigcommerce.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bigcommerce-announces-second-quarter-financial-results-0">here</a>.)</p>
<p>It was, he said. He made two cases for taking companies public that I wanted to share. They add up to faster growth at BigCommerce, though Bellm cautioned that it was impossible to disaggregate growth stemming from the following factors from other elements that contributed to his company’s recent performance.</p>
<p>Regardless, a few reasons to go public:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credibility: </strong>Being a public company with open finances can breed in-market confidence. Startups have an awkward habit of dying somewhat often. Public companies far less so. This means that customers are more likely to trust a company, perhaps boosting its chances of securing deals. Even more, partners are more confident in BigCommerce now that it is public, per Bellm, helping drive more partnerships and growth.</li>
<li><strong>Increased attention:</strong> I thought that I understood this element of going public, but Bellm expanded my perspective. Of <em>course</em> going public is a branding event. But that’s where I thought this particular edge wrapped up. Instead, the CEO explained that now when his company does <em>a thing</em> the analyst community has to pay attention, for example. So it’s easier for BigCommerce to stay in the public eye as a public company than when it was a startup. Call it boosted ambient market noise, in a good sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bellm told The Exchange that going public was “overwhelmingly positive” for his company. Unicorns, take note.</p>
<p>Then there was <strong>Paycom</strong>. This chat was mostly about talent in two ways. First, Paycom is dealing with the same competitive tech talent market as every other company. But notably it’s seeing a tight supply of the talent it needs despite being far from traditional technology hubs. Paycom is based in Oklahoma, notably. (You can read the company’s Q2 report <a href="https://investors.paycom.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Paycom-Software-Inc.-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx">here</a>.)</p>
<p>But the talent market and its general tightness today is impacting Paycom in another way: The HR-tech company sells software that helps companies secure and retain talent. Those businesses, per the company’s CEO Chad Richison, are benefiting from companies’ putting more focus on not letting talent go after they went through all the work of getting them aboard.</p>
<p>Also the labor market has become very similar to the venture capital market, it turns out. Richison said that today you have to make a choice on whether to hire someone after you interview them within a few days. Before you had more time. Just like VCs today are forced to cut checks in days instead of weeks and months.</p>
<p>Hot economy summer, or something.</p>
<h2>The startup BNPL market</h2>
<p>Hope remains for the startup BNPL market, per <a href="https://twitter.com/ozdane">Brad Paterson</a>, the CEO of <a href="https://www.splitit.com/">Splitit</a>. Splitit allows customers to use their current credit cards to make installment payments. So it’s a mix of traditional credit and BNPL. (SplitIt’s Crunchbase page is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/payitsimple">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Paterson volunteered to provide comment on the current market for BNPL startups, and after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/what-squares-acquisition-of-afterpay-means-for-startups/">chatting much about the Square-Afterpay deal</a>, I wanted to get his take on why smaller companies are going to be able to survive behemoths charging into their market.</p>
<p>In an email, Paterson argued that a wealth of factors, what he described as “average purchase price, length of installment plan, industry vertical serviced, etc.” will protect margins in the space. And that as BNPL solutions can “extend beyond smaller purchases,” there will be room for startups in the space.</p>
<p>Perhaps the better question is how much more work there is to do with consumer credit and checkout. That sounds much more like an infinite problem space than just BNPL tooling itself.</p>
<h2>Startup competition</h2>
<p>Returning to our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/do-bronze-medals-ever-make-sense-for-unicorns/">earlier work regarding startup competition</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33">Elizabeth Yin</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/HustleFundVC">Hustle Fund</a> sent in a list of notes that I want to share. When we were discussing the importance of being a leading player in markets for startups, we were mostly discussing the marketplace space, areas where young companies are trying to connect different parties.</p>
<p>In ride-hailing, that’s drivers and riders. Food delivery is even more complex, with delivery drivers, consumers and food-generative business establishments. You get the idea. Per Yin, being content with lower-tier market share is “generally really tough.” She continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>The value of a marketplace usually increases as both the supply and demand sides increase. E.g., more listings + customers on Airbnb. More drivers and riders on Uber. Etc. In fact, in many cases, that is the <em>sole</em> value.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re No. 3 or No. 4 in the market, retention is a big potential concern, because you have to ask yourself what will enable you to keep your supply and demand sides from defecting to the No. 1 or No. 2 player that has a larger network? This is why you tend to see consolidation of marketplaces.</p>
<p>For early backers, they may still end up doing fine via an acquisition to No. 1 or No. 2, but it may end up being a magnitude or two off from the outcome of backing the No. 1 or No. 2 marketplace. For this reason, if there are already a couple of marketplaces that have a strong head start, early-stage investors tend to shy away from backing a new player.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yin also answered our question ​​startup marketplace competition generally yielding markets with a small number of leading players, and a dearth of other competitors as smaller entrants are chased out due to low market share. She added an interesting perspective regarding the impact of capital:</p>
<blockquote><p>In general, yes, but investors also play a role in this phenomenon. Once a couple of companies get going, investors tend to pour more into those initial leaders AND others tend to shy away from backing competitors. And once money floods a space, it&#8217;s really customer acquisition costs that become an issue &#8212; CAC gets driven up by the top companies. (We saw this with the rise in food delivery companies). This is why you can&#8217;t really bootstrap a marketplace company very easily &#8212; you can&#8217;t afford to acquire customers.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is, in a sense, an answer to the question about kingmaking in the startup world. VCs are not deciding who wins in many cases, but the impact of capital really can skew results in the marketplace world. Now, let’s stop before we start endorsing how the first Vision Fund disbursed capital! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Hugs, and get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Your friend,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/">TechCrunch’s China roundup</a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The question for the tech news cycle in China these days has become: Who is Beijing&#8217;s next target? Regulatory clampdowns are common in China&#8217;s tech industry but the breadth of the recent moves has been unprecedented. No major tech giant is exempted and everyone is being attacked from a slightly different angle, but Beijing&#8217;s message is clear: Tech businesses are to align themselves with the interests and objectives of Beijing.</p>
<h2>Education curbs hit tech giants</h2>
<p>The government&#8217;s motivation isn&#8217;t always ideological. It could lead to policies that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/31/china-roundup-keep-down-internet-upstarts-cultivate-hard-tech/"> rein in the unruly private tutoring sector</a> in the hope of easing pressure on students and parents. Recent orders from Beijing have strictly limited after-school tutoring, though they also sparked a wave of sympathy for public school teachers who work at lucrative tutoring centers to compensate for their meager salaries.</p>
<p>The effects of the education crackdown are also trickling down to internet companies. For the past few years, ByteDance had been aggressively<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/bytedance-announces-its-first-gadget-in-a-big-education-push/"> building an online education business</a> through a hiring and acquisition spree in part to diversify an ad-based video business. Its plan seems to be in shambles as it reportedly plans to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/bytedance-lay-off-staff-close-businesses-over-china-tutoring-clampdown-sources-2021-08-05/">lay off staff in its education department</a> following recent the clampdown.</p>
<p>The restraints are also hitting American companies. Duolingo, the language learning app, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-05/china-removes-duolingo-from-app-stores-targeting-u-s-edtech">was removed from several app stores in China</a>. While it&#8217;s not immediately clear whether the action was the result of any policy change, the government recently, along with its restraints on extra-curriculum, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-bars-foreign-curriculum-ownership-some-private-schools-2021-05-17/">barred foreign curricula in schools from K-9</a>.</p>
<h2>Games are opium</h2>
<p>It could be tricky to read the top leaders&#8217; minds because their messages could come through various government departments or state-affiliated media outlets, carrying different weights.</p>
<p>This week, Tencent is in the authorities&#8217; crosshairs. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tencent-falls-after-china-media-calls-online-gaming-spiritual-opium-2021-08-03/">About $60 billion of its market cap</a> was wiped after the Economic Information Daily, an economic paper supervised by China&#8217;s major state news agency Xinhua, published an article (which was taken down shortly) describing video games as &#8220;spiritual opium&#8221; and cited the major role Tencent plays in the industry. Shares of Tencent&#8217;s smaller rival NetEase were also battered.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This certainly isn&#8217;t the first time Tencent and the gaming industry overall were slammed by the government for their impact on underage players. Tencent has been working to appease the authorities by introducing protections for young players, for instance, by tightening age checks several times.</p>
<p>Tencent, which has a sprawling online empire of social networks, payments and music on top of games, has also promised to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/tencent-motto-tech-for-good/">&#8220;do [more social] good&#8221; through its products</a>. And following the recent op-ed from the state paper, Tencent <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-china-media-b48e08c16d0c299a970fda6acd7bcc79">further restricted</a> the amount of time and money children can spend inside games. But after all, the company still depends largely on addictive game mechanics that lure players to open loot boxes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186395" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186395" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2186395 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="632" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png 1286w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png?resize=768,474 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png?resize=680,420 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186395" class="wp-caption-text">Tencent share prices over the past six months. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google Finance</p></div></p>
<h2>Fix the algorithms</h2>
<p>The other camp of tech companies feeling the heat is those dependent on machine learning algorithms to distribute content. The Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party, the country&#8217;s watchdog of public expressions, along with several other government organs, issued an <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2021-08/02/c_1127722893.htm">advisory</a> to &#8220;strengthen the study and guidance of online algorithms and carry out oversight over algorithmic recommendations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government&#8217;s goal is to assert more control over how algorithmic black boxes affect what information people receive. Shares of Kuaishou, TikTok&#8217;s archrival in China, tanked on the news. Since its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/kuaishou-ipo/">blockbuster initial public offering</a> in February, Kuaishou&#8217;s stock price has tumbled<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-rivals-stock-slides-amid-removal-of-u-s-app-criticism-of-video-platforms-11628166283"> as much as 70%</a>. Meanwhile, the Beijing-based short video firm is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/bytedance-rival-kuaishou-shuts-down-controversial-short-video-app-zynn-in-us/">shuttering</a> one of its overseas apps called Zynn, which has caused controversy over plagiarism. But its overseas user base is also rapidly growing, crystalizing in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/tiktoks-chinese-nemesis-kuaishou-hits-1-billion-monthly-users-worldwide/"> one billion monthly users worldwide</a> recently.</p>
<h2>End of &#8220;two-choose-one&#8221;</h2>
<p>The week hasn&#8217;t ended. On Friday morning, The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-antitrust-regulator-planning-to-fine-meituan-about-1-billion-11628238951">reported</a> that the country&#8217;s antitrust regulator is preparing to fine Meituan, China&#8217;s major food delivery platform, $1 billion for allegedly abusing its market dominance. In 2020, Meituan <a href="http://meituan.todayir.com/html/index.php">earned 114.8 billion yuan</a> or $17.7 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>Until recently, forcing suppliers to pick sides had been a common practice in China&#8217;s e-commerce world. Alibaba did so by forbidding sellers to list on rivaling platforms, a practice that resulted in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/china-gets-serious-about-antitrust-fines-alibaba-2-75b/">$2.75 billion antitrust penalty in April</a>. We will see where the government will act next as it continues to curb the power of its tech darlings.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nimrod-golan-yanay-8196a4/">Nimrod Golan-Yanay</a> is the CEO of <a href="https://www.urbanaero.com/">Urban Aeronautics</a>, the Israel-based aerospace company behind the world’s first wingless, eco-friendly and compact aircraft fleet designed specifically for dense urban environments.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Nearly everyone knows the pain of sitting in traffic watching valuable minutes tick by. Just as bad is the maddening search for a parking spot, or even just a safe place to hop out of the backseat of an Uber on a dense, buzzing city street.</p>
<p>For emergency medical providers, these headaches can literally mean life or death. Who among us hasn’t stared up at the sky behind a sea of red taillights, wishing we could rise above the gridlock and get to whatever corner of the city in a fraction of the time?</p>
<p>The truth is, flying cars are a reality. The aviation technology exists and early-stage regulatory review is underway in both the <a href="https://evtol.com/news/legislation-secure-leadership-advanced-air-mobility-introduced-us-congress/">U.S. House and the Senate</a> to bring eVTOLs — electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles — to market.</p>
<p>What doesn’t exist is a place to land them. The promise of urban air mobility is the promise of superlative convenience — a trip to the airport that would regularly take 90 minutes door-to-door whittled down to 10. For this promise to be realized, eVTOL landing points must be as accessible as taxi lines — think a five-minute walk (or one-minute elevator ride) from your office.</p>
<p>And sure, we’ve seen office buildings and hospitals on the outer edges of cities build heliports on their roofs. But the truth is, helicopters’ external rotors make them too noisy and too dangerous to land in tight spaces. Heliports have to be on the outer borders of cities — they need the extra space for safety (and noise) concerns.</p>
<h2>Urban flight today</h2>
<p>I have over 25 years of experience as a helicopter pilot. I know that urban air travel is nothing new. However, noise ordinances, space constraints and safety measures needed to make commercial helicopter flights viable have largely limited their use.</p>
<p>Existing VTOLs are much better designed for repeated commercial use, but they still don’t solve for noise. Most importantly, they do not eliminate the risks associated with external moving mechanical components and large wingspans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Instead of looking to airports as the model for advanced air mobility, we should look to metro hubs that are accessible to everyone, with multiple departures and arrivals per day.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>These VTOLs also require far more space for takeoff and landing — which means intracity travel won&#8217;t be feasible without massive infrastructure investments, a fact pointed out by countless urban air mobility analysts and even folks at NASA. For it to work, cities would have to turn a huge percentage of their rooftops into miniairports, which would require years of disruption.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="R4GJUiHn9R"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/the-air-taxi-market-prepares-to-take-flight/">The air taxi market prepares to take flight</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The air taxi market prepares to take flight&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/the-air-taxi-market-prepares-to-take-flight/embed/#?secret=R4GJUiHn9R" data-secret="R4GJUiHn9R" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That isn’t the only option, though. Engineers are developing compact VTOLs with the agility of a helicopter and the size and relative safety (and interior machinery) of a car. These vehicles have the best chance to prove the viability of VTOLs. Imagine an ambulance arriving at the scene of an accident via air — landing in a parking-spot-sized space directly next to the accident — and swiftly moving the injured to a hospital in another part of the city.</p>
<p>Instead of looking to airports as the model for advanced air mobility, we should look to metro hubs that are accessible to everyone, with multiple departures and arrivals per day. However, this kind of passenger turnover only works at scale if there are numerous eVTOLs coming and going — just like a train station. This just isn’t feasible unless most of those eVTOLS are smaller than a passenger van.</p>
<h2>Consider the ground, not just the skyline</h2>
<p>Decades from now, city infrastructure will look very different. Vertiports within the city that can accommodate VTOLs of all sizes and distance capabilities will be commonplace in the modern metropolis. But these train stations for the sky require enormous vision and forward thinking on the part of city planners, civil engineers, policymakers and politicians, as well as citizens demanding alternative forms of transportation.</p>
<p>Current prototypes require dramatic resurfacing of the city’s skyline for safe takeoff and landing at scale, but it does not have to be this way. The street infrastructure required to bring VTOLs to city dwellers is too often overlooked.</p>
<p>Cities need to consider the spaces and cases for VTOLs. We need to think about the city as we know it now — how can we design a vehicle that fits naturally within the environment that already exists? Is there space to create a vehicle that coexists with the city’s people as well as its birds? One quiet enough that anyone would welcome on their apartment rooftop?</p>
<h2>Big vision, small footprint</h2>
<p>A smaller eVTOL isn’t just more agile and safer in dense spaces, it also allows for more vehicles per square foot, more flights per hour, and more people moved across town per day in a more affordable way.</p>
<p>Before we can build the vertiport of the future, we must first use what already exists today to prove the case for urban air mobility. We need to be deliberate in matching the technology to the infrastructure that city dwellers know and expect, not vice versa. This means an eco-friendly VTOL that can land not just on helipads, piers and parking lots, but literally anywhere an SUV might fit.</p>
<p>Size alone is not enough. We must think about alternative fuel sources. Batteries are one, but they’re also inefficient, and the ecological impact of battery production, storage and disposal make them far from perfect. Some VTOL developers have proposed hydrogen as a fuel source; I welcome this and encourage more investment toward innovation in hydrogen-powered aviation. The larger commercial aviation market is already taking big steps toward hydrogen-fueled airliners, and VTOL developers have no excuse not to do the same.</p>
<p>Finally, we have to start with a truly efficient VTOL that can have the biggest impact in the shortest time frame, and where time is of the essence: Emergency services. The promise of flying cars to improve people’s lives must be made apparent and available in the most essential of use cases first.</p>
<p>This will not only make an immediate, positive impact, it will also help pave the way for acceptance, infrastructure and large-scale commercialization for VTOLs of every size and use case. Indeed, it will realize the dream of the flying car.</p>

<p>Writing our way out of the place we&#8217;re in is tricky. The words come easily enough, each measured for its emotional weight in the stream of issues we face. It&#8217;s possible this paragraph will disappear as I find my ground. Mandates, Cuomo, Olympic mental gymnastics, where we were two weeks ago and how it relates to right now. Let&#8217;s triangulate: forget Trump. Forget the Republicans and progressive Democrats who together slow down passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Forget the evasions and half truths, the talking points to fill up the airtime until the actual rubber meets the road.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget the brave athletes who dare to fail for the greater safety of their colleagues. Celebrate the public servants and the difficult personal choices that lead us to honesty, empathy, resolute choices that will draw distinctions between malignant fraud and real outcomes at the ballot box. If politicians refuse to answer questions, draft laws to weed them out of the process itself. Hold the media to the fire they pretend to examine in their choices of coverage, debate, and commercial breaks.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been having an argument about the time delay between recording a show and releasing it here on Techcrunch in a post-produced fashion with music added, Sneak Peeks produced to promote the show, and a post somehow related to the context of the show two or so weeks ago. In generating the text, I&#8217;ve noticed the time delay serves a useful purpose of diluting the realtime urgency of the conversation with what ends up being a healthy dose of context derived from what actually happened. The news is always rendered as the first draft of history, but the constant need for ratings creates this underlying pressure to convert stories from insight to controversial clickbait.</p>
<p>Marshalled through this take-the-foot-off-the-gas filter, the black and white becomes more shades of gray, less subject to the attitudes of the individual Gang members and more attuned to the sense of the group as a whole. Take the perennial struggle between social media giants and antitrust pressure to regulate the worst aspects of the social storm. One side decries attempts to rein in the success of these companies in building audiences and unparalleled power in the marketplace — a version of &#8220;If it&#8217;s not broke, don&#8217;t fix it.&#8221; The other side says it is indeed broke, and needs to be fixed by breaking up these new monopolies born of user satisfaction with the stream of commentary, sarcasm, and family news. Or perhaps the battle lines are drawn around individual rights versus the collective good, as with the struggle to get COVID under control via vaccination mandates. In the middle between these hard-coded partisan stances is potentially something gentler than being right and more powerful in its sense of compromise.</p>
<p>In the case of mandates, the subject comes up every show. The immediate news may be New York City&#8217;s new rules governing vaccinated access to indoor restaurants, gyms, and entertainment events, but the larger abstraction is the divide between the federal government&#8217;s lack of power to effect a countrywide mandate and the politics of governors in the Red states pushing back on any mandates, most egregiously outlawing local governments from protecting their citizens from the impact of the unvaccinated. Two weeks ago, nothing seemed possible to alleviate any aspect of the crisis. Today, the New York move may encourage more people to act now to protect themselves; the data shows a doubling of new vaccinations in the most impacted states. In turn, the media includes this promising data in their stories, pushing the more partisan memes to the edges of the coverage. The net result is a more flexible narrative that speaks to the old fashioned idea that government can actually get some things done, which in turn helps promote less of the distrust that fuels many of the vaccine hesitant.</p>
<p>Getting back to the new normal drives most of the mandate discussion. The pandemic&#8217;s acceleration of digital transformation seems to reflect a growing understanding that we&#8217;re not going back to post pandemic anytime soon. Instead, there&#8217;s the realization that what we&#8217;re thinking of as survival is a foreshadowing of how we&#8217;ll live both at work and at home. We talk about our creative heroes on the show, many of whom became household names streaming through the stages of public performance and media networks. Streaming has roiled both Hollywood and the news networks, whose business models and value propositions are under attack from the tech social networks. Facebook talks of video now consuming more than 50 percent of time on its network. Amazon&#8217;s advertising revenue is growing rapidly as a counter to Google and Facebook&#8217;s control of the advertising markets. Digital advertising is consuming the linear broadcast Upfronts marketplace.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We talk often about the creator economy, a self-important waving of the media red flag in the face of the mainstream media&#8217;s bull. The Information, a subscription-fueled tech journal, looks like what the newsletter startups Substack and Twitter Revue will look like when or if they grow up. The social audio Clubhouse clones offer a similar promise of escaping the long tail into viable competition for the Fox, CNN, and MSNBCs of the realigning media companies. On each end of the spectrum, the promise of success runs into the overblown reality of too many hours in search of useful differentiation or unrealistic odds of escaping the noisy underbelly of unprofessional media.</p>
<p>If the numbers don&#8217;t seem to add up for the creators, neither do they for the social networks. Once the feature wars settle down, you&#8217;ll see a fragmented array of star writers on Substack and Facebook and very little outlet for influencers and talent to bubble up. Corporate adoption of these tools might prove a growth opportunity for enterprise versions. Is that enough to keep tech in the game? Maybe two weeks from now we&#8217;ll know.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 6, 2021. We made it to Friday. High-fives all around. If you own stocks or cryptos, you are wrapping up the week on a high. Crypto prices are rising while some indices are hitting records.</p>
<p>Before we get into the news, don’t forget that TechCrunch is launching another newsletter! The first edition of This Week in Apps by our own Sarah Perez launches Saturday morning and is the place to go for all of your app news goodness.

<p>Now, the news. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/spacex-stacks-the-full-starship-launch-system-for-the-first-time-standing-nearly-400-feet-tall/">SpaceX builds 400-foot rocket:</a> </strong>If you were concerned that childish jokes regarding billionaire rocketry were about to die down, fear not: SpaceX has stacked its Starship vehicle on top of a Super Heavy booster. That means a very tall rocket with much oomph. This is the first time that Starship and Super Heavy have come together.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/a-lot-of-cash-and-little-love-an-insurtech-story/"><strong>The changing value of insurtech startups:</strong></a><strong> </strong>A few weeks back, TechCrunch asked if the market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/24/should-we-be-worried-about-insurtech-valuations/">should be concerned</a> about insurtech valuations. Then they took another hit. We tackled the topic in the wake of Hippo’s public listing, deciding that most public insurtech companies are wealthy enough in cash terms to not sweat the declines. Too much.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/what-to-expect-from-samsungs-next-unpacked/">What to expect from Samsung’s next hardware event:</a></strong> Samsung’s impending Unpacked event may be, well, packed. We could see a new Galaxy Fold phone, new watches, wearables from a Google partnership and more. TechCrunch will be covering the event this August 11, so stick close to the site for more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/zeroheight-raises-10m-round-led-by-tribe-capital-to-scale-designops-for-ux-teams/"><strong>DesignOps is the new DevOps:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s our take on zeroheight and its new $10 million Series A round. The startup “does for UX what DevOps platforms like GitHub do for building and shipping code, providing a central place to document and manage UX components,” CEO Jerome de Lafargue told TechCrunch.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/raise-a-startup-building-africas-carta-gets-backing-from-500-startups/"><strong>500 Startups backs the Carta for Africa:</strong></a> Carta is an important part of the U.S. startup technology stack, helping keep cap tables and shares in proper order. As Africa’s startup scene expands, it will need something similar. And Raise is building it. Per the startup, most startup equity on the continent is still tracked with paper. It’s time for that to change.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/verifiable-secures-17m-for-its-api-that-manages-healthcare-provider-information/"><strong>Healthcare provider API raises $17M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>APIs to help companies manage their providers are not new. AgentSync is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/13/should-there-be-some-law-against-raising-three-times-in-one-year/">building something in the space for insurance brokers</a>. Verifiable is pursuing a similar model, but focused on healthcare workers. As with Rapid, what is being replaced are manual processes. Software is good at many things, but alleviating humans from certain types of bullshit work is one of them.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/the-first-zambian-startup-to-get-into-yc-is-developing-africas-first-card-issuing-api/"><strong>Card-issuing APIs are coming to Africa:</strong></a> Thanks to the first Zambian company to get into Y Combinator, I hasten to add. The startup in question, Union54, was first launched in 2015 as Zazu, a neobank. But it found the card-issuing space so punitive to work with that it took on that problem, rebranding along the way. Card issuing is a big market in the U.S. and Latin America. Let’s see how it performs in the startup space on a new continent.</li>
<li>To close out our startup coverage today, TechCrunch has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/dutch-startup-hub-utrecht-emerges-from-amsterdams-shadow/">good and long look at the burgeoning startup hub of Utrecht</a>, that bit of the Netherlands that always looks super gorgeous when you see a photo of it. Enjoy!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Craft your pitch deck around ‘that one thing that can really hook an investor’</h2>
<p>We frequently run articles with advice for founders who are working on pitch decks. It&#8217;s a fundamental step in every startup&#8217;s journey, and there are myriad ways to approach the task.</p>
<p>Michelle Davey of telehealth staffing and services company Wheel and Jordan Nof of Tusk Venture Partners appeared on Extra Crunch Live recently to analyze Wheel&#8217;s Series A pitch.</p>
<p>Nof said entrepreneurs should candidly explain to potential investors what they&#8217;ll need to believe to back their startup.</p>
<p>&#8221; … It takes a lot of guesswork out of the equation for the investor and it reorients them to focus on the right problem set that you’re solving,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You get this one shot to kind of influence what they think they need to believe to get an investment here … if you don’t do that … we could get pretty off base.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/india-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-amazon-to-stall-3-4b-future-and-reliance-deal/"><strong>Amazon gets win in Indian Supreme Court:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Not happy with a planned sale of Indian retail and warehouse chain Future Group to Reliance Retail, the leader in its category, Amazon won a legal reprieve this week when India’s Supreme Court said that a ruling in Singapore to halt the transaction was valid in the country. Seeing a U.S. tech giant argue against consolidation of players in a market may sound ironic, or even hypocritical, but in business it’s better to simply remember that corporations are amoral by nature at best.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/the-cost-of-velodynes-internal-drama-is-starting-to-add-up/"><strong>Drama costs at Velodyne rise:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Lidar shop Velodyne, a company that went public via a SPAC, is still paying out to cover the price of internal drama and some executive departures. TechCrunch dug into the company’s latest earnings here.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“The growth industry is definitely maturing. Less hacks, more teams, more focus on velocity,” Ward van Gasteren, founder of Grow with Ward told us in an interview this week. “Everybody within the field is getting to know the best practices very quickly and implementing them even quicker. So then what?”</p>
<p>Working with a growth professional can alleviate some of the pressure on founders who are finding their way. In our discussion, van Gasteren spoke about the importance of knowledge — qualitative feedback, systemic approaches and when/how to experiment.</p>
<p>This week in TechCrunch’s growth marketing roundup, you&#8217;ll also find two guest columns from Stewart Hillhouse and Sam Richard&#8217;s take on how to hire a growth team. Below you’ll find recommendations of growth marketers from the community. If there’s a growth marketer that you’ve enjoyed working with, please fill out our <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">survey</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/demand-curve-tested-tactics-for-growing-newsletters/">Demand Curve: Tested tactics for growing newsletters:</a></strong> Stewart Hillhouse, senior content lead at Demand Curve, talks through tactics for email newsletters. Hillhouse tells us that newsletters have nearly 40x ROI, but you have to work in order to achieve that. This article discusses the 60% rule for pop-ups, the strategy behind email timing and the importance of quality over quantity. Hillhouse mentions, “We’ve seen very little correlation between volume of emails and the resulting conversion rate.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/demand-curve-questions-you-need-to-answer-in-your-paid-search-ads/">(Extra Crunch) Demand Curve: Questions you need to answer in your paid search ads:</a></strong> Hillhouse also wrote an Extra Crunch article this week about the 14 questions you should be answering with your paid search ads. One question he mentions revolves around acceptance and how “Going shopping in real life is a social activity. Shoppers will peer into the carts of others, compare their tastes and ask those with them for input.” Let’s be honest — we’ve all done it. Hillhouse answers how this behavior can be replicated for online shopping.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/how-to-hire-and-structure-a-growth-team/">(Extra Crunch) How to hire and structure a growth team:</a></strong> Sam Richard, senior director of growth at OpenView, provides insights on what questions you should be asking when you&#8217;re hiring a growth leader. Richard says, &#8220;A strong growth-minded hire will already have a feel for benchmarks and should be able to identify which growth lever in your customer journey needs the most help.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/which-person-should-you-hire-a-growth-hacker-or-a-digital-marketer/">How Ward van Gasteren thinks about growth hacking today:</a></strong> In this interview, Ward van Gasteren spoke about common misconceptions regarding growth hacking, like how it’s assumed to be a perfect approach. But, we were told, “The hard data that you see in your analytics tools can only tell you what is slowing down your growth … not why your growth slows down there.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Starting with the assumption that 90% of startups will fail and the most successful ones take an average of six years to IPO, founders must make careful decisions about whom they invite to join the core team.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Assembling a startup team is harder than assembling 10 IKEA dressers, and the stakes are much, much higher.</p>
<p>Starting with the assumption that 90% of startups will fail and the most successful ones take an average of six years to IPO, founders must make careful decisions about whom they invite to join the core team.</p>
<p>Will that stellar engineer become a great CTO? Should your product person be opinionated or a team player? Are you even the best choice for CEO?</p>
<p>ThoughtSpot CEO Sudheesh Nair shared some of his thoughts about building a sturdy leadership team and drafted a thorough checklist for entrepreneurs who are putting a crew together. His initial advice?</p>
<p>&#8220;Investors love founder-CEOs, and founders are often fantastic candidates for this role. But not everyone can do it well, and more importantly, not everyone wants to.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a related article, Gregg Adkin, VP and managing director at Dell Technologies Capital, shared<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/whats-the-boards-role-in-an-early-stage-startup/"> the framework he&#8217;s developed for helping founders set up their board</a>.</p>
<p>Choosing the right mix of people can impact everything from fundraising to hiring: “Investors often ask founders about their board [because] it says a lot about their character, their judgment and their willingness to be challenged,” he writes.</p>

<p>Miranda Halpern spoke to Amsterdam-based coach Ward van Gasteren for<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/which-person-should-you-hire-a-growth-hacker-or-a-digital-marketer/"> our latest growth marketing interview</a>, which is free to read.</p>
<p>In their discussion, van Gasteren addressed misconceptions about growth hacking, the mistakes most startups are likely to make, and the distinctions he draws between growth hacking and growth marketing:</p>
<p>“Growth hacking is great to kickstart growth, test new opportunities and see what tactics work,” he tells us.</p>
<p>“Marketers should be there to continue where the growth hackers left off: Build out those strategies, maintain customer engagement, and keep tactics fresh and relevant.”</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch this week; I hope you have a great weekend.</p>

<p>In his first column since returning to TechCrunch, reporter Ryan Lawler considered the potential ripples Square&#8217;s purchase of Afterpay may send across the pond of buy now, pay later startups.</p>
<p>For commentary and perspective, he interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dan Rosen, founder and general partner, Commerce Ventures</li>
<li>Jake Gibson, founding partner, Better Tomorrow Ventures</li>
<li>TX Zhuo, partner, Fika Ventures</li>
<li>Matthew Harris, partner, Bain Capital Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p>The investors he spoke to agreed that deferring payments helps drive e-commerce, &#8220;but scale matters and long-term margins look slim for BNPL startups,&#8221; reports Ryan.</p>

<p>Businesses have been deploying AI solutions for 20 years, but few have achieved the outstanding gains in efficiency and profitability promised when the technology first appeared.</p>
<p>But there’s a burgeoning new generation of enterprise AI, Eshwar Belani, an operating partner at Symphony AI, writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“Companies on the leading edge of AI innovation have advanced to the next generation, which will define the coming decade of big data, analytics and automation — Enterprise AI 2.0.”</p>

<p>Over the next 18 months, one technologist says the increased adoption of embodied artificial intelligence will open a path to superintelligence — incredibly powerful software that dwarfs anything the human mind could produce.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the crazy Boston Dynamics videos of robots jumping, dancing, balancing and running are examples of embodied AI,&#8221; says Chris Nicholson, founder and CEO of Pathmind, which uses deep reinforcement learning to optimize industrial operations and supply chains.</p>
<p>“The field is moving fast and, in this revolution, you can dance.”</p>

<p>The Exchange looks at the valuations of public insurtech companies and considers what that means for startups &#8212; but from a slightly different perspective.</p>
<p>“We’d typically riff on the new values of public neoinsurance companies and use that data to work our way into a guess concerning what the price declines might mean for related startups,” Alex Wilhelm writes. “Taking public-market data and using it to better understand private markets is pretty much the national pastime of this column.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm checks in on results from Starling Bank and Monzo to see what the neobanks’ most recent financial figures say about the state of neobanks overall.</p>
<p>“Although some neobanks are managing to clean up their ledgers and work toward profits — or reach profitability — not all are in the black,” he notes.</p>
<p>But among those that are?</p>
<p>“At least a portion of the neobanking world is financially stable enough to consider public offerings.”</p>

<p>Assembling a board of directors is not merely about finding individuals who can aid your early-stage journey, Gregg Adkin, the vice president and managing director at Dell Technologies Capital, writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>The composition of the board can also impact your fundraising.</p>
<p>“Investors often ask founders about their board [because] it says a lot about their character, their judgment and their willingness to be challenged,” he writes.</p>
<p>Adkins offers a framework he calls “SPIFS” &#8212; for strategy, people, image, finance and systems for compliance &#8212; to aid founders in setting up a board.</p>

<p>In the wake of Deliveroo’s plans to abandon the Spanish market after the country passed legislation requiring companies dependent on gig workers to hire employees, Alex Wilhelm wondered about the battle for smaller markets and whether third place is sufficient.</p>
<p>“One company exiting a market is not a big deal, but we were curious about Deliveroo’s comments regarding the need for market leadership — or something close to it — to warrant continued investment,” he writes for The Exchange.</p>
<p>“Is this the common reality for startups battling for market position, no matter if those markets are cities or countries?”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Biden’s major bipartisan infrastructure plan struck a rare chord of cooperation between Republicans and Democrats, but changes it proposes to cryptocurrency regulation are tripping up the bill.</p>
<p>The administration intends to pay for $28 billion of its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/business/dealbook/infrastructure-bill-details.html">planned infrastructure spending</a> by tightening tax compliance within the historically under-regulated arena of digital currency. That&#8217;s why cryptocurrency is popping up in a bill that’s mostly about rebuilding bridges and roads.</p>
<p>The legislation&#8217;s vocal critics argue that the bill’s effort to do so is slapdash, particularly a bit that would declare anyone “responsible for and regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets” to be a broker, subject to tax reporting requirements.</p>
<p>While that definition might be more straightforward in a traditional corner of finance, it could force cryptocurrency developers, companies and even anyone mining digital currencies to somehow collect and report information on users, something that by design isn’t even possible in a decentralized financial system.</p>
<p>Now, a new amendment to the critical spending package is<a href="https://twitter.com/SenToomey/status/1423731811096670215"> threatening to make matters even worse</a>.</p>
<h2>Unintended consequences</h2>
<p>In a joint letter about the bill&#8217;s text, Square, Coinbase, Ribbit Capital and other stakeholders warned of “financial surveillance” and unintended impacts for cryptocurrency miners and developers. The <a href="https://twitter.com/EFF/status/1422337127556157444">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/actions/stop-the-senate-from-sneaking-through-total-surveillance-of-the-crypto-economy/">Fight for the Future</a>, two privacy-minded digital rights organizations, also slammed the bill.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Following the outcry from the cryptocurrency community, a pair of influential senators proposed an amendment to clarify the new reporting rules. Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) pushed back against the bill, proposing an amendment with fellow finance committee member Pat Toomey (R-PA) that would modify the bill’s language.</p>
<p>The amendment would establish that the new reporting &#8220;does not apply to individuals developing block chain technology and wallets,&#8221; removing some of the bill&#8217;s ambiguity on the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;By clarifying the definition of broker, our amendment will ensure non-financial intermediaries like miners, network validators, and other service providers — many of whom don’t even have the personal-identifying information needed to file a 1099 with the IRS — are not subject to the reporting requirements specified in the bipartisan infrastructure package,&#8221; Toomey said.</p>
<p>Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis also threw her support behind the Toomey and Wyden amendment, as did Colorado Governor Jared Polis.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment is simple.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<h2>&#8220;Picking winners and losers&#8221;</h2>
<p>The drama doesn&#8217;t stop there. With negotiations around the bill ongoing — the text could be finalized over the weekend — a pair of senators proposed a competing amendment that isn’t winning any fans in the crypto community.</p>
<p>That amendment, from Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) and Mark Warner (D-VA), would exempt traditional cryptocurrency miners who participate in energy-intensive “proof of work&#8221; systems from new financial reporting requirements, while keeping those rules in place for those using a <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1423113906529177601">&#8220;proof of stake&#8221; system</a>. Portman worked with the Treasury Department to author the cryptocurrency portion of the original infrastructure bill.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow. Sen. Warner and Portman are proposing a last minute amendment competing with the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment. It is a disastrous. It only excludes proof-of-work mining. And it does nothing for software devs. Ridiculous!</p>
<p>Here is all it excludes: <a href="https://t.co/FA7K6NU2s0">pic.twitter.com/FA7K6NU2s0</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jerry Brito (@jerrybrito) <a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Rather than requiring an investment in computing hardware (and energy bills) capable of solving increasingly complex math problems, proof of stake systems rely on participants taking a financial stake in a given project, locking away some of the cryptocurrency to generate new coins.</p>
<p>Proof of stake is emerging as an attractive, climate-friendlier alternative that could reduce the need for heavy computing and huge amounts of energy required for proof of work mining. That makes it all the more puzzling that the latest amendment would specifically let proof of work mining off the hook.</p>
<p>Some popular digital currencies like Cardano are already built on proof of stake. Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency, is<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/cryptocurrency-goes-green-proof-stake-offer-solution-energy-concerns-rcna1030"> in the process of migrating</a> from a proof of work system to proof of stake to help scale its system and reduce fees. Bitcoin is the most notable digital currency that relies on proof of work.</p>
<p>The Warner-Portman amendment is being touted as a “compromise” but it’s not really halfway between the Wyden-Toomey amendment and the existing bill — it just introduces new problems that many crypto advocates view as a fresh existential threat to their work.</p>
<p>Prominent members of the crypto community, including <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1422667000950706187">Square founder and Bitcoin booster Jack Dorsey</a>, have thrown their support behind the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment while slamming the second proposal as misguided and damaging.</p>
<p>The executive director of Coincenter, a crypto think tank, called the Warner-Portman amendment &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577">disastrous</a>.&#8221; Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong echoed that language. &#8220;At the 11th hour @MarkWarner has proposed an amendment that would decide which foundational technologies are OK and which are not in crypto,&#8221; he tweeted. &#8220;&#8230; We could find ourselves with the Senate deciding which types of crypto will survive government regulation.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA['If you take the leap that the pandemic happened because there's just a lot of things happening in the environment, it means we have to build the future that we want.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Andy Yang joined Indiegogo at a turbulent time. As the crowdfunding platform’s then-CEO stepped aside for personal reasons, the service also reportedly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18635644/indiegogo-layoffs-ceo-david-mandelbrot-andy-yang">grappled with layoffs</a>. Coming on board after a stretch with Reddit, the new CEO would have less than a year at the helm before COVID-19 turned the globe upside down.</p>
<p>Now 13 years old, the San Francisco-based site matured alongside the world of online crowdfunding. And, certainly, Indiegogo had a front-row seat for all of the ups and downs. Indiegogo introduced several million-dollar campaigns, but the platform has often suffered from comparisons to Kickstarter, a service that has become synonymous with the category for many.</p>
<p>Yang sat down to discuss how Indiegogo has changed under his tenure, how crowdfunding has evolved and what both will look like in a post-pandemic world.</p>
<p><em>(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)</em></p>
<p><strong>What was your primary objective coming on as CEO?</strong></p>
<p>I was at Reddit doing core product, and when Indiegogo’s board and founders reached out, it was really around, “Hey, we would love somebody with product experience, a background in community.” What was going on in Indiegogo was really an evaluation of, “What&#8217;s our core values?” When I took the saddle and the reigns, it was really focusing on that core of who we are, what segments do we want to go after, and where do we want to focus. Where do we want to focus our product?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;We’ve had our number of failures on our site, of campaigns that haven&#8217;t fulfilled or just, the campaigns have ghosted their backers, and we own up to that.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>From that perspective, we&#8217;ve been really heads-down for the last two years, just working on ourselves, internally, and focusing on the core &#8212; what we&#8217;re terming “bringing the crowd back in crowdfunding.” I think a lot of the platforms have been very transactional in nature, and so I think backers and consumers and users have been trained by Amazon to click a button and get things two hours later. The premise of crowdfunding is very different.</p>
<p>You may or may not get this perk delivered in the time frame that you&#8217;re expecting, and to help educate backers and the community around that is really core to who we are. We&#8217;ve been through the last two years with COVID, but we&#8217;ve been profitable since I&#8217;ve joined, which is huge. We can control our own destiny and really take the time to do things right and invest in areas like trust and safety, like community, that we really wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>The company wasn’t profitable when you joined?</strong></p>
<p>We weren&#8217;t profitable. I enjoyed and then we cut to profitability, or at least kind of a neutral state, and with any kind of change in leadership, some tenured folks opted out, and we basically became a new team overnight to kind of re-found the company, and we&#8217;ve been slowly adding people over the last couple years, but always with that eye on profitability and controlling our own destiny.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond people changing roles, what had to happen in order for the company to become profitable?</strong></p>
<p>Really doubling down on making sure that we understood our sales pipeline and making sure that, from a supply perspective, that we had a number of campaigns from across a number of categories. Obviously, our bread and butter is what we call tech and innovation, consumer electronics hardware, but also seeing what other categories that we can lean into. We&#8217;re definitely strong in comics, travel, outdoors, and what can we do from expanding our wedge and our categories in different areas that we&#8217;re seeing growth. I think a trend that we&#8217;re currently seeing is a lot of green tech. Just trying to understand what categories are growing, where our brand resonates with entrepreneurs and backers.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what needed to happen &#8212; just making sure that we had adequate supply on the platform, and also just from the backer side, we had not traditionally focused on the backer side. We had heavily focused on the supply side, but really starting to, again, return back to the crowd in crowdfunding, leaning on my Reddit experience, just making sure that we can engage the community in new and interesting ways.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kickstarter announced on Wednesday that backers have pledged <a href="https://twitter.com/kickstarter/status/1422942324049555460">$6 billion</a> to more than 200,000 projects over the course of the crowdfunding site’s history. The milestone comes a little over a year after the platform hit the $5 billion mark.</p>
<p>A matter of weeks before the company hit that last massive round number, however, it revealed starker news. Kickstarter reduced its staff by 39%, through a combination of layoffs and buyouts, as newly minted CEO Aziz Hasan <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257585/kickstarter-layoffs-employees-union-negotiations-severance">noted a 35% drop in new projects.</a> The company wasn’t alone, certainly, in suffering major setbacks in the face of a pandemic, but that likely didn’t cushion the blow of a downturn with “no clear sign of rebound,” according to the executive.</p>
<p>With another $1 billion pledge in the intervening 15 months, however, it’s probably safe to say that predictions of crowdfunding’s demise were somewhat premature. Like most of the rest of us, the pandemic has spurred a reprioritization and recentering, and the service that has long been synonymous with the category looked to new methods of engagement.</p>
<p>After a dozen years of being the face of crowdfunding, plenty of question marks still remain. The past decade has seen something of a hype bubble for the process, and for some, the shine has worn off a bit, courtesy of undelivered gifts and unfinished campaigns. What will the next decade hold for crowdfunding&#8217;s biggest name? And will the pandemic fundamentally transform how people back projects on the internet?</p>
<p>We sat down with Hasan to discuss the past year, the company&#8217;s big milestone and the future of crowdfunding.</p>
<p><em>(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)</em></p>
<p><strong>When you took the role of CEO in 2019, what changes did you feel like you needed to implement?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;d really like to touch on the connection that I&#8217;ve always felt with Kickstarter. It, for me personally, is a place where I feel like both my personal passion and what we do on a day-to-day basis came together really well. At one of the first all-hands when I got hired, I said what&#8217;s beautiful about the job that I get to do is that every evening I go home and <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/aziz-hasan-on-finding-harmony-in-your-daily-life-and-creative-work/">I illustrate</a>. And so I get to feel the hard pain, a lot of the insecurity and the uncertainty that comes with being a creator.</p>

			&#8220;I see crowdfunding as probably one of the best mechanisms to go independently and create the thing that you want and to find the support that you need and the resources that you need.&#8221;					</blockquote>

<p>I come in every morning and I say, &#8220;OK, how am I going to fix that? What can I do to make that process better, make that easier?&#8221; And so that for me was just this underlying motivation. This is what gets me out of bed in the morning. The thought to me was, “What are the ways in which we have the greatest strength in helping creators find the funding that they need?”</p>
<p>I think one of the greatest opportunities that I really see is that the backers are such an incredible part of this puzzle, and for us, for the longest time we really focused on the creator tools and really making sure that the creators have a way to share their project. What we&#8217;ve seen is that backers are such a tremendous part of this process and their ability to discover the joy, the fun, the curiosity that they feel through that process is such an important part of the experience as well. And so here&#8217;s a place where we can actually put some focus and some time and attention on what the backer experience looks like. And so that really has been a big mantra for me as we&#8217;ve been moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean to impact the backer experience? In the past two years, how has the backer experience changed?</strong></p>
<p>One is just making it simpler and easier for backers to find projects that they would care about. And I think us being just a space where this stuff exists, I think just putting it out there as it is on a home page or through the creator that you know isn&#8217;t enough. And so there are a lot of channels that we&#8217;ve been using, particularly thinking about our emails and newsletters and these points of connection that we have with the backer over the course of their journey and actually introducing projects that they might like through that process. So we have a recommendation engine that we&#8217;ve been developing over the last few years that&#8217;s meant to help connect, make better connections based on either affinity, which you might like, or the way that you backed in the past or projects that you might&#8217;ve watched.</p>
<p><strong>Early last year, Kickstarter went through a fairly large round of layoffs — 40%, according to reports. How did the company navigate the earliest days of the pandemic and what do you feel you’ve done to help right that ship?</strong></p>
<p>What we saw in our platform was that creators just kind of off the bat had the same level of uncertainty everybody else was feeling. We saw a slowdown of projects and what we saw was about 40% of our pledge volume dipping. And as a result, there&#8217;s a lot of projects that fell off as a result of that. There were some very, very concerning times. The big thing that we thought about was, we need to make sure that our business is resilient for the future, make sure that we&#8217;re actually just set up operationally in a way that we can withstand uncertainty as it comes. Through that really tough time and then, kind of peeking out toward the end of 2020, the backers didn&#8217;t change their pattern of behavior. Even though creators were launching fewer projects during that really difficult time, what we saw was that the backers remained extremely eager to keep pushing forward and supporting creative work.</p>
<p>So things like our pledge rates and success rates remained quite high and that&#8217;s especially if you think about the games community, comics, publishing a number of these spaces where we&#8217;ve always seen strong engagement. That engagement actually continued through. About four or five months after that initial dip, we slowly started to see some of the creators come back online, because I think they also started to recognize that the backers are there. They haven&#8217;t changed their backing patterns. And so what that did for us is that started to give us a bit of understanding here that we should start to connect back to the creators and let them know that the backers are here.</p>
