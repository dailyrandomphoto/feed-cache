										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An Indian startup that is improving the way how millions of people in the nation lease or buy an apartment is the latest firm to become a unicorn in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based <a href="https://www.nobroker.in/">NoBroker</a> has raised $210 million in its Series E financing round, its founders told TechCrunch in an interview. Tiger Global and General Atlantic, two existing investors, and Moore Strategic Ventures co-led the six-year-old startup’s Series E financing round.</p>
<p>The round values NoBroker at $1 billion, up from about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/indias-nobroker-raises-an-additional-30m-from-general-atlantic/">$350 million in April 2020</a>. There was no secondary transaction &#8212; that is, sales of shares by any existing investors including the founders &#8212; in the new funding round, the founders said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238496" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>NoBroker helps people looking to buy or lease an apartment avoid brokers, thus avoiding brokerage fee. The startup operates in several major Indian cities including Bangalore, Delhi, Pune, and Hyderabad. The startup has over 7.5 million properties listed on its platform and over 16 million people have used its services.</p>
<p>Over the years, NoBroker has expanded to several additional categories including financial services (to offer customers help with securing the rent, for instance), and home services such as cleaning, fulfilling furniture needs and movers and packers. It now also operates a service, called NoBrokerhood, that is aimed at communities to stay connected and manage and keep track of visitors. NoBrokerhood, which also allows society residents to buy and sell items from each other, competes with some of the offerings of MyGate, which is also backed by Tiger Global.</p>
<p>The new funding follows months of strong growth as Indian states relaxed lockdown restrictions earlier this year and mobility resumed. The startup said it has grown three times since last year, said Amit Kumar Agarwal, founder and chief executive of NoBroker, in an interview.</p>
<p>“NoBroker’s digital-first approach to efficiently solve renting, buying, maintenance and related needs for real-estate owners, tenants, buyers, residential societies and developers is paradigm shifting, said Shantanu Rastogi, Managing Director of General Atlantic, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Focused execution with a customer-first mindset of the founders bodes well for NoBroker’s continued penetration in this market solving for the toughest problems. In the future, NoBroker’s product stack will also find relevance in several under-regulated developing markets around the world. We are excited to be part of NoBroker’s continued success.”</p>
<p>In a joint interview, Agarwal and startup&#8217;s other founders &#8212; Akhil Gupta and Saurabh Garg &#8212; said the startup will deploy the fresh funds to expand to 50 cities in a span of two to three years, up from six currently.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changpeng “CZ” Zhao launched Binance in 2017 and, according to some sources, the company grew into the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world in 180 days</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-became-the-biggest-cryptocurrency-exchange-without-licenses-or-headquarters-thats-coming-to-an-end-11636640029">Wall Street Journal</a> recently reported that Binance’s daily transactions stood at $76 billion, a volume worth more than its four nearest rivals combined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first half of 2021, Binance attracted 151 million clicks from Africa and the Middle East and 11 million from Nigeria, according to the WSJ. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These numbers highlight the general activity of crypto trading in Africa, where $105.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was transacted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from July 2020 to June 2021, according to <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/africas-grassroots-cryptocurrency-adoption">Chainalysis</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233992" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite growing over 1,200% by value, Africa still accounts for only <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2021/09/14/cryptocurrency-flows-in-africa/">2%</a> of the global value of crypto transacted in this period. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With cryptocurrency, blockchain and decentralized finance gaining ground on the continent, Binance wants to be the leader in driving these activities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for that to happen, the company will need to consider the regulatory challenges it might face on the continent, where crypto activities have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been barred</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in two of the most prominent crypto-heavy countries, Nigeria and Kenya</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is already taking several hits from regulators in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the U.S., China, the U.K., Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, and the E.U., which are now concerned about its unregulated and unstifled growth in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this interview with TechCrunch, Zhao discussed crypto usage and adoption in Africa, Binance activities and the company’s stance on regulation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><em>(This transcript has been edited for clarity and length.)</em></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: Crypto is one industry several governments are trying to regulate. What’s your take? Should crypto be regulated?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhao: Regulation is essential for the crypto industry and will go a long way towards building trust with consumers and institutions interested in the space</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it takes proper regulation to realize crypto mass adoption, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in facilitating this in a healthy way through </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">proactively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> collaborating with local regulators and leading the industry to a common destination: benefit and protect users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our view is that it’s great for the regulators to be coming </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in order to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get to 10%, 20%, 80%, 99% [crypto] adoption. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as crucial for regulation to complement instead of hinder crypto’s growth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, effective regulations safeguard consumers while stimulating growth and innovation, while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">poorly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crafted regulatory policy stifles growth and protects dated, ineffective processes and institutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>As the largest exchange globally, why is Binance having so many regulatory issues in the U.S., Europe and China? And what steps is the company taking to address them?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every cryptocurrency exchange is working </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">closely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with regulators all around the world. As industry leaders, many people see the industry and see Binance. We don’t take that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lightly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as we have the opportunity to lead by example and partner with regulators to move shared objectives forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are the largest crypto exchange because users trust us. We earned that trust through many decisions and actions that protected users. We want to share our best practices with the industry and regulators all around the world. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this will help shape a healthier industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of efforts to meet compliance with all local regulation guidelines, we’ve recently launched new products — such as Shyft Network’s Veriscope to support <a href="https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/financial-action-task-force-fatf-travel-rule-140#:~:text=FATF%20Travel%20Rule%2C%20officially%20accepted,border%20and%20domestic%20bank%20transfers.">FATF Travel Rule</a> Compliance and our Tax Reporting Tool API so users can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meet their personal tax obligations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have also reviewed our existing services, including updating Futures Leverage for New Accounts and restricting access to it in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a number of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> markets and initiating a mandatory KYC [know your customer] </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">requirement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’ve also recently hired several top-tier talents with a strong background in compliance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example in leadership, we recently began a push for industry players to be long-term driven, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the standard KYC/AML [anti-money laundering] procedures. We are pushing for longer unlocking schedules for founder tokens, from 2-4 years to 8-10 years. This is something that no regulators have asked for, but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it will help the industry become healthier. We are always looking for ways to protect users.</span></p>
<p><strong>Would you say governments are going about it correctly? And are they knowledgeable about the budding industry and how to hone its advantage?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no absolute right or wrong here. It’s a matter of calibration and balance. Crypto and even the regulation of crypto are such new concepts, and many governments are trying to get more clarity about the space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulators share the same mission with us &#8212; protecting consumers while encouraging innovation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As regulators work to find the most effective way to engage with the industry, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are committed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to 100% compliance globally, and all our teams have been working nonstop to achieve this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The adoption and development of crypto has many parallels with that of the car. When the car was first invented, there weren’t any traffic laws, traffic lights or even safety belts. Laws and guidelines </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were developed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> along the way as the cars were running on the road. These are frameworks and laws we take for granted today that allow this powerful technology to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">widely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">safely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto is similar because it can be accessible for everyone, but frameworks </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are required</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prevent misuse and bad actors. Clarifying and building the first set of standards is critical for the industry’s continued growth. And Binance wants to be a positive contributor.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why is Binance bullish on Africa, where crypto regulations are increasingly becoming worrying?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The African continent holds some unique opportunities for cryptocurrency adoption and development and so, we’ve always been bullish in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto is solving the issues of cross-border payments and remittances (sending money within Africa and beyond), currency devaluation, etc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many African countries have suffered from high unemployment rates, and crypto and blockchain have provided innovative job opportunities for a young and brilliant continent, bringing Africans closer to financial freedom</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even from the first day when Binance launched, we had users from Africa, and they were actually </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> active. And so, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it was early 2018 that I visited Uganda, Togo, Nigeria at the same time — and also Ethiopia. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I had a little tour around Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn a little bit more about the market, and soon after that, we opened Binance Uganda, which was our first fiat gateway</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is particularly interesting about African usage is that the number of people having bank accounts is quite low due to a lack of access to traditional financial services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this is why crypto is so attractive.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Yes, it is attractive, and maybe that’s why African central banks have targeted crypto users in recent months and barred banks from facilitating transactions</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. What happens when they start coming for Binance instead, similar to the U.S., China and other countries?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance welcomes regulation and takes a collaborative approach in working with regulators and governments in navigating this emerging industry, and we take our compliance obligations very </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seriously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> keeping abreast of changing policies, rules and laws in this space.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Binance is ready to assist regulators and find the optimal way to set a fair playing field &#8212; consumer protection is important to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> us</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve grown </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exponentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an organization and there are certain processes and protocol updates that we are still working through at the request of regulators</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Do you think crypto adoption and growth will slow down if Binance and other crypto platforms are subjected to government regulations worldwide?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I don’t. Smart regulation encourages innovation and helps keep users safe. It’s also important to understand that regulation and innovation are not mutually exclusive. Crypto users deserve safe access to emerging technologies and practices, including NFTs, stablecoins, staking, yield-farming and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We touched on this in our recently released 10</span><a href="https://yourcryptorights.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fundamental Rights for Crypto Users.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Crypto regulation is inevitable. But users have the right to share their voice on how the industry should evolve with their blockchain platform of choice.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">What do you think is fueling crypto adoption in Africa?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s always a combination of many things. Africa is a unique continent with unique challenges. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, several African countries </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are plagued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with constant currency devaluation, and so users are more likely to use crypto and stablecoins as a hedge against devaluation and as a store of value</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making payments &#8212; whether it is remittances, cross-border transfers or settlements &#8212; is also pretty difficult across country lines, and crypto simplifies this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RSXHntdrTV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/09/crypto-remittances-are-a-lifeline-for-the-worlds-most-vulnerable/">Crypto remittances are a lifeline for the world’s most vulnerable</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Crypto remittances are a lifeline for the world’s most vulnerable&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/09/crypto-remittances-are-a-lifeline-for-the-worlds-most-vulnerable/embed/#?secret=RSXHntdrTV" data-secret="RSXHntdrTV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Africans look to crypto for wealth creation and financial freedom. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like Southeast Asia and Latin America, millions of people live below the poverty line. So it’s natural that more people look for innovative, non-traditional ways to create wealth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some reports say only 11% of the population in Africa have bank accounts. Many of the non-banked are skipping banks and coming </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to crypto, using a mobile phone as their bank.</span></p>
<p><b>Talking about numbers, a recent WSJ article said Nigeria had 11 million clicks in H1 2021 on Binance. Is that the number of Binance users on the continent?</b></p>
<p><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wall Street Journal cited stats provided by a third party based on speculation, as they do not have access to our systems nor any user information. We can’t comment on speculative analysis conducted by external third parties.</span></p>
<p><strong>As more Africans use P2P more than ever before, how is Binance making sure users are safely trading cryptocurrencies in Africa on its platform?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These have been our focuses in Africa as we remain committed to ensuring that Africans are well educated and protected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Binance P2P in particular, user protection and safety are paramount. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of August, we had provided free crypto classes to over 400,000 Africans on topics ranging from user protection to building a career in blockchain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team recently implemented new risk management measures, including a crypto escrow service.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We have also recently expanded our global KYC requirements to enhance user protection and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implement new P2P features to prevent bad actors from exploiting the system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of China&#8217;s biggest AI solution providers SenseTime is a step closer to its initial public offering. SenseTime has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-19/ai-giant-sensetime-said-to-win-approval-for-hong-kong-ipo">received regulatory approval</a> to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, according to media reports.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, SenseTime was christened as one of China&#8217;s four &#8220;AI Dragons&#8221; alongside Megvii, CloudWalk, and Yitu. In the second half of the 2010s, their algorithms found much demand from businesses and governments hoping to turn real-life data into actionable insights. Cameras embedded with their AI models watch city streets 24 hours. Malls use their sensing solutions to track and predict crowds on the premises.</p>
<p>SenseTime&#8217;s three rivals have all mulled plans to sell shares either in mainland China or Hong Kong. Megvii is preparing to list on China&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/megvii-ipo-china/">Nasdaq-style STAR board</a> after its HKEX application lapsed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238426" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The window for China&#8217;s data-rich tech firms to list overseas has narrowed. Beijing is making it harder for companies with sensitive data to go public outside China. And regulators in the West are wary of facial recognition companies that could aid mass surveillance.</p>
<p>But in the past few years, China&#8217;s AI upstarts were sought after by investors all over the world. In 2018 alone, SenseTime racked up more than <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sensetime/company_financials">$2 billion in investment</a>. To date, the company has raised a staggering $5.2 billion in funding through 12 rounds. Its biggest outside shareholders include SoftBank Vision Fund and Alibaba&#8217;s Taobao. For its flotation in Hong Kong, SenseTime plans to raise up to $2 billion, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/sensetime-receives-go-ahead-hong-kong-ipo-sources-2021-11-19/">according to Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>SenseTime spends a large chunk of its capital on research and development, which cost it more than 5 billion yuan ($780 million) between 2018 and 2020, according to its <a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/app/sehk/2021/103756/documents/sehk21082702575.pdf">prospectus</a>. The company recorded net losses for the past four years, largely due to &#8220;the fair value losses of our preferred shares.&#8221; Its net losses reached 3.7 billion yuan in the first half of 2021. Total deficits neared 23 billion yuan as of June.</p>
<p>Like its peers, SenseTime relied on &#8220;smart city&#8221; projects for monetization. The business comprised 47.6% of its total revenues of 1.65 billion yuan in the six months ended June, up from a share of 27% in the same period of 2020. The number of cities using SenseTime&#8217;s software platform reached 119 by June, according to the firm&#8217;s prospectus.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The &#8220;Smart Business&#8221; line, which is tailored to commercial space, residential property, and other enterprise needs, made up about 40% of its revenues in the first half of this year. The firm derived the rest of its revenues from the &#8220;Smart Life&#8221; unit, which supplies to IoT devices, and &#8220;Smart Auto&#8221;, which applies perception intelligence to autonomous driving solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup Leocare has raised a big Series B funding round led by <a href="https://eightroads.com/en/">Eight Roads</a>. Overall, the company has raised $116 million. It’s an equity and debt round, which means that part of this amount is a cash-for-equity transaction, while the rest is a credit line.</p>
<p>The company is raising today’s Series B less than a year after raising <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/leocare-raises-18-1-million-for-its-insurance-products-designed-to-fit-in-a-mobile-app/">its Series A</a>. And some of Leocare’s existing investors are putting more money on the table with the Series B, such as Felix Capital, Ventech and Daphni.</p>
<p>Leocare wants to handle all your insurance needs under a single roof. The startup can insure your home, your car, your motorbike and your smartphone. And it believes consumers want to subscribe to new insurance product using a mobile app because it’s more convenient and it opens up new features.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238218" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For instance, the company is working on a new feature called TakeCare. “It’s like Waze, it tells you when you’re entering a high-risk area,” co-founder and CEO Christophe Dandois told me.</p>
<p>But TakeCare doesn’t warn you about speed traps. Instead, the Leocare app tells you if people often end up in a car incident in the area. Leocare is leveraging road safety open data for that feature. Similarly, if your neighbor is using your car for the weekend, you can add a second driver in a few taps and remove them on Monday.</p>
<p>The startup also uses data to adjust pricing where it makes sense. For instance, Leocare tracks the channel you’re using to subscribe, looks at the smartphone model you’re using, checks the time of the session, etc. In other words, expect some dynamic pricing.</p>
<p>When you want your insurance to step in, once again, Leocare wants you to use the mobile app. You can still call a phone number, but most clients are already using the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The long-term vision is quite clear as Leocare wants to create a single contract that covers everything you own and everything you regularly do. And you should be able to tweak your insurance options whenever you need to. The company wants to add more products, such as bike insurance — as long as they are not one-off insurance products, such as travel insurance, it could potentially be covered by Leocare.</p>
<p>And it makes sense to aggregate everything as many customers end up paying twice for the same thing. For instance, home insurance usually cover against theft. That’s why a bike insurance could cover theft outside of the home as your Leocare home insurance is already taking care of theft at home.</p>
<p>The company currently acts as a managing general agent and partners with several insurance companies. It sells its insurance products under its own brand.</p>
<p>“With this funding round, we’ll still follow the same model but we’ll also add the ability to use our own risk carrier,” Dandois said. Depending on the insurance product, Leocare could end up managing the insurance product from start to finish.</p>
<p>In addition to new insurance products, the company wants to expand to new markets, starting with Southern Europe, such as Spain. Right now, Leocare has 65,000 active customers and aims to generate €100 million in revenue next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://www.yababa.com/">Yababa</a> only started its same-day grocery delivery business this summer, selling products geared towards the tastes of the capital&#8217;s sizeable Turkish and Arabic communities shortly afterwards, but in a few short months it&#8217;s closed a $15.5 million seed round of funding to fuel planned rapid expansion &#8212; both within Germany and across Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paris, Amsterdan, Brussels, London,&#8221; says co-founder Ralph Hage, reeling off the list of likely first-candidate cities for its service outside Germany.</p>
<p>Inside Germany, he says Cologne will be next after Berlin &#8212; where it currently delivers to Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain, Kreuzberg, Moabit, Wedding, Neukölln, Charlottenburg, Wilmersdorf, Tiergarten, Tempelhof-Schöneberg and Lichtenberg &#8212; either by the end of this year or early next. It also wants the service to be live in seven German cities in 2022.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237809" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Expanding Yababa&#8217;s product mix to address a wider mix of multicultural communities is also on the cards. But, for now, the most popular item being ordered in the German capital is Arabic bread, followed by meat, fruit and vegetables, per the startup.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s starting with a focus on Turkish and Arabic foods, it nonetheless sells a wide range of groceries &#8212; from fresh lemons to luncheon meats, through frozen pizza and cleaning products, to name a few of its current ~1.5k SKUs. And a much more expansive inventory is on the way.</p>
<p>Yababa&#8217;s seed round is led by Creandum and Project A, with existing investor FoodLabs also participating along with a number of business angels.</p>
<p>While quick-commerce (or instant grocery) has been growing like a weed across Europe in recent months &#8212; driven by the shock of the pandemic switch Europeans&#8217; food buying habits away from in-person trips to stores to (socially distant) app-based shopping; which is, in turn, exciting regional investors who are salivating at the prospect of disrupting traditional bricks-and-mortar supermarkets, hence funds falling over themselves to pour big bucks into speed-focused digital platforms like Turkey&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/">Getir</a>, Spain&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/">Glovo</a>, Germany&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/">Gorillas </a>and the US-owned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/filing-instant-grocery-startup-gopuff-is-raising-750m-more-at-a-13-5b-valuation/">GoPuff</a> (to name a few); the convenience play is starting to give way to more interesting market slices &#8212; catering to specific communities&#8217; grocery needs and niches.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>See, for example, the ethnic product-focused London-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/oja-bags-3-4m-to-build-an-online-supermarket-for-ethnic-products/">Oja</a> &#8212; whose seed round we covered last month &#8212; or the local food producer platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/grocery-delivery-startup-membo-is-hungry-to-build-a-europe-wide-local-food-producer-network/">Membo</a>, an Estonian startup which has bagged funding from Y Combinator to spin up a marketplace model connecting shoppers with quality local producers, to name two.</p>
<p>Yababa suggests such developments are a sign of market &#8220;validation&#8221; &#8212; while also arguing there&#8217;s a massive opportunity to build a leading pan-European grocery-buying platform catering for underserved multicultural communities, given what&#8217;s still a relative lack of competition. (And, btw, &#8216;Yababa&#8217; is a casual greeting you&#8217;re likely to hear if you go to an Arabic supermarket in person.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Oja bags $3.4M to build an online supermarket for ethnic products&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/oja-bags-3-4m-to-build-an-online-supermarket-for-ethnic-products/embed/#?secret=Rx8XEvBNP2" data-secret="Rx8XEvBNP2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Just in case you think &#8216;niche&#8217; means a market that&#8217;s too small to be significant, in Germany itself Hage points out that over a fifth of the population have a migrant background (the majority being Middle Eastern). And there are plenty of other sizeable <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">diasporas living in countries across Western Europe &#8212; communities Yababa is gearing up to scale and serve. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;For our investors, our stakeholders, our customers today, we&#8217;re clearly filling a massive gap,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;From the investors side there&#8217;s a huge opportunity &#8212; we&#8217;re one of the first players in the market today. It&#8217;s been validated in the US with companies focusing on the Asian segment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As we continue expanding throughout Europe &#8212; because we see the same issue in France, in Benelux, in the UK etc &#8212; we expand into other ethnic groups,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;This is how the business model will evolve.&#8221;</p>
<p>As on-demand grocery delivery startups become more novel/specialist, the need for blistering speed as a differentiator is naturally dialled back. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Here, convenience comes from providing the sought for products (and quality) that&#8217;s simply harder for your customers to come by through more traditional retail (or less specialist) grocery buying</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> channels. </span></p>
<p>This in turn means platforms like Yababa can manage with maybe just one centralized warehouse per city, rather than having to pepper a location with scores of mini dark stores &#8212; because the delivery promise is typically &#8216;next day&#8217; (rather than within minutes).</p>
<p>This means the logistics element looks easier to streamline (and sustain) vs the likes of q-commerce platforms like Gorillas et al (meaning <em>potentially</em> burning less investor cash). Albeit, in Yababa&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s clearly in a rush to scale in order to steal a march on other multicultural-focused newcomers and doing that requires enough resource, hence the chunky seed raise.</p>
<p>A slower delivery model may also mean reduced risks in relation to delivery worker conditions &#8212; i.e. because you&#8217;re not mandating inhumanly fast turnaround times. And conditions for platform workers is an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">area of active legislative attention in Europe</a>; and one where q-commerce platforms like <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/10/08/gorillas-delivery-app-fires-hundreds-of-berlin-workers-for-strikes-over-pay-and-working-co">Gorillas</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/as-eu-eyes-balance-on-precarious-gig-work-glovo-offers-pledge-of-fairer-conditions-for-couriers/">Glovo</a> continue to face a smorgasbord of challenges.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t focus on speed,&#8221; confirms Hage of the grocery delivery service itself. &#8220;Basically our USP does not revolve around how fast we deliver a product. Of course we think same day is very important and we think convenience to the customer is equally important but we want to offer a service that is affordable, rather than charging customers a few euros for delivery &#8212; because we think this creates a bit of friction around the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our model is <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">closer &#8212; I would say &#8212; to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/09/amazonfresh-launches-grocery-deliveries-in-london/">AmazonFresh</a> and <a href="https://picnic.app/nl/">Picnic</a>. Where we basically allow a customer to choose a delivery slot and decide the time of delivery &#8212; and we deliver within a two hour window today,&#8221; he goes on. </span>&#8220;Over time this will potentially decrease &#8212; into [a more] faster [service] &#8212; or we&#8217;ll offer the ability for customers who want to get their products faster to pay a delivery fee. But for now the model is closer to AmazonFresh and Picnic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the customers that we&#8217;ve spoken with &#8212; all the customers that are buying from us today &#8212; value assortment and value the quality of the products over the speed of the delivery,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do own our stores, basically &#8212; it&#8217;s a dark warehouse model &#8212; nonetheless it&#8217;s larger in size than the quick commerce warehouses because we will expand our SKUs today from 1.5k to 5k. And we don&#8217;t need as many warehouses in the city as the quick commerce player.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite having the relative luxury of (pretty) relaxed delivery times (vs instant grocery/q-commerce), Yababa still aims to maintain control over the delivery experience. So, while it&#8217;s sourcing delivery staff via third party companies, it takes care of their training and Hage also says it aims to hire from the same communities it&#8217;s targeting in order to provide the best fit between deliverer and customer.</p>
<p>Yababa&#8217;s founding team, meanwhile, brings plenty of seasoned experience to the table via past roles in on-demand food and logistics businesses.</p>
<p>Hage, for example, has previously worked in management positions at food delivery firm Delivery Hero and digital insurer, Wefox &#8212; including co-founding NokNok, a 10min grocery delivery company operating in the Middle East.</p>
<p>He also notes that he has a migrant and Middle Eastern background himself, having been born in Beirut.</p>

<p>Yababa&#8217;s other co-founders are also seasoned in logistics: There&#8217;s Hadi Zaklouta (also ex-Delivery Hero); Javier Gimenez (previously at e-scooter startup, Tier Mobility); and Kamel Semakieh (whose career history includes co-founding a delivery logistics platform in Lebanon).</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most important things today is that no one has time to learn,&#8221; says Hage when asked what experiences the founding team is bringing with them from their prior workplaces. &#8220;You need to have people on your team that already have context. People that have done this before in the areas where they are focused today.</p>
<p>&#8220;So if you look at the founding team today it&#8217;s people that I&#8217;ve known and I&#8217;ve worked with in the past. So I understand exactly what their skills are, their skill-sets, how they operate and we can work very closely today &#8212; we have an element of trust and we solve problems really well together.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Europe&#8217;s online grocery space positively sizzlingly with investor cash and frenzied competition (not to mention a lot of consolidation), there is the question of whether Yababa is building a business for the long term &#8212; with the aim of an eventual IPO &#8212; or hoping for a quick exit to one of the convenience-focused food app giants who will likely be casting around for fresh segments to bolt on as/when the convenience growth slows?</p>
<p>After all, on-demand hot meals platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/">Delivery Hero already took a slice of Gorillas</a> &#8212; leading its Series C round last month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, if there&#8217;s anything we know about this market &#8212; whether it&#8217;s food or groceries &#8212; is that it will lead to consolidation,&#8221; says Hage. &#8220;It&#8217;s been consolidated over the years, and this is one of the things that I did for Delivery Hero in the Middle East &#8212; I did M&amp;A integrations for them as part of my role &#8212; and this is something that I definitely understand. And it&#8217;s part of how I position the business. But my goal in building this company is not to sell it in a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not &#8212; from a business perspective &#8212; the most profitable or strategic decision for either our stakeholders or us as a team. A lot of hard work to build a business today and we want a brand that becomes a household name and lasts over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever invests in us or whoever is interested in acquiring us &#8212; I think this is only a vote a confidence and is something that we appreciate and admire if we get to that stage. But we&#8217;re not building a company with a goal of selling it in a year. And this is not the reason why our investors wants to work with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The meaty size of the seed raise is a measure of Yababa&#8217;s ambition to scale first &#8212; and scale fast, per Hage.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a few things we want to achieve with the next round. Expansion is one of them. With the fresh capital we plan to basically go beyond Germany fairly quickly &#8212; we strongly believe there is a landgrab opportunity in this business today and we want to make sure we are well positioned in the cities that make sense for us, based on where our customers and the communities we want to target are,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will build a network of warehouses. We want to broaden our assortment. And make sure that we not only serve the customers with products that they know and find in Germany today &#8212; but also more exciting products that they know from home that are not available in Germany. So we want to focus on making sure that we&#8217;re bringing more and more relevant products over time &#8212; identify gaps in the offering and figure out where to get them from. Because this is one of the most compelling and important part of what we do &#8212; is offering people products that they really want and they miss from home.</p>
<p>&#8220;And obviously scale our supply chain &#8212; from a technical perspective, operational perspective &#8212; and continue growing the team. We want to hire some of the best people in Europe today and we&#8217;re building a fantastic culture so far. And something that&#8217;s important for us to do is to make sure that we continue to have this culture of excellence that we&#8217;ve started with.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Yababa is obviously differentiating via the mix of products it stocks, Hage says it will also be doing more to distinguish its app experience from more vanilla/Western food shopping services &#8212; such as by localizing language content.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a few different phases for the app itself,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Today we operate similar to other food delivery or grocery delivery apps &#8212; so the experience is quite familiar. Nonetheless the plan is to localize the experience so we&#8217;re now in the process of translating to the local languages of the audiences that we&#8217;re serving. And I think this is an extremely important element in what we&#8217;re trying to build &#8212; not only on the app itself but customer service and drivers as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>More differentiating flavor will be incoming for the app experience too &#8212; but Hage is keeping Yababa&#8217;s plans on that front under wraps for now, saying only: &#8220;Over time we&#8217;ll build more exciting features that customers would love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From a personal level I have a big connection to the product that I&#8217;m building today,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;I personally come from the Middle East &#8212; I was born in Beirut during a very difficult time, I left home super early &#8212; started working at a very young age and ever since have been moving countries over and over again. Lived in many different places and have been chasing this idea of home. So for me food has been the closest thing that I have to home &#8212; and I&#8217;ve always wanted to build a product where I can show how special [is] the food and the groceries and the different variety of cuisines in the region where I come from to the Western market. So matching those two ideas together basically, today we have Yababa.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Commenting on the funding in a statement, Peter Specht, partner at Creandum, said: “We’ve seen a range of fast-rising generalist and convenience grocery players recently, however the segment for multicultural groceries is still overlooked in Europe. Just as it’s a differentiated market in the offline world with verticalized retailers, suppliers and customer needs, we foresee the same trend on the digital side.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Yababa founders impressed us with their vision, know-how and close ties to the communities &#8212; as well as their track record from high growth startups in the food and grocery delivery space. We’re proud to back Ralph, Hadi, Javier and Kamel to build the European market leader.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Anton Waitz, general partner at Project A Ventures, added: “Multicultural grocery shopping is an underserved and very fragmented market, widely differing from city to city and district to district. The amazing and experienced Yababa team is on a mission to enrich the everyday lives of millions of people in Europe &#8212; not only with the best-possible shopping convenience but also by offering a truly unique food supply.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’ve followed corporate card and spend management startups in the U.S., you might be familiar with <a href="https://www.brex.com">Brex</a> and <a href="https://ramp.com">Ramp</a>. Payhawk is also offering an all-in-one financial management solution for businesses, but with a focus on European customers. And the company just raised a $112 million Series B round at a $570 million valuation.</p>
<p>Greenoaks is leading the round, with all existing investors participating once again, such as QED Investors and Earlybird Digital East.</p>
<p>Payhawk wants to replace several services that companies use to simplify their financial stack and make things work better together. Customers get their own account with a dedicated IBAN. They can connect this Payhawk account to their existing bank account to load and withdraw funds.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237218" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After that, you can use Payhawk for all things related to payment. Customes can issue virtual and physical cards for employees with a set rules, such as a team budget or an approval workflow. This way, employees don’t have to pay with their personal cards.</p>
<p>There are no conversion fees with transactions in EUR, GBP and USD. For other currencies, Payhawk charges a 1.99% exchange markup. The startup recently <a href="https://payhawk.com/blog/payhawk-releases-enterprise-suite-and-3-cashback-on-all-payments/">introduced</a> 3% cashback on card payments with a cap at the Payhawk subscription price.</p>
<p>Payhawk also handles invoice collection so that clients can reconcile expenses from their employees. The startup has also built several integrations with ERP systems — you can automatically sync expenses and receipts with traditional accounting software.</p>
<p>You can also use your Payhawk balance to reimburse employees in case they had to use cash. If your bank charges fees on outgoing bank transfers, you can also use Payhawk to pay bills without paying any transfer fee. It&#8217;s also a way to keep everything in the same interface.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Managing company cards, especially reports, bill payments, and invoices is currently a disconnected experience bridged by finance teams through a lot of manual work. We are building enterprise software running on global payments infrastructure that automates all spend processes. Our strong product background and engineering team allows us to move at break-neck speed,” co-founder and CEO Hristo Borisov said in a statement.</p>
<p>In Europe, Payhawk competes with <a href="https://www.spendesk.com">Spendesk</a>, <a href="https://www.pleo.io/en">Pleo</a>, <a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-FR/business/business-account">Revolut Business</a> and others. As you can see, there are quite a lot of players in this space, meaning that there’s a big market opportunity.</p>
<p>Payhawk currently has offices in London, Sofia, Berlin and Barcelona. It has customers across 27 European countries but most of them are in the U.K., Germany, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Since the company’s Series A round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/payhawk-raises-20-million-to-unify-corporate-cards-payments-and-expenses/">earlier this year</a>, Payhawk saw a huge increase of 663% in transaction volume. As the company generates revenue on interchange fees, that metric tells you that the company&#8217;s revenue is also growing rapidly.</p>
<p>Up next, the company plans to open offices in the U.S., the Netherlands, Australia and Singapore. It should give you an idea of the company’s upcoming market expansions. In addition to cards that are directly tied to your Payhawk balance, the company is also working on credit cards as well as better cross-border transactions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s problems with European privacy law could be about to get a whole lot worse. But ahead of what may soon be a major (and long overdue) regulatory showdown over the legality of its surveillance-based business model, Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) is facing a Facebook-shaped problem of its own: It&#8217;s now the subject of a criminal complaint alleging corruption and even bribery in the service of covering its own backside (we paraphrase) and shrinking the public understand of the regulatory problems facing Facebook&#8217;s business.</p>
<p>European privacy campaign group <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/irish-dpc-removes-noyb-gdpr-procedure-criminal-report-filed">noyb</a> has filed the criminal complaint against the Irish DPC, which is Facebook&#8217;s lead regulator in the EU for data protection.</p>
<p>noyb is making the complaint under Austrian law &#8212; reporting the Irish regulator to the Austrian Office for the Prosecution of Corruption (aka <a href="https://www.justiz.gv.at/wksta/wirtschafts-und-korruptionsstaatsanwaltschaft.312.de.html">WKStA</a>) after the DPC sought to use what noyb terms &#8220;procedural blackmail&#8221; to try to gag it and prevent it from publishing documents related to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) complaints against Facebook.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238291" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The not-for-profit alleges that the Irish regulator sought to pressure it to sign an &#8220;illegal&#8221; non-disclosure agreement (NDA) in relation to a public procedure &#8212; its complaint argues there is no legal basis for such a requirement &#8212; accusing the DPC of seeking to coerce it into silence, as Facebook would surely wish, by threatening not to comply with its regulatory duty to hear the complainant unless noyb signed the NDA. Which is quite the (alleged) quid-pro-quo.</p>
<p>The letter sent by the DPC to noyb seeking an agreement to maintain the confidentiality of all material relating to objections by other DPAs (as well as any associated observations by the data controller (Facebook), complainant (noyb et al), DPC or other EU supervisory authorities) vis-a-vis a draft decision related a complaint against Facebook that&#8217;s undergoing an active dispute resolution procedure &#8212; &#8220;on the grounds that such arrangements are necessary to preserve/maintain free and frank exchanges&#8221; and to ensure that &#8220;interim views&#8221; are not aired in order to &#8220;preserve the confidentiality and integrity of the co-decision-making procedure&#8221; as the DPC&#8217;s letter circularly demands &#8212; has been published by noyb <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2021-11/2021-11-12%20-%20Letter_DPC%20-%20NOYB_redacted.pdf">here</a> (redacting the name/s of the DPC officer/s who put their name/s to the demand).</p>
<p>&#8220;The DPC acknowledges that it has a legal duty to hear us but it now engaged in a form of &#8216;procedural coercion&#8217;,&#8221; said noyb chair, Max Schrems, in a statement. &#8220;The right to be heard was made conditional on us signing an agreement, to the benefit of the DPC and Facebook. It is nothing but an authority demanding to give up the freedom of speech in exchange for procedural rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>The regulator has also demanded noyb remove documents it has previously made public &#8212; related to the DPC&#8217;s draft decision of a GDPR complaint against Facebook &#8212; again without clarifying what legal basis it has to make such a demand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As noyb points out, it is based in Austria, not Ireland &#8212; so is subject to Austrian law, not Irish law. But, regardless, even under Irish law it argues there&#8217;s no legal duty for parties to keep documents confidential &#8212; pointing out that <a class="m_4651245392375765138link1" href="https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/7/section/26/enacted/en/html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/act/7/section/26/enacted/en/html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637677562393000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Jpv6Y0rwsYGwqFH1L_lZ_">Section 26 of the Irish Data Protection Act</a>, which was cited by the DPC in this matter, only applies to DPC staff (&#8220;relevant person&#8221;), not to parties.</p>
<p>&#8220;Generally we have very good and professional relationships with authorities. We have not taken this step lightly, but the conduct of the DPC has finally crossed all red lines. The basically deny us all our rights to a fair procedure unless we agree to shut up,&#8221; added Schrems.</p>
<p>He went on to warn that &#8220;Austrian corruption laws are far reaching&#8221; &#8212; and to further emphasize: &#8220;When an official requests the slightest benefit to conduct a legal duty, the corruption provisions may be triggered. Legally there is no difference between demanding an unlawful agreement or a bottle of wine.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of which looks exceptionally awkward for the Irish regulator. Which already, let&#8217;s not forget &#8212; at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/"><em>literal start</em> of this year</a> &#8212; agreed to &#8220;swiftly&#8221; finalize another fractious complaint made by Schrems, this one relating to Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data transfers, and which dates all the way back to 2013, following noyb bringing a legal procedure.</p>
<p>(But of course there&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/facebook-loses-last-ditch-attempt-to-derail-dpc-decision-on-its-eu-us-data-flows/">still no sign of a DPC resolution of that Facebook complaint either</a>&#8230; So, uhhh, &#8216;Siri: Show me regulatory capture&#8217;&#8230; )</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/irelands-draft-gdpr-decision-against-facebook-branded-a-joke/">Last month</a> noyb published a draft decision by the DPC in relation to another (slightly less vintage) complaint against Facebook &#8212; which suggested the tech giant&#8217;s lead EU data regulator intended <em>not</em> to challenge Facebook&#8217;s attempt to use an opaque legal switch to bypass EU rules (by claiming that users are actually in a contract with it receive targeted ads, ergo GDPR consent requirements do not apply).</p>
<p>The DPC had furthermore suggested a wrist-slap penalty of $36M &#8212; for Facebook failing transparency requirements over the aforementioned &#8216;ad contract&#8217;.</p>
<p>That decision remains to be finalized because &#8212; under the GDPR&#8217;s one-stop-shop mechanism, for deciding cross-border complaints &#8212; other EU DPAs have a right to object to a lead supervisor&#8217;s preliminary decision and can ratchet out a different outcome. Which is what noyb is suggesting may be about to happen vis-a-vis this particular Facebook complaint saga.</p>
<p>Winding back slightly, despite the EU&#8217;s GDPR being well over three years old (in technical application terms), the DPC has yet to make a single final finding against Facebook proper.</p>
<p>So far it&#8217;s only managed one decision against Facebook-owned WhatsApp &#8212; which resulted in an inflated financial penalty for transparency failures by the messaging platform after other EU DPAs intervened to object to a (similarly) low-ball draft sanction Ireland had initially suggested. In the end <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">WhatsApp was hit with a fine of $267M</a> &#8212; also for breaching GDPR transparency obligations. A notable increase on the DPC&#8217;s offer of a fine of up to $56M.</p>
<p>The tech giant is appealing that penalty &#8212; but has also said it will be tweaking its privacy policy in Europe in the meanwhile. So it&#8217;s a (hard won) win for European privacy advocates &#8212; for now.</p>
<p>The WhatsApp GDPR complaint is just the tip, of course. The DPC has been sitting, hen-like, on a raft of data protection complaints against Facebook and other Facebook-owned platforms &#8212; including several filed by noyb on the very the day the regulation came into technical application all the way back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">May 2018</a>.</p>
<p>These &#8216;forced consent&#8217; complaints by noyb strike at the heart of the headlock Facebook applies to users by not offering them an opt-out from tracking based advertising. Instead the &#8216;deal&#8217; Facebook (now known as Meta) offers is a take-it or leave-it &#8216;choice&#8217; &#8212; either accept ads or delete your account &#8212; despite the GDPR setting a robust standard for what can legally constitute consent that states it must be specific, informed and <em>freely given</em>.</p>
<p>Arm twisting is not allowed. Yet Facebook has been twisting European&#8217;s arms before <em>and since</em> the GDPR, all the same.</p>
<p>So the &#8216;forced consent&#8217; complaints &#8212; if they do ever actually get enforced &#8212; have the potential to purge the tech giant&#8217;s surveillance-based business model once and for all. As, perhaps, does the vintage EU-US data transfers issue. (Certainly it would crank up Facebook&#8217;s operational costs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/max-schrems-on-the-eu-court-ruling-that-could-cut-facebook-in-two/">if it had to federate its service so that Europeans&#8217; data was stored and processed within the EU</a> to fix the risk of US government mass surveillance.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook, Google face first GDPR complaints over &#8216;forced consent&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/embed/#?secret=ynxBxNmYTa" data-secret="ynxBxNmYTa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However, per the draft DPC decision on the forced consent issue, published (by noyb) last month, the Irish regulator appeared to be preparing to (at best) sidestep the crux question of the the legality of Facebook&#8217;s data mining, writing in a summary: “There is no obligation on Facebook to seek to rely solely on consent for the purposes of legitimising personal data processing where it is offering a contract to a user which some users might assess as one that primarily concerns the processing of personal data. Nor has Facebook purported to rely on consent under the GDPR.”</p>
<p>noyb has previously accused the DPC of holding secret meetings with Facebook around the time it came up with the claimed consent bypass and just as the GDPR was about come into application &#8212; implying the regulator was seeking to support Facebook in finding a workaround for EU law.</p>
<p>The not-for-profit also warned last month that if Facebook&#8217;s relabelling &#8220;trick&#8221; (i.e. switching a claim of &#8216;consent&#8217; to a claim of &#8216;contract&#8217;) were to be accepted by EU regulators it would undermine the whole of the GDPR &#8212; making the much lauded data protection regime trivially easy for data-mining giants to bypass.</p>
<p>Likewise, noyb argues, had it signed the DPC&#8217;s demanded NDA it would have &#8220;greatly benefited Facebook&#8221;.</p>
<p>It would also have helped the DPC by keeping a lid on the awkward detail of lengthy and labyrinthine proceedings &#8212; at a time when the regulator is facing rising heat over its inaction against big tech, <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/data-protection/news/european-parliament-calls-for-infringement-procedure-against-ireland/">including from lawmakers on home soil</a>. (Some of which are now pushing for reform of the Commission &#8212; including the suggestion that more commissioners should be recruited to remove sole decision-making power from the current incumbent, Helen Dixon.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The DPC is continuously under fire by other DPAs, in public inquiries and the media. If an NDA would hinder <em>noyb&#8217;s </em>freedom of speech, the DPC&#8217;s reputational damage could be limited,&#8221; noyb suggests in a press release, before going on to note that had it been granted a benefit by signing an NDA (&#8220;in direct exchange for the DPC to conduct its legal duties&#8221;) its own staff could have potentially committed a crime under the Austrian Criminal Act.</p>
<p>The not-for-profit instead opted to dial up publicity &#8212; and threaten a little disinfecting sunlight &#8212; by filing a criminal complaint with the Austrian Office for the Prosecution of Corruption.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s essentially telling the DPC to put up a legal defence of its procedural gagging attempts &#8212; or, well, shut up.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Schrems again: &#8220;We very much hope that Facebook or the DPC will file legal proceedings against us, to finally clarify that freedom of speech prevails over the scare tactics of a multinational and its taxpayer-funded minion. Unfortunately we must expect that they know themselves that they have no legal basis to take any action, which is why they reverted to procedural blackmail in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nor is noyb alone in receiving correspondence from the DPC that&#8217;s seeking to apply swingeing confidentiality clauses to complainants.</p>
<p>Following publication of noyb&#8217;s criminal complaint, Johnny Ryan, a fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnyryan/status/1463056901688770561">tweeted</a> that it received a &#8220;confidentiality demand&#8221; from the DPC in relation to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">a GDPR complaint raised against Google&#8217;s adtech</a> &#8212; suggesting the regulator is seeking to use the same threat of silence or be removed from the proceeding against another complainant against big tech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything I and my lawyers read would be tracked in a &#8216;data room&#8217;. Otherwise, DPC withholds all materials from us (including Google docs that are already public),&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">DPC also sent us a confidentiality demand -in my complaint v mega Google RTB data breach. <br />It is 6,429 words long.<br />Everything I and my lawyers read would be tracked in a “data room”.

<p>&mdash; Johnny Ryan (@johnnyryan) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnyryan/status/1463056901688770561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>TechCrunch has also reviewed correspondence sent to the Irish regulator earlier this fall by (yet) another complainant &#8212; who writes to query its legal basis for a request to gag disclosure of correspondence and draft reports.</p>
<p>Despite repeated requests for clarification by the complainant, the DPC appears to have entirely failed &#8212; over the course of more than a month &#8212; to reply to the request for its legal basis for making such a gag request.</p>
<p>This suggests noyb&#8217;s experience of threats and scare tactics lacking legal substance is not unique &#8212; by looks rather more like <em>modus operandi</em> &#8212; backing up its claim that the DPC has questions to answer about &#8220;how it conducts its office&#8221;.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the DPC for comment on the allegations it&#8217;s facing.</p>
<p>But what about Facebook? noyb&#8217;s press release goes on to predict a &#8220;tremendous commercial problem&#8221; looming for the data-mining giant &#8212; as it says DPC correspondence &#8220;shows that other European DPAs have submitted &#8216;relevant and reasoned objections&#8217; and oppose the DPC&#8217;s view&#8221; [i.e. in the consent bypass complaint against Facebook].</p>
<p>&#8220;If the other DPAs have a majority and ultimately overturn the DPC&#8217;s draft decision, Facebook could face a legal disaster, as most commercial use of personal data in the EU since 2018 would be retroactively declared illegal,&#8221; noyb suggests, adding: &#8220;Given that the other <a class="m_4651245392375765138link1" href="https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines-art_6-1-b-adopted_after_public_consultation_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines-art_6-1-b-adopted_after_public_consultation_en.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637677562393000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2_NBGwQ9Ls0KX8ID6WTM-z">DPAs passed Guidelines in 2019</a> that are very unfavourable to Facebook&#8217;s position, such a scenario is highly likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>The not-for-profit has more awkward revelations for the DPC and Facebook in the pipe, too.</p>
<p>It says it&#8217;s preparing fresh document releases in the coming weeks &#8212; related to correspondence from the DPC and/or Facebook &#8212; as a &#8220;protest&#8221; against attempts to gag it and to silence democratic debate about public procedures.</p>
<p>&#8220;On each Sunday in advent, noyb will publish another document, together with a video explaining the documents and an analysis why the use of these documents is fully compliant with all applicable laws,&#8221; it notes, adding that what it&#8217;s billing as the &#8220;advent reading&#8221; will be published on <em><a href="http://noyb.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://noyb.eu&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637677562393000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ycpkhoBqC9C0EwAmox32c">noyb.eu</a> &#8212; </em>&#8220;so tune in!&#8221;.</p>
<p>So looks like the next batch of &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/internal-facebook-documents-highlight-its-moderation-and-misinformation-issues/">Facebook Papers</a>&#8216; that Meta would really rather you didn&#8217;t see will be dropping soon&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lost-item tracker company Tile, which competes with Apple&#8217;s AirTag is being acquired by family communication service Life360. The deal is valued at $205 million and will see Tile continue to be led as its own brand under its existing CEO CJ Prober. The company says no further changes to the Tile team are currently planned and Prober will also now join the Life360 board of directors.</p>
<p>This is the second recent hardware acquisition for Life360, which earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/family-tracking-app-life360-to-acquire-wearable-location-device-jiobit-for-37m/">acquired</a> the location device maker Jiobit for $37 million. The company then said its goal was to expand its family tracking capabilities beyond those who have smartphones capable of running its app &#8212;  smaller children, children with special needs, and pets, for example.</p>
<p>In the case of Tile, however, the company says it sees the potential in expanding its business beyond family tracking to become a broader solution for finding &#8220;the people, pets, and things&#8221; that families care most about. The company envisions a combined service that offers a unified platform where users can track their family members and stay in touch, but also keep track of their items &#8212; like wallets, keys, remote controls and more &#8212; using Tile&#8217;s location-based finding capabilities.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238443" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Tile also has partnerships with over 50 different third-party devices, from wireless earbuds to laptops to dog collars, which also make the deal more valuable. And it runs the sizable &#8220;Tile Finding Network,&#8221; which taps into its install base of Tile owners who run the Tile mobile app to locate items when they&#8217;re out of Bluetooth range. To date, Tile has sold over 40 million devices and has over 425,000 paying customers, but hadn&#8217;t disclosed its total number of active users.</p>
<p>Life360 says the addition of its 33 million smartphone users is expected to increase the reach of Tile&#8217;s Finding Network by 10x.</p>
<p>&#8220;This acquisition marks a key step forward towards Life360 achieving its vision of being the world’s leading platform for safety and location services. We are thrilled to welcome Tile to the Life 360 family,&#8221; noted Chris Hulls, Co-Founder and CEO of Life360, in a statement.</p>
<p>Ahead of this news, Tile in September <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/tile-secures-another-40-million-to-take-on-apple-airtag-with-new-products/">announced</a> a $40 million debt round of financing which Prober had said made sense because it&#8217;s good to have a mix of &#8220;debt and equity&#8221; on the books, as the debt &#8220;doesn&#8217;t incur dilution to our shareholders.&#8221; But there&#8217;s no doubt Tile&#8217;s future was threatened since the launch of the Apple AirTag &#8212; the company went on to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/">a staunch Apple critic</a> over antitrust issues and even <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/17/tile-apple-antitrust-opening-statement/">testified</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-apple-tile/tile-says-apples-behavior-is-anticompetitive-and-has-gotten-worse-not-better-idUSKBN21J72V?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtechnologyNews+%28Reuters+Technology+News%29">before</a> lawmakers about the impacts Apple was having on its business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tile also recently revamped its product line, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/tile-unveils-its-new-product-lineup-including-its-upcoming-apple-airtag-rival-tile-ultra/">including</a> its upcoming AirTag rival powered by ultra-wideband, in the hopes of remaining competitive.</p>
<p>Both companies have some commonalities in that their approach is to be platform-agnostic, working across iOS and Android devices alike &#8212; the latter which could aid with international expansion efforts, as Android dominates in many global markets.</p>
<p>Following the deal, Life360 will have access to consumers in over 27,000 retail stores where Tiles are sold and the over one million third-party devices which has Tile&#8217;s technology built in. Both companies also offer premium subscription services, and Life360 expects to now expand its paid subscriber base by 45% to around 1.6 million people. In the future, a combined offering could help convert more free users to paying customers, the companies likely hope.</p>
<p>Life360 has been listed on the Australian Securities Exchange since 2019, and had previously announced plans for a potential dual listing in the U.S. in 2022. This deal will add momentum to that goal, Life360 said.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse and Code Advisors acted as Life360’s joint financial advisers on the deal. DLA Piper and Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe LLP acted as Life360’s legal advisers, the company reported. Jefferies LLC served as exclusive financial advisor to Tile and Fenwick and West LLP served as Tile’s legal adviser.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a great day for Tile, our customers, and our employees,” said CJ Prober, CEO of Tile, in a statement.  &#8220;This acquisition not only brings together two incredible teams with complementary missions and values, it paves the way for us to jointly build the world’s leading solutions for peace of mind and safety. This is the next step in our journey, and I could not be more excited to continue leading our incredible team and to join the Life360 Board,&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2>Musk: SpaceX to conduct first orbital flight of Starship in January</h2>
<p>SpaceX CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/spacex-aims-to-conduct-first-orbital-flight-of-starship-in-january-musk-says/">Elon Musk gave a talk</a> at the National Academies&#8217; first virtual joint fall meeting of the Space Studies Board and the Board on Physics and Astronomy on Wednesday night, followed by a Q&amp;A session with Academy members on the technical and operational aspects of Starship, SpaceX&#8217;s ultra-super-heavy launch system.</p>
<p>First, the logistical details: Musk said he anticipates conducting the first orbital flight of Starship in January, followed by dozens or possibly more launches through the rest of the year. He added candidly that while the first orbital launch is not likely to be successful, he&#8217;s &#8220;comfortable&#8221; Starship will reach orbit at some point next year.</p>
<p>This is significant and not <em>totally </em>unsurprising. While Musk has made a handful of predictions before about when Starship might attempt an orbital launch, all of that has been dependent on the Federal Aviation Administration completing its regulatory review of SpaceX&#8217;s Boca Chica launch site, Starbase. Well now, the <a href="https://www.permits.performance.gov/permitting-project/spacex-starshipsuper-heavy-launch-vehicle-program-spacex-boca-chica-launch-site" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAA has officially confirmed</a> that it anticipates the review will be complete by December 31, so a January launch is looking more likely than ever.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Musk also reaffirmed his vision of Starship as a tool that can make humans truly multi-planetary for the first time in history. He described the vehicle as “a generalized transport mechanism for the greater solar system&#8221; &#8212; that means the moon, Mars and even beyond.</p>
<h2>Rocket Lab acquires PSC, recovers booster after sending BlackSky satellites to orbit</h2>
<p>Rocket Lab was busy this week. First, the launch company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/rocket-lab-acquires-planetary-systems-corporation-in-cash-and-stock-deal/">announced it was acquiring spacecraft separation systems company Planetary Systems Corporation</a>, Rocket Lab&#8217;s third acquisition in around 18 months or so. Then there was the company&#8217;s third-quarter earnings call. On Wednesday evening, the company &#8212; drumroll, please &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/rocket-labs-electron-booster-splashes-down-in-the-pacific-ocean/">successfully recovered the first stage</a> of its Electron launcher for the third time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236270" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236270" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2236270" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/rocket-lab.gif" alt="" width="640" height="370" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236270" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://rocketlabusa.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocket Lab <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Rocket Lab has successfully recovered the first-stage booster twice in its history. During all three flights, this booster made a splashdown via parachute. But Wednesday night&#8217;s recovery included an additional element: the presence of a helicopter, which hovered near the splashdown area to track and observe the booster as it made its descent. While the helicopter didn’t actually assist with recovery, its presence is significant, as it indicates that Rocket Lab is also a step closer to executing its ultimate reusability plan: using a parachute to slow the velocity of the booster and capturing it mid-air.</p>
<p>Finally, Rocket Lab finished out the week with even <em>more </em>news: It has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Johns Hopkins University to commercialize small spacecraft telemetry and control radio technology. It&#8217;s calling the software-defined radio product &#8220;Frontier-S by Rocket Lab.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 22, 2021! I am happy to report that this is a holiday week in the United States, so expect the news to be busy until Wednesday at around midday, at which point the Americans in your life are going to switch off the internet and start eating. Don’t call; we’re on the couch! — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/nft-music-rights-startup-royal-banks-55m-investment-from-a16z-crypto/"><strong>NFTs + music = Royal?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today news broke that Royal, a startup that is bringing NFTs, fractional ownership and music rights together in a single package, announced a $55 million raise. This after it raised some $16 million the other month. That’s a lot of money! A good question at this juncture is this: <em>Why do crypto startups appear to require so very much capital to do regular startuppy things?</em></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/riot-games-new-esports-president-on-nba-collaboration-its-hit-netflix-series-and-nfts/"><strong>League of Legends is still ultra-popular:</strong></a> TechCrunch has an interesting dig into the world of LoL today parsing its recent Worlds tournament — <a href="https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Team_Liquid">sadly Team Liquid struggled</a> — viewership numbers and its work with the NBA. Frankly it’s a good reminder of just how big the world of esports remains, even if we’ve heard a little less from startups in the domain of late.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/what-happened-to-paytms-ipo-valuation/"><strong>What happened to Paytm’s IPO?</strong></a><strong> </strong>In the wake of a huge public debut, Indian fintech giant Paytm struggled to hold onto its market value. It fell during its first day of trading, and it fell again today after a market break in its home country last Friday. Our read, after going back through its numbers, is that the company’s IPO was simply mispriced.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/creator-driven-marketplace-ltk-now-valued-at-2b-after-raising-300m-from-softbank/"><strong>If you say “creator” three times in the mirror, a VC will appear and stuff money into your hands:</strong></a> Today’s creator-economy round is a doozy. LTK has raised $300 million from SoftBank, valuing the company at $2 billion. Per TechCrunch, LTK “helps social media influencers make their posts shoppable and houses them on a central marketplace, both on the web and on its app.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/fsd-africa-expands-insurtech-accelerator-program-to-ghana-and-nigeria/"><strong>FSD Africa wants to bolster insurtech on the continent:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Insurtech remains a hot startup category despite some public-market whoopsies in the United States. So much so that a group is “set to launch insurtech accelerator programs in Ghana and Nigeria next year.” TechCrunch has the news.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/eu-retail-giant-schwarz-group-snags-security-startup-xm-cyber-for-700-million/"><strong>Here’s $700M worth of cybersecurity liquidity:</strong></a> Today Schwarz Group, what we called “an EU-based retail company,” announced that it has purchased Israeli security startup XM Cyber for $700 million. That is a great many duckets, leading myself to wonder why the deal came together. Per our own Ron Miller, the gist is that the retail company wants to protect itself, so it bought a company to help with the work.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/autocloud-raises-4m-to-commercialize-its-oss-cloud-visualization-service/"><strong>AutoCloud raises $4M for cloud viz:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today’s news that AutoCloud — the company behind the CloudGraph open source project — raised capital was not a surprise. Startups with an open source component have been hot lately, making investments into their ranks completely non-shocking.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/fractional-lands-5-5-million-to-let-friends-and-strangers-invest-in-real-estate-together/"><strong>Fractional wants to help you buy real estate with your friends:</strong></a> While Zillow and other public companies play the iBuying game, smaller companies are hoping to help you get into the buying wars. Fractional wants to help you and friends buy real estate together. And Doorvest, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/2236404/">which we covered last week</a>, wants to help users buy and manage rentals. Fun space to keep an eye on.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/irelands-fonoa-raises-20-5m-to-help-digital-first-businesses-stay-tax-compliant-as-they-scale-globally/"><strong>Fonoa raises $20.5M for global tax compliance:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Software is great because you can sell it over the internet, which means you can build a global customer base. But, when you do, you also engender a varied tax bill. Enter Fonoa, which wants to help customers untie that particular Gordian knot.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/render-secures-20m-series-a-to-compete-with-the-big-three-cloud-vendors/"><strong>TechCrunch battlefield winner Render renders unto itself a $20M Series A:</strong></a> DevOps is a big freakin’ software category because developers are very expensive. So, tooling budgets for the group exist to ensure that staffing dollars are put to good use. Render’s round is another example of that fact.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/nigerian-fintech-abeg-faces-its-biggest-test-yet-after-blitzscaling-to-millions-of-users/"><strong>Abeg shows that there are other ways to advertise your startup than Facebook ads:</strong></a> After sponsoring a reality TV show on its home continent, African fintech startup Abeg saw a huge influx of new users. TechCrunch has the deets on the deal and some questions that surround the company itself, but the marketing ploy appears to have worked.</li>
<li>And, because it is both cute and neat, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/analogues-pocket-retro-gaming-handheld-console-ships-on-december-14/">check out this retro handheld coming soon</a>.</li>

<p>Before he became a partner at Battery Ventures, Bill Binch was chief revenue officer at Pendo, a product analytics app.</p>
<p>In his former role, he was responsible for providing his company&#8217;s board with quarterly updates on growth and revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a wise mentor once told me, no one ever gets a promotion from a board meeting, but people sure do get fired afterward,&#8221; he writes in an article about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/5-must-have-board-slides-for-saas-sales-and-revenue-leaders/">five slides sales and revenue teams <strong>must</strong> get right:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Headline reel.</li>
<li>Detailed, five-quarter view.</li>
<li>Segments, geographies and verticals.</li>
<li>Pipeline.</li>
<li>Sales team health.</li>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/walmart-will-be-the-first-retailer-to-test-twitters-new-livestream-shopping-platform/">Live shopping coming to Twitter:</a> </strong>And Walmart is its first retail partner? I don’t really want to shop on Twitter. I want to read tweets. But I am merely one single, religious DAU and thus only get so much sway on Twitter’s product choices (none). Regardless, Twitter <em>is</em> getting into live shopping, a category popular in some Asian markets and, perhaps, soon, maybe, here as well with folks under the age of 80.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/astra-moves-full-steam-ahead-after-successful-orbital-launch-looks-to-test-rocket-4-0-next-year/">Astra’s rocket doesn’t go boom, does reach orbit, allows for more tests:</a></strong> Most startups don’t have binary outcomes. Things tend to fall along a shading line, grayer or not depending on the circumstance. Rocket tests are not like that. They either make it to orbit or not, as was the case with Astra. After one of its rockets did not, the next one did. Now the company is marching forward with more work.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/ericsson-to-acquire-cloud-communications-company-vonage-for-6-2b/"><strong>And to close us out, another deal</strong></a>, this time with Ericsson (international networking) buying Vonage (cloud communications) in a deal worth $6.2 billion. Both are names that I once heard rather often but have not in some time. Perhaps as a pair they can make a bit more noise. And by noise we mean money.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Niantic, the augmented reality platform that&#8217;s developing games like Pokémon GO, <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/coatue/?hl=en">raised $300 million</a> from Coatue, valuing the company at $9 billion. The San Fransisco-based startup, which initially<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/how-a-google-side-project-evolved-into-a-4b-company/"> spun out of Google</a>, will use this money to build what it calls the &#8220;real-world metaverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>As early as August, Niantic founder and CEO John Hanke has referred to the metaverse &#8212; at least, the one that renders us bound to VR headsets, like in &#8220;Ready Player One&#8221; &#8212; as a &#8220;<a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/real-world-metaverse/">dystopian nightmare</a>.&#8221; Unlike Facebook, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">changed its company name to Meta</a> to signal its investment in VR technology, Niantic wants to develop technology that brings people closer to the outside world. Earlier this month, Niantic unveiled its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/niantic-reveals-its-vision-for-a-real-world-metaverse-releases-lightship-ar-developer-kit/">Lightship AR Developer Kit</a> (ARDK), which makes tools to develop AR games publicly available for free to anyone who has a basic knowledge of the Unity game engine.</p>
<p>“At Niantic, we believe humans are the happiest when their virtual world leads them to a physical one,” Hanke said at the time. “Unlike a sci-fi metaverse, a real-world metaverse will use technology to improve our experience of the world as we’ve known it for thousands of years.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238311" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The funding will help expand the ARDK, which has already been used by companies like Coachella, Historic Royal Palaces, Universal Pictures, SoftBank, Warner Music Group and the PGA of America to create augmented reality experiences. So, instead of using technology like VR headsets &#8212; which are still inaccessible to much of the population &#8212; AR projects mostly use smartphones to encourage people to explore their outside surroundings. You might walk by the same mural every day, for example, but in Pokémon GO, a user-generated Pokéstop description might tell you what that mural actually represents. Niantic says that tens of millions of people play Niantic&#8217;s games each month, walking more than 10.9 billion miles in their games since launch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xZXAcIZOPR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/the-niantic-ec-1/">The Niantic EC-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Niantic EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/the-niantic-ec-1/embed/#?secret=xZXAcIZOPR" data-secret="xZXAcIZOPR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Niantic is building a platform for AR based on a 3D map of the world that we believe will play a critical role in the next transition in computing,” said Matt Mazzeo, a general partner at Coatue. “We are excited to partner with Niantic because we see this infrastructure supporting a metaverse for the real world and helping to power the next evolution of the internet.”</p>
<p>The VR metaverse might be &#8220;dystopian&#8221; in Hanke&#8217;s eyes, but like any technology, AR isn&#8217;t without its problems. Niantic&#8217;s newest game, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/pikmin-bloom-an-ar-mobile-game-is-niantics-next-collaboration-with-nintendo/">Pikmin Bloom</a>, is designed around walking, which can be alienating to elderly or disabled players. Pokémon GO has a community of disabled players, but they&#8217;ve had to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/pokemon-go-influencers-threaten-a-boycott-after-niantic-removes-covid-safety-measures/">speak out</a> about how certain small in-game tweaks can make the game much more accessible for people with limited mobility.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, Niantic&#8217;s vision offers an alternative to Meta&#8217;s headset-dependent plans. Pokémon GO remains a smash success &#8212; it earned over <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-one-billion-revenue-2020">$1 billion</a> in 2020 and is already on track to outpace that revenue this year, according to app analytics firm Sensor Tower. Not all of its games are as beloved &#8212; the company recently announced it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/harry-potter-wizards-unite-shut-down-niantic/">shut down</a> Harry Potter: Wizards Unite after in-app consumer spending and global installs dropped 57% year over year. But as independent developers get their hands on Niantic&#8217;s Lightship ARDK, we&#8217;ll see how far the concept of a &#8220;real-world metaverse&#8221; can stretch.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yelizavetta/">Liz Kofman-Burns, Ph.D</a>., is a recovering academic and co-CEO of <a href="http://www.peoplism.com/">Peoplism</a>, a DEIB consulting firm that has helped startups like Betterment, ClassPass and Grammarly achieve measurable results. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">As a startup founder, you&#8217;re likely laser-focused on growth. We get it: You can’t do anything at all if the lights aren’t on. But if you want to survive and thrive as a company, investing early in diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB) is critical.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/09/who-is-driving-the-great-resignation">Great Resignation era</a>, talent is in high demand, willing to leave and often motivated by factors other than pay.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we’ve seen startups make the four mistakes below over and over, and it costs them in time, money and talent. You can’t afford that. Take the time to understand why these DEIB mistakes have long-term costs and use our tips to course correct them now.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237671" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Mistake 1: Your hiring strategy is based on referrals</h2>
<p>You managed to bring together a group of talented, motivated people. You’re doing well and they’re all excited to tell their friends and former colleagues about new job openings. Thanks to their enthusiasm, you’re filling jobs quickly, without even needing to post them or spend money recruiting. Win, right?! <em>Wrong. </em></p>
<p>First, people’s networks are very homogeneous (three-quarters of white Americans, for example, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/25/three-quarters-of-whites-dont-have-any-non-white-friends/">don’t have a single Black friend</a>). Despite a lot of anecdotal beliefs about the quality of referral hires, research actually shows that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002764213503330">referrals don’t perform better</a>. You’re not getting the best person for the job — you’re getting the easiest person to find.</p>
<p>You’re also setting up extremely bad company habits. Good hiring is a habit that involves consistently articulating what is important for each role, evaluating those criteria and making sound hiring decisions. Referral hiring kicks the can of good habits far down the road, where it is much more costly to fix.</p>
<p>If you want to be a company with a future, you will need a real hiring strategy. Get started <em>now.</em> Building out an effective hiring strategy will align your team on what matters most to your organization, ensure you are hiring the best and help you avoid the lack of diversity nearly all large tech companies face today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Start with ensuring that referrals go through the same hiring process as all other candidates. Next, focus on your job descriptions. Make sure they clearly articulate four to five of the main skills required for the job, not a laundry list. Finally, ensure interviewers actually evaluate those skills in a meaningful way. These steps are the foundation of structured hiring, which <a href="https://home.ubalt.edu/tmitch/645/session%204/Schmidt%20&amp;%20Oh%20validity%20and%20util%20100%20yrs%20of%20research%20Wk%20PPR%202016.pdf">100 years of research</a> shows is the most effective way to hire.</p>
<h2>Mistake 2: You don’t have job levels</h2>
<p>Startups move fast and startup employees are known for being able to “wear many hats.” Surely, in such a fast-paced and uncertain environment, writing out job levels doesn’t make sense, right? <em>Wrong. </em></p>
<p>Without a basic job-level system in place, hiring, compensation and promotion decisions are made based on completely subjective criteria. Eventually, those people you’ve hired, paid and promoted are going to start talking to each other and asking how those decisions were made.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a coherent answer that you are comfortable sharing with them and your entire team, you’re in trouble. People are willing to accept difficult realities, like if current business needs don’t support having two senior engineers. They are much less forgiving of poor communication and unfairness.</p>
<p>Instead, use <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/sections/formalizing-levels">Radford</a> or similar leveling rubrics as a guide to sketch out job levels for each of the departments at your company (even if it’s a department of one). This will help you write great job descriptions because it forces you to clarify the key components of each role. Then, you will know what to evaluate folks on when it’s time to make decisions about rewards, like raises and promotions.</p>
<p>Don’t worry: This system is flexible, and you can make changes as you grow. The important thing is that it puts your company in the habit of making people decisions based on <em>predetermined</em> criteria rather than on a bias-prone case-by-case basis.</p>
<h2>Mistake 3: Your policies focus on the employees you have, not the ones you want</h2>
<p>Your current team is mostly 20-somethings with big dreams, similar hobbies and few responsibilities outside of work. Maybe no one has a partner, let alone a baby. So it doesn’t make sense to write out parental leave and flexible work policies, right? <em>Wrong. </em></p>
<p>Your benefits partly serve as a recruiting ad for your company. Your current team may be delighted by free snacks and a gym stipend. But ambitious employees who want a family (<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/164618/desire-children-norm.aspx">90% of Americans do</a>) and the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/famee.pdf">31% of the workforce with children</a> have scanned your benefits and decided to pass. Lack of a thoughtful parental leave policy is a sign that you haven’t thought about how to support employees with different life situations and needs.</p>
<p>An equitable parental leave policy tells all potential candidates that you think about your employees as whole people and are committed to supporting them over the long haul. PL+US offers a <a href="https://paidleave.us/workshop/">step-by-step guide</a> to creating a gender-neutral, equitable policy. Parental leave is just one example, though. Think about all the talent pools you could tap that may be underrepresented in your company. What kind of policies and benefits could you offer to support (and attract) those folks?</p>
<h2>Mistake 4: You don’t take onboarding seriously</h2>
<p>You’re moving fast, so your new hire onboarding consists of a rushed email and a smattering of links and documents to get your new employee “up to speed.” That’s OK because those smart self-starters you just hired will figure it out on their own, right? <em>Maybe, but it may cost you. </em></p>
<p>A rushed, cursory onboarding experience sets up your shiny new employees for failure and disengagement. When new hires are thrown into the deep end without a clear understanding of what is expected of them, they spend precious energy second-guessing themselves. (In fact, <a href="https://qz.com/606727/is-imposter-syndrome-a-sign-of-greatness/">high-achieving</a> individuals are especially likely to suffer from “imposter syndrome.”) And your employees aren’t robots — they have a fundamental <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/belonging-at-work/">human need</a> to connect with others and fit in. Yet, 40% of employees feel <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/02/the-surprising-power-of-simply-asking-coworkers-how-theyre-doing">isolated</a> at work.</p>
<p>So invest in creating a thoughtful onboarding process. There are many great onboarding templates and checklists to get you started, like <a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/how-to-create-an-onboarding-process">this one</a>. Next, focus on communicating clear expectations by writing out the unwritten rules in a company handbook and laying out a clear first project.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t forget the personal connections. One belonging intervention that we use at Peoplism is to have all current employees <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J4Il3FtWAIvc8_bsn5anjabMZmtr-LGKbn2O6WJnEao/edit#heading=h.yslhejkf92yd">share a mistake they’ve made</a>. This not only helps people get to know their new colleagues on a deeper level, but research also shows simply learning that others have had to overcome their insecurities<a href="https://sparq.stanford.edu/solutions/when-students-feel-they-belong-they-thrive?utm_source=Peoplism&amp;utm_campaign=eac2affd17-NEWSLETTER_CAMPAIGN_1_14_2019_10_3_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_cc89718d22-eac2affd17-"> increases people’s sense of belonging and performance</a>.</p>
<p>If you survive as a company, you will eventually need to have a robust hiring strategy, a job-level system, thoughtful policies and a thorough onboarding process. The question is this: Will you leave a sea of disgruntled employees rage-reviewing you on Glassdoor before you get to fixing these four common DEIB mistakes?</p>
<p>Don’t wait! Invest in your people practices and your DEIB strategy as early as possible. These four common mistakes are not just bad for underrepresented employees — they’re bad for all of your current and future employees, which means they’re bad for your startup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix is acquiring Munich-based <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/bringing-more-vfx-magic-to-our-members-with-scanline-vfx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visual effects studio Scanline VFX</a> for an undisclosed amount. The company expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Scanline has done work on several Netflix originals, including &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; and &#8220;Cowboy Bebop.&#8221; The studio has also provided special effects for many Marvel and DC titles.</p>
<p>Founded in 1989, Scanline has offices in Vancouver, Montreal, Los Angeles, London, Munich, Stuttgart and Seoul. For Netflix, Scanline has worked on &#8220;Stranger Things 4,&#8221; &#8220;Blood Red Sky,&#8221; &#8220;Slumberland,&#8221; &#8220;The Gray Man,&#8221; &#8220;The Adam Project&#8221; and &#8221; Don&#8217;t Look Up.&#8221; Outside of Netflix, the studio has provided special effects for &#8220;Game of Thrones,&#8221; &#8220;Black Widow,&#8221; &#8220;Black Panther,&#8221; &#8220;Captain Marvel,&#8221; &#8220;Iron Man 3,&#8221; &#8220;Captain America: The Winter Soldier,&#8221; &#8220;Zack Snyder&#8217;s Justice League,&#8221; &#8220;Joker&#8221; and more.</p>
<p>In terms of upcoming projects, Scanline is working on &#8220;The Batman,&#8221; &#8220;The Flash,&#8221; &#8220;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,&#8221; &#8220;Black Adam&#8221; and &#8220;Moonfall.&#8221; Netflix says that going forward, Scanline will continue to operate as a standalone business and work with its current clients.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238227" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Netflix&#8217;s vice president of studio operations, Amy Reinhard, says Scanline is known for its complex, photorealistic effects and expertise in virtual production. In a <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/bringing-more-vfx-magic-to-our-members-with-scanline-vfx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, Reinhard outlined that Netflix plans to invest in Scanline’s pipeline, infrastructure and workforce and &#8220;continue to support the work that Scanline’s Eyeline Studios is doing in virtual production to push the boundaries of what is visibly possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ll also continue to rely on many other studios around the world for our VFX needs so we can continue to ensure that our creators have access to the world&#8217;s most innovative tech, and continue to bring the most compelling and cutting-edge storytelling to our members,&#8221; Reinhard stated.</p>
<p>Netflix&#8217;s acquisition of Scanline comes amid the streaming giant&#8217;s push toward in-house production. In 2018, Netflix acquired Albuquerque Studios and announced last year that it planned to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/netflix-commits-1-billion-to-make-new-mexico-home-to-one-of-the-worlds-largest-studios/">invest $1 billion</a> in production spending to expand the studio and include an additional 300 acres to make it home to one of the largest studios. The proposed expansion and $150 million in capital expenditures will add 10 new stages, post-production services, mills, backlots and training facilities, wardrobe suites, a commissary and more.</p>
<p>The streaming giant&#8217;s latest acquisition comes as it recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-acquires-its-first-games-studio-oxenfree-developer-night-school/">purchased its first games studio,</a> Night School Studio, in September for an undisclosed amount. The independent game developer is known for its narrative-driven titles like &#8220;Oxenfree&#8221; and was founded in 2014 by Sean Krankel, a former senior game designer at Disney Interactive, and Adam Hines, who was a lead writer at Telltale Games.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of Roku customers are experiencing problems with their Roku TVs following the <a href="https://newsroom.roku.com/news/2021/09/roku-os-10-5-offers-easy-access-to-content-/-qrfhin6-1632009402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roku OS 10.5 update</a>. According to reports published to Roku&#8217;s own <a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Roku-Device-Features-Settings-Updates/OS-10-5-Roku-TV-experiencing-loading-channel-issues/td-p/738115/highlight/true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer forums</a> and other sites, like Reddit, impacted Roku TV owners say many of their streaming apps &#8212; like HBO Max, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+ and others, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/qyxplo/i_feel_roku_owes_me_money_since_im_now_paying_for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no longer work</a> while others have more intermittent issues, like Netflix.</p>
<p>Some are also experiencing problems with their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/qz5whm/frozen_screen_and_broken_remote_with_new_update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screens being frozen</a> and their Roku remote no longer functioning, they said, but it&#8217;s unclear for now if these are a related or separate issue.</p>
<p>Roku says it&#8217;s aware of the problem and working to resolve it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238123" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While the 10.5 update began rolling out in October, Roku tends to update its streaming players first followed by its Roku TV devices. That means many of the impacted customers only recently received the update, as they own a Roku TV, leading to the flood of consumer complaints when the update resulted in favorite streaming apps not working. In addition, the issues impact Roku Ultra devices, as well.</p>
<p>Though the issue began to blow up on the Roku forums last week, some users said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/qygyez/customer_support_offers_absolutely_no_support_105/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they&#8217;ve been dealing with</a> a non-functional TV for multiple weeks, leading them to purchase a Chromecast or Fire TV stick instead.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Roku-Device-Features-Settings-Updates/OS-10-5-Roku-TV-experiencing-loading-channel-issues/td-p/738115/highlight/true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an 18-page thread</a> on Roku&#8217;s community forums, users reported issues with Westinghouse, TCL, Sharp and Hisense TVs, among other devices. There are <a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Roku-Device-Features-Settings-Updates/bd-p/device-settings-config" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many other threads as well</a>, with dozens of responses. Customers with both hardwired and wireless network connections are impacted, according to consumer complaints. A few users said rebooting their TV <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/qwbwwy/tcl_roku_tv_has_strong_wifi_connection_but_all/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or router</a> worked, but others said they tried that, as well as a factory reset, without any resolution.</p>
<p>Roku has been aware of the problem for some time, as a Roku forum <a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/forums/recentpostspage/post-type/message/user-id/108737" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderator has been writing back</a> to forum posters since at least last week, asking for information about their devices like the serial number, Roku device model, device ID and software OS version.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With no official fix yet available, Roku has been forced to roll back the update for some of its users by downgrading their devices to software version 10.0.0. But this option hasn&#8217;t been automatically deployed to all customers. Instead, forum members said a Roku representative had privately <a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Roku-Device-Features-Settings-Updates/OS-10-5-Roku-TV-experiencing-loading-channel-issues/td-p/738115/page/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messaged</a> them with instructions after they shared their device information.</p>
<p>And, as of last week, users were <a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Roku-Device-Features-Settings-Updates/OS-10-5-Roku-TV-experiencing-loading-channel-issues/m-p/740171/highlight/true#M25239" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being asked to private message</a> a Roku employee with their device information to receive the downgrade, indicating the fix is being handled on a one-off basis for the time being. This process is frustrating some Roku customers who think a broader rollback should be underway at this point.</p>
<p>The issues arrive at a time when many U.S. consumers will be taking time off from work over the Thanksgiving holidays &#8212; meaning they have a lot more time for watching TV. Tuning into NFL football, for example, is part of the Thanksgiving tradition, but livestreaming apps like Sling TV and Hulu are among those impacted by the software issues.</p>
<p>A representative for Roku was reached for comment this afternoon but didn&#8217;t yet have a statement available.</p>
<p>Later in the day, Roku shared the following comment with TechCrunch:</p>
<p><i><span data-removefontsize="true" data-originalcomputedfontsize="16">A small portion of users that have certain older Roku TV models or older Roku Ultra players are experiencing issues with the latest firmware update, OS 10.5.

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">As a revenue leader at large and small technology companies, I’ve spent the last 15 years attending a lot of quarterly board meetings.</p>
<p>These meetings take countless hours to prepare for and can create a lot of stress. The prep and the practice can be draining, and, more importantly, distracting from your daily grind.</p>
<p>This is all necessary because the board meeting is such a high-stakes event. As a wise mentor once told me, no one ever gets a promotion from a board meeting, but people sure do get fired afterward.</p>
<p>So if you’re responsible for driving revenue growth at your company, how do you make your portion of these meetings as engaging and impactful as possible? I’ve got some hard-earned advice on that front, as well as suggestions for five must-have board slides — customized for leaders at B2B, software-as-a-service companies — that will help you give a great presentation and preserve your sanity.</p>
<h2>Size matters — and so does consistency</h2>
<p>I’ve been part of company board meetings where the deck was 30 slides, and I’ve also been in meetings where decks would be more than 150 slides. You’ll need to gauge what level of detail is right for your organization, but my general rule is to cut your slides until it hurts the narrative of the deck.</p>
<p>You should also strive for consistency. You’ll want to deliver the same sets of metrics and details in each quarterly meeting so that directors and executives can make apples-to-apples comparisons of key data.</p>
<p>One caveat: The world is evolving and the idea of &#8220;cohort data&#8221; is thriving. As businesses evolve and new models like consumption- or payment-based pricing become more common, you may need to adjust certain metrics over time, particularly if you are a B2B SaaS company.</p>
<h2>Deliver the goods</h2>
<p>From the delivery point of view, I’ll share a couple of ideas.</p>
<p>The first is fairly well known: Don’t present slides; present the story. Board members are skilled at thin slicing through data and composing their questions ahead of time. Don’t feel the need to present every nuance around your data — get to the point.</p>
<p>The other piece of advice here is to look ahead. First-time attendees at board meetings often lean toward giving a look at the past, which is probably not where you should be focusing most of your energy. Read through your presentation and see how much focuses on the future versus the past.</p>
<p>The majority of your deck should paint a picture of what you’re going to do, not what’s happened. The board has received a board flash from the CEO right after the quarter closed and has now read the deck. What you’re here to do is share the adjustments you’re making to lead the business forward.</p>
<p>Finally: Create an appendix. This allows your content — new initiatives, changes to go-to-market strategies and product topics — to stay front-and-center and not get bogged down by too much data. But having an appendix still allows the board to view more detailed, quarter-over-quarter changes.</p>
<h2>Focus on these five, must-have slides</h2>
<p>I traditionally build my &#8220;talk time&#8221; around five revenue-focused slides during a board presentation. Some versions of these slides have been in my board decks for the past decade. These are data-rich slides, so again, prepare to discuss the story they’re telling and not the data.</p>
<p>For example, your board members will notice if your sales velocity is speeding up and your average selling price is trending down. They can see that in your numbers, so you need to explain why that is happening.</p>
<h2>Slide #1: Headline reel</h2>
<p>After the cover page and agenda, I think every deck should start with the headline reel: the key results of what you achieved last quarter. Regardless of whether your quarter was good or bad, don’t make the board search through the deck to find the details.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When LTK launched in 2011, phrases like &#8220;influencer marketing&#8221; or &#8220;the creator economy&#8221; weren&#8217;t common, but fashion blogger Amber Venz Box faced the same struggles that internet personalities face today. How do you convert unpaid hours writing posts, shooting photos, editing videos and building a following into a viable career?</p>
<p>Amber Venz Box started LTK when she wanted a way to earn a commission from readers who bought the products she recommended, but now a decade later, the blogger-turned-founder has a $2 billion company on her hands. Previously branded as RewardStyle and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/06/liketoknow-it-app-launch-screenshots/">LIKEtoKNOW.it</a>, LTK helps social media influencers make their posts shoppable and houses them on a central marketplace, both on the web and on its app. Brands can also use the platform to connect with creator partners for upcoming marketing campaigns. The company reached this valuation after raising $300 million from SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund.</p>
<p>LTK caters to creators, brands and shoppers, who spend more than $3 billion on the platform each year, according to the company. The interface is reminiscent of Instagram Shop &#8212; you scroll through posts by creators who have curated their favorite products to share, only LTK predates Instagram&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/facebook-whatsapp-e-commerce-features/">pivot to e-commerce</a>. The company has been <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211122006289/en/LTK-the-Creator-Commerce%E2%84%A2-Platform-Raises-at-a-2-Billion-Valuation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">profitable for many years</a>, and with its new round of funding, plans to hire across the organization to grow the Texas-based company internationally. Currently, LTK has an international staff of 350, working with 5,000 retailers and more than 1 million brands.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238083" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We believe LTK is helping to reimagine the concept of entrepreneurship by enabling people to make a living out of their hobbies and passions,” said Angela Du, Investment Director at SoftBank Investment Advisers, who will join the company’s board of directors when the transaction closes. “LTK&#8217;s innovative marketing platform empowers these creators to build their personal brands across the social universe and forge long-term, authentic relationships with their followers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The success and growth of LTK reiterates consumers&#8217; increasing interest in shopping through recommendations from the people they follow. Venz Box <a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandrasternlicht/2021/11/22/ltk-cofounder-amber-venz-box-now-one-of-americas-richest-self-made-women-after-softbank-fundraising/?sh=13de51de1939" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Forbes</a> that more than 130 influencers have become self-made millionaires through LTK. These creators, mostly women, earn between 10% and 25% of sales &#8212; the brands and retailers on the platform set their own commission rate. Brands get the sale that the creator drives, and the creator earns a commission on top of that &#8212; LTK earns a transaction fee from these sales.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most people in Africa wish to utilize various insurance products but are often deterred by the associated high premiums. It is, therefore, not surprising that insurance penetration across the continent remains marginal, with reported premiums per capita being 11 times lower than the world average, according to a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/middle-east-and-africa/africas-insurance-market-is-set-for-takeoff">McKinsey study</a>.</p>
<p>But the market might soon change as innovative products that run on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/insuretech-on-the-heels-of-a-fintech-boom-heats-up-in-africa/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">micropayment or pay-per-use frameworks emerge</a> under the support of institutions like the U.K.-funded Financial Sector Deepening (FSD) Africa.</p>
<p>FSD Africa is set to launch insurtech accelerator programs in Ghana and Nigeria next year to promote innovations that will drive the uptake of insurance in the two markets and beyond.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238088" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The planned launch of insurtech accelerator programs in the West African countries follows the introduction of the same in Kenya earlier this year, in partnership with Insurance Regulatory Authority, the country’s regulator, and cloud solution provider Tellistic Technology Services.</p>
<p>“At FSD Africa, we are committed to the growth of the insurance sector and are excited to be involved in grooming the next generation of insurance innovators. … The insurance industry has been slow to innovate compared to the rest of the financial sector, yet Africa is experiencing a huge protection gap,” FSD Africa&#8217;s director of risk, Kelvin Massingham, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We are planning to launch the BimaLab Insurtech Accelerator Program in Ghana and Nigeria.&#8221;</p>
<p>FSD Africa is also planning to provide access to capital through venture funds and grants to early-stage insurtech startups, in addition to setting up an online platform where founders can brainstorm, share experiences, create partnerships, and gain technical support from different industry professionals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The organization is working with eight insurance regulators including those of Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda and Tanzania to build an environment that bolsters insurtech innovation across the continent.</p>
<p>“It is really a peer learning and engagement platform for regulators primarily around regulating for innovation and things like creating insurtech and startup ecosystems, but also on wider issues like ESG (environmental, social and governance). And we&#8217;re excited to support the development of similar programs like this across the region,” Massingham said.</p>
<p>The new plans follow the graduation of the Kenya program’s second cohort last Friday. Over the 10-week program, participants were provided with knowledge and resources to develop and get their solutions ready for the market. Twelve startups were in the cohort, with Karopay and Motisure landing recognition for their innovations.</p>
<p>Motisure targets motorcycle (boda-boda) taxi commuters and riders with personal accident coverage for as low as 10 Kenyan shillings (about 9 U.S. cents) a day. Boda-bodas are a popular means of transport in East Africa, with 22 million rides served every day in Kenya alone.</p>
<p>Karopay’s edtech insurance product Bimashule ensures that students in rural Kenya have basic medical and personal accident insurance coverage, with premiums starting from less than $1 a month. It also comes with a school fee guarantee in the event of a guardian’s demise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year ago I accidentally turned my house into a smart home. What started out as an easy (and lazy, let&#8217;s be honest) way to switch off the radio in the kitchen without getting up from the couch quickly became an obsession to remotely control and automate as much of my house as possible.</p>
<p>What makes a smart home? In my house the lights, outlets and window blinds can be controlled from my phone, at home or anywhere in the world, but you can extend it to other things, like air conditioners, sprinklers and garage door openers. Or thermostats, speakers, security cameras and just about anything electrical. And by adding smart home tech that can detect temperature, humidity or motion, you can automate your house to turn the light up at sunset, set the sprinklers on when the weather is dry, turn on the air conditioning when it&#8217;s warm or alert you if the doors open when you&#8217;re not at home.</p>
<p>The novelty of switching your living room lights off and off from your phone might quickly wear off, but it can be reassuring knowing that you can get a sense of what&#8217;s going on at home even when you&#8217;re not there — or automatically adjust the climate and lighting when you are.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234206" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You&#8217;re probably thinking, <em>is this guy serious? Why would I want even more of my home connected to the internet? </em>The Internet of Things (IoT) doesn&#8217;t have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/smart-home-hub-flaws-unlock-doors/">the best reputation</a> historically with security, but modern smart home devices can be certified to the far higher standards set by the Big Tech giants like Apple, Amazon and Google. That said, no technology is ever perfectly secure, though efforts to create a common secure smart home standard is paying off with Matter, a protocol endorsed by some of the biggest tech companies and smart home device makers.</p>
<p>It helps to join a smart home ecosystem that you&#8217;re comfortable with. I use a Mac and an iPhone, so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/anybody-can-now-make-homekit-accessories/">Apple&#8217;s HomeKit</a> makes the most sense for me. Apple does not collect a ton of data like other smart home ecosystems and is probably a better fit for the privacy minded. For this guide we&#8217;ll focus on HomeKit but much will broadly apply if you use another ecosystem. For Android users, Google Home would make more sense, or Amazon Alexa if you&#8217;re so inclined. Many modern devices are compatible with other smart home platforms anyway, including newer standards like Thread. But for best results, pick an ecosystem and make sure the add-ons you&#8217;re buying are compatible.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re after convenience or routine — or like in my case you just want to tinker — there&#8217;s a lot you can do with what you already have but a lot more you can do without breaking the bank.</p>

<h2>First, you need (or may already have) a HomeKit hub</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2234227" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234227" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2234227 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homepod.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="729" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homepod.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homepod.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homepod.jpg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homepod.jpg?resize=768,547 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homepod.jpg?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homepod.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234227" class="wp-caption-text">A HomePod mini or Apple TV will work as a hub. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>HomeKit devices rely on a hub to communicate with. It&#8217;s through this hub that your other smart home devices connect to the internet, letting you access your devices from your phone in the outside world. Good news if you have an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/the-new-apple-tv-4k-comes-with-a-new-siri-remote/">Apple TV</a> or a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-will-focus-on-mini/">HomePod</a> (or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/apple-homepod-mini-review-remarkably-big-sound/">HomePod mini</a>) since these will serve as your HomeKit hub out of the box and generally don&#8217;t require any configuration. If you have more than one of these devices in your home, they can all serve as failover hubs if one becomes unavailable.</p>
<p>Some tech, like Philips Hue or Samsung SmartThings, will require their own separate hub (sometimes called a bridge) before they will appear in your smart home. Hubs often connect directly into the router, so keep available ports and wireless range in mind.</p>

<h2>Control your regular devices with smart plugs</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2236125" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236125" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2236125 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wemo-smart-plug.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="687" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wemo-smart-plug.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wemo-smart-plug.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wemo-smart-plug.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wemo-smart-plug.jpg?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wemo-smart-plug.jpg?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wemo-smart-plug.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236125" class="wp-caption-text">Smart plugs can be used to control regular devices with physical power switches. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Smart plugs are a great way of connecting conventional electrical and appliances to your smart home. A smart plug fits between your regular appliance plug and the wall outlet and can be told to switch on and off at your command. It&#8217;s worth noting that smart plugs only work with devices and appliances with a physical power switch that stays in place and won&#8217;t work with devices with an auto-shutoff switch, like a kettle. (You probably shouldn&#8217;t rely on a smart plug for anything mission critical, like medical equipment or big household appliances.)</p>
<p>WeMo Wi-Fi Smart Plugs by Belkin have a small form factor compared to other, bulkier smart plugs and work reliably. There&#8217;s also a physical button on the side, in case you want or need to toggle it by hand. Eve Energy plugs are a little more expensive and also come with power management features in the Eve app.</p>

<h2>Smart bulbs will light your home the way you want it</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2236126" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236126" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2236126 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homekit-smart-bulbs.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="813" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homekit-smart-bulbs.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homekit-smart-bulbs.jpg?resize=150,119 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homekit-smart-bulbs.jpg?resize=300,238 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homekit-smart-bulbs.jpg?resize=768,610 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homekit-smart-bulbs.jpg?resize=680,540 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homekit-smart-bulbs.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236126" class="wp-caption-text">You may be better off finding smart bulbs that fit your existing fixtures, rather than the most recommended brand. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Just like regular bulbs, smart bulbs come in all shapes, sizes and colors so you&#8217;re likely going to need to find a brand that suits your lights and fixtures. You may also need to mix and match brands as you expand your smart home. Most bulbs are dimmable and some offer granular temperature controls to get the warmth of the room right. <a href="https://us-shop.nanoleaf.me/products/nanoleaf-essentials-lightstrips">Nanoleaf</a> also offers bulbs that connect to HomeKit over Wi-Fi. Philips Hue is a popular favorite but requires a separate hub to talk to your <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/02/apple-debuts-a-new-home-app-website-to-show-how-its-devices-work-in-a-smart-home/">Home app</a>. LIFX also has a <a href="https://www.lifx.com">broad range of bulbs</a> and an accompanying app offering a few more features. Furniture giant IKEA has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/23/ikeas-smart-light-bulbs-will-work-with-amazon-alexa-apple-siri-and-google-assistant/">diverse range of smart bulbs</a>. A common criticism of smart bulbs is that they often aren&#8217;t as bright as regular filament or LED bulbs, so keep that in mind if your home is particularly prone to low light.</p>

<h2>Set the mood with smart strip lighting</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2236127" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236127" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2236127 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/home-strip-lighting.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="685" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/home-strip-lighting.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/home-strip-lighting.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/home-strip-lighting.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/home-strip-lighting.jpg?resize=768,514 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/home-strip-lighting.jpg?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/home-strip-lighting.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236127" class="wp-caption-text">Strip lighting can be themed, colorful and animated. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zack Whittaker/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Adding color light strips to your smart home can really brighten up a space. Smart light strips are like regular strip lighting for under cabinets and shelves, but they can be controlled from your phone. These adhesive-backed strips contain dozens or hundreds of LEDs that let you customize their color and brightness, and often also their patterns and animations to bring reactive light to your rooms. You&#8217;ll need to keep in mind that most will require a power source, more often than not a wall outlet if not USB — many modern television sets should have one spare. We like the Nanoleaf Essentials Lightstrip Starter Kit to start with, or LIFX&#8217;s Lightstrip also does a great job; there&#8217;s one in my living room.</p>

<h2>You can retrofit some of your older tech</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2237421" style="width: 849px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237421" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2237421 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SOMA.jpg" alt="" width="839" height="767" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SOMA.jpg 839w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SOMA.jpg?resize=150,137 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SOMA.jpg?resize=300,274 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SOMA.jpg?resize=768,702 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SOMA.jpg?resize=680,622 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SOMA.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237421" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SOMA</p></div></p>
<p>One of the best things about smart homes is how much you can do with your existing fittings. There are a handful of window blinds and shades made by well-known brands like <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/fyrtur-blackout-roller-blind-wireless-battery-operated-gray-30417460/">IKEA</a> (with a separate hub) or baked-in like Lutron&#8217;s <a href="https://www.serenashades.com/applehomekit/">Serena</a> that are natively compatible with HomeKit. Or if you have existing blinds, there are options to let you retrofit your existing window blinds with a HomeKit-enabled controller.</p>
<p>My house has vertical blinds with a tilt handle you have to rotate to close the blinds and so we rely on <a href="https://www.somasmarthome.com/">Soma</a>, an Estonia-based smart home device maker, which makes a number of blind controllers that fit into existing chains or tilt mechanisms. You hook them up to your blinds, remove the peel from the adhesive on the device, stick the box to the wall and you&#8217;re done — no skills required. These controllers run on battery or can be powered through the stick-on solar panel or plugged into an outlet. These controllers connect to HomeKit through a separate Raspberry Pi-like hub, the <a href="https://www.somasmarthome.com/products/soma-connect-blinds-control-for-amazon-alexa-apple-homekit-google-home">Soma Connect</a>. While my experience with Soma has been flawless, others at TechCrunch report having troubles with it — consider our reviews here &#8220;mixed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blinds are just one area that can be retrofitted to work with HomeKit. Other tech exists to connect garage doors, ceiling fans and even <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-thermo">radiators</a> to your smart home, too.</p>
<h2>Get automating your home with sensors</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2234247" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234247" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2234247 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/eve-door.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/eve-door.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/eve-door.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/eve-door.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/eve-door.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/eve-door.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/eve-door.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234247" class="wp-caption-text">Sensors allow you to set up more automations for your smart home. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Eve Home</p></div></p>
<p>Now you have your lights and blinds hooked up to your Home app, you can start to add sensors to the mix. Sensors can let you automate your home by detecting light, movement, temperature, or if a window or door opens, and then turning on fans when it gets warm or setting the lights only when someone is home at sunset before it gets dark. Some might want to use these for security. They can be useful for power saving by shutting off lights when no motion is detected and adjusting the temperature when the weather changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ONVIS-Hygrometer-Thermometer-Temperature-Bluetooth/dp/B07KY6747N">Onvis Motion</a> is a great, cheap, entry-level motion detector that also packs in a thermostat and hygrometer, so you can instantly get the temperature and humidity of the room that it&#8217;s in. Weather stations are more expensive but pack in a lot more features. <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-door-window">Eve Door &amp; Window</a> are small stick-on battery-powered sensors that can trigger an alert or any other connected HomeKit device when a door or window is opened. And, if you&#8217;re after a privacy-friendly camera, Logitech&#8217;s Circle View <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/cameras/circle-view-security-camera.961-000489.html">works exclusively</a> on HomeKit&#8217;s end-to-end encrypted video and doesn&#8217;t rely on a third-party cloud, if that&#8217;s a deal breaker for the privacy-minded.</p>

<p>One of the benefits to picking one ecosystem and sticking with it: For the most part, the most important features of each device will be aggregated into one app. With HomeKit, that&#8217;s the Home app.</p>
<p>Your Home app consolidates your HomeKit-enabled smart home tech in one place and lets you connect your sensors to automate the rest of your home. With window sensors you can turn on all of your lights as soon as you open the door, and you can set your strip lighting to light up a hallway when a sensor detects motion between sunset and sunrise.</p>
<p>The Home app also packs in some automation features, like switching on fans or opening blinds at certain times of the day when you know it&#8217;s going to be bright outside or at a time you know you&#8217;ll want privacy. Most devices also come with a corresponding app, often with a lot more settings, features and the ability to update the device&#8217;s firmware.</p>
<p>And that is your starter HomeKit smart home!</p>
<h2>Some things to think about:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wi-Fi network range is critical to a functioning smart home. HomeKit works on the 2.4 GHz wireless connection because it has a longer range than 5 GHz. There&#8217;s a good chance your router allows you to use both, but make sure you&#8217;re on the right network when setting up your HomeKit devices. Network coverage might be fine in a one-bedroom apartment, but larger homes may require Wi-Fi range extenders or a mesh network.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you have a router that&#8217;s set up for self-organizing networking, which lets you move seamlessly between the different Wi-Fi bands, you might want to switch that setting off since it can interfere with your smart home. Some routers may have a dedicated Wi-Fi network for IoT devices built in.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes things will break and it&#8217;s not always clear why. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a moment of poor connectivity, sometimes in the more frustrating cases you might need to reset your devices. Each device comes with its own scannable QR code for getting set up. Keep these codes safe since you&#8217;ll need them if you ever have to reset a device and especially helpful when you can&#8217;t easily access or scan your HomeKit devices.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You can customize your Home screen and room backgrounds. <a href="https://homepaper.app/">HomePaper</a> is a simple app that does exactly that, and it&#8217;s designed to gradually fade the background so it&#8217;s not intrusive or make the device panels difficult to read. Home wallpapers don&#8217;t sync across your Apple devices, so you have to manually add wallpapers to each Home app.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://voyagerspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voyager Space Holdings</a> is continuing its trend of snapping up space companies by moving to acquire a majority stake in <a href="https://www.spacemicro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Space Micro</a>, a manufacturer of orbital communications and digital subsystems for satellites.</p>
<p>This is Voyager’s sixth acquisition since its founding in October 2019, as the company seeks to become a full-service space firm offering everything from robotics to launch support to communications tech.</p>
<p>Previous acquisitions include X.O. Markets, the parent of commercial space service venture <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/voyager-space-holdings-sets-it-sights-on-space-stations-with-majority-stake-in-nanoracks/">Nanoracks</a>; Pioneer Astronautics, a company that conducts research into supporting human life in outer space; robotics startup Altius Space Machines; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/voyager-space-holdings-to-acquire-multi-launch-site-startup-the-launch-company/">The Launch Company</a>, a launch support company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238132" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The acquisition strategy has turned Voyager Space into something of a powerhouse; despite being scarcely two years old, the company has already set its sights on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/voyager-nanoracks-and-lockheeds-starlab-is-the-latest-sign-that-the-low-earth-orbit-economy-is-coming/">launching a commercial space station in 2027</a>. The plans, which were announced as part of a joint project with Nanoracks and Lockheed Martin, position Voyager to oversee financing and capital allocation for the project.</p>
<p>Whether Space Micro’s tech will be used on that station isn’t clear, but the investment will no doubt provide support for the subsystems manufacturer to scale operations and its product output.</p>
<p>“Today marks a huge step in our growth trajectory,” Space Micro co-founder and chair David Strobel said in a statement. “The satellite constellation market stands at the tipping point of explosive expansion and now, with the Voyager team and operational functions by our side, we will be prepared to scale our technologies to meet these market needs.”</p>
<p>Space Micro has built out a large portfolio of customers since its founding in 2002, including NASA, the U.S. Space Force, the U.S. Air Force and the German Space Agency. The company currently has more than 100 subsystems in orbit and has collectively racked up 2.7 million hours of spaceflight time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has provided tech for NASA’s Lunar Atmosphere Dust and Environment Explorer mission and its Transiting Explanet Survey Satellite. Space Micro also works with commercial companies, and was selected by Masten Space Systems earlier this year to provide transponders for the company’s XL-1 lunar lander.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than three months after announcing a $16 million seed round led by Founders Fund and Paradigm, NFT music rights startup <a href="https://royal.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Royal</a> has raised another major round of funding, banking a $55 million Series A from Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s crypto investment arm.</p>
<p>The startup partners with musicians and allows users to buy NFTs which represent collective ownership in works from those artists. The effort is helmed by Justin Blau, an EDM artist who performs under the name 3LAU, and JD Ross, a co-founder of home-buying startup Opendoor. Royal represents a very early, but promising foray into NFT functionality outside the spheres of visual art and gaming.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Founders Fund backs Royal, a music marketplace planning to sell song rights as NFTs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/founders-fund-backs-royal-a-music-marketplace-planning-to-sell-song-rights-as-nfts/embed/#?secret=x5cmzfHtkC" data-secret="x5cmzfHtkC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Last month, Blau gave away hundreds of NFTs through the platform, which held 50% of the streaming rights to his latest song. The startup says there have already been nearly $600,000 worth of secondary sales for those tokens, giving the new single an implied $6 million valuation. Crypto-friendly musicians like Blau have already banked millions from crypto holders looking to diversify their holding through NFTs while also backing projects that expand the market opportunity of the blockchain.</p>
<p>Boundary-pushing projects like Royal still have a delicate line to walk when it comes to advertising opportunities to grow alongside artists while staying compliant with securities laws.</p>
<p>This investment is notably being helmed by a16z Crypto co-lead Katie Haun who sits on the boards of Coinbase and NFT marketplace OpenSea. The firm already has a deep relationship with Royal&#8217;s executive team, having previously backed Ross&#8217;s last company Opendoor. Naithan Jones, a former Andreessen Horowitz partner who led the team&#8217;s Talent X Opportunity Fund, also joined Royal in September as the firm&#8217;s head of Growth.</p>
<p>Joining the round alongside a16z Crypto are a number of musical artists, including The Chainsmokers, Nas, Logic and Kygo. CAA and NEA’s Connect Ventures, Crush Music, Coinbase Ventures, Founders Fund and Paradigm also participated in the round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
