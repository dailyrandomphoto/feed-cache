										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The venture world is &#8212; quite literally &#8212; waking up to the potential of applying artificial intelligence to a wider variety of real-world, consumer-driven problems, and today comes the latest development on that front: <a href="https://eightsleep.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eight Sleep</a>, which makes &#8220;smart&#8221; mattresses and mattress covers for regular mattresses that use machine learning and other artificial intelligence-based algorithms to improve your sleep both by changing temperature and monitoring other physical parameters to provide an overall picture of your health, has raised $86 million in a Series C round of funding.</p>
<p>Valor Equity Partners &#8212; the firm that has backed the likes of Tesla, SpaceX, GoPuff and many other big tech firms &#8212; is leading this latest investment, with SoftBank, Khosla Ventures, Founders Fund, and General Catalyst also participating, along with a lot of high-profile individuals who are also users for the product, athletes Alex Rodriguez, Kris Bryant and J.D. Martinez; celebs Kevin Hart; and tech figures Sophia Amorouso, Naval Ravikant and Kyle Vogt.</p>
<p>This Series C brings the total raised by Eight Sleep to $150 million, and the startup has confirmed to me that its valuation is now close to $500 million.</p>
<p>Matteo Franceschetti, Eight Sleep&#8217;s CEO, said in an interview that the funding will be used in a few ways.</p>
<p>First, the plan is to double down on building out more technology. Today, Eight&#8217;s Pod technology can detect your temperature, heartbeat and breathing and heat or cool a bed accordingly. Tomorrow, that could also include more physical products, additional ambient factors like lighting, and other diagnostics related to you, the sleeper.</p>
<p>Second, Eight Sleep wants to expand internationally, with plans to sell New York-based Eight Sleep products across Europe and the UK by the end of this year. After all, it&#8217;s not just people in the U.S. who could use a better night of sleep.</p>
<p>Franceschetti &#8212; who co-founded the company with Massimo Andreasi Bassi, Andrea Ballarini, and Alexandra Zatarain &#8212; told TechCrunch that he came to think about sleep and the need to improve it by way of having been an avid and active sports enthusiast.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I was into the idea of sleep as recovery,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is how we came up with the idea of sleep fitness.&#8221; Sleep he said, &#8220;is not just a waste of time.&#8221; Extrapolating that, it&#8217;s not just important for athletes, but everyone, to have better quality sleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vision for us is to compress your sleep and save your life,&#8221; he said. A good six hours, he added, &#8220;are better than eight hours that are not.&#8221; The company&#8217;s original name, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/02/eight-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eight</a>, was in reference to those fabled eight hours. Eight Sleep claims that when people use its products, they fall asleep 40% faster, get up to 20% more deep sleep, experience 30% fewer mid-night wake ups, and up to 30% fewer tosses and turns.</p>
<p>(But can it get me to stop worrying about Covid, the economy and societal collapse, whether my kids will be happy in life, and if we remembered to lock the door downstairs? Or maybe all of those just seem less serious when you are actually comfortable in bed&#8230;)</p>
<p>While Eight has definitely had a lot of traction with athletes &#8212; some 100 big names use it today &#8212; it&#8217;s hoping that the big boom in quantified self technology &#8212; hardware and software built to measure our blood pressure, heart rate, how much we sleep, how much we walk or do other activities, and much more &#8212; will mean that it can ultimately have a mass market appeal.</p>
<p>Indeed, we are living in a world with wearable tech that tracks our every movement is nothing new. And, as computing and communications technologies have become smaller and more portable, and infinitely more powerful, and cloud technology and advances in big data analytics has made the gathering of data and the ability to parse it more sophsiticated, we have only seen the possibilities for how that can be used to measure (and potentially &#8220;improve&#8221;) our lives increase.</p>
<p>Within that, sleep has been a large category of opportunity both for startups and tech companies. Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/fitness-ring-maker-oura-raises-100m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oura raised $100 million</a> for its fitness and sleep tracking rings; others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/zeits-early-warning-wearable-for-sleep-strokes-could-save-hours-and-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zeit</a> have been exploring how to use wearable technology to address more acute sleep-related issues like sleep strokes.</p>
<p>Larger tech companies are not asleep at the wheel, either. Google recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/google-nest-hub-2-review-the-solid-smart-screen-adds-sleep-tracking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated its Nest Hub</a> to track sleep; and even Apple has acquired a sleep tech company, Beddit (that deal was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/09/apple-acquires-sleep-tracking-company-beddit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2017</a>, however, and it has been years since that hardware was updated: that could be one sign that Apple was more interested in using some of the technology in some of its other health-related efforts).</p>
<p>All this points to many more developments in a sleep tech market estimated to be worth some $30 billion. Within that Eight Sleep has been on a roll, with revenues for 2021 currently on track to triple versus 2020 on the back of two main products, a mattress that retails for $2,500 and a smart cover that sells for $1,500. (The company does not disclose user numbers but Franceschetti said that the figures are in the &#8220;several thousands,&#8221;)</p>
<p>2021 revenue is on track to more than triple vs. 2020. The funds will be used to accelerate the company’s innovation and technology roadmap and grow the size of the team.</p>
<p>“The sleep tech market is only in its infancy. The opportunity is limitless, as we spend up to a third of our lives asleep. Consumers are increasingly focused on sleep fitness as the understanding of how deeply important sleep is to overall health becomes more widely known,” said Antonio Gracias of Valor Equity in a statement.</p>
<p>Gracias founded Valor and is joining the board with this round, and as with other investors, he seems to have been won over in part by becoming a user: “The first night I slept on the Pod I knew we had to get involved,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We’ve seen this in our portfolio many times &#8211; Eight Sleep’s products and technology are disrupting the sleep market, and its rapid innovation is outpacing the competition as it builds a new sleep fitness focused category that delivers results.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ryan Reynolds is America&#8217;s sweetheart, despite being both Canadian and somewhat irreverent. The actor, producer, screenwriter and entrepreneur has been nominated for a Golden Globe and Grammy for his work on the Deadpool franchise.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t just his acting that made Deadpool a record-breaking, billion-dollar franchise. Reynolds is one of the world&#8217;s greatest when it comes to fast-vertising, which he&#8217;s leveraged into his production company and marketing firm Maximum Effort, which ran some of the cheapest, and most impactful marketing for Deadpool from the start.</p>
<p>Maximum Effort is also responsible for some of the best ads of the past few years. It would be hard to forget his campaigns for Aviation Gin (remember how quickly he turned a terrible Peloton ad into an <a href="https://twitter.com/VancityReynolds/status/1203118775815622664">hilarious Aviation Gin ad</a>) or the devilishly funny Match.com spot.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qmb5ENInqVk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>His creative chops are impressive, but come with some clever entrepreneurial grit. Reynolds is an owner of Aviation Gin, which sold for more than $600 million in 2020, and an owner of Mint Mobile, a fast-growing MVNO. Reynolds has brought his marketing expertise to Mint Mobile, too, without becoming the joke.</p>

<p>Obviously, we&#8217;re thrilled to have him join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true&amp;promo=rrpost">Disrupt (Sept 21-23)</a> for a fireside chat to talk about how he leverages both his creativity and his platform in the world of entrepreneurialism, and pick his brain on how startups can use fast-vertising to have a maximum impact on a minimum budget.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll also get a feel for his investment appetite in the world of startups.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">With the arrival of U.S. Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, breaking up Big Tech has reemerged as a major policy discussion in Washington. The issue seems to be bipartisan, with Republicans and Democrats alike in favor of stemming monopolistic behavior in the tech industry. Of course, the situation on the ground is more nuanced.</p>
<p>One month after the House Judiciary Committee voted to advance five bipartisan bills that would force Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Google to split up or walk away from core businesses, Republican committee members introduced new legislation to give Americans legal recourse against online censorship by Big Tech companies. The more conservative-driven policy measures also propose greater transparency into content moderation practices by Big Tech.</p>
<p>This sparring between lawmakers on how to regulate Big Tech is not expected to end anytime soon. But as the U.S. ushers in a new era of digital transformation accelerated by the pandemic, Congress stands firmly united in the belief that Big Tech’s power must be checked to preserve the free market.</p>
<p>As it stands now, small competitors and consumers alike have little choice but to be tethered to Big Tech to participate in today’s modern economic engine. And coming out of the pandemic, the five biggest tech giants <a href="https://www.axios.com/earnings-largest-companies-tech-giants-77de0e35-e3b3-42d6-9dd4-b56bb4064ea1.html">are growing</a> at breathtaking speed unseen before in the history of capitalism.</p>
<p>Big Tech companies have come out strongly against regulation that would break up their business operations, suggesting reform would result in the loss of research and development, impractical market fragmentation and higher service costs to consumers.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/23/new-poll-shows-voters-favor-tech-regulation-but-rank-it-low-priority.html">survey</a> commissioned by a tech industry trade group funded by Big Tech companies such as Apple, Facebook and Amazon suggests that Americans view tech regulation as a low priority for Congress. Among those listed as top priority for Americans were the economy, public health, climate change and infrastructure. The survey also revealed that Americans are more likely to oppose regulation if it were to affect offerings like free shipping on Amazon Prime products.</p>
<p>Perhaps this poll and the bipartisan sentiment among elected leaders signals that after COVID-19, society has become aware of its dependency on tech giants, for better or worse. For the last 18 months, American workers have adapted to remote work. They utilize programs run by Big Tech companies to communicate with other employees, to run companies, and to buy groceries and essentials. It is unlikely this dynamic will change, as many companies have announced their transition to a fully remote or hybrid work model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This topic has raised interest among professionals, more specifically those who work in the tech industry, startups and small businesses. We at <a href="https://www.fishbowlapp.com/">Fishbowl</a> thought we’d ask professionals &#8212; many of whom work in the tech industry &#8212; about breaking up tech giants. Fishbowl is a social network for professionals, so conducting surveys on this and other workplace topics is a natural fit.</p>
<p>The survey ran from July 26-30, 2021, to determine how employees in the field feel about antitrust laws. The survey asked professionals: Do you believe antitrust legislation should be used to break up Big Tech companies like Amazon and Google?</p>
<p>There were 11,579 verified professionals on the Fishbowl app who participated in the survey, and they were given the option to answer either yes or no. The survey was broken down into state and professional industries such as law, consulting, finance, tech, marketing, accounting, human resources, teachers and others.</p>
<p>Here’s what the survey revealed:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194677" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194677" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2194677 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Legislation-Survey-Industries-Bar-Chart-Survey.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Legislation-Survey-Industries-Bar-Chart-Survey.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Legislation-Survey-Industries-Bar-Chart-Survey.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Legislation-Survey-Industries-Bar-Chart-Survey.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Legislation-Survey-Industries-Bar-Chart-Survey.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Legislation-Survey-Industries-Bar-Chart-Survey.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Legislation-Survey-Industries-Bar-Chart-Survey.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Legislation-Survey-Industries-Bar-Chart-Survey.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194677" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fishbowl</p></div></p>
<p>Out of 11,579 professionals, the majority — 6,920 (59.76%) — responded yes to the survey question.</p>
<p>Based on responses, we found that law professionals were the highest group responding in the affirmative to the survey, with 66.67%. Consulting professionals followed with 61.97%, while finance (60.64%) marginally beat out tech (60.03%). Conversely, teachers had the lowest percentage with 53.49%. Human resources (55.65%), accounting (58.51%) and other professional industries (58.83%) trailed behind.</p>
<p>The survey’s data was collected from professionals in 25 U.S. states. The highest percentage responding “yes” was Colorado with 76.83%. In second place was Washington with 73.17%, and Michigan rounded out the top three with 69.70%. Missouri (51.35%) had the lowest percentage of employees responding &#8220;yes&#8221; to splitting up Big Tech. Following closely behind were Indiana (52.59%) and Massachusetts (52.83%). Overall, the majority of the states involved in the survey agreed that they believed antitrust legislation should indeed break up Big Tech companies.</p>
<p>Tech had the fourth-highest percentage of professionals agreeing that Big Tech companies should be broken up. Some benefits from breaking up Big Tech companies are more opportunities for small businesses — for a tech professional or entrepreneur, this could open up opportunities to launch new products, programs and services. It could also add more jobs for highly skilled professionals. Second, it can reduce data privacy and national security concerns. But some <a href="https://medium.com/chamber-of-progress/new-house-bills-would-ban-these-15-tech-conveniences-that-consumers-love-f55289701ae8">cons of breaking up Big Tech</a> companies include the loss of research and development — large companies provide major funding for artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, wearables, robots and more. Ultimately, breaking up Big Tech companies can also increase service costs for professionals and the overall public.</p>
<p>As policymakers continue to negotiate on how to break up Big Tech, the White House is also making moves. President Joe Biden recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/15/technology/lina-khan-ftc.html">named</a> Khan, a professor at Columbia Law School, as chair of the FTC. A staunch critic of Big Tech, Khan’s main priority is to protect the public from corporate abuse and ensure merger guidelines reflect economic realities and empirical learning and enforcement. Simply put, she reviews mergers with skepticism.</p>
<p>And in July, Biden announced his intention to nominate <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/20/president-biden-announces-jonathan-kanter-for-assistant-attorney-general-for-antitrust/">Jonathan Kanter</a> for chief of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. Kanter is an antitrust lawyer with over 20 years of experience who has been a leading advocate and expert in the effort to promote strong and meaningful antitrust enforcement and competition policy.</p>
<p>With these additional members, it is expected that there will be an aggressive approach to enforcing antitrust laws across industries, leaving it to Congress to ensure that moving forward things are different.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new startup called <a href="http://www.clay.earth">Clay</a>, backed by $8 million in seed funding, has built a system designed to help you be more thoughtful with the people in your life, which operates somewhat like a personal <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/crm/what-is-crm/">CRM</a>. With Clay, you build a collection of the people you meet by connecting your email and calendar with social apps, including Twitter and LinkedIn. Clay then populates each person&#8217;s entry with all the relevant information you would need to recall for any future meeting &#8212; ranging from their work history to latest tweets to the details on how you met and when you last communicated, among other things.</p>
<p>You also can add notes of your own to each entry, click to activate reminders to follow up with certain people and organize entries into groups. The app supports a command bar, keyboard shortcuts and home screen widgets, as well.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The end result is something that&#8217;s not exactly an address book but also not necessarily as sales and pipeline-focused as a CRM system.</span></p>
<p>Clay&#8217;s founders instead refer to their app as a &#8220;home for your people,&#8221; as it&#8217;s attempting to carve out a new space in the market for a more personal system of tracking who you know and how.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195637" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195637" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2195637" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ios_screens.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ios_screens.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ios_screens.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ios_screens.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ios_screens.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ios_screens.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ios_screens.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ios_screens.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195637" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clay</p></div></p>
<p>The idea for the startup comes from entrepreneurs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/achariam/">Matthew Achariam</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyhamed/">Zachary Hamed</a>, Clay&#8217;s co-founders and co-CEOs, who met back in their early days of working with startups. Prior to starting Clay, Achariam helped lead product at Y Combinator-backed analytics company, Custora, and Hamed led the product management team for Goldman Sachs&#8217; web platform, Marquee.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think that people and relationships have played such an important role in our own career trajectories. And we wanted to dive into that,&#8221; Hamed explains, when speaking about what prompted their interest in building Clay.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To get started with Clay &#8212; which is available as a web, desktop and mobile app &#8212; you&#8217;ll first connect your accounts. At present, Clay supports Microsoft Outlook/Office 365, Google Calendar, Gmail/Google Mail and Twitter. You also can add other services via Zapier integrations. After setup, Clay will then automatically track your meetings and personal connections, and augment people&#8217;s entries with other details pulled from the web, like their background and work experience listed on LinkedIn and latest tweets.</p>
<p>People&#8217;s entries will also detail how you met the person &#8212; something people tend to forget over time. For example, they may be noted as a connection you made on LinkedIn, or someone you met in person or in an online meeting.</p>
<p>Through Clay&#8217;s desktop app, you also can optionally connect Clay with iMessage, which allows it to augment its people entries with phone numbers and details about when you last communicated. However, this feature should be met with some caution. While Clay doesn&#8217;t import the content of your messages, the company says, it has to work around the lack of an official API or SDK to perform this integration. That means the feature requires full disk access in order to function. That&#8217;s an elevated security permission some will not feel comfortable using.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195635" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195635" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2195635 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/clay_hero_mac.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="460" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/clay_hero_mac.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/clay_hero_mac.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/clay_hero_mac.jpg?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/clay_hero_mac.jpg?resize=768,520 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/clay_hero_mac.jpg?resize=680,460 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/clay_hero_mac.jpg?resize=1536,1039 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/clay_hero_mac.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195635" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clay</p></div></p>
<p>The founders, however, say they&#8217;ve built Clay to respect people&#8217;s privacy and security. The company&#8217;s privacy policy is <a href="https://library.clay.earth/security-and-privacy">human-readable</a> and each integration is explained in terms of what data is pulled, what&#8217;s not pulled and how the data is used. Currently, data is encrypted on Clay&#8217;s servers and in transit, but the goal &#8212; and part of what the funding round is going toward &#8212; is to make Clay work fully locally on users&#8217; devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want it to work fully on your machine. We don&#8217;t want to be storing any data at all,&#8221; says Hamed. &#8220;To do that is a very technically complex task, so it was prohibitively out of reach for Matt and I as we were building Clay in the beginning. But now that we have resources, that is our eventual goal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still, Clay may face a difficult time convincing users that it&#8217;s safe, due to how many times people have been burned in the past over &#8220;smart&#8221; address books that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/16/plaxo-goes-back-to-being-a-smart-address-book-launches-virtual-assistant/">abused</a> users&#8217; private data. Only last year, a new startup in this space, Sunshine Contacts, was found to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/sunshine-contacts-may-have-given-out-your-home-address-even-if-youre-not-using-the-app/">distributing people&#8217;s home addresses,</a> even though these people hadn&#8217;t signed up for the app. Many other prior efforts also failed because they overstepped user privacy concerns in order to generate revenue.</p>
<p>Achariam believes the problem with these earlier products was often the business model they adopted.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was one of the things we really were thinking about when we started going into the space &#8212; because we, ourselves, wanted something like this &#8212; and every product that we saw kind of rubbed us the wrong way or exploded because of those reasons,&#8221; notes Achariam, of the smart address market&#8217;s history. &#8220;A lot of these things started off with making the user the product. And then you weren&#8217;t paying for it. There was no sustainable business model and at some point, they had to balance those trade-offs,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195634" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195634" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2195634" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/clay_hero_ios.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="460" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/clay_hero_ios.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/clay_hero_ios.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/clay_hero_ios.jpg?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/clay_hero_ios.jpg?resize=768,520 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/clay_hero_ios.jpg?resize=680,460 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/clay_hero_ios.jpg?resize=1536,1039 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/clay_hero_ios.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195634" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clay</p></div></p>
<p>Clay is doing things differently. It&#8217;s starting from day one with a pricing plan that will allow it to self-sustain. Right now, that&#8217;s a fairly steep $20 per month, but the goal is to bring that down over time and introduce a free plan. (It&#8217;s also offering cheaper access to certain groups, like students and nonprofits, if a request is emailed.)</p>
<p>During testing, Clay was <a href="https://clay.earth/#reserve">adopted</a> by a number of different types of users, including teachers who wanted to remember students and their parents; a congressional candidate who wanted to track their constituents; and a veterinarian who wanted to remember customers and their pets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We intentionally made it really cross-industry, cross-disciplinary. We didn&#8217;t think that this was a tech problem or investor problem. We went broader,&#8221; notes Hamed.</p>
<p>The startup has raised a total of $8 million in seed funding from 2019 through 2020. The funding was led by Forerunner Ventures, with participation from General Catalyst.</p>
<p>Angel investors include Shannon Brayton, former CMO at LinkedIn; Kevin Hartz, former CEO of Eventbrite; Kelvin Beachum, an NFL player, philanthropist and investor; Lindsay Kaplan, co-founder of Chief and former VP of Communications and Brand at Casper; Zoelle Egner, former marketing lead at Airtable; Adam Evans, former CTO of RelateIQ; Charlie Songhurst, former head of corporate strategy at Microsoft; Sam Lessin, former VP of product management at Facebook; Jonah Goodhart, former CEO of Moat and SVP at Oracle; Jeff Morris Jr., Chapter One Ventures and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Emerging from COVID, people are recognizing what had already become true. Relationships are increasingly digital, formed through online interaction and honed through messaging apps. So, how is it that we can be continuously connected, yet increasingly lonely at the same time?&#8221; stated Forerunner GP Brian O&#8217;Malley, about his firm&#8217;s investment. &#8220;The problem is that existing social products don&#8217;t serve you as the end user. You are just a pawn for some other customer, like a recruiter or some unknown advertiser. Clay is the first relationship software company built to understand all the signals that drive your connections, helping you form better ones with a broader set of people. Clay understands that your network is yours, so you should be empowered to own it,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Clay is currently opened to sign-ups through its website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who doesn’t want a vacation home?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right. That’s what I thought.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.kocomo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kocomo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a Mexico City-based startup that wants to help make that dream a reality. And it has just closed on $6 million equity and $50 million debt financing to advance on that goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company aims to allow for cross-border co-ownership of luxury vacation properties that goes beyond the historical use of timeshares. Put simply, the founders of Kocomo &#8212; who are a mix of Colombian, British, Mexican, American and Panamanian &#8212; want to upend conventional vacation home ownership with a marketplace that gives people a way to purchase, own and sell fractional interests in luxury homes. Or even more simply, Kocomo’s mission is to make the dream of vacation home ownership “an attainable reality for more people around the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded this year, it has been operating in stealth mode since May, recently launching a beta version of its website to engage with a “select” group of clients from its waiting list. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are focused initially on Americans and Canadians wanting to buy a vacation home in Mexico, the Caribbean and Costa Rica and then eventually we will be doing the same in Europe,” said Martin Schrimpff, co-founder and CEO of </span><a href="https://www.kocomo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kocomo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AllVP and Vine Ventures co-led the equity portion of the financing, which included participation from Picus Capital, Fontes &#8211; QED, FJ Labs and Clocktower Technology Ventures, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">JAWS &#8212; the family office of Starwood Capital Group Chairman Barry Sternlicht. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/architect-capital-brings-alternative-capital-to-the-early-stage-with-new-100m-fund/">Architect Capita</a>l provided the debt investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the founders of four Latin American unicorns also put money in the equity round, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mate Pencz and Florian Hagenbuch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/brazils-loft-adds-100m-to-its-accounts-700m-to-its-valuation-in-a-single-month/">Loft</a>, Oskar Hjertonsson of Cornershop, Carlos Garcia of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/mexican-unicorn-kavak-raises-a-485m-series-d-at-a-4b-valuation/">Kavak</a> and Sergio Furio of Creditas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No doubt the COVID-19 pandemic had many people reassessing their views about life and work.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;9 proptech investors talk co-living, home offices and other pandemic trends&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/9-proptech-investors-talk-co-living-home-offices-and-other-pandemic-trends/embed/#?secret=FRPhsiCiWi" data-secret="FRPhsiCiWi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Schrimpff’s case, spending more time with friends and family became a top priority and he accelerated his plans to find a vacation home. But he was disappointed as he explored options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Buying an entire vacation home that I was only going to use a few weeks a year, and which I’d have to manage myself, seemed wasteful, stressful and outdated,” he said. “Furthermore, it was impossible to find a beautiful house on the beach in Mexico that fell within my budget.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience of renting an Airbnb year after year, with what Schrimpff described as having “inconsistent quality and lack of professional management,” did not make sense to him either. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, as he discussed his frustration with his now co-founders, the idea for Kocomo was born.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s model is similar to that of another early-stage proptech based here in the U.S. called </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/pacaso-raises-75m-goes-from-launch-to-unicorn-in-5-months/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pacaso</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Schrimpff’s view the biggest difference between the two models is that Pacaso is focused more on the second home market in places that are a one- to two-hour drive from where the owners are living.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SUnwV8F8TR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/pacaso-raises-75m-goes-from-launch-to-unicorn-in-5-months/">Pacaso raises $75M, goes from launch to unicorn in 5 months</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pacaso raises $75M, goes from launch to unicorn in 5 months&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/pacaso-raises-75m-goes-from-launch-to-unicorn-in-5-months/embed/#?secret=SUnwV8F8TR" data-secret="SUnwV8F8TR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kocomo is focused more on the cross-border vacation homes which are more like a two- to three-hour flight away from where the owners are located,” he said. Also, “the complexities and problems” tackled by Kocomo are larger, considering that they involve cross-border transactions, according to Schrimpff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another big differentiator from Pacaso is that Kocomo gives owners the option to “rent their weeks,” added Schrimpff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same way that NetJets uses shared ownership to create an opportunity for people to enjoy the benefits of private air travel, Kocomo aims to apply a co-ownership model to vacation homes, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our platform enables multiple people to own and enjoy a luxury vacation home and split all the costs amongst them without the fuss and hassle normally involved,” explained CFO and co-founder Tom Baldwin. “We call this the smarter way to own a home abroad. Buying a whole home for just a few weeks a year feels like more hassle than it’s worth while spending money on a rental is a waste and an expense, not an asset.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kocomo, said co-founder and CPO Graciela Arango, manages all of the legal and administrative processes that come with home acquisition and ownership. For example, it purchases the home through an LLC, finds and vet qualified co-owners, allocates time equitably among the co-owners and performs all of the services necessary to manage and maintain the home over time. It even deals with managing utilities, landscaping and preventive maintenance.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195469" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195469" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2195469 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/casa_arroyo_1.2-1-e1630263324533.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195469" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kocomo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way it is <a href="https://www.kocomo.com/how-it-works">different from the concept of timeshares</a>, the executives say, in that participants </span>actually own a part of the real estate, not just the use of time. So if the property value goes up, so does someone&#8217;s investment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its equity capital in part toward increasing the number of its nine-person staff, with a particular focus on sales, marketing and engineering. It also, naturally, plans to invest in the technology that powers its platform. The debt capital will go toward the acquisition of about 20 luxury vacation properties in “sought after” destinations in Mexico that are close to airports with international flights — such as Los Cabos, Punta Mita and Tulum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, the company plans to expand to other vacation destinations within direct flying distance of the U.S., such as Costa Rica and the Caribbean. Down the line, the company sees “huge potential” in ski locations, Mediterranean beach destinations and cultural centers such as Paris, London, Madrid and Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kocomo has also identified a financial institution partner so that it can provide financing to clients for the purchase of ownership interests in properties on their platform, and is in late-stage discussions to formalize the partnership, according to Baldwin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whereas many startups coming out of stealth-mode focus on going from 0 to a high number of sales quickly, our primary focus initially is to go from 0 to 10 Kocomo qualified co-owners,” said Schrimpff. “Even though we are a B2C company, since our ticket size is upwards of $200,000, our sales cycle exhibits a trajectory more akin to that of a B2B startup.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, but not surprisingly, Kocomo is seeing that most of its early interest is coming from people in the tech community. Pacaso, too, saw a similar trend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This profile fits our model because they often have flexibility in their calendars, or ability to work remotely, and are open to trying new models, especially if they feel like this is a savvier way to become an owner,” said Schrimpff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AllVP’s Antonia Rojas said that</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kocomo is leveraging technology to deliver “an evolved model of real estate ownership which taps into deep-seated changes in the way consumers organize and prioritize work, family and free time in a post-COVID world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm was also impressed by the caliber of the team. Schrimpff founded and later sold PayU, a global payments business now owned and controlled by Naspers. Baldwin is a former Goldman Sachs banker who spent the last eight years as a venture capital and private equity investor in Mexico and Brazil. Arango graduated from Harvard Business School, and previously worked at IDEO in Silicon Valley. Brian Requarth, co-founder &amp; non-executive chairman, previously founded real estate classifieds company Vivareal.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disrupt is right around the corner, and this year the show is packed to the brim with incredible panels and conversations, an absolutely <em>stacked</em> Startup Battlefield cohort of companies launching on our stage, investor insights and a virtual expo hall <em>full</em> of exciting new products and services in the Startup Alley.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait! Literally. So we&#8217;re giving you guys a sneak peek at some of the startups you might see at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt</a> in upcoming episodes of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/ecl">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p>
<p>Usually, the Extra Crunch Live crew sits down with founders and the investors who finance them to learn how they decided to partner with one another and, ultimately, how startups can get to &#8220;yes&#8221; when fundraising. In the latter half of the episode, those same guests give live feedback to folks in the audience who come on our virtual stage and pitch their products.</p>
<p>Truth be told, everyone loves a good pitch-off. So in these upcoming Startup Alley Edition episodes of Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;re turning the entire episode into a pitch-off. SUA companies will come on stage, one at a time, and have exactly 60 seconds to get us excited about their startup. But it wouldn&#8217;t be a true pitch-off without some expert feedback.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce the investors joining us on these episodes to share their insights and wisdom with both the startups and the audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ideanomics, a fintech and electric mobility firm based in New York, has added to its list of acquisitions: commercial electric vehicle manufacturer Via Motors (in an all-stock deal valued at $450 million).</p>
<p><a href="https://ideanomics.com/">Ideanomics</a> has been aggressively purchasing mobility businesses this year, as it seeks to build out vertically integrated offerings for fleet operators and transit authorities transitioning to electric vehicles. The Via Motors acquisition announcement pushed Ideanomics&#8217; share price up 6% since the market opened, to $2.43.</p>
<p>This year alone, Ideanomics has completed acquisitions of US Hybrid, a manufacturer of electric powertrain components and fuel cell engines; EV tractor maker Solectrac, which builds the only American-made electric tractor; Utah-based wireless charging company Wave and Timios Holdings Corp., which provides title and escrow services.</p>

<p>The acquisition of <a href="https://www.viamotors.com/">Via Motors</a> is by far the largest in Ideanomics’ history. Via designs and manufacturers electric vans and trucks for short- and middle-mile delivery, using a modular, “skateboard” style architecture across three vehicle models.</p>
<p>“This acquisition marks a transformational milestone for Ideanomics,” CEO Alfred Poor said in an investor call on the deal Monday. He noted that the acquisition also provides “full OEM manufacturing capabilities,” meaning the company can now make the EVs that it finances and keeps charged.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195626" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195626" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2195626" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/via-motors.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/via-motors.jpeg 1100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/via-motors.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/via-motors.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/via-motors.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/via-motors.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/via-motors.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195626" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.viamotors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Via Motors <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The transaction includes a potential earnout for Via stockholders of up to $180 million, contingent on vehicle deliveries through 2026. The shareholders will also own around 25% of the combined company. Separately, Ideanomics said it will advance a $50 million financing note to fund Via operations.</p>
<p>Ideanomics currently facilitates everything from EV procurement to setting up charging management infrastructure. Through its fintech arm, Ideanomics also offers financing, as well as charging-as-a-service and vehicle-as-a-service services, which it says will let fleet companies switch their investment model from capital expenditure-driven to operating expenses-driven.</p>
<p>“We believe the shift from CapEx to OpEx will have a profound effect on fleet operators, accelerating the adoption of zero-emission fleets by removing the obvious barrier to entry but having to invest in new products and infrastructure,” Poor said in a recent second-quarter earnings call.</p>
<p>While the company stayed quiet about financial projections for Utah-based Via through 2026, Poor added that these figures would be included in Ideanomics’ proxy statement submitted to regulators in advance of the acquisition&#8217;s closing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petlove&amp;Co, a São Paulo-based digital platform for products and services for the pet market, announced today that it has raised about $150 million (R$750 million) today in a funding round led by Riverwood Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round is nearly double that of what <a href="https://www.petlove.com.br/">Petlove</a> has raised in its history. The company started its life as PetSuperMarket when it was founded in 1999 in the early days of the internet. Today, the company continues to operate an online store offering a wide range of pet products and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tarpon, SoftBank, L Catterton, Porto Seguro and Monashees also participated in the funding round, which brings the company’s total raised to a known $225.8 million over its lifetime, according to Crunchbase. Since January 2020 alone, Petlove has raised over $192 million. The company has declined to reveal at what valuation this last round was raised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petlove CEO Talita Lacerda said the company will use the new capital in part to further expand its logistics network with the goal of accelerating its delivery capabilities. In particular, it plans to expand its express delivery service, Petlove Já, which allows products to be delivered within 4 hours of placing their order, to other geographies. Currently it is only available in a few cities in Brazil, such as São Paulo and Belo Horizonte. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding will also go toward growing Petlove&#8217;s subscription program, which Lacerda said is the first of its kind in the country, and one of the company&#8217;s flagship services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Brazilian pet market is one of the largest in the world and Brazilian consumers are increasingly demanding digitally native products and services with a high level of customer-centricity,” said Francisco Alvarez-Demalde, co-founding partner and managing partner at Riverwood Capital, in a written statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has evolved and grown after a recent integration with DogHero, the acquisitions of Vetus and VetSmart and the launch of Porto.Pet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have built an increasingly comprehensive and inclusive platform to meet the needs of all stakeholders in this rapidly expanding market,” Lacerda said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brazil is the 4th largest pet market in total spend, the company says. According to the Instituto Pet Brasil, total sales of the Brazilian pet market surpassed US$7 billion (R$40 billion) in 2020, growing 13.5% compared to the previous year, while Petlove grew 65%. Overall, pet ownership in the country is high, with 60% of Brazilians owning pets compared to 50% in the US.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p>Petlove has over 400 employees, according to Pitchbook.</p>
<p>Alex Szapiro, head of Brazil and operating partner of SoftBank Latin America Fund described the work that Petlove has done to help &#8220;form the largest ecosystem in Latin America&#8221; as  &#8220;one of the most extraordinary in the segment and in the entire retail sector.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lot of startup founders think there&#8217;s a dire need for their product in the market, but Liya Shuster-Bier knew for sure that there was one, because she&#8217;d required it herself prior to building it — yet nothing like it existed. Liya&#8217;s company <a href="https://myalula.com">Alula</a> provides a new kind of shopping platform, organized based on treatment types, and includes both registry and care calendar features for helping a whole network of caregivers rally around someone&#8217;s cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>On this week&#8217;s episode of<a href="https://pod.link/found"> Found</a>, we talk about Liya&#8217;s entrepreneurial journey, as well as the challenges of managing a cancer diagnosis, even after remission, and how that provided her with the inspiration not just for what Alula does, but also for how the company functions. She provides us tremendous insight about what it means to be a leader, and how you can build a company that has mutual respect and concern for our shared humanity as a core value that&#8217;s also a commercial success.</p>
<p>We loved our time chatting with Liya, and we hope you love yours listening to the episode.

<h2>Nuro&#8217;s Nevada play</h2>

<p>Earlier this month, we published a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec-1/">series of articles</a> that took a deep dive into autonomous vehicle technology company Nuro. We mentioned that the company was aiming to move into Nevada. Now, there are more details.</p>
<p>Nuro, which is applying its AV tech to delivery, is investing $40 million to develop a factory and closed course test track in southern Nevada. Nuro co-founder and CEO Jiajun Zhu said this will allow Nuro to &#8220;build tens of thousands of robots.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Nuro isn&#8217;t wasting any time getting started. Construction on the factory will begin in fall 2021 and is expected to be completed in 2022. Both the factory and closed-course testing facility are expected to be fully operational in 2022, the company said.</p>
<p>The factory, which will be more than 125,000 square feet, will be used to build Nuro&#8217;s third-generation autonomous vehicles with current and future partners. BYD North America will be Nuro&#8217;s manufacturing partner.</p>
<p>Nuro is also taking over 74 acres of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway to build a closed-course testing facility that will allow the development and validation of its autonomous on-road vehicles. The testing track will measure bot performance in a broad range of scenarios, from avoiding pedestrians and pets to giving bicycles space on shared roadways, as well as environmental tests and vehicle systems validation. the company said.</p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Rivian has raised more than $10.5 billion in its lifetime, funds that have been directed towards the design, development and production of its first two electric vehicles as well as commercial vans for Amazon.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a hefty sum that should be enough to fulfill that mission — and more. And yet, even Rivian is no match for the public market&#8217;s siren song.</p>
<p>The company, just weeks before its first electric pickup trucks are expected to be delivered to customers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/electric-vehicle-company-rivian-has-confidentially-filed-for-an-ipo/">confidentially filed paperwork</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to go public. A Rivian IPO announcement has been expected for months now. The valuation the company is shooting for is the big surprise. If Bloomberg&#8217;s sources are right, Rivian is shooting for a valuation roughly around $80 billion.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s nearly three times larger than the last valuation I was able to nail down in January. At that time, the company had just raised another $2.65 billion from existing investors T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Fidelity Management and Research Company, Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund, Coatue and D1 Capital Partners. New investors also participated in that round, which pushed Rivian&#8217;s valuation to $27.6 billion, a source familiar with the investment round told TechCrunch at the time.</p>
<p>Rivian has raised more money since then. In July, the company announced it had closed a $2.5 billion private funding round led by Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund, D1 Capital Partners, Ford Motor and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Third Point, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Dragoneer Investment Group and Coatue also participated in that round. The company did not share a post-money valuation at the time of the July 2021 announcement.</p>
<p>Officially, Rivian says the size and price range for the proposed offering have yet to be determined.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Coco</strong>, the Los Angeles delivery robot startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/last-mile-robotic-delivery-firm-coco-raises-36m/">raised $36 million</a> in a Series A round led by Sam Altman, Silicon Valley Bank and Founders Fund, with participation from Sam Nazarian, Ellen Chen and Mario Del Pero. It brings the company&#8217;s total funding up to around $43 million.</p>
<p><strong>DealerPolicy</strong>, an insurance marketplace for automotive retail, raised $110 million in a Series C rouond led by the Growth Equity business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Additional investors include 3L Capital and Hudson Structured Capital Management Ltd. Goldman Sachs&#8217; Paul Pate will also join the company&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p><strong>Getaround</strong>, the peer-to-peer car-sharing startup, is in talks to go public through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Altitude Acquisition Corp , <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-softbank-backed-getaround-spac-merger-talks-sources-2021-08-25/">Reuters reported</a>. The company has confidentially sought investors to participate in the deal through a private placement in public equity, or PIPE, at a valuation of around $1.7 billion.</p>
<p><strong>HyPoint</strong>, the two-year-old fuel cell developer, has secured a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/hypoint-and-piasecki-reach-6-5m-deal-to-develop-hydrogen-fuel-cells-systems-for-evtols/">$6.5 million development agreement</a> with Piasecki Aircraft Corporation for the design and certification of hydrogen fuel cell systems. Through the partnership, HyPoint aims to deliver five full-scale, 650 kilowatt hydrogen fuel cell systems for ground testing, demo flights and the certification process.</p>
<p><strong>KKR</strong>, the global investment firm, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/kkr-to-acquire-new-zealand-bus-company-ritchies-transport-at-value-of-347m/">plans to acquire</a> New Zealand bus and coach company Ritchies Transport, which currently has a fleet of more than 1,600 vehicles and 42 depots that operate across the country. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but sources familiar with the circumstances say the deal values Ritchies at over $347 million ($500 million NZD). This is KKR&#8217;s first infrastructure investment in New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>Malta Inc</strong>., an energy storage company, said that Chevron Technology Ventures and Piva Capital have joined a group of investors including Proman, Alfa Laval, Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Dustin Moskovitz in its oversubscribed Series B financing, increasing the round to more than $60 million.</p>
<p><strong>MaxAB</strong>, the Egyptian B2B e-commerce platform that serves food and grocery retailers, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/maxab-gets-an-extra-15m-acquires-yc-backed-moroccan-startup-waystocap/">$15 million extension</a> from existing investors RMBV, IFC, Flourish Ventures, Crystal Stream Capital, Rise Capital, Endeavour Catalyst, Beco Capital and 4DX Ventures. The extension brings its total Series A fundraise to $55 million.</p>
<p><strong>Point Pickup Technologies</strong>, a last-mile delivery service, acquired white-label e-commerce platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/point-pickup-acquires-e-commerce-platform-grocerkey-for-42m-to-allow-for-same-day-delivery/">GrocerKey for $42 million</a>. The acquisition means Point Pickup will be able to offer retailers services such as same-day delivery under their own brand name, rather than under third parties like Instacart.</p>
<p><strong>Upstream</strong>, the Israeli automotive security firm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/automotive-cybersecurity-startup-upstream-raises-62m-series-c-to-scale-cloud-based-security/">raised $62 million</a> in a Series C funding round led by Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance and was joined by new investors I.D.I. Insurance, 57 Stars&#8217; NextGen Mobility Fund and La Maison Partners. Existing investors Glilot Capital, Salesforce venture, Volvo Group Venture Capital, Nationwide, Delek US and others also participated in the round. With this latest round, the company has raised a total of $105 million since its founding in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Volvo Group</strong> has agreed to buy heavy duty truck subsidiary of Jiangling Motors Corp for about 1.1 billion Swedish crowns ($125.7 million) to make trucks in China, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ab-volvo-buys-chinese-vehicles-business-about-sek-11-bln-2021-08-23/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome back to policy corner! The stalemate over the budget reconciliation that I warned might take months to break &#8212; just kidding! The House managed to pass the $3.5 trillion budget resolution and made progress on the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill on Tuesday, in a 220-212 bipartisan vote. The vote includes a non-binding agreement to vote on the infrastructure bill by Sept. 27.</p>
<p>The path is now clear for Democrats to pass one of the most socially progressive budgets in decades, with a slew of social safety net provisions for childcare, healthcare, climate and education. House Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> had previously sworn she would stall the infrastructure bill until the budget passed, so the infrastructure bill passing sometime in our lifetime is suddenly looking like a much more realistic proposal!</p>
<p>Progressive Democrats in particular are committed to keeping the fate of the two bills intertwined. &#8220;We will only vote for the infrastructure bill after passing the reconciliation bill,&#8221; Progressive Caucus chairwoman, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.), said in a statement.</p>
<p>Speaking of the two bills&#8230; while consumer incentives for electric vehicles were slashed from the infrastructure bill, they did survive the budget reconciliation. Right now, there currently exists a 30D tax credit, but the $7,500 incentive doesn&#8217;t include automakers that have sold more than 200,000 EVs (so General Motors and Tesla don&#8217;t qualify).</p>
<p>Leilani Gonzalez with the Zero Emission Transportation Association urged reform to the EV tax credit. She suggested that Congress slash means-testing for the credit, like one that only allows people under a certain annual income to access it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congress should ensure that this tax credit is not impeded by restrictive means-tested requirements, like low manufacturer&#8217;s suggested retail price (MSRP) or adjusted gross income (AGI) caps,&#8221; <a href="https://www.zeta2030.org/insights/we-cant-tackle-the-climate-crisis-without-robust-electric-vehicle-incentives-for-all-americans">she wrote</a>. &#8220;These limitations ignore the public benefits of EVs that leave everyone better off, and they would only serve to hinder EV adoption.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even beyond reform, some Democrats are pushing for a direct cash rebate &#8212; meaning that the dollar amount would just be taken off the cost of the car at the point of sale, rather than the consumer having to wait to get that money back at tax time. But we&#8217;re still a long way from seeing a new kind of consumer incentive put into law, with some Democrats urging a $12,500 tax credit, and others arguing for a rebate, with still others arguing for either but with means-testing like what Gonzalez writes about.</p>
<p>In any case, we&#8217;ll be keeping an eye on it. It&#8217;s very hard to imagine how the country will achieve any kind of meaningful transition to electric vehicles by 2030 without some mechanism to make them easier (and cheaper) to buy.</p>
<p>In other news, the Federal Aviation Administration is spending $20.4 million in grants to airports who want to electrify equipment and transition to ZEVs. This isn&#8217;t about the planes themselves, though they tend to get the most media attention. These grants would be for less sexy things like airport shuttle buses and mobile ground power units, but which collectively still generate a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. The FAA has earmarked $300 million out of its $3.5 billion budget for electrification initiatives.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s one of those weeks folks. Lotta news so let&#8217;s get down to it.</p>
<h3>ADAS</h3>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong> admitted that the latest version of its so-called FSD tech — which is an upgraded version of its Autopilot advanced driver assistance system — is &#8220;not great.&#8221; He went on to write that the &#8220;Autopilot/AI team is rallying to improve as fast as possible. We&#8217;re trying to have a single tech stack for both highway &amp; city streets, but it requires massive [neural network] retraining.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong>, GM&#8217;s self-driving car subsidiary, launched a new initiative called Farm to Fleet that will allow the company to source solar power from farms in California&#8217;s Central Valley. Cruise is directly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/cruise-is-buying-solar-energy-from-california-farmers-to-power-its-electric-self-driving-fleet/">purchasing renewable energy credits</a> from Sundale Vineyards and Moonlight Companies to help power its fleet of all-electric autonomous vehicles in San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>Jalopnik&#8217;s</strong> Jason Torchinsky <a href="https://jalopnik.com/lots-of-people-seem-to-completely-misunderstand-the-aut-1847541014">has a great explainer</a> on the various levels of SAE autonomy.</p>
<p><strong>Toyota</strong> <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/35952477.html">suspended the operation</a> of its e-Palette autonomous shuttles — which do have two human safety operators on board — at the Paralympic Games Athletes&#8217; Village after one of the shuttles struck an athlete. The schedule for resuming operations at the Paralympic Games has not yet been determined, the company said. A spokesperson also noted to me that only the shuttles at the Olympics were halted. The e-Palette program is still operational.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: Since the newsletter went out to subscribers over the weekend, Toyota has restarted the e-Palette shuttles in the Olympic village. It&#8217;s important to note that these shuttles use a combination of manual and autonomous driving modes while underway. Toyota President Akio Toyoda <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJXhG_hFNK4">apologized for the incident</a> during a recent interview. The translation provided in closed captioning isn&#8217;t great, but he does make some interesting comments about the readiness of autonomous vehicle technology. In short: it&#8217;s not ready and humans are still better drivers.</p>
<p><strong>Waymo</strong> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/waymo-launches-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/">launched a robotaxi service</a> that will be open to certain vetted riders in San Francisco. The company officially kicked off its Waymo One Trusted Tester program in the city with a fleet of all-electric Jaguar I-PACEs equipped with the company&#8217;s fifth generation of its autonomous vehicle system. This is a big step for Waymo and we&#8217;ll be watching closely to see how the ramp mirrors, or differs, from its service in the Phoenix area.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Bensinger</strong> took a look at the terms of service on the Waymo One ride-hailing app <a href="https://twitter.com/GregBensinger/status/1430234711897509891">and in a tweet thread</a> provides a breakdown of what riders are agreeing to, including that the company will record video of riders while being driven around San Francisco.</p>
<p>Waymo also has decided to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/waymo-will-stop-selling-its-self-driving-lidar-sensors-to-other-companies/">get out of the lidar sales business</a> as it shifts its focus to deploying its autonomous vehicle technology across its ride-hailing and trucking divisions. In 2019, Waymo announced it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/06/waymo-to-start-selling-standalone-lidar-sensors/">sell its short-range lidar</a>, called Laser Bear Honeycomb, to companies outside of self-driving cars. It initially targeted robotics, security and agricultural technology.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>GM</strong> expanded (again) its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/gm-says-it-will-seek-reimbursement-from-lg-chem-for-1b-chevy-bolt-recall-losses/">recall of Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles</a> due to fire risks from battery manufacturing defects. The automaker said it would seek reimbursement from LG Chem, its battery cell manufacturing partner, for what it expects to be $1 billion worth of losses. this is the third recall GM has issued for this vehicle related to batteries.</p>
<p><strong>Lordstown Motors</strong> hired Daniel A. Ninivaggi, a longtime automotive executive and former head of Carl C. Icahn&#8217;s holding company, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/lordstown-motors-taps-former-icahn-exec-as-ceo-to-put-its-ev-truck-ambitions-back-on-track/">CEO and a board member</a>. The appointment follows months of tumult at Lordstown, which became publicly traded via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company.</p>
<h3>Other bits</h3>
<p><strong>Aria Alamalhodaei</strong> wrote up a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/yc-grad-buoyant-wants-to-solve-middle-mile-delivery-with-cargo-airships/">feature on Buoyant</a>, a recent Y Combinator grad and one of several airship startups that have popped up recently.</p>
<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s</strong> chief technology officer Sajjad Khan is leaving the automaker to start a <a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko.xhtml?oid=51095656&amp;ls=L3NlYXJjaHJlc3VsdC9zZWFyY2hyZXN1bHQueGh0bWw_c2VhcmNoVHlwZT1mbGV4JnNlYXJjaFN0cmluZz1OTVNfRmxleFNlYXJjaF9OZXdzT25seUNvbXBhbnkmcmVzdWx0SW5mb1R5cGVJZD00MDYyNiZmbGV4SW5mb1R5cGVzPTQwNjI2JTJDNDA2MzA!&amp;rs=0">venture capital fund</a>, the company said in a statement. Khan&#8217;s replacement, Magnus Östberg, will take over the CTO role effective Sept. 1.</p>
<p><strong>Porsche Cars North America</strong> added its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/porsche-expands-online-marketplace-to-include-us-inventory-of-new-cars/">entire U.S. inventory of new cars</a> to an online marketplace that it launched in May 2020. The platform called Porsche Finder is one of the ways the automaker is trying to keep up with customer demands and the industry&#8217;s shift to digital commerce. The product lets customers search by vehicle model and generation as well as price, equipment, packages and colors, on all new and used vehicle inventory from its 193 U.S. dealerships.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> wants to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/tesla-wants-to-sell-electricity-in-texas/">supply electricity directly to customers</a>, according to an application filed with Texas electricity regulators earlier this month. Energy Choice Matters first reported on the application.</p>
<p>The application, filed with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas on August 16, is a request to become what&#8217;s called a &#8220;retail electric provider&#8221; under its subsidiary Tesla Energy Ventures. On the deregulated, idiosyncratic Texas power market, REPs generally purchase wholesale electricity from power generators and sell it to customers. More than 100 REPs currently compete on the open market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you hear the word, “enterprise” and you immediately think software instead of Star Trek, you’re going to love this post — and the SaaS and Enterprise-focused knowledge waiting for you at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=saaspost">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> on September 21-23.</p>
<p>We’ve packed a veritable boatload of Grade A prime programming into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true&amp;promo=saaspost">three full days of Disrupt</a>. Prepare to hear and learn from an endless parade of tech icons, visionaries, movers, shakers and unicorn makers. We’re talking more than 80 scheduled offerings, folks.</p>
<p><strong>Join your people:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true&amp;promo=saaspost">Buy your pass</a> today and get ready to hear from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#eb919231-f3e4-4def-8dd0-afb0bc7c9c6e">leading voices</a> across the startup spectrum.</p>
<p>Where were we? Ah, yes — we’re here to help save you a bit of time by spotlighting just some of the sessions focused on enterprise software and SaaS. Plus, we’ll have a dedicated Disrupt Desk session where industry experts, like Emergence Capital’s Carlotta (Lotti) Siniscalco, and TechCrunch editors will break it down with deep-analysis, insight and likely a laugh or two.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">the Disrupt agenda</a> for exact days and times, and then plan your daily schedule in advance.</p>
<h3>From Bootstrapped to Billions</h3>
<p><em>Dozens have tried to reinvent the calendar, and dozens have failed. <strong>Tope Awotona</strong> built <strong>Calendly</strong> not as a way to reinvent the wheel, but to add a layer of simplicity to the chaos of human communication and time management. And boy did it work! The once-bootstrapped company is now worth more than $3 billion, serving individuals and enterprises alike. Hear from the founder and CEO on how he got Calendly off the ground, why he decided to finally take institutional investment, and how the company has changed as it grows.</em></p>
<h3>An Unstoppable Force and an Immovable Object</h3>
<p><em>Slack and Salesforce are two of the biggest names in tech. The communication tool (born from one of the odder pivots in tech history) is commonplace across organizations from almost every industry. It’s an unstoppable force. The sales CRM behemoth is used all over the world by sales teams small and large. An immovable object. In December of 2020, the pair announced a $27.7 billion merger. Hear from <strong>Slack co-founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield and Salesforce President and COO Bret Taylor</strong> about the future of the combined entity, why the deal made sense, and what it’s like to write down that many 0’s.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3>Powering the Small Business Economy with Cloud Technology</h3>
<p><em>Small business is a critical engine of job creation, economic growth, innovation and a driver in our efforts to recover from a global pandemic. Fifteen years ago, a New Zealand start-up called Xero was founded with the purpose of making life better for small businesses and their advisors. Xero achieved this by shifting accounting practices to the cloud and providing an open set of APIs, which has enabled more than 1,000 application partners to build affordable tech solutions connected to the Xero platform. <strong>Xero CEO, Steve Vamos</strong>, will discuss how Xero is revolutionizing the way small businesses do business by using the cloud and its platform to connect real-time data with bespoke business solutions that help small business owners be more successful. Steve will speak to a number of key initiatives that will change the game for startups and entrepreneurs who want to innovate and collaborate on the Xero platform, and he will explain how Xero’s vision extends beyond just technology to galvanizing a global community of support and purpose to help small businesses everywhere. Presented by Xero.</em></p>
<h3>Powering What’s Next: Insights from the Enterprise Software Market</h3>
<p><em>Spurred by digital transformation and the recent shift to remote work, the enterprise software industry has gone from strength-to-strength, and competition for deals and valuations are at all-time-highs. While investor appetite for enterprise software may be strong, it doesn’t mean that all tech businesses make worthy investments. In this panel, hear from <strong>Michael Fosnaugh and Monti Saroya, co-heads of Vista’s flagship investment strategy</strong>, and a selection of Vista CEOs on the hallmarks of best-in-class software companies and trends driving the industry. Presented by Vista Equity Partners.</em></p>
<h3>Achieve Sustainable IT with Prometheus, Grafana and Hardware Sentry</h3>
<p><em>Implementing sustainability initiatives to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in the data center is a vital challenge. Join <strong>Bertrand Martin, Sentry Software’s co-founder and CEO</strong>, as he presents Hardware Sentry Exporter for Prometheus. Measure the power consumption and temperature of more than 250 platforms with this unique pure-software solution. Report CO₂ emissions, electricity usage and costs of applications and services in Grafana. Reduce the carbon footprint of your datacenter with intelligent optimization of ambient temperature. Presented by Sentry Software.</em></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a>. I <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">also tweet</a>.</p>
<p>We are heading into a simply crazy week, so make sure that you keep Twitter pulled up as often as you can. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This is Y Combinator Demo Day week</strong>, which means a zillion startups are going to be doing their best to make noise, stand out from their peers, and raise capital on uncapped notes sans discount. TechCrunch is going to be busy as bees tracking the accelerator cohort, and bringing our favorites to your ears and eyes.</li>
<li><strong>The</strong> <strong>Chinese regulatory story continues</strong>, with new gaming restrictions and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-30/china-limits-minors-to-just-three-hours-of-online-gaming-a-week?sref=gni836kR">fresh warnings about anti-monopoly action</a> coming this morning. As before, the news is moving stocks. And the gaming news underscores that the Chinese state is not too bothered about directly undercutting its private sector to meet government goals.</li>
<li><strong>All that regulatory work is harming venture capital investment</strong>, it appears. Despite a rapid-fire July for Chinese startups, <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2021-08-30/china-venture-capital-deals-shrink-amid-regulatory-concerns-101763857.html">August is looking thinner from a foreign-investor perspective</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/29/north-base-media-leads-2-7m-pre-series-a-funding-in-digital-media-startup-vietcetera/">Vietcetera has raised new capital</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/29/korean-3d-spatial-data-tool-startup-urbanbase-closes-11-1m-series-b-round/">along with Urbanbase</a>. In India, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ola-electric-in-talks-to-raise-at-over-2-5-billion-valuation/">Ola Electric is looking to raise a huge amount of capital</a>, we report.</li>
<li>In public market news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/astras-first-commercial-launch-fails-to-reach-orbit/">Astra&#8217;s rocket didn&#8217;t go up high enough</a>, so its shares are falling. And we are heading back into an IPO cycle, so get ready.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright! That&#8217;s our show! Let&#8217;s get to work!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The startup has big plans: It is moving into the cryptocurrency market, it announced this morning, and partnering with Plaid to make money transfer easier for investors.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://alpaca.markets/">Alpaca</a> said this morning that it has closed a massive $50 million Series B round of capital. TechCrunch previously covered the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/08/alpaca-stock-trading-api/">late-2019 $6 million seed round</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/alpaca-raises-10m-series-a-for-its-api-powered-equities-trading-service/">late-2020 $10 million Series A</a>.</p>
<p>Alpaca offers equities trading software via API. The company initially allowed firms to plug into its technology, powering the trading capabilities of investing groups. More recently, Alpaca has begun allowing other fintech companies to offer equities trading through its service to their consumer user bases, work that fits under the larger embedded finance trend.</p>
<p>Tribe Capital led the company&#8217;s Series B, which saw participation from existing investors Spark Capital, Portage Ventures and Social Leverage. New investors including Horizons Ventures also put funds into the round.</p>
<p>Alpaca is an interesting startup. During the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/17/saving-not-spending-is-the-new-hotness-in-fintech/">savings-and-trading boom of 2020</a>, we used the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/whats-driving-api-powered-startups-forward-in-2020/">company&#8217;s trading volume</a> growth as a proxy not only for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/api-startups-are-so-hot-right-now/">growth of API-delivered software startups</a>, but also as a window into interest in buying and selling U.S. equities more broadly.</p>
<p>By now offering its trading services to fintechs with consumer end users &#8212; the B2B2C model, if you will &#8212; Alpaca has expanded its market remit. Per the startup, the number of brokerage accounts it supports has risen some 1,500% this year to more than 100,000. The startup&#8217;s CEO, <a href="https://twitter.com/iyoshyoshi">Yoshi Yokokawa,</a> told TechCrunch that it expects to secure 100 partners for its equities trading tech by the end of 2021. That figure was zero at the end of 2020, before its embedded finance product was released.</p>
<p>For Alpaca, working with more fintech companies opens up new revenue streams. The company will continue to generate payment for order flow incomes (PFOF), it said, but by supporting international customers, it can also earn incomes from foreign exchange fees and more.</p>
<p>Notably, Alpaca intends to make its service an anti-cost center by sharing PFOF revenues with partners that embed its fintech APIs. Yokokawa declined to share the PFOF split with customers, but our guess is that something around 15% to 25% makes sense, providing incentives to potential partners to choose Alpaca over rival tech while keeping enough top line on the Alpaca side of the ledger to continue building a venture-scale business.</p>
<p>The startup has big plans: It is moving into the cryptocurrency market, it announced this morning, and partnering with Plaid to make money transfer easier for investors. Recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/robinhoods-q2-revenue-appears-to-soar/">results from Robinhood</a>, a consumer trading platform popular in the United States, helped underscore just how lucrative crypto trading can be for platforms.</p>
<p>Why raise $50 million? TechCrunch was curious why the company would put so much capital onto its books in a single shot instead of raising a more modest round of, say, $25 million, still a healthy figure for a Series B and one closer in size to its preceding Series A.</p>
<p>Yokokawa said Alpaca has a lot of stuff to build. And to build it all is going to take a lot of folks. Alpaca had just 10 employees when COVID-19 hit, which means that the company has a lot of hiring in front of it. And the sorts of developers it needs, we suppose, aren&#8217;t going to come cheap.</p>
<p>Still, big rounds mean big expectations, from both investors and the observer team (that&#8217;s us) as well. We&#8217;ll check back with the company in a few months to see if it is on track to reach its partner goal for 2021.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Poppi is on a mission to lead in the new category of “functional soda” by offering a better-for-you product that also tastes good.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.drinkpoppi.com/">Poppi</a>, a prebiotic soda brand, closed $13.5 million in a Series A2 round and is on a mission to lead in the new category of “functional soda” by offering a better-for-you product that also tastes good.</p>
<p>The investor group includes CAVU Ventures as well as sports and entertainment celebrities like Russell Westbrook, the Chainsmokers, 24kGoldn, Kygo, Halsey, Kevin Love, Ellie Goulding, Olivia Munn, Nicole Scherzinger, Chantel Jeffries, Bryce Hall, Noah Beck, Josh Richards, Griffin Johnson and Blake Gray.</p>
<p>Husband-and-wife co-founders Stephen and Allison Ellsworth, former oil and gas researchers, launched the soda in 2020 after Allison Ellsworth began having stomach issues about two years prior. She went to doctor after doctor without a definitive diagnosis and decided to take to the internet to find some answers. She not only found that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/a18e644abb994b3ca76211179751129b">80% of our body’s immunity stems from gut health</a>, but that she could assist by healing her body through food.</p>
<p>One of the foods that helped with the stomach issues was apple cider vinegar, but drinking it straight everyday became difficult for her. So she went into the kitchen and began concocting a drink that would help her tolerate the vinegar and be tasty enough to drink regularly.</p>
<p>What resulted was a drink that eventually became a hit at a Dallas farmers market, which is where the pair was approached to sell Poppi in Whole Foods Market. They then decided to quit their jobs and do Poppi full time, even gaining a deal from CAVU Ventures co-founder Rohan Oza on <a href="https://www.drinkpoppi.com/shark-tank/">Shark Tank</a> in December 2018.</p>
<p>Each can of Poppi includes approximately a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, sparkling water, real fruit and plant-based sweeteners mixed into a formula that provides a balance of gut-friendly prebiotics known to aid in digestion, immunity and glowing skin.</p>
<p>The drinks retail for $2.49 per can and come in nine flavors like watermelon, strawberry lemon, raspberry rose and orange. They are available in over 7,500 retail locations, including Target, Safeway, Kroger, Publix, Whole Foods and Amazon.com.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2195347" style="width: 585px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195347" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2195347" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Stephen-x-Allison-1.jpeg?w=575" alt="" width="575" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Stephen-x-Allison-1.jpeg 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Stephen-x-Allison-1.jpeg?resize=127,150 127w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Stephen-x-Allison-1.jpeg?resize=254,300 254w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Stephen-x-Allison-1.jpeg?resize=768,909 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Stephen-x-Allison-1.jpeg?resize=575,680 575w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Stephen-x-Allison-1.jpeg?resize=42,50 42w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195347" class="wp-caption-text">Allison and Stephen Ellsworth, Poppi co-founders. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Poppi</p></div></p>
<p>Now the Ellsworths say they are receiving comments from consumers who say Poppi has “changed their lives.”</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, we are putting out a product that is healthy and tastes good,” Allison Ellsworth said. “We don’t want to be a niche health product — that is secondary to what we are trying to do, but it’s a bonus that we get that, too.”</p>
<p>Another bonus is that within the functional soda category, which has grown 465% year over year based on data from research company SPINS, the Ellsworths boast their annual growth put Poppi in the No. 1 spot based on four-week data from SPINS ending June 13, 2021.</p>
<p>Prior to the round, the company was bootstrapped. Proceeds will be used to expand distribution, scale Poppi’s team of 50 currently and marketing. The company is based in Dallas for now, but Allison Ellsworth said the company is moving its headquarters to Austin.</p>
<p>The company grew its revenue 550% year over year and the funding assists in giving Poppi a burn rate of 12 months and the ability to continue in high-growth mode, Stephen Ellsworth said.</p>
<p>Stevie Clements, chief brand architect at CAVU Ventures and a member of Poppi’s board, said via email that the company’s product, founders and growth to date were the drivers for her firm to invest in the company.</p>
<p>In addition, people are looking for products like Poppi that do more for them, while gut health, in particular, is a highly relevant category. The company’s ability to “deliver real function with incredible flavor is unlike anything on the market,” she said.</p>
<p>“Soda is a massive category ripe for disruption, and Stephen and Allison are a great team with an authentic story that’s really proven to resonate with people,” Clements added. “We’re excited by what Poppi has accomplished thus far and feel strongly that a better-for-you soda that tastes amazing and offers real function can shake up the multibillion dollar soda category.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ragnarok, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> gang operational since 2019 that gained notoriety after launching attacks against unpatched Citrix ADC servers, has shut down and released a free <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/decryption/">decryption key</a> for its victims.</p>
<p>The gang, sometimes referred to as Asnarok, last week replaced all 12 of the victims listed on its dark web portal with a short instruction on how to decrypt files. This was accompanied by the release of a decryptor, which experts at Emsisoft confirmed contains the master decryption key. The security firm, known for assisting ransomware victims with data decryption, has also released <a href="https://www.emsisoft.com/ransomware-decryption-tools/ragnarok">a universal decryptor</a> for Ragnarok ransomware.</p>
<p>Ragnarok is best known for using the Ragnar Locker ransomware to target IT networks. It claimed dozens of victims after exploiting a Citrix ADC vulnerability to search for Windows computers that are vulnerable to the EternalBlue vulnerability — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/12/wannacry-two-years-on/">the same vulnerability behind the now-notorious WannaCry attack</a> — and has racked up more than $4.5 million in ransom payments, according to the <a href="https://ransomwhe.re">Ransomwhe.re</a> payments tracker.</p>
<p>In April 2020, the cybercriminals stole 10 terabytes of data belonging to Portuguese energy giant EDP and threatened to leak it if a ransom of $10.9 million was not paid. The gang went on to exfiltrate up to 2TB of data, including bank statements, employee records, and celebrity agreements, from the servers of Italian liquor giant Campari Group, and demanded it hands over $15 million in ransom.</p>
<p>And in November, the short-lived ransomware gang also targeted Capcom, the Japanese video games giant behind titles such as Street Fighter, Resident Evil, and Devil May Cry. The gang reportedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/capcom-resident-evil-game-maker-breach-ransomware/">stole the personal data of 390,000 customers</a>, business partners, and other external parties from Capcom’s systems.</p>
<p>News of the shut down was <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ragnarok-ransomware-releases-master-decryptor-after-shutdown/">first reported</a> by Bleeping Computer.</p>
<p>With no formal departure note, it’s not clear why Ragnarok has seemingly decided to call it quits. But other ransomware gangs have adopted a similar self-destruction tactic in the face of increasing pressure from the U.S. government, which earlier this year branded ransomware as a national security threat; REvil, the gang behind the JBS attack, mysteriously disappeared from the internet, and DarkSide, the gang behind <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/colonial-pipeline/">the Colonial Pipeline incident</a>, also announced it was retiring.</p>
<p>Other ransomware gangs, including Ziggy Avaddon, SynAck, and Fonix, have also all retired from hacking this year, each giving up their keys to help victims recover from their attacks.</p>
<p>Of course, it remains to be seen whether Ragnarok&#8217;s disappearance is permanent, or whether it will simply rebrand; the infamous DoppelPayment ransomware gang recently reappeared as Grief Ransomware after months of no activity.</p>
<p>“Even though I am sure is only temporary, it is nice to see another win,” <a href="https://twitter.com/uuallan/status/1431075394023792641">tweeted</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/uuallan">Allan Liska</a>, from Recorded Future’s Computer Security Incident Response Team.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Flip mixes a live commerce mobile app with real customer reviews to improve the buying experience and opportunity for the creator economy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Social commerce startup <a href="http://www.flip.shop">Flip</a> is mixing live commerce mobile apps with real customer reviews to improve the buying experience and opportunity for the creator economy. Today, the Los Angeles-based company closed on a $28 million Series A led Streamlined Ventures.</p>
<p>Nooruldeen “Noor” Agha, a serial e-commerce entrepreneur, founded Flip in 2019 after emigrating to the United States from Iraq. He had previously lived in Dubai, where he built some companies in the e-commerce space.</p>
<p>It was while leading the companies that he realized that the vision of commerce was broken and that people had a fragmented path to purchase: They may start on social media, then move to video platforms and conclude on yet another site to make the purchase.</p>
<p>Agha believes the future of e-commerce will be driven by shoppers and the experiences they have with social media, so Flip is pulling all of those experiences into one app, mixing in user-generated reviews and live shopping shows for beauty, wellness and health brands. It then adds same-day shipping and back-end logistics, Agha told TechCrunch. Users post video reviews of their purchases and can see in real-time data how they did, as well as receive commissions from sales that resulted from their posts.</p>
<p>“It’s not only a social platform, it is the best post-purchase experience — shipping, rewards, returns — everything people love and in a two-click process,” he added. “Our app is like if TikTok and Amazon had a baby.”</p>
<p>Joining Streamlined Ventures in the latest round is Mubadala Capital Ventures, BDMI and a group of early backers and angel investors, including Ruby Lu, an early investor in Kuaishou, China’s leading social commerce platform. In total, Flip raised $31.5 million, which includes a small seed two years ago, Agha said.</p>
<p>He intends to use the new funding to scale the company and its creator ecosystem, while also expanding the end-to-end logistics part of the platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Live commerce originated in China, where McKinsey estimates the market reached <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/its-showtime-how-live-commerce-is-transforming-the-shopping-experience">$171 billion in 2020</a> and will jump to a valuation of $423 billion by 2022. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinlarson/2021/03/27/retailers-embrace-livestreaming-market-expected-to-reach-11-billion-in-2021/?sh=5ce4f2d32fde">U.S. live commerce market</a> is trailing behind, expecting to reach $11 billion by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Flip is now signing an average of 20 new brands per week and has already gained partnerships with Unilever and Coty. Agha expects to hit 500 brands by this year’s holiday season. In addition, the company has 1 million downloads and in the last quarter shopped out 30,000 orders, which Agha predicts will double in coming months.</p>
<p>“We were hiding on purpose so we could build out everything and be done when we launched,” he added. “We focused on onboarding brands instead of pushing for growth, but now we expect to have a grand launch at the end of September where we start aggressively pushing growth.”</p>
<p>Ullas Naik, founder and general partner of Streamlined Ventures, said his firm does a lot of investment in e-commerce and marketplaces and was one of the first investors in DoorDash and also backed Rappi.</p>
<p>Commerce has evolved over the past 20 years in a meaningful way, he said. During that time, spend shifted from retail and online, while the quality of the experience has also evolved. He has seen evidence of similar models in other geographies, particularly in China when they have “had massive success.”</p>
<p>“We are most intrigued with how live commerce intersects with social networking to create enhanced shopping experiences,” Naik said. “When I met with Noor and he told me he was going to start with beauty and cosmetics, I thought he was building a unique experience and wanted him to be in a broad range of categories, not just beauty. With what he is building on the back end, with the logistics piece, he is creating a super experience and I’m intrigued by what can be built.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The mobile app provides tools for travel creators to build their own travel-based businesses in order to curate, share and soon sell interactive travel guides and planning services.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a difficult year, the <a href="https://www.ustravel.org/research/monthly-travel-data-report">travel industry is gaining steam</a> again this summer and <a href="https://www.thatch.co">Thatch</a> is carving out a space for itself in the sector by enabling travel creators to monetize their recommendations.</p>
<p>Today the company announced a $3 million Seed II round led by Wave Capital. They were joined by Freestyle VC’s Jenny Lefcourt and Netflix co-founder Marc Randolph. It brings Thatch’s total investment to $5.2 million since the company was founded by West Askew, Abby West and Shane Farmer in 2018.</p>
<p>Prior to the global pandemic, the company was a subscription-based consumer travel service that matched travelers with someone who would essentially plan their trips from top to bottom. Then the industry came to a grinding halt in 2020, and the co-founders saw a bigger need to help travel creators — those who share their experiences on social media — better connect to their followers and capture value for the travel recommendations, tips and perspectives they create.</p>
<p>“We noticed consumers were willing to pay individuals for their time and expertise,” Abby West told TechCrunch. “Increasingly, instead of going to travel agencies, they are going to Instagram or YouTube and then DM&#8217;ing them for information. We are formalizing that relationship so that the travel creator can get paid and can then provide a better experience for the end user.”</p>
<p>Askew and West say travel creators <a href="https://skift.com/2021/06/28/travels-creator-economy-is-poised-for-next-boom/">drive billions of dollars of consumer travel spending</a>. Thatch’s free mobile app provides tools for them to build their own travel-based businesses in order to curate, share and will soon be able to sell interactive travel guides and planning services. Thatch makes money when the creators do, taking a small percentage of the transactions.</p>
<p>While the pandemic was detrimental to the travel industry, it gave the Thatch team time to build out its app, and now it is focused on building the creator side and marketing to attract creators to the app. This is where the new funding will come in: The company intends to hire additional engineers, build out new content and launch new features for selling or earning tips on interactive guides that creators produce in the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195315" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195315" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2195315" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195315" class="wp-caption-text">Thatch app. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Thatch</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new tab)</span></p>
<p>Among the travel creators already using the app, their audience reach is over 12 million, and the company saw a bump in usage in July, a sign that the travel industry is improving, Askew said.</p>
<p>Following the seed, the company will go live with the monetization and booking features so the creators can get paid, and it is looking at a strong first quarter in terms of potential bookings. The founders also want to attract larger creators and build a network for them, with Askew saying they need to be considered like the small businesses that they are and wants to help them grow.</p>
<p>“There is unfortunately a graveyard full of travel companies, but we are doing things differently,” West said. “We are unique with our people-to-people angle, and in this case, with people who have a built-in audience and who are trusted by that audience. That is something we don&#8217;t see in this space today.”</p>
<p>Wave Capital’s general partner Riley Newman said he and his other general partner, Sara Adler, both former Airbnb executives, were introduced to the company through one of Thatch’s existing investors.</p>
<p>His firm typically invests in marketplaces at the seed stage and the investment in Thatch marks the first into the travel sector, saying, “It is one we know well from Airbnb and a good moment to dive back into the industry.”</p>
<p>The travel market is poised for growth in the years ahead, especially with the pent-up demand for travel post-pandemic, Newman said. At the same time, the creator economy is on the same trajectory to democratize travel planning similar to the way he said Airbnb did, and that was a compelling vision for Wave Capital.</p>
<p>“Travel planning has been around for a long time, but this is an interesting new angle,” Newman added. “We look at the founding team and see Abby and West having complementary backgrounds and energy. This is a good moment for travel given their approach, and their concept for attacking the market is right and needed.”</p>

The desktop Xayn WebBeta is described as a &#8220;light web version&#8221; of the product with similar functionality [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://www.xayn.com/">Xayn</a>, which as we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/xayn-is-privacy-safe-personalized-mobile-web-search-powered-by-on-device-ais/">reported last year</a> is doing ad-free, personalized, privacy-safe search as an alternative to tracking and profiling adtech giants like Google, has expanded its product offering &#8212; launching a desktop version (in beta for now).</p>
<p>The desktop Xayn WebBeta is described as a &#8220;light web version&#8221; of the product with similar functionality to the mobile app &#8212; though of course there are differences, such as not being able to literally swipe on content to signal interest/disinterest, as you do on Xayn&#8217;s mobile apps.</p>
<p>Xayn isn&#8217;t a browser itself, per se, though it&#8217;s crossing the streams a bit (and can self-describe as a &#8220;browsing engine&#8221;) &#8212; since, as well as private search, it also offers an in-app browsing experience by populating a feed with snippets of content organized in the form of a discovery/news feed.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll likely notice a short lag on loading the software in a desktop browser (also true on mobile) as Xayn&#8217;s AI figures out what to populate this feed with. It seems marginally longer the first time you fire the software up &#8212; when it&#8217;s starting from scratch (localizing the content to your country) vs repeat visits when the AI will have your individual browsing signals to work with.</p>
<p>On the desktop Xayn, you can signal a like or dislike on a particular piece of content by hovering the mouse next to the green (to like) or pink (to dislike) bar, which appear on the left and right sides of the content box respectively, and then clicking on the up (or down) thumb icon that pops up. So it&#8217;s actually a left click to like.</p>
<p>And if you really don&#8217;t need another feed in your online life you can switch off the discovery view &#8212; and have only a search bar on loading.</p>
<p>Search results are displayed by default in a similar grid of rectangular content panes to the discovery feed. Which is a little lacking in information density for this information worker&#8230;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2194910" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194910" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2194910" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="439" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png 2442w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png?resize=768,496 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png?resize=680,439 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png?resize=1536,991 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png?resize=2048,1322 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194910" class="wp-caption-text">Sample search result page as seen on Xayn&#8217;s WebBeta version (Screengrab: Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>Xayn&#8217;s learning AI can be toggled off whenever you like, by clicking on the brain icon in the top right. Say if you want to browse &#8216;unwatched&#8217; &#8212; i.e. without the stuff you&#8217;re looking at being used as learning material for the AI to decide what else you&#8217;ll get shown (both for content in the feed and search results).</p>
<p>You can also reset the learning manually by clearing your browsing data &#8212; if you want to purge the whole thing and start again.</p>
<p>Another carrot to entice users is no ads: Xayn is ad-free &#8212; which of course isn&#8217;t the case with other non-tracking private search engines (like DuckDuckGo or Qwant), which tend to rely on showing contextual ads.</p>
<p>And in another break from the search industry &#8216;norm&#8217;, its AI&#8217;s search algorithms are <a href="https://github.com/xaynetwork/xayn_ai">open source</a>.</p>
<p>Other features available on the desktop version of Xayn include a &#8216;deep search&#8217; offering that it says lets users dive into a topic via &#8220;a simple click to be shown a personal reference library of relevant content&#8221;; and &#8216;collections&#8217; &#8212; a bookmark-like offering which lets users &#8220;collect and store their favorite web content by creating, filling, and managing collections&#8221;.</p>
<p>Plus, as well as being ad-free itself, Xayn has baked in an ad blocker &#8212; blocking ads on third party sites for a &#8220;noise-free&#8221; browsing experience as it puts it.</p>
<p>Its first focus for the desktop is Chromium-based browsers and Firefox &#8212; so Safari users will need to switch to a supported browser to kick the tyres of its WebBeta.</p>
<p>The mobile version of Xayn&#8217;s product launched back in December and has been downloaded more than 250,000 times worldwide since then, according to the startup.</p>
<p>Three months after launch it says users were already conducting 100,000+ active daily searches &#8212; feeding in the browsing data and interest-based swipes that the AI uses to train and improve the personalized content discovery which is core to Xayn&#8217;s value proposition. And because it&#8217;s doing all this learning and reranking on device it&#8217;s able to tout its user-specific search results as &#8216;privacy safe&#8217;.</p>
<p>It also tries to avoid a filter bubble type effect by consciously injecting variance &#8212; so its algorithms don&#8217;t always just feed users more of the same.</p>
<p>Both the desktop and mobile version of Xayn use a technique called Masked Federated Learning to tailor the user&#8217;s web experience without compromising their privacy.</p>
<p>Google is also of course working on evolving its own ad targeting technology &#8212; currently it&#8217;s piloting a technology called FloCs (aka &#8216;federated learning of cohorts&#8217;) to put browser users in interest buckets for ad targeting purposes, as it works on deprecating tracking cookies. But its core business remains people profiling and selling your attention to advertisers &#8212; something Xayn definitely isn&#8217;t doing.</p>
<p>“We started Xayn as a direct response to the false privacy vs convenience dilemma and quickly proved that it’s possible to solve this trade-off so users are no longer losers. In fact, with each update, our fantastic team of engineers and designers demonstrates all over again how privacy, quality, and great UX go hand in hand,” said Leif-Nissen Lundbæk, co-Founder and CEO, in a statement.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to copy what&#8217;s already out there but instead re-think it and create something new. With Xayn, you can find your favorite part of the Internet &#8212; either by actively searching the web or by browsing through the discovery feed that offers personalized content suggestions from the entire Internet. Either way, your privacy is always protected.”</p>
<p>“In creating Xayn’s web version, we have taken all the elements that made the app great and adapted them to the desktop browser window,” added Julia Hintz, its head of design, in another statement.</p>
<p>“The privacy-protecting algorithms, the intuitive design, and the smooth animations have found their way into the web version. Users can switch effortless between mobile and desktop without leaving their familiar environment. This is key for the seamless, deep interaction experience that makes Xayn special.”</p>
<p>In the web version of the product, Xayn says users&#8217; personal data stays privately within the browser.</p>
<p>Asked about the security of the desktop product, a spokesperson told us: &#8220;Desktop computers are less safe than smartphones in general. However, Xayn protects personal data by using decentralized privacy-preserving machine learning in combination with encryption. From the pure technical point of view, Xayn is actually a browser within a browser on a desktop device. On desktop devices, Xayn runs in a sandbox in the respective browsers and this is how it protects personal data from unwanted third-party access.”</p>
<p>Future features Xayn plans to add includes the ability for mobile and desktop users to synchronize their personalized experience across multiple devices, while keeping their privacy intact, so the AI’s learnings can go with them wherever they&#8217;re online.</p>
<p>To check out the WebBeta version of Xayn&#8217;s search engine on your desktop computer point your browser at <a href="https://www.xayn.com">www.xayn.com</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/privacy-oriented-search-app-xayn-raises-12m-from-japanese-backers-to-go-into-devices/">Earlier this summer</a>, Xayn announced a $12 million Series A funding round led by the Japanese investors Global Brain and Japanese telco KDDI, along with participation from prior backers including Berlin&#8217;s Earlybird VC &#8212; bringing its total financing to $23M+. Unsurprisingly, then, Asia (starting with Japan) is now a big focus for the Berlin startup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China’s National Press and Publication Administration has <a href="http://www.nppa.gov.cn/nppa/contents/279/98792.shtml">released a notice</a> imposing limits on online gaming for minors. On September 1st, video game companies will have to restrict gaming time to three hours a week — from 8 PM to 9 PM on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>With this new set of restrictions, Chinese authorities want to tackle addition to online games. According to the National Press and Publication Administration, online gaming has an impact on both the physical and mental health of minors.</p>
<p>In order to implement those time limits, game companies will have to leverage a real name-based registration system. In 2018, Tencent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/tencent-to-tighten-age-verification-checks-for-gamers-amid-government-crackdown/">started using this system</a> to limit playtime on Honor of Kings, a widely popular mobile game.</p>
<p>Back then, limits weren’t as strict though as children up to aged 12 could play one hour per day, and up to two hours per day for children between 13 and 18. At the time, authorities were concerned about worsening myopia among minors.</p>
<p>During the signup flow, users have to go through an ID verification system, which means that you can only have one account associated with your real name. Regulators will regularly check whether gaming companies comply with local regulation.</p>
<p>It’s going to be interesting to see how the new rules affect video games as a whole. Online gaming is mentioned specifically, which could mean that solo games won’t be restricted going forward. Similarly, it’s unclear whether console games and foreign games will have to implement the new real name-based registration system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some young gamers will also be tempted to circumvent the restrictions by signing up on a foreign server. It’s also worth noting that adult players will still be able to play 24/7.</p>
<p>Following the news, Tencent has <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/bwz0NBjj9vqKjBTMsi-W9A">issued a statement</a>. “Tencent expressed its strong support and will make every effort to implement the relevant requirements of the Notice as soon as possible,” the company says.</p>
<p>As Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-30/china-limits-minors-to-just-three-hours-of-online-gaming-a-week">noticed</a>, NetEase <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NTES/">shares</a> are currently down 8% compared to yesterday’s closing price. NetEase is another popular Chinese game development company and its activities aren’t as diversified as Tencent’s activities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">HAAS Alert, a SaaS company that provides real-time automotive collision prevention for public safety and roadway fleets, has raised $5 million in seed funding that the company says it will use to scale sales and outreach efforts and prioritize R&amp;D with vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2X) technology partnerships.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was led by R^2 and Blu Ventures and joined by TechNexus, Stacked Capital, Urban Us, Techstars, Ride Ventures and Gramercy Fund.</span></p>
<p>HAAS Alert relies on cellular-based sensors to ingest roadway hazard data from the environment surrounding a vehicle and its predictive technology to digitally alert drivers through their vehicle systems. HAAS Alert&#8217;s proprietary digital alerting system, Safety Cloud, can be found on a range of fleet vehicles in the public and private sector, from fire trucks, ambulances and police vehicles to tow trucks, construction and waste vehicles, school buses and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Emergency responders, towing operators, construction and work zone crews and similar municipal fleets have extremely high death and injury rates from collisions,&#8221; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy Agulnek, HAAS Alert&#8217;s senior vice president of connected vehicle, told TechCrunch</span>. &#8220;They also really form the backbone of our communities, and every driver encounters them on the road daily. Many of these jobs are inherently risky to begin with, and yet struck-by incidents still rank as a leading cause of death for all of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>HAAS Alert sees advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and V2X as the solution, so it built its service to start with those at the highest risk on our roads, and grow from there.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us, this is not about using connected vehicles for entertainment and general connectivity – it is specifically about safety,&#8221; said <span style="font-weight: 400;">Agulnek</span>. &#8220;By connecting and protecting these folks, we can immediately bring a connected vehicle experience to all drivers and infrastructure in a way that also makes communities safer. We think that solving for safety with first responders and roadway workers is the most critical component to advancing mobility to the next stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, Safety Cloud is present on vehicles in more than 750 public agencies and private organizations that have sent more than 1 billion alerts collectively.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>HAAS Alert represents a growing number of startups looking to leverage V2X technology to reduce the risk of collisions, and funding is a big piece of the puzzle. Not only does the software cost money to build and keep updated, but the hardware and human-power costs associated with installing sensors, both on public infrastructure and within vehicles, aren&#8217;t cheap. HAAS Alert hopes to reach 10 billion driver safety alerts by 2022, and to do that, it&#8217;ll need to attract the automotive sector. Currently, the company works mainly with fleets, but it says the more fleets that are on its platform, the more automotive customers it will attract and vice versa.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We charge reasonable fees for fleet and agency customers to activate their roadway assets on Safety Cloud, and we charge a subscription fee to automotive customers to license the safety alerts, software and other services we provide,&#8221; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Agulnek said</span>.</span></p>
<p>The company says it&#8217;s actively installing its HA-5 Transponder hardware on vehicles across the nation, which allows equipped vehicles to automatically send digital alerts to approaching drivers when emergency fleets activate their flashing lights. These alerts give road users a heads up to the existence of response personnel on or near the roadway, giving drivers time to slow down or move over.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agulnek says the hardware setup is quick and easy with minimal downtime, but fleets also have the option of integrating Safety Cloud without hardware via the vehicle&#8217;s existing CAD, GPS or telematics system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All that is needed to add Safety Cloud alerts to a vehicle is a software update to receive data via the vehicle’s existing telematics capabilities and display driver alerts in the infotainment screen and/or instrument cluster,&#8221; Agulnek said. &#8220;We are working on a project right now with a car manufacturer where it took less than a week to implement alerts inside their vehicles.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Computations are done either in the cloud or on the edge of the chips inside the hardware, which means the alerting logic can reside in HAAS Alert&#8217;s cloud, in a vehicle OEM&#8217;s cloud, in the vehicle&#8217;s head unit or a hybrid multi-location architecture, according to Agulnek.</p>
<p>A fleet management platform, the Situational Awareness Dashboard, comes standard with the Safety Cloud and is designed to enable coordinating agencies across jurisdictions to work together. HAAS Alert also includes potential add-ons for specific industries. For example, responder-to-responder (R2R) features a set of lights attached inside a vehicle that sends notifications to responders when other Safety Cloud-equipped vehicles are in active response mode and approaching the same intersection. FleetFusion allows customers to integrate real-time data from Safety Cloud into internal dashboards, third-party applications and traffic management centers.</p>
