										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union&#8217;s chief privacy and data protection regulator has urged EU policymakers to strengthen proposed &#8216;transparency&#8217; rules for political ads &#8212; calling instead for meaningful limits that would fully ban microtargeting for political purposes.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal to regulate political ads, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/eu-political-ads-transparency-proposal/">last fall</a>, fell very far short of that &#8212; offering what this publication characterized at the time as a very &#8220;tepid&#8221; set of political ads transparency rules, riddled with loopholes which election fiddlers and propaganda muck-spreaders would find all too easy to exploit.</p>
<p>It seems the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), Wojciech Wiewiórowski, takes a similar view, recommending in an <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/system/files/2022-01/edps_opinion_political_ads_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opinion (PDF)</a> yesterday &#8212; after the usual courtesies welcoming the &#8220;overarching aims&#8221; of the Commission proposal &#8212; that the regulation needs to be strengthened and that it should include &#8220;a full ban on microtargeting for political purposes&#8221;.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260565" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Political communication is essential for citizens, political parties and candidates in order to fully participate in democratic life. To preserve our democracy, we also need strong rules to combat disinformation, voter manipulation and interferences with our elections. We need to do more if we want to tackle the many risks surrounding the use of targeting and amplification techniques for political purposes,” he said in a statement accompanying his opinion.</p>
<p>The EDPS&#8217; call for a ban on political microtargeting is not a great surprise as Wiewiórowski has previously called for EU lawmakers to ban behavioral advertising entirely.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/eus-top-privacy-regulator-urges-ban-on-surveillance-based-ad-targeting/">February last year</a> he warned that transparency measures may not be enough to prevent the myriad manipulative harms linked to microtargeting (such as discrimination; the exploitation of vulnerable or protected people and groups; the amplification of hate and fraud; and election interference, to name a few).</p>
<p>In his opinion on political ads now he argues that the case for a ban here is even stronger.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The existing business models behind many online services have contributed to increased political and idealogical polarisation, disinformation and manipulation. Targeted advertising and amplification mechanisms have been instrumental in provoking such harms,&#8221; he argues, adding: &#8220;The EDPS considers his recommendations about online targeted advertising are even more valid in the political context, having in mind its potential negative impact on the integrity of democracy and its representative institutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Targeted advertising can be used to unduly influence individuals when it comes to political discourse and democratic electoral processes,&#8221; Wiewiórowski continues. &#8220;While &#8216;traditional&#8217; offline political campaigning intends to influence voters&#8217; behavior via message that are generally available and retrievable (verifiable), the targeted advertising makes it possible to target individual voters as well as group with tailored messages, specific to the particular needs, interests and values of the target audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPS concurs with the Commission&#8217;s conclusion that such practices have specific detrimental effects on citizens&#8217; fundamental rights and freedoms, including their freedoms of opinion and of information, to make political decisions and exercise their voting rights. Moreover, he is convinced that they present increasing risks not only for the fundamental rights of individuals, but also for society as a whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>He goes on to warn that use of personal data allows for different groups of voters or individuals to be segmented and &#8220;characteristics or vulnerabilities exploited&#8221; &#8212; such as by serving an ad at a particular moment in time or a place when a person or group may be more sensitive to the messaging.</p>
<p>And of course democratic accountability and oversight over political messaging when, in the case of ads delivered via microtargeting platforms like Facebook, there may be <em>literally hundreds of thousands</em> (or more) permutations of marketing, tweaked and tailored to specific individuals, is simply not realistic.</p>
<p>To be clear, when the EDPS talks about targeted ads, he&#8217;s specifically concerned about the use of personal data for microtargeting &#8212; and how such data may be analyzed to infer characteristics (or otherwise derive information) about individuals which is then used to selectively target that person with messages judged to be most likely to have the desired impact &#8212; so his call for a ban on political microtargeting is not a call for a blanket ban on being able to target political ads.</p>
<p>(Contextual advertising, for example, which does not rely on processing individuals&#8217; personal data to determine which ad to show &#8212; and where targeting is based on a general location, say, or limited to certain (non-sensitive) search keywords &#8212; seems unlikely to invoke the same suite of concerns.)</p>
<p>As well as calling for a full ban on political microtargeting, the EDPS wants to see further restrictions on the categories of data that can be processed for political targeting under the proposed law.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal did suggest some limits on the personal data that can be used for political targeting &#8212; focused on so called &#8220;special category&#8221; data, which refers to personal data considered the most sensitive (such as health data, political or religious affiliation, ethnic or racial origin, sexuality and so on).</p>
<p>However the EDPS wants the provision strengthened &#8212; pointing out that the Commission&#8217;s suggested limitations include two gaping exceptions which essentially make the claimed limits worthless (as TechCrunch also pointed out in our analysis <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/eu-political-ads-transparency-proposal/">last year</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPS considers that, in practical terms, Article 12 of the Proposal does not appear to offer any additional protection in comparison to existing Union legislation on data protection,&#8221; writes Wiewiórowski in a particularly awkward line of assessment for the Commission.</p>
<p>He goes further, too &#8212; essentially saying it&#8217;s unlikely that political microtargeting that makes use of such sensitive personal data would have a valid legal basis under EU data protection law (so, er, legally you probably can&#8217;t do that anyway) &#8212; with Wiewiórowski pointing out that current cookie consent practices are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/edps-decision-european-parliament-covid-19-test-website/">hardly renowned as paragons of compliance</a>&#8230;</p>

<p>He also highlights &#8220;the growing use of complex and often opaque algorithms&#8221; &#8212; and AI &#8212; being used for ad profiling and targeting, asserting that: &#8220;[I]t is questionable to what extent the consent of the citizen will actually be sufficiently and meaningfully informed&#8221;.</p>
<p>He also adds: <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;More fundamentally, however, the EDPS questions whether practices which have been identified by the Proposal of having specific detrimental effects should be allowed at all to take place and whether the individual&#8217;s consent would be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In short, this is a very polite &#8212; but very firm &#8212; slapdown to the Commission&#8217;s whole approach (and its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6118">trumpeting</a> of an &#8220;ambitious&#8221; proposal &#8212; which it claimed last year would usher in &#8220;strict conditions&#8221; and &#8220;secur[e] the use of personal data in context of political targeting, protecting the democratic process&#8221;)<em>. </em></span></p>
<p>In essence, the bloc&#8217;s chief data protection supervisor is saying the proposal will do none of the things claimed in the Commission&#8217;s PR.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>The Commission was contacted for a response to the EDPS&#8217; opinion. At the time of writing it had not responded &#8212; but we&#8217;ll update this report if we get a comment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fair to say that the EU&#8217;s executive is not a fan banning very much when it comes to problematic digital practices.</p>
<p>A proposal to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">regulate AI </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">introduced by the Commission last year did</a> &#8212; unusually &#8212; propose some outright bans on certain use-cases. However <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/eu-ai-act-civil-society-recommendations/">civil society has warned</a> the text added so many limitations, dilutions and exceptions to the suggested prohibitions it&#8217;s hard to see how they would have a meaningful effect on limiting harms.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s AI Act falls far short on protecting fundamental rights, civil society groups warn&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/eu-ai-act-civil-society-recommendations/embed/#?secret=DPSrTP00di" data-secret="DPSrTP00di" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When it comes to microtargeting, the Commission evidently also isn&#8217;t at all keen on a ban.</p>
<p>Indeed, a number of commissioners &#8212; including EVP Margrethe Vestager &#8212; have been straight-up parroting the adtech industry talking points on the topic in recent months (per <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/139843">Politico</a>), seemingly in a bid to influence the European Parliament&#8217;s negotiating position on the legislation to prevent MEPs adding restrictions on adtech business as usual. (Not very successfully, however &#8212; given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/meps-vote-to-limit-tracking/">MEPs just gave a thumbs up to some major limits on tracking ads</a>.)</p>
<p>Tracking industry lobbyists with links to the adtech duopoly &#8212; who of course have the most to lose if surveillance advertising actually gets banned &#8212; have argued that the survival of small businesses is dependent upon Internet users giving up their privacy en masse in order that everyone can be profiled and targeted cheaply enough to spark joy for SMEs&#8217; marketing budgets.</p>
<p>Vestager appears to have made a similar point to a European Parliament committee last November &#8212; apparently favoring transparency and user friendly controls &#8212; aka, exactly the sort of measures adtech lobbyists like to suggest to try to fend off meaningful regulation &#8212; rather than anything more substantial measures. Such as the EDPS&#8217; recommended outright ban.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Still, the Commission as a whole, and Vestager too, evidently sees the need for political ads to have different rules vs commercial marketing &#8212; so at least for there to be a <em>perception</em> that political ads are being dealt with more strictly in the EU.</p>
<p>In practice, though, their proposal looks closer to delivering yet more tedious and exhausting regulatory theatre than meaningful limits on serious harms. EU citizens should not be impressed.</p>
<p>While adtech lobbying to defend privacy-hostile microtargeting continues to try to chainlink the mass tracking, profiling and behavioral targeting of Internet users to the economic survival of SMEs, a YouGov survey earlier this month (via <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/french-and-german-smes-oppose-tracking-based-ads-survey-finds/">Euractiv</a>) offers a very different perspective &#8212; finding a majority of French and German SMEs actually oppose microtargeting yet feel they have no choice but to use these ad tools given the market dominance of Facebook and Google.</p>
<p>So not exactly a ringing endorsement of creepy ads from (some) European SMEs.</p>
<p>Vestager &#8212; who remains the bloc&#8217;s competition chief &#8212; has made it clear for years that she&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/dont-break-up-big-tech-regulate-data-access-says-eu-antitrust-chief/">not a fan of boosting competition by breaking up Big Tech</a>, which could be one way to ensure SMEs have a better choice of ad tools.</p>
<p>Nor indeed is she a fan of blocking Big Tech M&amp;As which may further entrench  dominance &#8212; preferring behavioral remedies, and/or regulation, rather than stronger intervention to restore competitive balance to tipped markets.</p>
<p>Such as the ten year ban on Google using Fitbit heath data for advertising &#8212; which was one of the &#8220;commitments&#8221; Vestager accepted to waive through that particular acquisition back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/">2020</a>.</p>
<p>Adtech has been a particular Vestager blindspot &#8212; as the Commission only opened a formal probe of Google&#8217;s adtech stack <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">last summer</a>, lagging way behind complaints and investigations across multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<p>When it comes to Big (ad)Tech&#8217;s market power, the Commission EVP has championed a package of ex ante rules as the best way to clean up abusive practices &#8212; aka the Digital Markets Act, which is fast making its way through the EU&#8217;s co-legislative process. Although here too MEPs have found her approach lacking &#8212; since the parliament <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/">voted for restrictions on microtargeting to be added into that law</a> too.</p>
<p>The Commission is duty bound to listen to the other EU institutions as it draws up regulatory proposals. So how long it can keep sticking its fingers in its ears on the need to reform adtech is an interesting question to ponder.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company designed its product offerings to connect all of the moving pieces related to booking residential and commercial service work.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Six weeks after buying a new refrigerator, Anand Subbaraj found himself on the phone with customer service to address strange noises coming from the appliance. Technicians would arrive only to not have the right parts or know how to fix that particular appliance. It ultimately took six calls to customer service and eight weeks for the refrigerator to get fixed.</p>
<p>That experience got Subbaraj, who spent 14 years at Microsoft helping larger organizations improve their businesses, thinking on how he could apply that to help global brands offer better customer experiences.</p>
<p>“When I looked into it, I found that the experience was not connected at all, and technicians were not empowered to perform their job, nor could provide the on-demand experience because they lacked the tools, solutions and integrations,” he told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260400" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In 2016, he started Seattle-based <a href="https://zuper.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zuper</a>, a provider of productivity tools for intelligent field service management and customer engagement. Today, the company announced $13 million in Series A, led by FUSE, with participation from Sequoia Capital India and existing investors Prime Venture Partners and HubSpot. This latest round gives Zuper $14.1 million in total funding raised to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company designed its product offerings to connect all of the moving pieces related to booking residential and commercial service work: integrations for things like CRM, payroll and APIs, and features including booking tools so the right technician’s skills are tapped and all of the job information is at the technician’s fingertips so they have everything they need, from the beginning, to perform the service. A bonus is the ability to tell customers their technician’s estimated time of arrival.</p>
<p>All of this was designed so jobs are completed the right way the first time, Subbaraj said. As a result, organizations using Zuper save, on average, at least 20 hours per week, per user and improve customer satisfaction by more than 50%, he added.</p>
<p>The new funding follows explosive growth by Zuper over the past 12 months that included global traction and an annualized recurring revenue growth of seven times year over year. It achieved 140% net revenue retention, onboarded more than 100 new customers across North America, Asia and Europe and tripled the size of its team to 55 employees.</p>
<p>In addition, Zuper added over 250 new features and completed 18 new integrations with organizations, including Salesforce, Oracle Netsuite and QuickBooks. Also in 2021, the company supported more than 3 million work orders and 15 million scheduled hours of work and facilitated over $20 million of transactions through the platform.</p>

<p>Subbaraj plans to invest the new funding in product leadership innovation in workflows, location intelligence, dispatching, marketing and sales. He also looks to double Zuper’s headcount this year and expand its partner ecosystem.</p>
<p>With over 5 million technicians working in these kinds of service businesses, Subbaraj estimates there is a $1.1 trillion opportunity to inject some technology into this industry. He is not alone in that thinking; for example, we have reported on other companies announcing new venture capital as they develop similar technologies.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/fuzey-takes-in-4-5m-to-charge-up-its-management-tools-for-service-based-businesses/">Fuzey</a> raised $4.5 million in seed funding for its “digital one-stop shop” for small businesses and independent contractors, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/puls-technologies-on-demand-home-repair-service/">Puls Technologies </a>raised $15 million for its mobile app connecting tradespeople with on-demand home repair services. There are also larger companies in the space, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/jobber-raises-60m-as-its-platform-for-home-service-professionals-hits-100k-users/">Jobber</a>, which announced $60 million in funding.</p>
<p>“Since 2020, $420 billion was spent on home improvement and repairs as people spent more time at home, increasing the demand for skilled tradespeople,” Subbaraj said. “This has caused a tailwind for home and commercial services, and multiple players can be here. We are seeing players coming in with different things to offer the right tools.”</p>
<p>Kellan Carter, general partner at FUSE, also said via a written statement that Zuper was bringing digital technology to a field service industry traditionally slow to adopt it.</p>
<p>“The company’s product market fit coupled with a strong executive team has enabled Zuper to become a category-leading field service software provider with global scale, customer-driven growth and a robust ecosystem of partners across the entire service management tech stack,” he added. “We see significant opportunities for Zuper to continue delivering tangible ROI for its customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dublin-based <a href="https://www.exergyn.com/">Exergyn</a> replaces refrigerants with solid materials, thus reducing the output of greenhouse gases. The technology could be applicable in data centers.</p>
<p>The industrial-grade cleantech company has now raised a $35 million (€30 million) Series A round led by Mercuria, an energy and commodities company, and Lacerta Partners, a family office-backed fund. Also participating was Prague-based private equity and venture capital firm McWin.</p>
<p>Exergyn has a product called a solid-state shape memory alloy (SMA) which it claims could lower carbon emissions in industries such as heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, refrigeration (HVACR), automotive, and aerospace. The HVACR industry accounts for more than 10 percent of the global CO2 emissions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259804" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These SMAs contract and relax as they absorb and release heat, doing away with refrigerants.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.unep.org/ozonaction/who-we-are/about-montreal-protocol">Montreal Protocol</a>, the number one solution to global warming is to remove gases that have global warming potential.</p>
<p>In terms of competitors, the University of Maryland, or the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia are looking at the space but commercial entities operating in the same space are thin. Magnetocaloric is like an expensive cousin of SMA, but it is generally considered too expensive. </p>
<p>Commenting on the Series A announcement, Co-Founder and Managing Director Dr. Kevin O&#8217;Toole said:<br />
&#8220;By joining forces with thought leaders such as Mercuria, Lacerta, and McWin, we can expand our offering into multiple new and exciting verticals.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking about the investment, David Haughie, Managing Director at Mercuria noted: &#8220;Mercuria’s ambition is for these SMAs to negate the need for refrigerants in traditional sectors such as the cooling and refrigeration industry, allowing even more cost-efficient operation, with zero HFC-driven impact on the environment.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ahead of the company’s upcoming earnings, Peloton CEO John Foley took a break from a “quiet period” to address a number of reports related to poor device sales. The executive issued a denial that the company is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/peloton-reportedly-pauses-bike-and-treadmill-production-amid-slowed-demand/">halting production across its entire bicycle and treadmill line</a> as demand for the devices has begun to crater amid gym re-openings.</p>
<p>Under the heading, “Rumors that we are halting all production of bikes and Treads are false,” Foley writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]e’ve found ourselves in the middle of a once-in-a-hundred year event with the COVID-19 pandemic, and what we anticipated would happen over the course of three years happened in months during 2020, and into 2021.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260521" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We worked quickly and diligently to meet the demand head-on at a time when the world really needed us, in large part thanks to how hard you worked every day. We feel good about right-sizing our production, and, as we evolve to more seasonal demand curves, we are resetting our production levels for sustainable growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a separate statement tied to preliminary earnings, Foley states:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we discussed last quarter, we are taking significant corrective actions to improve our profitability outlook and optimize our costs across the company. This includes gross margin improvements, moving to a more variable cost structure, and identifying reductions in our operating expenses as we build a more focused Peloton moving forward.</p></blockquote>
<p>He adds that the firm expects to share more information around the moves when Peloton reports its earnings on February 8. Those actions included “right-sizing” production, in response to decreased demand – though the executive was careful to push back on reporting that production on all four of its bicycle/treadmill devices will halt for weeks or months outright.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Foley also acknowledged reports of restructuring and layoffs, following a report from consulting firm, McKinsey. “In the past, we’ve said layoffs would be the absolute last lever we would ever hope to pull,” he writes. “However, we now need to evaluate our organization structure and size of our team, with the utmost care and compassion. And we are still in the process of considering all options as part of our efforts to make our business more flexible.”</p>
<p>Such reports have been seen as confirmation that Peloton overplayed its hand amid increased adoption during the aforementioned “once-in-a-hundred year event.” The news comes after the company experienced a 76% drop in shares last year, following an astronomical rise in 2020, on the strength of pandemic demand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite producing global hits like &#8220;Squid Game&#8221; in 2021, Netflix&#8217;s <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/FINAL-Q4-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">fourth quarter returns</a> show the streaming giant struggling to maintain a lead over its competitors. The company fell short of its projections for new subscribers this quarter, adding 8.3 million as opposed to its projected 8.5 million &#8212; it also projects to add just 2.5 million subscribers in Q1 2022, down from 4 million last year (the company says this is because it has &#8220;a more back-end weighted content slate&#8221; for the quarter). Overall, this year marks a downward trend in subscriber growth &#8212; its the company&#8217;s lowest growth year <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/netflix-subscriber-forecast-misses-estimates-sending-stock-down?sref=gni836kR">since 2015</a> and about a 50% decrease from its pandemic-inflated 2020 numbers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Consumers have always had many choices when it comes to their entertainment time &#8212; competition that has only intensified over the last 24 months as entertainment companies all around the world develop their own streaming offering,&#8221; the company wrote in its <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/FINAL-Q4-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">letter to shareholders</a>, admitting that &#8220;competition may be affecting [its] marginal growth some.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260504" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While Netflix has about 222 million total subscribers, larger conglomerates like Disney (which also owns Hulu and ESPN) have continued to expand at a more aggressive pace. Disney ended 2021 with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/disneys-streaming-biz-reorg-includes-an-international-content-hub-plans-to-double-disney-footprint/">179 million total subscribers</a> across Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+, and it plans to double the number of countries that Disney+ is available in by fiscal 2023. Disney also announced the creation of an International Content and Operations group to expand its direct-to-consumer streaming internationally. HBO Max is growing too &#8212; the company said that <a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/1027633/and-just-like-that-sex-lives-of-college-girls-ratings-hbo-max/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December had been its most-viewed month</a> since the service’s launch in May 2020.</p>

<p>Netflix announced last week that it plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/netflix-raised-its-prices-again/">raise subscription prices</a> in the US and Canada, while in India, the platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/struggling-to-win-subscribers-netflix-cuts-prices-in-india/?cx_testId=6&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_undefined&amp;cx_artPos=2#cxrecs_s">lowered its prices</a> to try to attract more consumers after six rocky years in the massive entertainment market. Netflix is also experimenting with another new revenue stream: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/netflixs-gaming-service-adds-three-more-titles-globally-on-ios-and-android/">gaming</a>. The company recently acquired the gaming studio <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-acquires-its-first-games-studio-oxenfree-developer-night-school/">Night School</a> and has developed games based on its own IP, like the hit show &#8220;Stranger Things.&#8221; If this week&#8217;s biggest tech stories tell us anything, it&#8217;s that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-acquire-activision-blizzard/">gaming can be very lucrative</a>. As expected, Netflix says it will expand its portfolio of games in 2022.</p>
<p>Another new avenue for Netflix to grow its subscriber base lies in content marketing &#8212; the company launched a website called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/netflix-launches-a-website-dedicated-to-news-about-renewals-exclusive-interviews-and-more/">Tudum</a> last month, hiring entertainment journalists and editors from publications like Allure, Vanity Fair and Bitch Media to share exclusive content about Netflix originals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">While global tech and finance leaders have <a href="https://real-leaders.com/billionaire-investor-the-worlds-first-trillionaire-will-be-someone-fighting-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that the world’s first trillionaire will be someone tackling climate change and that many climate <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-next-1000-unicorns-will-be-in-climate-tech.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unicorns</a> are on the way, current VC levels are dwarfed by the mind-boggling funding amounts that are needed to give humanity a fighting chance.</p>
<p>As of October, climate-tech startups had <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/26/dealroom-climate-tech-start-ups-have-raised-32-billion-this-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> over $32 billion in 2021 and, <a href="https://qz.com/2079657/us-climate-startups-got-most-vc-funding-since-paris-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Dealroom and London &amp; Co</a>., U.S. VCs invested nearly $50 billion in climate-tech companies between 2020 and 2021. However, depending on whom you talk to, the climate finance <a href="http://gggi.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mind-the-Gap_web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gap</a> currently sits at $2.5 trillion to 4.8 trillion.</p>
<p>To put this gap into perspective, total global VC funding (across all sectors, including climate) in 2021 was at an <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-unicorns-2021-monthly-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> $643 billion, and most countries in the world, aside from a handful, have a <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDP_RPCH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD/HND" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDP</a> under $4 trillion. Additionally, a sharp uptick in the number of climate funds and startups has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2021/10/31/will-this-generation-of-climate-tech-be-different/?sh=5934f0f34a62" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some</a> experts worrying about the potential of a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robday/2021/01/27/were-already-in-the-second-cleantech-bubble/?sh=d94ae797fc2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bubble</a>, and doubters may argue that traditional VC investment strategies are too risky to make a meaningful contribution to addressing climate change.</p>
<p>So where precisely do VCs factor into global efforts to address climate change? Indeed, a vast portion of the investments will be allocated toward infrastructure investments, as well as emergency funding, which will not yield venture-like returns. By the same token, new policies and national programs will be spearheaded by governments, and as conditions worsen in certain countries, foreign aid agencies will be crucial players.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we won’t be looking to VCs to write billion-dollar checks, create new policy incentives, or provide shelter and food to populations in need. However, VC funds and their investment strategies and networks have unique features that give them an important position in these global efforts.</p>
<p>Below we outline five key areas where we believe VCs can play a role in addressing climate change:</p>

<h2>Backing and de-risking proven climate technologies</h2>
<p>Venture capital has a vital role to play in de-risking climate technologies, which can help bring costs down, accelerate adoption rates and transform markets to enable a decarbonized future. Any hope of addressing the climate crisis requires helping entrepreneurs to mitigate technology risks and scale their innovations quickly and cost-effectively.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p><!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! --></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 20, 2022! Today’s theme is <em>more</em>. Sure, the creator economy grew last year, but this year more major platforms are working to help power individual artists. And sure, last year was one of the best for crypto startups, but now even more big companies are getting into the mix. Oh and Peloton is having a terrible day. Let’s talk about it! – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260431" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>P.S. Early Stage is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/techcrunch-early-stage-2022-is-back-live-in-san-francisco/">back in San Francisco this year</a>, so <em>see you there!</em></p>
<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/peloton-reportedly-pauses-bike-and-treadmill-production-amid-slowed-demand/">Peloton reportedly halts production</a>: Remember when you couldn’t buy a Peloton bike because there wasn’t enough supply? The company is having the opposite issue now, with more supply than demand. Shares of the 2019 IPO were down sharply today. It appears clear that the pandemic trade, once a key influencer of corporate value, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/the-pandemic-trade-is-over/">is over</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/twitter-blue-subscription-users-are-first-gain-access-to-a-new-nft-profile-picture-feature/">Twitter rolls out NFT support</a>: If you’re a member of Twitter’s subscription service, you will soon have the ability to connect a crypto wallet and use an NFT that you own as your profile picture. This is going to make some of you happy and some of you angry. Regardless of what you think of the news, that Twitter took the time to build the feature is indicative of where the market is likely heading this year. Speaking of which, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/facebook-and-instagram-may-help-you-create-and-sell-nfts/">Facebook and Instagram are apparently also getting into the NFT game</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/plaid-buys-cognito-to-bolster-its-feature-set-as-it-moves-beyond-simply-connecting-accounts/">Plaid buys Cognito</a>: After the huge Plaid-Visa deal fell through over regulatory hurdles, the fintech API company has been busy. It raised more money, pushed its valuation above $13 billion, and has since been busy building and buying other companies. Today’s news is that the company bought Cognito for around a quarter billion dollars to layer more services atop its core API business.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Startups/VC</strong></h2>
<p>Before the news deluge, a few notes. First, <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna Heim</a> wrote something lovely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/dont-underestimate-first-time-founders/">about first-time founders</a> and how market fetishization of serial founders could be leading to new entrepreneurs not getting their due. Given that a number of recent unicorns were founded by new builders instead of those going around the block for the second, third or 10th time, she may be onto something.</p>
<p>And after dodging drops in startup investment, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/changes-to-corporate-investing-rules-could-diminish-chinas-resilient-venture-landscape/">the Chinese venture capital market could be facing new stress</a>. Perhaps this time, really, we’ll see the declines that many anticipated.</p>
<p>And now, the newsroll:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/berlins-cherry-ventures-launches-fourth-fund-at-340m-for-early-stage-tech-and-web3/">Cherry Ventures lands $340M</a>: The German venture capital firm with an interest in early-stage tech has new capital for its third fund. It also invests in blockchain tech, Mike Butcher reports. With prior funds, the group put capital into Flink and SellerX, among other startups.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/2fa-compromise-led-to-34m-crypto-com-hack/">How the Crypto.com hack went down</a>: It turns out it was a 2FA compromise that caused the heavily advertised cryptocurrency firm to lose customer funds and temporarily halt withdrawals. This sort of hack might seem, well, standard at this point in time, but it’s still not? It’s still very bad? And perhaps even surprising given that bitcoin was first discussed back in 2008. I wonder what Matt Damon thinks.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/tbd-launch/">Sexual health is a growth industry</a>: That’s our lesson from our writeup of TBD Health, which provides “ a fresh new approach with at-home [STI] testing made available for vagina-havers.” It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/25/infinite-revenue-multiples/">reminds me of Juna</a>, which means that the at-home STI testing market has a neat competitive landscape to track.</li>
<li>Remember no-code? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/prophecy-raises-25m-for-its-low-code-data-engineering-platform/">It’s everywhere again</a>. When TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/softrs-series-a-is-a-reminder-that-the-no-code-boom-continues/">covered the Softr round the other day</a>, we asked internally what had happened to all the no-code rounds. Well, here they are. Today it’s Prophecy raising $25 million for its “low-code data engineering platform.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/weavits-new-app-wants-to-be-a-shazam-for-your-thoughts/">Shazam for your thoughts</a>: Startup Weavit wants to “offer people a different way to quickly capture their thoughts in a note-taking tool with the press of a button, which are then matched to other content in a broader knowledge base” TechCrunch writes. Does the world need another note-taking tool? Apparently, the answer is yes. I kid, my brain is a colander with extra-large holes; I need all the help I can get.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/codesee-pulls-in-a-7m-secondary-seed-to-build-out-code-visualization-platform/">CodeSee does what it says on the tin</a>: There’s a startup in the market called CodeSee. What does it do? Help you <em>see</em> your <em>code</em>. Hell yeah obvious startup names. In this case, code visualization is the name of the game. Why does that matter? As Ron Miller explains, it helps folks see how code fits together. Given that my C++ never compiled I am not one to talk, but this does seem like a pretty neat idea.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/south-koreas-agtech-startup-greenlabs-raises-140m-series-c-to-accelerate-global-expansion/">Green Labs raises $140M</a>: Perhaps we need to hire a few agtech reporters. The space really does seem to be heating up. (Just like the planet! Heyo!) The company has now raised a total of $170 million for its digital services for the farming world, including, we write, “an app that aggregates reliable data using AI, giving more than 500,000 farmers insight into crop lifecycle.” Farming is hard, so 1.5 cheers for food growers getting new tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>And to close us out, quantum computing. Very much akin to self-driving cars, quantum computing has always felt a little <em>not quite yet</em>. And yet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/terra-quantum-raises-60m-for-its-quantum-as-a-service-platform/">Terra Quantum, a Swiss company, is now offering quantum as a service in the market</a>. Yes, you can access early quantum systems. I suppose our real question is when mainstreamization will occur. Terra, we bet, would answer that with a “soon.”</p>

<p>Whether it’s done informally via a Reddit AMA or a Twitter Space, it’s never a bad idea to directly engage with the people who use your products and services.</p>
<p>Customer personas are useful, but talking to a customer is better if you want to understand what delights them — and what they’re willing to pay for.</p>
<p>With a product advisory council (PAC), early-stage startups can tap into their customers’ hive mind. The benefits are many: PACs can validate everything from marketing campaigns to future product planning.</p>
<p>But to build one, founders must first define clear goals and create value for participants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A major Senate bill that would prevent tech companies from giving preference to their own products and services just passed a significant hurdle in Congress, bringing it one step closer to becoming law.</p>
<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee voted today on the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2992/text"> American Innovation and Choice Online Act,</a> moving the prominent antitrust bill toward a vote before the full Senate. The bill passed its committee vote 16-6 Thursday, with five Republicans joining Senate Democrats to press forward with the legislation.</p>
<p>The bill would prohibit tech platforms from &#8220;favoring their own products or services, disadvantaging rivals, or discriminating among businesses that use their platforms in a manner that would materially harm competition on the platform.&#8221; It would also forbid dominant platforms from preventing interoperability with other services and from leveraging another company&#8217;s data on the platform to compete against them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260496" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To accomplish its goals, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act would empower antitrust enforcers with &#8220;strong, flexible tools,&#8221; including &#8220;civil penalties, authority to seek broad injunctions, emergency interim relief, and potential forfeiture of executive compensation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights, hailed the legislation as the first major tech competition bill to head toward the Senate floor “since the dawn of the internet.” The bill could still see changes from a handful of amendments that didn&#8217;t impede its progress Thursday but may still impact its final language.</p>
<p>While it still has an uphill slog to make it into a crowded and mostly stalled out legislative agenda, the bill&#8217;s momentum was significant enough to prompt Google and Apple to both weigh in with comments earlier this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every day, millions of Americans use online services like Google Search, Maps and Gmail to find new information and get things done,” Alphabet Global Affairs President and Chief Legal Officer Kent Walker <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/the-harmful-consequences-of-congresss-anti-tech-bills/">wrote in a blog post</a>. &#8220;&#8230;Legislation being debated in the House and Senate could break these and other popular online services, making them less helpful and less secure, and damaging American competitiveness.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple also sought to intervene,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-18/apple-tells-senate-that-big-tech-bills-will-harm-iphone-privacy"> penning a letter</a> to Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin, the committee’s ranking Republican Chuck Grassley as well as Antitrust Subcommittee Chair Amy Klobuchar that subcommittee’s ranking member Mike Lee.</p>
<p>“After a tumultuous year that witnessed multiple controversies regarding social media, whistle-blower allegations of long-ignored risks to children, and ransomware attacks that hobbled critical infrastructure, it would be ironic if Congress responds by making it much harder to protect the privacy and security of Americans’ personal devices,” Apple Senior Director of Government Affairs Tim Powderly wrote. “Unfortunately, that is what these bills would do.”</p>
<p>Both companies argued that the bill along with another piece of legislation, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/open-app-markets-act-app-stores-apple-google/">Open App Markets Act</a>, would be a detriment to consumer security. The latter bill would force companies that control operating systems to allow third-party apps and app stores and allow developers to tell consumers where they could find the same software at better prices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Findings from the United States and governments around the world reveal the many anticompetitive self-preferencing tactics dominant technology companies use to attain and entrench their gatekeeper status in the market to the detriment of competition, consumers, and innovation,&#8221; the companies wrote. &#8220;The American Innovation and Choice Online Act&#8230; targets self-preferencing to help restore competition in the digital marketplace and remove barriers for consumers to choose the services they want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regulating the tech industry is a rare issue that inspires bipartisan cooperation in Congress — another sign that the tech industry should expect new restrictions on its business, even if those proposals still progress at a crawl.</p>
<p>The bill was introduced by by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and is co-sponsored by Dick Durbin (D-IL), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), John Kennedy (R-LA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Mark Warner (D-VA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Steve Daines (R-MT).</p>
<p>The House version of the bill, led by House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David N. Cicilline (D-RI) and Ranking Member Ken Buck (R-CO), is already out of committee and ready for a vote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last summer, Samsung announced that – for the first time in a decade – it wouldn’t be releasing a new Note. The future of the well-loved phablet was a big, open question, as the hardware giant acknowledged a shift in focus to foldables, a form factor it felt was finally ready for a truly mainstream push.</p>
<p>Further muddying the waters is the Galaxy S line – Samsung’s primary flagship, which has steadily been blurring the line separating itself from the Note. “Instead of unveiling a new Galaxy Note this time around,” the company’s president wrote at the time, “we will further broaden beloved Note features to more Samsung Galaxy devices.”</p>
<p>That’s meant a fairly steady increase in the S series’ screen sizes over the years, culminating with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/samsungs-galaxy-s21-line-arrives-with-camera-bumps-price-drops-and-s-pen-compatibility/">addition of S-Pen functionality for the S21 Ultra last January</a>. In August, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/samsungs-latest-galaxy-fold-adds-stylus-support-waterproofing-and-an-underdisplay-camera/">also brought its proprietary stylus to the Galaxy Fold line</a> leaving some wondering whether the Note was quietly being phased out.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260480" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Coming fresh off CES and staring down the face of MWC, we find ourselves entering Unpacked territory – the time of year when the company announces the latest additions to the S series. Roh is back with another somewhat vaguely worded post that celebrates the life of the Note’s life, pointing out how its 5.3-inch display caused a minor stir back in 2011. It seems quaint now, though it’s worth pointing out for those who weren’t at the IFA unveiling, that big screens meant much larger and thicker devices than they do now.</p>
<p><a href="https://smsng.news/3566pVH.">The post</a> strongly suggests a proper merging of the two flagships to make more room for its foldables.</p>
<p>“With every fresh evolution of Samsung Galaxy devices, we have introduced features that redefine the entire mobile category,” the executive writes. “And we’re about to rewrite the rules of industry once again. At Unpacked in February 2022, we’ll introduce you to the most <strong>noteworthy</strong> S series [emphasis added by TC] device we’ve ever created. The next generation of Galaxy S is here, bringing together the greatest experiences of our Samsung Galaxy into one ultimate device.”</p>
<p>“Noteworthy” could mean a lot of things in this context. The most obvious seems to be an S22 Ultra becoming the S22 Note. Does that mean a proper stylus slot? Could we be seeing further S Pen integration across the lines? I&#8217;d say most likely not to that one, if only because the carefully worded post uses the singular &#8220;noteworthy device.&#8221; There are still some big questions in the lead up to the event – which may or may not be answered early, given the frequency of leaks surrounding these devices. Also on-tap for the line are improved night/low-light photos and a more sustainable design, which has become a priority for the company in recent years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Samsung is once again betting that consumer excitement and brand loyalty will be enough to get users on-board, sight unseen as it gets set to open reservations for the new smartphone and an unnamed Galaxy tablet tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Music streaming is continuing to grow around the world. According to a new <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/music-subscriber-market-shares-q2-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report from MIDiA</a>, an entertainment research firm, 523.9 million people subscribed to a music streaming service globally as of the second quarter of 2021. This marks a 109.5 million (26.4%) increase since the previous year.</p>
<p>Though Spotify remains the most-subscribed streaming service, owning 31% of the market, its dominance is very slowly decreasing &#8212; it held 33% of the market in 2020, and 34% in 2019. Spotify added more total subscribers in the year leading up to Q2 2021 than its competitors, but while Spotify grew by 20%, Amazon Music grew by 25%. Meanwhile, Google&#8217;s YouTube Music grew by more than 50% over the year leading up to Q2 2021, making it the only Western streamer to have increased its overall share of the global market. The Chinese gaming giant Tencent, which operates Tencent Music, owns the same percent market share as Amazon Music.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260393" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260393" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2260393 size-large" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover_image-1642508252.jpg?w=680" alt="A pie chart showing the percent market share of music streamers: Spotify has 31%, Apple Music 15%, Amazon Music has 13%, Tencent has 13%, and Youtube Music has 8%." width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover_image-1642508252.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover_image-1642508252.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover_image-1642508252.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover_image-1642508252.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover_image-1642508252.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover_image-1642508252.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover_image-1642508252.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260393" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MIDiA</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260337" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The market share of Amazon Music and Apple Music may continue to grow &#8212; because this report only covers up to Q2 2021, it won&#8217;t show the impact of lossless audio coming to both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/amazon-makes-its-its-lossless-music-streaming-service-a-free-upgrade/">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/">Apple</a> in May. Nearly a year ago, Spotify teased that it would launch a high-end subscription called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/">Spotify Hi-Fi</a>, which would give subscribers their music in a &#8220;CD-quality, lossless audio format.&#8221; But Spotify <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/All-Platforms-Music-HiFi-Quality-Lossless-Streaming-16bit-44/idi-p/700006" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still hasn&#8217;t said</a> when this product might become available.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s Tidal, which has historically targeted consumers who seek a higher-quality audio experience. Though Tidal&#8217;s lossless audio tier is $9.99 per month &#8212; the same cost as Apple Music, and just two dollars a month more than Amazon Music &#8212; Tidal owns less than 2% of global market share, according to MIDiA&#8217;s report. Founded by Jay-Z and later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/square-buys-majority-of-tidal-adds-jay-z-to-its-board-in-bid-to-shake-up-the-artist-economy/">acquired</a> by Block, Tidal markets itself as a service that helps artists share their music &#8220;precisely as the artist intended&#8221; (i.e. with extremely good audio quality).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260463" style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260463" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2260463 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png?w=336" alt="Tidal fan centered royalties interface" width="336" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png 1746w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png?resize=768,1553 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png?resize=336,680 336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png?resize=760,1536 760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png?resize=1013,2048 1013w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260463" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Tidal</p></div></p>
<p>But under Block&#8217;s ownership, the idea of an artist-friendly streaming service isn&#8217;t just about sound &#8212; now, the company is experimenting with ways to make music streaming more profitable for artists. At the start of this year, Tidal introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/tidal-is-investing-direct-artist-payments-a-step-toward-fair-streaming-payouts/">fan-centered royalties</a> to its top HiFi Plus tier ($19.99/month), which means that 10% of a user&#8217;s subscription will go directly to their most-listened-to artists.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Will this move help Tidal earn new subscribers who care about paying artists more than master-quality audio? It&#8217;s a worthy try &#8212; after all, the user-centric payment streamer Deezer has a full 2% of the pie, which is more than Tidal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://foundationcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foundation Capital</a>, an early-stage venture firm with offices in Palo Alto and San Francisco, has been around for 27 years, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/09/foundation-capital-now-24-years-old-just-closed-its-ninth-fund-with-350-million-in-capital-commitments/">many iterations</a>. It has been sprawling, it has been small, it has thrived, it has teetered.</p>
<p>In 2022, it&#8217;s in expansion mode once again. Three years after closing its ninth fund with $350 million in capital commitments with three general partners, the firm is announcing that it has secured $500 million for its tenth flagship fund. It now has six general partners, having promoted two of its investors to general partner and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/foundation-capital-hires-rhode-island-based-angus-davis-as-its-newest-partner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired</a> former founder Angus Davis. And it has a lot of deals in its portfolio that undoubtedly continue to excite its investors.</p>
<p>Among these is the fast-growing NFT marketplace OpenSea, the buzzy public blockchain platform Solana (Foundation was its first institutional investor) and Cohesity, a data management vendor that confidentially filed to go public last month and is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/softbank-backed-cohesity-files-confidentially-for-ipo?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> seeking a valuation of between $5 billion and $10 billion. (For context, Cohesity was valued by its private investors last March at $3.7 billion.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260203" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>How to explain Foundation&#8217;s rebound? Strong connections to founders and their various networks would seem to explain part of it. It&#8217;s a benefit enjoyed by any firm that has been around the block a few times and treated people well en route.</p>
<p>Foundation has also more aggressively embraced the unknown, moving away from metrics and toward individuals who haven’t started a company yet but are on the cusp of making the jump. These might be operators inside big companies, or founders returning to the startup arena, or teams preparing to spin out of academia. As explains Ashu Garg, who joined Foundation in 2008 and is now one of its longest-serving general partners, “Our goal is to have a handshake deal with someone as they&#8217;re ready to start the company. That&#8217;s the business that we&#8217;re in. There is no company. <em>That</em> is our business model.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Joanne Chen just became the first woman GP at Foundation Capital since founder Kathryn Gould&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/joanne-chen/embed/#?secret=CY0tgdP5Nm" data-secret="CY0tgdP5Nm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It almost sounds comical. But it&#8217;s no joke. Given the amount of capital in the market today &#8212; all of it driving valuations sky high for even fledgling companies &#8212; Foundation is joined by a growing number of venture firms that now zero in on individuals rather than wait on actual products or teams to form. As VC Mark Suster of Upfront Ventures in LA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/vc-mark-suster-the-bet-were-making-now-is-on-founder-skills-not-customers-or-products/">recently told us</a> of his own team, &#8220;We’ll even take a risk on you want to leave your company . . . We will back you at formation — at day zero.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Part of Foundation&#8217;s go-earlier strategy centers on incubating companies. Some of the startups to rise up inside of Foundation in recent years include Cerebras, an AI chip and system startup company that was valued at more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-10/artificial-intelligence-chip-startup-nabs-4-billion-valuation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4 billion</a> in a November round; the digital title, escrow and closing company Doma (formerly States Title), which went public last year after merging with a blank-check company (it has been a <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/doma-goes-public-but-investors-cash-out-early/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bumpy ride</a> since); and Turing, an outfit that helps source, vet and connect developers with tech companies that need them, and which raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/turing-books-87m-at-a-1-1b-valuation-to-help-source-hire-and-manage-engineers-remotely/">$87 million</a> in Series D funding last month.</p>
<p>Foundation, like other firms, is also plugging more money not just into startups but emerging venture firms that give it access to new networks and ideas. Steve Vassallo, another longtime general partner at the firm, says it has committed roughly $15 million in recent years into at least 53 different venture outfits that serve as &#8220;beacons&#8221; for Foundation deals.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YU2b847Hhj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/bvc_fund_nine/">Bain Capital Ventures raised $1.3 billion to fund young startups, and young VC firms, too</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bain Capital Ventures raised $1.3 billion to fund young startups, and young VC firms, too&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/bvc_fund_nine/embed/#?secret=YU2b847Hhj" data-secret="YU2b847Hhj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Not last, Foundation has evolved the way that it learns what&#8217;s bubbling up. Joanne Chen, a longtime member of the team who was promoted to general partner last year and is very focused on artificial intelligence, engages with VPs of engineering and technical founders who share ideas through Slack communities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the firm has partners who spend 10 hours a day trying to figure out which projects on GitHub are taking off,&#8221; says Vassallo. The team &#8212; which is very focused on the &#8220;automation of the enterprise&#8221; and fintech &#8212; is also spending far more time these days in Discord channels. &#8220;That&#8217;s for sure where our crypto team is,&#8221; says Vassallo, adding that &#8220;it&#8217;s not a fabulous platform, but it&#8217;s the best of what exists&#8221; for those hunting down web3 and DeFi deals.</p>
<p>If Foundation feels pressured to become even more inventive in this go-go market, it isn&#8217;t admitting as much.</p>
<p>Asked about crazy acts that Foundation has either seen or committed to land a deal, Vassallo says he is aware of &#8220;extensive love letters&#8221; that certain Foundation portfolio companies have received between financings, but he says his partners are content for now to walk and talk with founders around Stanford&#8217;s campus or <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/the-floating-utopia-of-salesforce-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salesforce Park</a> in downtown San Francisco.</p>
<p>Garg echoes the sentiment, saying that he thinks &#8220;some of the crazier things folks are doing to get the attention of founders will be tempered as markets settle down a little bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>He insists that Foundation would never engage in such antics either way. &#8220;We&#8217;re talking with founders before they&#8217;ve changed their LinkedIn. If we&#8217;re talking with someone at the same time as Tiger [Global], then we&#8217;ve failed.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been pretty astonishing to see what robotics researchers have been able to accomplish with legged robots over the past few years. Oregon State University taking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/cassie-the-bipedal-robot-runs-a-5k/">Cassie for a 5K back in July springs to mind</a>. This week researchers at ETH Zurich announced that they were stretching their own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/the-anymal-inspection-robot-gives-spot-some-four-legged-competition/">ANYmal robot’s</a> physical capabilities in similar fashion by <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2022/01/how-robots-learn-to-hike.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">training it climb a nearby mountain</a>.</p>
<p>The team trained the quadruped (which bears more than a passing resemblance to Boston Dynamics’ work) to walk up nearby Mount Etzel, a modest summit that stands some 1,098 meters (3,600 feet) above sea level. The team says the robot was able to make the 120 vertical meter hike in 31 minutes &#8212; a full four minutes faster than is standard for human hikers. Doubly impressive is that the robot apparently accomplished the task without stumbling or mis-stepping &#8212; more than a lot of humans can probably say.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0e40Umfnl_w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260382" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Researchers say the feat was accomplished by way of a control scheme recently highlighted in a scientific journal that combines imaging with tactile feedback. The pairing makes it easier for the robot to operate on uneven terrain and in low visbility &#8212; both frequent issues while hiking. Based on the feedback, the robot determines, among other things, how cautiously it needs to make its steps. The tech was initially tried in a virtual environment before the quadruped went up the mountain.</p>
<p>“The robot has learned to combine visual perception of its environment with proprioception – its sense of touch – based on direct leg contact,” lead researcher Marco Hutter says in a release. “This allows it to tackle rough terrain faster, more efficiently and, above all, more robustly,” Hutter says. In the future, ANYmal can be used anywhere that is too dangerous for humans or too impassable for other robots.</p>
<p>The ability to maintain steady footing on uneven terrain is a key feature roboticists have been working to develop in quadrupeds. Utilizing such real-time processing could ultimately prove useful for robots sent into dangerous situations to keep humans out of harm’s way.</p>

		Frederik Mijnhardt is the CEO of <a href="http://secfi.com/">Secfi</a>, an equity planning platform for startup executives and employees.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Last year set a new record for public exits, with more than 844 U.S. companies going public via an initial public offering (IPO), a direct listing, or through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). That’s 105% higher than 2020, which saw 410 similar companies go public, according to PitchBook.</p>
<p>The 20 largest U.S. IPOs generated an estimated $41 billion in pre-tax value for employees who held stock options in those companies.</p>
<p>Record public exit activity is good news for founders and investors, but what about the employees who were granted stock options in those companies?</p>
<p>We dove into our proprietary data as well as publicly available data filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to uncover defining trends for employees from late-stage unicorns in 2021.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of what we found:</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Employees could have paid less in taxes by exercising their stock options before their company went public.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2021, startup employees paid an estimated $11 billion in avoidable taxes by exercising their stock options post-exit, rather than pre-exit.</li>
<li>On average, Secfi clients paid $543,254 in 2021 to exercise their pre-exit stock options (roughly double their annual household income), with taxes accounting for 73% of the cost.</li>
<li>Employees at companies that went public in 2021 saved nearly $415,000, on average, by exercising before an IPO.</li>
<li>Pre-exit stock option exercise rates vary widely from company to company, from as little as 2.4% on the low end to more than 77% on the high end, which could represent an indication of employee confidence in their company.</li>
</ul>
<h2>$11 billion in unnecessary taxes paid in 2021</h2>
<p>In 2021, employees working at VC-backed U.S. startups that went public paid an estimated $11 billion in extra taxes because they waited to exercise their stock options post-exit, per a Secfi estimate of 172 U.S.-based, VC-backed public exits.</p>
<p>Employees could have paid less in taxes by exercising their stock options before their company went public. Doing so could have also maximized their gains when selling their shares. In 2021, high stock option exercise costs remained a major barrier to people exercising their stock options early.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sexual health isn&#8217;t the taboo it once was, but that doesn&#8217;t mean everything is all roses and unicorns in the land of STI testing. <a href="https://www.tbd.health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TBD Health</a> is taking a fresh new approach with at-home testing made available for vagina-havers. The company has been offering <a href="https://www.tbd.health/products/the-5-panel-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a five-panel &#8220;check yourself out&#8221; kit for at-home testing</a>, and recently opened an in-person clinic in Las Vegas. I spoke to the two co-founders to find out why there&#8217;s a need for at-home sexual health services.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/prevalence-incidence-cost-2020.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STI rates in the United States have continued to climb over the last several years</a>, reaching a sixth consecutive all-time high per data reported in 2021. One in five people in the U.S. has an STI, half of them among young people aged 15-24, costing $16 billion in direct medical costs. Suffice to say, TBD is going after a market that ought to be shrinking, but isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized that access to screening is key, and people have less access today than they did before. This is in part because of COVID &#8212; people don&#8217;t want to go to the doctor&#8217;s office &#8212; and a lot of federal funding has made it trickier. We built this company to provide empowering STI screening that really works in people&#8217;s routines, starting with our at-home kit. We took a very different approach to how most other medical companies do, so it doesn&#8217;t feel clinical or high-stakes,&#8221; shares Stephanie Estey, co-founder at TBD Health. &#8220;We really wanted to make a screening feel as though it was on your terms. We launched a pilot earlier this year in six states.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252611" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TBD Health&#8217;s at-home testing services are available in Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Massachusetts, Florida and Connecticut &#8212; and the company is planning to roll out to more states, but there are regulatory challenges on the path to full 50-state coverage.</p>
<p>&#8220;If someone tests positive, we can provide treatment for almost everything. Our clinician will set up a time to talk to you about your personalized care plan &#8212; it&#8217;s not an ananonymous &#8216;here&#8217;s a generic care plan you need to follow to go figure it out with your provider&#8217;. For the most part, the vast majority of infections, the ones that require antibiotics, for instance, is something that we can get you that prescription to make sure that you have treatment,&#8221; explains Estey. Of course, the clinician requirement means that the team needs a home base in every state in which they operate. &#8220;We do have a medical team in each state, so you have a clinician reviewing all the results, signing off on the lab request and then processing results or doing the prescribing. Right now it&#8217;s, we&#8217;re in six states, but we are expanding quickly in 2022.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company suggests that they can test for all the same STIs that your usual doctor could test for, but relies on a self-collection protocol. There&#8217;s a self-collect vaginal swab, a urine sample and a blood sample. The latter, in particular, piqued my interest, as my mind went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">venipuncture draws</a> &#8212; but it turns out that it&#8217;s possible to do a finger-prick test, let some blood fall on a collection card, which then can be used by the team to run the assays and determine if treatment is required.</p>
<p>&#8220;We use what&#8217;s known as a dried blood spot card. It&#8217;s basically a piece of paper that has a few circles that you saturate with your blood using a finger prick lancet &#8212; similar to what diabetics do on a daily basis to test themselves. Through this card, we can test you for all major blood-based STIs, including HIV, syphilis. It&#8217;s actually kind of an incredible tool; I think it was developed for testing babies in hospitals because it&#8217;s hard to do draws on a baby,&#8221; explains Estey. &#8220;It lends itself really well to at-home testing because it stays stable throughout transport.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2260292" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260292" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2260292" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2260292" class="wp-caption-text">The in-person clicic TBD Health opened in Las Vegas, with its at-home testing boxes on the wall in the background. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> TBD Health</p></div></p>
<p>The company claims it retains the accuracy of more traditional STI testing protocols.</p>
<p>&#8220;In lab testing there are two main metrics for accuracy, and that&#8217;s sensitivity and specificity, and so we did a lot of vetting of a lot of labs. Our lab partners have comparable sensitivity and specificity, and that means it&#8217;s just as accurate. And you can do it from the privacy of your own home,&#8221; says Estey. &#8220;You&#8217;re supported through telemedicine with our clinical care team.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to have in-person care, too, <a href="https://vegas.tbd.health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TBD opened a care hub in Las Vegas</a>, with the goal of creating an environment where the company can get a deeper view of the needs of its customers, with the hope of translating the learnings to better service for the other side of the business.</p>
<p>For now, the team is focusing on vagina-havers. The team tells me this is mostly because they carry not just the burden of STIs, but there&#8217;s also a fertility angle to consider. In order to give the best possible service, they&#8217;ve chosen to focus their attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really focused on serving women and vagina owners right now. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re ready to say where serving penis-owners falls on our roadmap. Penis-owners are absolutely a contributor in terms of transmissions. But for women, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the burden is not just in terms of cost and stigma, but also fertility in many cases. STIs are actually the number one preventable cause of infertility in the U.S.,&#8221; Estey points out. &#8220;When we think about expanding what our focus is, we want to make sure that we are serving those people correctly. There have been so many examples of companies that get it wrong. The equivalence would be to make something for women by turning it pink &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t work like that. I think TBD is really excited to be going deep because we know vagina owners so well and we know how to best serve them. When we think about offering something to penis owners, we want to make sure that we are being as thoughtful and as deep, so we are doing justice just as we have done that for people with vaginas.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Calling an event after it has happened is lazy newswriter cliche, but it is fair today to say that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/what-happens-to-high-flying-startups-if-the-pandemic-trade-flips/">the pandemic trade</a> is over.</p>
<p>The concept was pretty simple: As COVID-19 spread across the planet, lockdowns and a general desire by many to avoid infection led to huge changes to how people lived and worked. The impact was wide-reaching.</p>
<p>First, the stock market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/saas-stocks-drop-over-8-reaching-bear-market-territory/">did its best impression of a falling rock</a>, crashing lower and lower as fears about economic decline spread. Even the ever-ebullient venture capital class took a brief pause from normal levels of investing exuberance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But then folks realized that, yes, some businesses were going to suffer thanks to the new economic landscape that COVID brought, but not all. So they bid up the value of those assets above their perhaps fair value, as many other investments were risky. This made the value of some firms escalate into orbit.</p>
<p>Software, in particular, was a winner, with the valuations of tech companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/in-public-and-private-markets-cloud-earnings-and-valuations-heat-up/">rising sharply in the back half of 2020</a> through much of 2021. Then, as last year reached its final weeks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/the-era-of-ultra-rich-software-valuations-could-be-behind-us/">that began to change</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="U2H1I64PL8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/the-era-of-ultra-rich-software-valuations-could-be-behind-us/">The era of ultra-rich software valuations could be behind us</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The worth of publicly trade software companies fell sharply enough that, on the year, all gains for cloud firms were wiped out. The selloff continued into 2022, with further declines now cutting into software valuation gains from even 2020.</p>
<p>The pandemic trade for software is over, and valuations are coming back to Earth. The same thing is happening to other companies, including those who made a mint in the home exercise markets, like Peloton. The value of Peloton, which went public in 2019, shot higher and many people were very stoked.</p>
<p>But the shine has come off the silver:</p>

<p>Shares of Peloton are off around 20% today alone.</p>
<p>The pandemic trade was fun while it lasted. It lasts no more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If it’s possible for a first-time founder to build a billion-dollar company, why don’t we talk about it more often?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French payroll startup PayFit is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/payroll-startup-payfit-is-frances-latest-unicorn-as-it-raises-289-million/">now valued at $2.1 billion</a> after raising a $289 million Series E round. It&#8217;s not France&#8217;s only recent unicorn, though: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/ankorstore-reaches-2-billion-valuation-two-years-after-launching-its-wholesale-marketplace/">Ankorstore</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/business-banking-startup-qonto-raises-552-million-at-5-billion-valuation/">Qonto</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/16/warehouse-robotics-system-exotec-raises-335-million/">Exotec</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/17/spendesk-is-the-fifth-french-startup-to-reach-unicorn-status-this-month/">Spendesk</a> also joined the club this month.</p>
<p>If you add <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/back-market-reaches-5-7b-valuation-for-its-refurbished-device-marketplace/">Back Market</a>’s $510 million Series E round valuing the company at $5.7 billion, things are shaping up well for French tech in 2022.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the pace of new unicorn creation and fundraising generated plenty of press coverage in France, but there&#8217;s an article in particular that caught my attention: A <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/start-up/portraits/french-tech-ces-4-patrons-qui-ont-fonde-une-licorne-des-leur-coup-dessai-1377044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portrait</a> of PayFit&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/firmin-zocchetto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firmin Zocchetto</a>, OVHcloud&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/octave-klaba-3a0b3632/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Octave Klaba</a>, Shift Technology&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-jawish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeremy Jawish</a>, and Contentsquare&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathancherki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan Cherki</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260211" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As French financial newspaper Les Echos pointed out, these four French Tech founders have another thing in common: They founded a unicorn on the first try.</p>
<p>If it’s possible for a first-time founder to build a billion-dollar company, why don’t we talk about it more often?</p>
<p>Sure, entrepreneurs sometimes get press for being under 30, as Zocchetto is. But even 20-somethings aren&#8217;t always first-time founders – Glovo&#8217;s <a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/oscarpierremi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Pierre</a> isn&#8217;t, for instance.</p>
<p>This post isn&#8217;t about young founders. It&#8217;s about remembering that regardless of their age, first-time founders can build huge companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Weirdly, this seems underrated in the startup ecosystem. This fact reminded me of a funny outburst from Expensify CEO David Barrett when I first interviewed him for my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/">deep dive</a> into his company, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/expensify-david-barrett-ipo-day/">since gone public</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I think the whole idea of the serial entrepreneur is a weird concept. The only time there&#8217;s a &#8216;serial anything&#8217; is &#8216;serial killer.&#8217; </em></p>
<p><em>Imagine a &#8216;serial parent.&#8217; I find someone, I fall in love, I have a bunch of kids. And then I leave, and I do it all over again. And then I say I started seven families. You&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Man, you&#8217;re a monster.&#8221; But if you do that as a CEO, we celebrate that! &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s great, what a great job.&#8221; </em></p>
<p><em>There are so many weird incentives in Silicon Valley, and all the hero stories of Silicon Valley are wrapped up in this really morbid concept of serial entrepreneurs.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Expensify isn&#8217;t Barrett&#8217;s first startup, but as someone who set out to &#8220;build a company that [he] wanted to work at forever,&#8221; praise of the &#8220;serial founder&#8221; concept is a pet peeve of his. He has a point: There&#8217;s nothing wrong with long-term commitment, and there&#8217;s something inherently wrong about glamorizing serial entrepreneurs for the sake of it.</p>
<p>This is not to say that experience has no value, but that it comes in many forms. Having founded another company brings lessons, regardless of whether it succeeded or failed. However, it is perhaps equally valuable for a founder to have relevant industry experience, especially if it is directly related to the problem that they are tackling.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to VC checklists, years of industry experience at unsexy companies don&#8217;t tick a box in the same way as having had a C-level role at a former startup. This is especially true in places such as Latin America, where the market is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/like-the-us-a-two-tier-venture-capital-market-is-emerging-in-latin-america/">split into two tiers</a> – hot or not.</p>
<p>Latin American VC <a href="https://twitter.com/hernanharo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hernan Haro</a> confirmed my perception: &#8220;Most Latin American VCs are chasing the same entrepreneurs, those &#8216;proven&#8217; by a track record as founders or past leadership roles at unicorns. Granted, they are more successful at raising capital, but that&#8217;s more of a self-fulfilling prophecy than anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pattern matching is part of what VCs do, but when they are looking at the wrong signals, they are doing a disservice to themselves and to their LPs. &#8220;VCs looking only at &#8216;proven&#8217; founders are seeing correlation, not causality, and missing out on opportunities,&#8221; Haro said.</p>
<p>That VCs are missing out on opportunities doesn&#8217;t keep me awake at night. After all, it creates space for others, such as Haro&#8217;s seed fund <a href="https://mrpink.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MrPink</a>. My concern is with founders; out of the spotlight, first-time entrepreneurs might not be getting the resources they need.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are more and more resources available for founders in general – not just capital, but also helpful communities and content from trusted sources.</p>
<p>For instance, it is now possible to find online advice from leading venture funds on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/index-sequoia-and-canvas-investors-weigh-in-on-how-to-raise-your-first-dollars/">how to raise your first dollars</a> or to get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/hear-from-these-amazing-investors-and-founders-on-techcrunch-live-this-february/">pitch feedback</a> from one of their partners, when a few years ago it would mostly happen behind closed doors within top accelerators.</p>
<p>Quality online resources are particularly valuable for first-time founders, not just for the knowledge, but also as a reminder not to underestimate themselves. Experimenting and bootstrapping are also great ways to learn, and VCs who overlook this type of profile may come to regret it.</p>
<p>My prediction, though, is that competition for hot deals will push VCs to look beyond their turf and pay more attention to first-time entrepreneurs. Let&#8217;s just hope it&#8217;s not only young ones or those who tick other boxes (top accelerators, top schools, etc.) – but simply those who are capable of delivering high returns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’ve met with Misty’s founders a number of times over the years, often in hotel suites at CES where the company was showing off their humanoid robot’s latest capability. The firm started life in mid-2017, as a spinoff of Sphero, which was dealing with its own growing pains at the time, moving from entertaining robots with help from Disney IP to a purely educationally-focused firm.</p>
<p>The company began life under the Sphero banner, led by co-founder Ian Bernstein, coming out of stealth with an $11.5 million Series A led by Venrock and Foundry Group. The company launched an adorable little wheeled robot, designed to be, in part, a development platform for things like hospitality.</p>
<p>Misty’s journey will continue, but things are about to look different from the startup, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/16/furhat-buys-misty/">recently acquired by Swedish firm Furhat Robotics</a>. The latter says it will be keeping a number of Misty senior staff on-board as it looks to incorporate the technology into its own products.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259788" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“For us, Misty is the piece that was missing. It helps us access a larger market focusing on education, for example,” co-founder and CEO Samer Al Moubayed tells TechCrunch. “The technologies are very similar, but Misty is great at the hardware front, and we are very strong on software. Instead of building a new robot for educational use, Furhat decided to start looking for another solution.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259792" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259792" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2259792" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/yt1s.com-Misty-Robotics-is-now-part-of-the-Furhat-family.2022-01-19-17_52_53.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259792" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Furhat</p></div></p>
<p>Misty is, at the very least, immediately less jarring than Furhat’s rear-projected face. The company notes on its About Page, “Animated projection allows for smoother facial movements as opposed to mechatronic designs, meaning Furhat falls short of the Uncanny Valley effect that most people feel when seeing a robot that appears almost lifelike, but fails to mimic a realistic human.” Uncanny? Maybe not. Unnerving? A bit, yeah.</p>
<p>Anyone in the industry can tell you the importance of creating a kind of emotional bond with a robot. I’ve heard stories about everyone from Roomba owners to manufacturing floor workers sticking googly eyes on their robots to humanize them. Or take all of those viral Boston Dynamics videos of robots dancing to Motown and Katy Perry. It takes the edge off when we see these machines are more human or animal-like.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2209184" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209184" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2209184" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Astro-Home-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Astro-Home-2.jpg 5804w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Astro-Home-2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Astro-Home-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Astro-Home-2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Astro-Home-2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Astro-Home-2.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Astro-Home-2.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Astro-Home-2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209184" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/could-humanlike-behavior-make-smart-devices-more-engaging-mit-researchers-think-so/">A recent MIT Media Lab paper</a> confirms what we sort of already knew on that front. People respond better to machines when they display some of these characteristics. This particular study focused on smart speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Nest. Pitted against bygone social robot Jibo, researchers reported greater interaction when the machine does something as simple as pointing its head toward the speaker in the way a person or animal would.</p>
<p>Says MIT, “[P]arcipants interacted with a Jibo robot, Amazon Echo, and Google Home, with no modifications. Most found the Jibo to be far more outgoing, dependable, and sympathetic. Because the users perceived that Jibo had a more humanlike personality, they were more likely to interact with it, [research assistant Anastasia] Ostrowski explains.”</p>
<p>Of course, Amazon has taken a step in that direction with its home robot Astro, but the device’s $1,500 price tag makes it quite cost prohibitive. And while the company insists it&#8217;s taking the category seriously, we still feel a long ways away from any sort of mainstream success for an Astro, Jibo or Misty. Crossing that threshold is going to require a dramatic reduction in cost and increase in functionality that can make it feel more accessible and like less of a toy. In the meantime, education is a fairly practical path for Furhat/Misty, going forward.</p>

<p>There was a pair of big rounds courtesy of French robotics startups this week. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/16/warehouse-robotics-system-exotec-raises-335-million/">Exotec raised</a> a beefy $335 million Series D, which puts the firm’s valuation at $2 billion. The company deals in the familiar territory of warehouse automation, but takes a fairly novel approach to the category. That comes courtesy of its “Skypods,” which roll around autonomously and then climb up the side of a rack and pull down a bin. It’s an extremely clever solution, particularly in densely packed warehouses, as Romain notes in his piece.</p>
<p>“While the entire logistics sector is fraught with uncertainty, one of the most prevalent challenges is ongoing labor shortages,&#8221; CEO Romain Moulin said in a statement. &#8220;Exotec pioneers a new path: elegant collaboration between human and robot workers that delivers warehouse productivity in a lasting, far more sustainable way.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Parisian company Wandercraft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/french-robotic-exoskeleton-maker-eyes-us-expansion-courtesy-of-a-45m-series-c/">has announced a $45 million Series C</a>. The round comes as the company is eyeing international expansion to the U.S. for its mobility-focused robotic exoskeleton, Atalante. The company is entering a crowded market here that includes the likes of ReWalk Robotics, Ekso, SuitX and Sarcos. Though Wandercraft distinguishes itself somewhat by exclusively focusing on healthcare.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are super excited to have attracted world-class investors from the USA and Europe to advance the development program of the company,&#8221; CEO Matthieu Masselin said in a release. &#8220;With the support of patients, medical professionals and the DeepTech community, Wandercraft’s team has created a unique technology that improves rehabilitation care and will soon enable people in wheelchairs to regain autonomy and improve their everyday health.&#8221;</p>

<p>This week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/aigen-fund-round/">Aigen announced</a> a more humble $4 million seed round, though that comes with the much grander ambition of “terraform[ing] the Earth” apparently. That starts with solar-powered weeding robots that use computer vision to distinguish crops.</p>
<p>“My relatives are farmers in Minnesota, and I’ve been talking with them for quite some time. They’re really experiencing some trouble with traditional agriculture approaches,” CEO Richard Wurden tells TechCrunch. “Even the diehard people that love chemicals, that love tilling the earth and other practices that have been releasing carbon in the atmosphere for thousands of years are starting to realize, hey, maybe we should be open to other ways to do this. Right now, agriculture is about 16% of carbon emissions. In the future, it has the potential to go negative, by reducing diesel emissions, soil compaction, chemical usage and reducing tilling.”</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has rapidly increased the pace at which companies must evolve to serve their customers, but as the world goes digital, it has also become harder to anticipate changing needs.</p>
<p>In order to design, build and maintain a product that meets changing customer demands, companies need a mechanism that provides unbiased insights from people that represent them.</p>
<p>By design, product advisory councils (PACs) are an invaluable tool that can provide direct access to the expectations of your customers. Once established, a good PAC will provide valuable perspectives on how to solve problems for a broader, evolving market while putting a real face and name to your customer personas, helping your teams feel more connected and motivated to provide tangible value.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways a PAC can influence your business decisions, but most importantly, they will help you prioritize features that have the most value to your customers and help position those features using the same language your customers use. And they can inform future content development by uncovering opportunities you might not have thought to explore.</p>
<p>Here are seven steps to help you set up a PAC and the steps for implementing them:</p>
<h2>Define the goals of your PAC</h2>
<p>First and foremost, define and align your goals for the PAC. These should be unique to your business, taking into account your industry, customers and goals.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			It’s important to think about what you can offer the PAC members to keep them engaged considering your budget, time constraints and your team&#8217;s bandwidth. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>A good place to start is to ask yourself how you want to grow. For example, you might want to expand beyond your current target customer. To do that successfully, you’ll need to understand how your new customers think. What are their challenges? What are their motivations? What language do they use to describe their work? This will inform the features you want to have to meet the needs of your new customer, as well as how to position the product&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>In this case, one of the PAC&#8217;s goals should focus on defining and evolving your market opportunity. Clearly defined goals are crucial to helping you decide the kinds of people you want to be represented in the PAC. Consider demographics (age, gender, occupation, location, etc.) as well as psychographics (fears, motivations, influences, etc.).</p>
<p>We implemented a PAC with pretty straightforward goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remain close to our existing customer base to prioritize how our product and marketing should evolve.</li>
<li>Get better at overcoming barriers to purchase by increasing our understanding of buyers and how decisions are made.</li>
<li>Validate and broaden our understanding of our next growth market — the folks we plan on selling to in the future.</li>
</ol>
<p>At a high level, these goals are valuable because they serve as the inputs needed to inform our product development strategy in both the near and long terms, as well as how we can best communicate the value we want to deliver.</p>
<h2>Ensure there is a clear, real value for PAC members who participate</h2>
<p>It’s important to think about what you can offer the PAC members to keep them engaged considering your budget, time constraints and your team&#8217;s bandwidth. The spectrum for this type of value is wide and can include anything from offering peer networking opportunities to providing exclusive content/training or negotiated discount rates for select member services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Not a single advanced driver assistance system offered in today&#8217;s new vehicles would meet pending safety criteria being developed by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, according to the organization.</p>
<p>The nonprofit that is funded by auto insurance companies said Thursday that its new rating program will evaluate the safeguards that vehicles with &#8220;partial automation&#8221; use to help drivers stay focused on the road.</p>
<p>IIHS will give systems good, acceptable, marginal or poor ratings. The first set of ratings is expected to be issued in 2022, IIHS said, though it did not give a specific date because ongoing supply chain issues have made it more difficult to obtain vehicles for testing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260216" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Partial automation systems may make long drives seem like less of a burden, but there is no evidence that they make driving safer,&#8221; IIHS President David Harkey said in a statement. &#8220;In fact, the opposite may be the case if systems lack adequate safeguards.&#8221;</p>
<p>To earn a &#8220;good&#8221; rating, vehicles will have to have a driver monitoring system that ensures a driver&#8217;s eyes are directed at the road and that their hands are either on the wheel or ready to grab at all times, the organization said. These advanced driver assistance systems must also be equipped with alerts that escalate and emergency procedures if a driver continues to ignore them.</p>
<p>The new IIHS ratings will not address other functional aspects of the systems that could also potentially contribute to crashes, such as how well their cameras or radar sensors identify obstacles.</p>
<p>Automakers are offering increasingly advanced driver assistance systems with an array of &#8220;partial automation&#8221; features. The most common is a feature that combines adaptive cruise control, which maintains a driver-selected speed and automatically slows to maintain a selected following distance, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">with lane centering that </span>continuously adjusts the steering to help the driver keep the vehicle in the middle of the travel lane. Automated lane changing is also becoming more common, IIHS noted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>IIHS&#8217; move to rate automated driving systems follows a regulatory and consumer advocacy trend to keep automakers in check. Consumer Reports has said it will <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/driver-monitoring-systems-ford-gm-earn-points-in-cr-tests-a6530426322/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin awarding points</a> for partially automated driving systems with adequate driver monitoring systems. CR will also factor in IIHS safeguard ratings once they are available.</p>
<p>Consumer Reports said that its 2022 autos Top Picks, which will be announced on February 17, will include evaluations of driver monitoring systems. CR will add two points to a vehicle&#8217;s overall score if it features a system that encourages safe driving as part of the model&#8217;s active driving assistance package.</p>
<p>CR said only Ford&#8217;s BlueCruise and GM&#8217;s Super Cruise systems will earn these additional points.</p>
<p>CR said in 2024 it will start docking two points from the overall score if the new vehicle lacks <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">adequate driver monitoring. That will increase to a loss of four points starting with 2026 models.</span></p>
<p>IIHS noted that while most partial automation systems have some safeguards in place, none of them meets all of the organization&#8217;s pending criteria. This can lead to drivers intentionally or unintentionally pushing the system well beyond its safe operation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way many of these systems operate gives people the impression that they&#8217;re capable of doing more than they really are,&#8221; said IIHS research scientist Alexandra Mueller, who is spearheading the new ratings program. &#8220;But even when drivers understand the limitations of partial automation, their minds can still wander. As humans, it&#8217;s harder for us to remain vigilant when we&#8217;re watching and waiting for a problem to occur than it is when we&#8217;re doing all the driving ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are no so-called self-driving cars available to consumers, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped automakers from branding their systems in a way that causes confusion or overstates the system&#8217;s capabilities.</p>
<p>Tesla has been widely criticized for the branding of its Autopilot advanced driver assistance system that comes standard in its vehicles and the upgraded FSD (full self-driving) beta software package that costs $12,000. But other automakers have also oversold the capabilities of their systems in marketing campaigns.</p>

As first reported by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/tiktok-is-testing-paid-subscriptions?irclickid=zbUwjW3d9xyIWX6XC8ydcwL-UkG3-OWhIz0czs0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;utm_medium=cpa&amp;utm_campaign=2334778-Linkbux&amp;utm_term=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Information</a>, the popular short-form video app is exploring the option for creators to charge subscriptions for their content. The feature is part of a limited test for the time being and is not broadly available. TikTok declined to elaborate on the feature or share additional details.</p>
<p>“We’re always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience,” a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch in an email, when reached for comment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how the paid subscription model will be implemented in the app. For context, TikTok&#8217;s popular algorithmic &#8220;For You&#8221; page surfaces videos from creators that users don&#8217;t follow. If a creator chooses to charge a subscription for their content, it&#8217;s likely that their videos won&#8217;t appear on users&#8217; For You pages. However, it&#8217;s also possible that the subscription will apply to additional content that&#8217;s exclusive to paid users, as opposed to being applied to the entirety of a creator&#8217;s account.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260193" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>News of the test comes a day after Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/instagram-launches-early-test-of-creator-subscriptions-in-the-u-s/">launched</a> subscriptions in the U.S. The feature is now in early testing with a small group of creators who are able to offer their followers paid access to exclusive Instagram Live videos and Stories. Creators can choose their own price point for access to their exclusive content. Paid subscribers will be marked with a special badge, differentiating them from unpaid users in the sea of comments.</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s paid subscriptions test follows recent confirmation that it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/tiktok-is-testing-a-new-direct-tipping-feature-with-select-creators/">testing</a> an in-app tipping feature on its platform that allows creators to accept money from fans outside of TikTok LIVE streams, where gifting is already supported. Creators who are part of the limited test can apply for the feature if they have at least 100,000 followers and are in good standing. Those who have been approved are given a Tips button on their profiles, which their followers are able to use to send them direct payments.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s newest test is its latest push toward monetization and helping creators earn a living through its platform. Last year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/">introduced</a> a $200 million fund aimed at helping creators in the U.S. supplement their earnings. TikTok also helps creators sign brand partnerships and sponsorship deals and also provides monetization for livestreams. Considering TikTok’s focus on monetization efforts, it’s no surprise that the company is experimenting with a way for creators to offer paid subscriptions for their content.</p>
<p>TikTok and Instagram&#8217;s tests follow Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/">launch</a> of &#8220;Super Follows,&#8221; a paid subscription offering that launched in September 2021. The feature allows users to subscribe to accounts they like for a monthly subscription fee in exchange for exclusive content. Eligible accounts can set the price for Super Follow subscriptions, with the option of charging $2.99, $4.99 or $9.99 per month. Similar to Instagram&#8217;s model, subscribers are marked with a special Super Follower badge, differentiating them from unpaid followers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TikTok, Instagram and Twitter&#8217;s paid subscription offerings outline the companies&#8217; efforts to court creator communities. The offerings are also a way for the companies to compete with each other, along with other digital platforms such as YouTube, which offers lucrative ways for creators to make money.</p>
