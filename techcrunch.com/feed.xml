Pilot testers have been able to send each other personal payments through the service since then. Now, the company has announced that a limited number of people in the US will also be able to send and receive Novi payments from within WhatsApp.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">There&#39;s a new way to try the <a href="https://twitter.com/novi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Novi</a> digital wallet. Starting today, a limited number of people in the US will be able to send and receive money using Novi on <a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WhatsApp</a>, making sending money to family and friends as easy as sending a message. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4b8.png" alt="💸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4ac.png" alt="💬" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/dGz3lejri7">pic.twitter.com/dGz3lejri7</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Stephane Kasriel (@skasriel) <a href="https://twitter.com/skasriel/status/1468722859648307201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245453" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The development doesn&#8217;t come as a surprise: Novi co-founder David Marcus <a href="https://fintechmagazine.com/financial-services-finserv/meta-bringing-fintech-wallet-novi-all-subsidiaries" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">previously said</a> that Meta will roll out Novi payments to all of its subsidiaries, namely Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. For WhatsApp, sending money is almost as easy as sending a message — users won&#8217;t even need to leave the application. It&#8217;s also a simple way to send money without incurring fees. To do so, users will have to find their intended contact within WhatsApp, tap the paper clip icon on Android or the + icon on iOS in the text bar, select Payment and follow instructions on how to log into their Novi account.</p>
<div id="max-player-injector" class="vmmi-si" data-maxi="0">
<div class="vdb_player">
<div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Head of Novi Stephane Kasriel said on Twitter: &#8220;We often hear that people use WhatsApp to coordinate sending money to loved ones, and Novi enables people to do that securely, instantly and with no fees. Payments will appear directly in people’s chat.&#8221;</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Facebook has been teasing its digital wallet and the Diem (formerly Libra) cryptocurrency it was supposed to support for years. After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-diem-association-us-111008891.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">facing pushback</a>from regulators around the world, though, the Diem Association shifted its focus, and Novi ended up using a stablecoin called the Pax Dollar (USDP) that&#8217;s backed by the US dollar. On Novi, 1 USDP is equivalent to 1 USD. People won&#8217;t be buying cryptocurrency when they use it, and it&#8217;s simply money transfers that use stablecoin as an instrument. While sending USDP via Novi on WhatsApp has extremely limited availability for now, Kasriel said the service will look to expand its reach after getting feedback from users about the experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tinder is partnering with Spotify to launch a new <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/Tinder-Launches-Newest-Experience-In-Explore-Music-Mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Music Mode&#8221; feature</a> where users will hear a 30-second looped preview of a potential matches&#8217; chosen song while checking out their profile. Users who link their Spotify accounts and add a chosen song, called an &#8220;Anthem,&#8221; to their Tinder profiles will be able to enter Music Mode. It&#8217;s worth noting that Tinder and Spotify first partnered in 2016 to launch the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/20/tinder-taps-spotify-to-let-you-add-music-to-your-profile/">Anthem feature</a>, which allows users to add music to their dating profiles. This latest integration is a new way for users to discover their potential matches&#8217; favorite songs.</p>
<p>Music Mode will be rolling out to Tinder users globally, in all markets where Spotify is available, in the coming weeks. The new feature will be found on Tinder&#8217;s interactive &#8220;Explore&#8221; page. Tinder notes that the new feature builds on the natural ties between music and human connections by allowing users to connect through their tastes in music.</p>
<p>“Now with Music Mode, our members can experience that feeling when you’re at a party and you find out someone else loves the same songs you do,” said Kyle Miller, the vice president of product innovation at Tinder, in a press release. &#8220;Songs are deeply personal, and Music Mode is a place to spark something new through music.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245428" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company says about 40% of Gen Z Tinder users have already added Anthems to their profiles and when they do, they see nearly a 10% increase in matches.</p>
<p>This latest launch comes as Tinder has been rolling out new features to allow users to engage with others in new ways. For example, the aforementioned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/tinder-adds-a-new-home-for-interactive-social-features-with-launch-of-tinder-explore/">new Explore section</a> features events, as well as new ways to discover matches by interests. It also allows users to dive into quick conversations with others before a match is made. The company also recently launched a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/tinder-is-releasing-a-new-plus-one-feature-to-help-users-find-a-wedding-date/">&#8220;Plus One&#8221; feature</a>. Through the feature, users are able to signal that they are either looking for a date to a wedding or are willing to be one.</p>
<p>Last month, Tinder also brought back <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/tinders-new-murder-mystery-themed-swipe-night-returns-november-7/">“Swipe Night,”</a> its interactive in-app event that allows its users another way to break the ice besides just matching and chatting, this time featuring a “whodunit” murder mystery. The Swipe Night feature is available in the Explore section. Also available in this section is “Hot Takes,” which lets members chat in real time in a sort of speed dating, timed experience, and “Passions,” where users can meet others with similar interests, among other things.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Tradeshift.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tradeshift</a> — the late-stage startup tackling supply chain financing — has announced a $200 million funding round in equity and debt from a combination of existing and new investors, including Koch Industries, the giant industrial conglomerate. Also participating were IDC Ventures, LUN Partners, Private Shares and Fuel Capital, which increased their existing stakes in the company.</p>
<p>Tradeshift has a portfolio of enterprise SaaS, marketplace and fintech products serving a B2B marketplace. The company said the capital would be used to “optimize Tradeshift growth and balance sheet to continue scaling the business.” Tradeshift helps buyers and suppliers digitize their invoice processing, automate the workflows for accounts payable and scale up.</p>
<p>In a statement, Jeff Randsell, managing director and founding partner at Fuel Venture Capital Partners, said: “Tradeshift’s combined SaaS and embedded financial services offering is well positioned at the forefront of what we see as the next wave of digital transformation. Further, it is clear that digital networks are the future of B2B software, just look at Slack, LinkedIn, and GitHub to see the trend. Tradeshift has pioneered the world’s first large-scale global trade network in the cloud with impressive growth rates through the pandemic and a compelling proposition to drive future scale.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245427" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Tradeshift says the cumulative value of transactions processed across its network has “passed the $1 trillion mark, having doubled in two years.” It adds that charge volumes on Tradeshift Go are predicted to exceed $2.5 billion in 2021, a 600% year-on-year rise. It’s also launched Tradeshift Cash, a &#8220;factoring&#8221; product that helps suppliers access cash flow.</p>
<p>“Embedding financial services directly into our product unclogs the flow of working capital across supply chains, eliminating a significant pressure point in the buyer-suppliers relationship,” said Christian Lanng, CEO and co-founder, Tradeshift. “As one of the first companies to recognize the potential for embedded finance in SaaS, we have been betting on the convergence of fintech and SaaS products for a while. We’ve built the technology and distribution channels to capitalize on what is now one of the defining trends in our industry.”</p>
<p>We haven’t heard from Tradeshift since January 2020, when it took in a funding round of $240 million in equity and debt. The idea then was that it would “get on a path to profitability” after a potential IPO was put back, and after skepticism around tech IPOs at the time.</p>
<p>That was before the pandemic hit. With supply chains both booming and under pressure, it&#8217;s likely that Tradeshift&#8217;s model is tailor-made for the post-COVID world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Based on this new round, San Francisco-based Tradeshift reportedly has a valuation of more than $2 billion. In 2018 the company said its valuation was $1.1 billion during a $250 million funding round.</p>
<p>Tradeshift also has American Express Ventures, HSBC (HSBA.L), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Wipro Digital as investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://m.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mio</a>, a startup that helps enterprise teams collaborate across messaging services like Zoom Chat, Microsoft Teams, Slack and Cisco&#8217;s Webex, today announced that it has raised an $8.7 million Series A funding round. The round was led by Zoom and Cisco Investments. In total, Austin-based Mio, which was founded in 2016 and participated in the Y Combinator Winter 2016 class, has now raised $17 million. Other investors include Goldcrest Capital, Eniac Ventures, Two Sigma Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Y Combinator and Capital Factory.</p>
<p>While being able to chat across platforms isn&#8217;t usually a problem that comes up inside a company, it does become an issue when you&#8217;re working across organizations. Traditionally, those kinds of conversations used to happen in pre-planned meetings, whether in-person or virtually, but the pandemic only accelerated the move toward enterprise messaging services for this use case, too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2245417" style="width: 837px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mio4-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245417" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2245417" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mio4-1.gif" alt="" width="827" height="461" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2245417" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mio</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244573" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As Mio CEO and co-founder Tom Hadfield told me, you may think that the different players in this field would want to keep their walled gardens closed off from competitors, but the fact that Zoom and Cisco are investing in Mio shows that interoperability is very much on their minds. He also noted that Microsoft and Meta recently partnered on an integration between Teams and Facebook Workplace, while Slack and Teams have also long partnered around <a href="https://dispatch.m.io/connect-slack-microsoft-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VoIP integrations</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Microsoft Teams is akin to a Local Area Network, because Microsoft will always deliver messages between Microsoft users,&#8221; said Hadfield. &#8220;When a Teams user wants to send a message to a Slack user, it will go over the Wide Area Network for workplace communications. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re building at <span class="il">Mio</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hadfield, who co-founded the company with CTO James Cundle, tells me that the team spent the last few years on addressing technical challenges like managing the basic differences between messaging clients (like Slack&#8217;s support for custom emoji) and how they handle channels, for example. Different platforms also place different limits on their users and their APIs are always in flux, too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2245418" style="width: 778px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mio1-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245418" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2245418" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mio1-1.png" alt="" width="768" height="509" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mio1-1.png 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mio1-1.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mio1-1.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mio1-1.png?resize=680,451 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mio1-1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2245418" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mio</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The collaboration industry has come a long way from the &#8216;multi-headed clients&#8217; like Trillian that connected AIM, ICQ, MSN and Yahoo! Messenger in the early 2000s,&#8221; explained Hadfield. &#8220;A decade ago, there was a big push for open standards like XMPP and SIP, but the standards bodies failed to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation in team collaboration. Mio solves this by federating publicly available APIs, so each platform can innovate at their own pace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the obvious need for a service like this, it&#8217;s no surprise that there is a bit of competition here. <a href="https://nextplane.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nextplane</a> offers somewhat similar capabilities and with Matrix, there is an open source protocol for decentralized messaging with bridges to Slack, Discord and others (but not Teams, Zoom and Webex). &#8220;We plan to work closely with Matrix and Nextplane to advance our shared vision for a unified messaging ecosystem,&#8221; said Hadfield.</p>
<p>Mio plans to use the new funds to enhance its service by adding support for additional services like Google Chat, Meta&#8217;s Workplace and Symphony. The company also plans to launch a new unified presence feature that will allow users to synchronize their presence status across services.</p>
<p>&#8220;This investment, by two of the largest players in the collaboration industry, ushers in a new era for interoperability,&#8221; said Hadfield. &#8220;It brings us one step closer to &#8216;Collaboration Nirvana&#8217; where everyone on the planet can collaborate with each other, regardless of which chat app they are using.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EU lawmakers have formally <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6605" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed legislation</a> for the gig economy they hope will improve conditions for platform workers across the bloc — including by establishing a framework to tackle the problem of bogus self-employment.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Commission&#8217;s overarching goal is to a create a level playing field between traditional businesses and gig platforms, as well as between different gig platforms (or &#8220;digital labor platforms&#8221; as its draft text calls them) &#8212; by enforcing minimum standards for platform workers in areas like pay, conditions and social protections.</span></p>
<p>EU lawmakers also want to improve visibility and &#8220;traceability&#8221; of platform work by bringing in obligations for platforms to declare work to authorities at a national level &#8212; to support enforcement of legal requirements across the bloc, and ensure social security contributions are being paid where the work is actually taking place.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245093" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>They are taking steps to drive algorithmic accountability and fairness on the sector &#8212; with a package of transparency measures.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, EVP Margrethe Vestager, said: <em>“</em>With more and more jobs created by digital labour platforms, we need to ensure decent working conditions for all those deriving their income from such work. Our proposal for a Directive will help false self-employed working for platforms to correctly determine their employment status and enjoy all the social rights that come with that. Genuine self-employed on platforms will be protected through enhanced legal certainty on their status and there will be new safeguards against the pitfalls of algorithmic management. This is an important step towards a more social digital economy.”</p>
<p>The directive will need the backing of the European Parliament and Member States&#8217; governments, via the European Council, before it can become EU law. But at a press conference today the Commission noted widespread support from MEPs for  legislation to protect gig workers.</p>
<p>It also pointed out that a number of Member States have been pressing for it to act. While the text of the draft highlights one incentive for governments to get on board, predicting: &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Member States will enjoy increased revenues in the form of additional tax and social protection contributions.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once adopted, the Commission is allowing two years for Member States to transport the rules into national law &#8212; meaning application and enforcement won&#8217;t happen before 2024 at the earliest.</p>
<p>While, by 2025, the Commission expects some 43M people in the EU to be working through digital labor platforms &#8212; up from around 28M now. And accelerating growth of the gig economy is a key reason why it&#8217;s decided to act.</p>
<h2>Presumption of employment</h2>
<p>Most notably, the proposed directive (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=24992&amp;langId=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF</a>) sets out a presumption of employment for workers on digital labor platforms &#8212; based on a set of defined criteria related to the facts of how work is controlled by a platform, rather than whatever relationship contracts might try to claim.</p>
<p>(And, as it happens, we&#8217;ve just seen another litigation on gig platform contracts play out in the UK courts &#8212; where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/uk-high-court-uber-contracts-loss/">earlier this month</a> Uber lost an attempt in the High Court to have a claimed bypass from contactual liability legalized, with industry-wide ramifications for London-licensed ride-hailing platforms in that (non-EU) market.)</p>
<p>An impact assessment in the EU proposal suggests the change could result in between 1.72M and 4.1M people providing services through platforms being reclassified as workers.</p>
<p>At a press conference announcing the reform this morning, Valdis Dombrovskis, the Commission EVP responsible for trade and social protections for workers, appeared to suggest an even larger number of platform workers may be reclassified as as result.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of 28 million platform workers [in Europe currently] there may be up to 5.5M whose contractors describes them as self employed but in reality they are regularly checked and supervised &#8212; this effectively makes them employed workers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They should have the labor and social rights that correspond to this status, such as working time and health protection, minimum wage, unemployment, sickness and old age benefits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our proposal address the mis-qualification of these vulnerable workers and introduces the principle of rebuttable presumption [of employment] based on a range of control criteria,&#8221; Dombrovskis added.</p>
<p>On-demand platforms such as those offering ride-hailing and food delivery have faced numerous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/spains-top-court-rejects-glovos-classification-of-couriers-as-self-employed/">legal challenges</a> over how their classification of workers&#8217; employment status in Europe in recent years.</p>
<p>Concern over the issue has also led some Member States to consider or pass national legislation (such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spain-agrees-on-labor-reform-that-will-recognize-delivery-platform-riders-as-employees/">Spain&#8217;s &#8216;riders law&#8217;</a> which was passed earlier this year and recognizes delivery platform workers as employees). Portugal has also said it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/portugals-gig-economy-workers-set-become-staff-2021-10-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking at similar legislation</a>.</p>
<p>The passing of national laws is a typical trigger for the EU&#8217;s executive to come forward with pan-EU rules to try to avoid fragmentation of the bloc&#8217;s single market.</p>
<p>Although, in this case, the EU&#8217;s legislative push is more about ensuring platforms abide by minimum standards across the region to prevent a race to the bottom on labor standards.</p>
<p>Commission president, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/tech-driven-change-a-key-priority-for-new-ec-president/">Ursula von der Leyen</a>, signalled an intention to dial up scrutiny of the gig economy as she took office at the end of 2019, saying she would look at ways of improving the labour conditions of platform workers, initially suggesting the approach would focus on skills and education.</p>
<p>However the coronavirus pandemic sharpened the bloc&#8217;s concern over conditions for gig workers, as the lack of social protections for many platform workers were brought into stark relief &#8212; highlighting a slew of risks around delivery services that were suddenly being relied upon in the midst of lockdowns and mobility restrictions. So the Commission appears to have stepped up its action.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">consultation phase</a> on the reform took place earlier this year but failed to lead to agreement between the two sides (platforms and unions) &#8212; hence the EU&#8217;s executive now stepping in with a legislative proposal.</p>
<p>The proposed framework for determining the presumption of employment has been tightly drawn by the Commission &#8212; covering factors such as whether a platform sets the level of pay for the work; puts conditions on conduct/performance; supervises the performance of work or verifies quality; puts restrictions on when/whether a worker can work; and restricts a worker from building a client base or working for third parties.</p>
<p>Here is the full list of proposed criteria:</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 35">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>(a) effectively determining, or setting upper limits for the level of remuneration;</li>
<li>(b)  requiring the person performing platform work to respect specific binding rules with regard to appearance, conduct towards the recipient of the service or performance of the work;</li>
<li>(c)  supervising the performance of work or verifying the quality of the results of the work including by electronic means;</li>
<li>(d)  effectively restricting the freedom, including through sanctions, to organise one’s work, in particular the discretion to choose one’s working hours or periods of absence, to accept or to refuse tasks or to use subcontractors or substitutes;</li>
<li>(e)  effectively restricting the possibility to build a client base or to perform work for any third party.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Just two of the five criteria need to be met for the presumption of employment to kick in, per the proposal. And &#8212; at a glance &#8212; it looks like many ride-hailing platforms especially will see their workers fall under the presumption of employment.</p>
<p>Taking press questions, the Commission denied it&#8217;s trying to kill off the gig economy business model &#8212; arguing that platforms that do not want to have to reclassify scores of workers will be able to adapt their systems and tweak their models to reduce the level of control they apply so workers can be deemed genuinely self employed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Platforms may react to this by adjusting their relations with their contractors if they prefer to keep self employment status &#8212; but it means less systemic control over those independent contractors,&#8221; said Dombrovskis. &#8220;Or if they think that their specific circumstances merit it they may still challenge this presumption but at least it sets clear criteria which would be uniform criteria across the EU.&#8221;</p>
<p>As well as switching the burden of proof vis-a-vis employment status off workers and onto platforms, the proposal stipulates that any legal challenges platforms bring to try to rebut the presumption &#8220;shall not have suspensive effect on the application&#8221; &#8212; meaning that they must treat workers as employees during any period they are trying to overturn that status.</p>
<h2>Algorithmic transparency</h2>
<p>The draft directive also includes a very interesting package of measures focused on algorithmic transparency and fairness that goes further than current EU legislation which provides citizens with some protections vis-a-vis automated decisions (such as the GDPR) &#8212; putting obligations on platforms to provide workers with information about the algorithms that are used to control their labor.</p>
<p>This has also been an active area for litigation in Europe &#8212; where, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/uk-uber-drivers-are-taking-its-algorithm-to-court/">ride-hailing drivers and unions have been challenging Uber</a> to provide detailed information on how its algorithms profile and performance-manages them; and over its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/dutch-court-rejects-uber-drivers-robo-firing-charge-but-tells-ola-to-explain-algo-deductions/">use of algorithms in account terminations</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/ola-is-facing-a-drivers-legal-challenge-over-data-access-rights-and-algorithmic-management/">Ola has also faced similar legal challenges</a> in the EU. While, in Italy, the data protection regulator has taken action under existing EU law: This summer it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/italys-dpa-fines-glovo-owned-foodinho-3m-orders-changes-to-algorithmic-management-of-riders/">fined a food delivery platform owned by Glovo</a> over a slew of breaches of EU privacy legislation, including around issues of algorithm management of couriers, such as via a rider rating system.</p>
<p>Spain&#8217;s rider law already includes a package of measures around algorithm transparency. And the strategic importance of claiming data rights for platform workers has led to the formation of new associations, such as <a href="https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worker Information Exchange</a>, which was founded by James Farrer &#8212; a former Uber driver who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">successfully challenged its employment classification under UK law</a> &#8212; with the goal of cracking open algorithmic blackboxes to reset the power imbalance between platform giants and the labor providers whose activity not only enables the service to function but generates data that&#8217;s fed back and used to tightly manage and control them.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s proposal would accelerate this cause by requiring gig platforms to provide workers and/or their representatives with information about all AI systems and algorithms used to monitor, supervise and evaluate them; and about any automated decision-making systems that could significantly affect their working conditions (such as by terminating their account or determining the distribution of jobs etc).</p>
<p>While the GDPR (Article 22) already includes a right to information in relation to automated decisions that have a legal or similar effect on individuals, this proposal goes further in the case of platform workers &#8212; as it covers decision-making systems used to &#8220;support&#8221; decisions, rather than being limited to solely automated decisions.</p>
<p>That looks important as platforms have sought to evade legal challenges to automated decisions under the GDPR by claiming AI systems used for processes such as fraud detection (which can lead to account terminations) do not take decisions alone &#8212; arguing there&#8217;s always a layer of human review. But the question then is what constitutes a meaningful human review of an AI decision (vs a person employed to rubberstamp algorithmic assessments)?</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s gig reform proposal looks intended to circumvent that workaround by applying far broader transparency requirements to algorithmic control systems used by gig platforms &#8212; meaning they will be obliged to keep workers informed of the systems being applied to them on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Notably, the proposal includes an explicit ban on platforms processing any personal data of workers that is not &#8220;intrinsically connected to and strictly necessary for the performance of the contract between the platform worker and the digital labour platform&#8221; &#8212; including an outright ban on processing data on &#8220;the emotional or psychological state of the platform worker&#8221;; and on data relating to the health of the platform worker (with some limited exceptions).</p>
<p>The Commission also specifies that platforms must not surveil the private conversations of platform workers, including exchanges with workers’ representatives.</p>
<p>Nor must they collect any personal data while the platform worker is not offering or performing platform work &#8212; implying they cannot repurpose their workforce as a freebie training pool for other AIs they might aspire to build.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<h2>No cap on standards</h2>
<p>The draft directive will not prevent Member States from passing (or amending) national laws that seek to further raise standards for platform workers &#8212; so it&#8217;s definitely intended to set a floor not impose a ceiling on standards in the gig economy.</p>
<p>The Commission argues the proposed directive will introduce &#8220;very clear criteria&#8221; and &#8220;more legal security&#8221; to a heavily litigated business model, adding that it&#8217;s expecting the legislation to reduce the number of legal challenges brought over gig platform working conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We based &#8212; especially our criteria &#8212; on concrete experience,&#8221; said Dombrovskis, responding to a journalist&#8217;s question raising an immediate critique of the proposal by the <a href="https://www.businesseurope.eu/publications/eu-commission-proposal-ignores-diversity-platform-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BusinessEurope</a> industry lobby group. &#8220;These are the criteria which came up in hundreds and more cases in different European jurisdictions.</p>
<p>&#8220;That responds also to the question on fragmentation. We have now a set of common rules, of common criteria. If a platform clearly abides by the rule applicable to self employed, well, there is no problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>The commissioner also denied the proposal will prevent platforms from providing more benefits to genuinely self employed workers if they wish &#8212; saying the reform makes it clear doing so would not risk those workers being reclassified as employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have brought more clarity and that we &#8212; I would not exclude that there will be some cases in the future &#8212; but we will limit the cases because we have this objective legal criteria,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Incoming EU rules for high risk applications of AI &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">proposed by the Commission earlier this year</a> &#8212; are also set to apply to algorithmic systems used in employment, worker management and access to self-employment.</p>
<p>And the draft gig worker directive confirms that platforms which are providers of high risk AI systems will also need to &#8220;test and document their systems appropriately&#8221; under that additional incoming pan-EU law. So there will likely be additional layers of compliance for gig platforms under the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Act</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As EU eyes &#8216;balance&#8217; on precarious gig work, Glovo offers pledge of &#8216;fairer&#8217; conditions for couriers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/as-eu-eyes-balance-on-precarious-gig-work-glovo-offers-pledge-of-fairer-conditions-for-couriers/embed/#?secret=HuSHQL4RSP" data-secret="HuSHQL4RSP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Unsurprisingly, platforms have been lobbying hard against the proposed reform &#8212; led by some of the largest ride-hailing and food delivery platforms which are likely to face the most disruption to their businesses.</p>
<p>Uber, for example, has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/">accused of lobbying the EU to lower employment protections</a> &#8212; after it published a white paper <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/uber-lobbies-for-prop-22-style-gig-work-standards-in-the-eu/">earlier this year</a> calling for a &#8220;new standard&#8221; for platform work which critics decried as an attempt to push for a Prop-22-style carve out for gig work from European employment rights.</p>
<p>Spain&#8217;s on-demand delivery platform Glovo also pre-empted the Commission&#8217;s proposal by announcing what it couched as a &#8220;Couriers Pledge back <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/as-eu-eyes-balance-on-precarious-gig-work-glovo-offers-pledge-of-fairer-conditions-for-couriers/">in October</a> &#8212; committing its business to &#8220;fairer&#8221; standards for gig workers and tacitly accepting there are problems with conditions currently offered.</p>
<p>That may have been a last ditch attempt to try to water down the Commission proposal. Or recognition that the loophole which gig economy platforms have exploited &#8212; and which Dombrovskis referred to as &#8220;a sort of gap or lack of precision in our laws&#8221; vis-a-vis social protection and self employment &#8212; is now inexorable closing.</p>
<p>During today&#8217;s presser, the commissioner suggested that at least one large platform had written to him saying it could support the employment presumption reform. He also <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">pointed out that a number of platforms already employ workers or operate a hybrid model with some employees and some contractors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Far from [planning to kill the gig economy model] I&#8217;ve said that there are large platforms already operating today employing people, employing workers, they&#8217;re working quite well,&#8221; he suggested. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we recognize the role of the platform economy which can bring to the economy &#8212; both in terms of innovation, new business models, new and better services to customers. We recognize the important role the platform economy has for employment &#8212; already 28M people working in the platform economy. At the same time we want to ensure the protection of European social model also applies to those who are working in the platform economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There should not be a difference if a person works in a classical economy or a platform economy that there is a possibility to contribute to and access social protection systems,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Asked about the risks of platforms circumventing the rules via subcontracting, Dombrovskis pointed out there is already an EU directive setting standards for temporary/agency work &#8212; and arguing that if platforms seek to evade the requirements via agencies it will still lead to better conditions for workers owing to existing regulations that apply to those types of businesses.</p>
<h2>Support and opposition</h2>
<p>Asked specifically whether Uber was one of the platforms that had expressed support for the directive, Dombrovskis declined a clear answer, saying: &#8220;I had a lot of discussions also with Uber &#8212; I do not remember that Uber expressed a direct support.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in a public response today the ride-hailing giant answered the question itself &#8212; raising concerns that the proposal will put &#8220;thousands of jobs at risk, crippling small businesses in the wake of the pandemic and damaging vital services that consumers across Europe rely on&#8221;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<span class="il">Uber</span> is committed to improving the working conditions for the hundreds of thousands of drivers and couriers who rely on our app for flexible work. We have worked with national governments across Europe and the rest of our industry on ways to strengthen platform work without risking the flexibility independent workers say they want,&#8221; its statement added, arguing for an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-16/france-considers-new-protections-for-gig-worker-invisibles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approach being taken in France</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;As countries including France have demonstrated, there is a better way and any EU-wide rules should allow drivers and couriers to retain the flexibility we know they value most, while allowing platforms to introduce more protections and benefits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking ahead of the Commission’s presentation of the proposal today, as a leaked draft was circulating, European ride-hailing startup Bolt also told us it does not support the plan to apply a presumption of employment &#8212; similarly claiming this component will lead to thousands of &#8220;job losses&#8221;.</p>
<p>Albeit, pressed on its paradoxical choice of terminology, Bolt&#8217;s head of public policy for Western Europe &amp; EU, Aurélien Pozzana, conceded it was referring to &#8220;earnings opportunities&#8221; rather than jobs in the traditional understanding of the word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tomorrow if we had this &#8212; basically &#8212; full time employment framework we&#8217;re going to need much less drivers than today,&#8221; Pozzana predicted, arguing that more than half of the ride-hailing drivers in Europe would &#8220;not be needed anymore&#8221; &#8212; aka &#8220;close to 140,000 people&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who would still keep their job they actually would lose revenue,&#8221; he also claimed. &#8220;If you are employed tomorrow as a driver by a platform that&#8217;s going to be close to minimum wage. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Whereas today&#8230; [drivers] are maximising revenues by working on multiple platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;So, in the end, everybody&#8217;s losing &#8212; it&#8217;s not productive. It goes against the will of the very people who are the most impacted by hitting drivers. It&#8217;s going to be harmful for platforms and especially European ones such as Bolt trying to compete with the biggest giants&#8230; And it&#8217;s going to be negative for the European citizens who are the passengers or the clients who get deliveries.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Asked how much more tax Bolt&#8217;s business would have to pay if the reform went ahead &#8212; meaning it was required to switch to employing drivers &#8212; Pozzana said he did not have a figure to hand for that.</p>
<p>&#8220;The core concern as we speak and the focus is on the fact that generally speaking this is going to destabilize the whole industry, it will harm the drivers, it will harm the service, it will harms the clients and it goes against the will of the silent majority of the drivers,&#8221; he instead said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We strongly support what the Commission&#8217;s goal was which was to improve platform workers&#8217; working conditions. We&#8217;ve made some proposals to the Commission &#8212; more social protection and so on, better revenues &#8212; we&#8217;re very open to discuss this&#8230; We think already ride-hailing provides decent revenues to drivers throughout Europe but of course things can always be improved and there are cases where you need definitely to find solutions to issues which apply but this is not what this proposal is doing. It&#8217;s only focusing on the status of employment.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch also sought <a href="https://fair.work/en/fw/homepage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairwork</a>&#8216;s reaction to the Commission proposal. The Oxford Research Institute research project benchmarks gig platforms against a set of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/flipkart-ranked-highly-for-fairness-of-working-conditions-in-india-gig-platform-study/">fairness principles</a> to encourage them to improve conditions for workers.</p>
<p>Fairwork&#8217;s Mark Graham and <span class="gD" data-hovercard-id="alessio.bertolini@oii.ox.ac.uk" data-hovercard-owner-id="106">Alessio Bertolini told us the proposal f</span><span lang="en-GB" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">or a presumption of an employment relationship will make it easier for platform workers to be reclassified as employees and therefore easier for them to enjoy the same rights as other (dependent) workers &#8212; &#8220;creating a long overdue level playing field in the platform economy&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But they warned the proposal is unlikely to go far enough in ensuring that platform workers receive</span><span lang="en-GB" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;adequate rights and protections. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;As many court cases in Europe and beyond have shown, platform companies have been able to amend their contracts and slightly change their working models in response to court trials in order to circumvent current regulations and avoid their workers being reclassified as employees. It is very likely that this practice will continue in the future, leaving it again to workers to play a cat and mouse game for their rights in national courts,&#8221; they predicted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">They also highlighted growing use by platforms of &#8220;</span><span lang="en-GB" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">often complex networks of subcontracting in order to avoid employer’s responsibilities, as is also the case in many other precarious and low-paid jobs across Europe and beyond&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Even platforms which classify their workers as employees, can make use of intermediaries, including large multinational employment agencies, which dilute their direct obligations as employers and make it more difficult for workers to claim their rights. The EU proposal does not contain any relevant clause in relation to subcontracting, de facto not offering platform workers any protection against those practices, which are likely to become increasingly more common as more and more platforms move away from the independent contractor model.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Another shortfall Fairwork&#8217;s researchers highlighted is around the lack of improvements in</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the rights and protections for workers who will continue to be classified as self-employed (regardless of whether genuinely or not), noting: &#8220;As </span><span class="il" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Fairwork</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, we want to make sure that all workers, regardless of employment classification, enjoy some basic labour standards, in line with the ILO Decent </span><span class="il" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Work</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Agenda. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;As it stands, all platform workers which will continue to be classified as self-employed including, most likely, most platform workers in the domestic and care sector as well as cloud workers, will continue to be denied basic rights, including the right to a minimum wage, health and safety protection, transparency, due process and collective representation. More needs to be done to ensure that even those workers, who are among the most vulnerable among platform workers, are adequately covered by rights and protections and enjoy decent labour standards.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">They welcomed the inclusion of an article in the proposal</span><span lang="en-GB" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> clarifying that platforms using self-employed workers will not be at risk of employment reclassification if they offer training, health and safety and social protection to their workers &#8212; &#8220;thus overcoming an important existing regulatory barrier fo<wbr></wbr>r platforms in introducing measures to improve protections&#8221; &#8212; however here again they warned the draft legislation leaves measures &#8220;to the good will of platforms&#8221;, rather than seeking to enforce a standard. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;The on-demand model can be <span class="il">fair</span> only as long as minimum labour standards are guaranteed for all workers,&#8221; they also told us. &#8220;The on-demand model should be re-conceived and re-organised in a way that guarantees workers the basic rights and protections they should be already entitled to. This is what courts across the world have already tried to address and what some platforms are already providing in a number of countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fairwork have also published a blog post with a fuller response <a href="https://fair.work/en/fw/blog/fairwork-response-to-the-european-commissions-proposal-for-a-directive-on-platform-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2>On those gig industry claims&#8230;</h2>
<p>We also asked Fairwork to respond to some of the ride-hailing industry&#8217;s main lobbying arguments against the reform &#8212; such as the claims that it will lead to widespread job losses and reduced earnings for drivers, and the framing that employment automatically means reduced flexibility.</p>
<p>On earnings Fairwork queried a claim by Bolt that driver &#8220;revenues&#8221; are consistently higher than the local minimum wage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our ratings of ride-hailing platforms across the world show that most of them are currently unable to provide adequate evidence its workers are paid above the minimum wage, once taken into account of <span class="il">work</span>-related costs, in their active hours (which should also include waiting time, according to our definition and that of many courts across the world, including the recent UK Supreme Court case against Uber). For details see <a title="https://fair.work/en/fw/ratings/#continue" href="https://fair.work/en/fw/ratings/#continue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://fair.work/en/fw/ratings/%23continue&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1639126848416000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1REZrODTO3gBZYEBEaMnq5">our ratings</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fairwork also pointed out that platforms frequently choose to talk about &#8220;average earnings&#8221; &#8212; which excludes those who fall below the minimum wage from the discussion, emphasizing: &#8220;The point of a minimum wage&#8230; is to ensure a wage floor: To ensure that nobody can earn below the legal minimum. Even if only 5% of workers are earning below the minimum wage, it is still an exploitative system. All workers deserve decent wages.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the ride-hailing industry predictions of mass job losses following employment reclassification, Fairwork pointed out the same sorts of claims surfaced before the UK introduced its minimum wage &#8212; and resurface every time there&#8217;s debate about raising it &#8212; adding: &#8220;None of these things, of course, transpired. Research in labour market policy across the world consistently shows that the introduction of minimum pay thresholds when previously there was none, do not only help raise the pay of those previously paid below the minimum, but also of those paying closer but above that minimum, contrary to what Bolt [and Uber] is claiming<i>.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>While, on the industry&#8217;s framing of flexibility vs employment, Fairwork said its research shows that it&#8217;s possible for platforms to reconcile flexibility with <span class="il">fair</span> working conditions &#8212; although it noted that only a minority have been doing so, so far.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;</i>We don&#8217;t see any inherent contradiction between a model which guarantees flexibility and fairness at the same time,&#8221; it said. &#8220;Platforms have often claimed to refrain from providing workers with more rights and protections for fear 1) of being seen as employers, and therefore being more at risk of seeing their workers being reclassified 2) being at disadvantage compared to other platforms, and have instead engaged in a &#8216;race to the bottom&#8217; in labour standards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that the proposal at least partly addresses these two concerns, removing the issue of reclassification and creating a level playing field which all platforms should abide to, this should also reduce the barriers for platforms in providing &#8216;fairer&#8217; working conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fairwork also agreed that platforms&#8217; claims of flexibility need far closer scrutiny &#8212; given how tightly they manage and control workers through the application of algorithms.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;</i>Our research and that of many other scholars has shown that flexibility is often fictitious for many workers, especially those relying on platform <span class="il">work</span> for a living. Though workers can appreciate the freedom to decide to <span class="il">work</span> when they want (which is something they should be able to continue to do in the future), many of these workers feel often obliged to <span class="il">work</span> long hours or accept any job in order not to earn a living or for fear of seeing their ratings reduced, and with it, future job opportunities. More importantly, we want to reiterate that there should not be, at least in principle, any reason why workers can <span class="il">work</span> flexibly, but being guaranteed at least some security.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meta (formerly Facebook) today is introducing a number of Facebook Live updates that will allow creators to engage with fans during their live broadcasts, including new features like Polls, support for four-person co-broadcasting via the &#8220;Live With&#8221; feature, new commenting features, a new post format, support for adding links to broadcasts and &#8220;Live in Stories,&#8221; which allows creators to share their livestreams directly to Facebook Stories to improve their chances of discovery.</p>
<p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg yesterday teased <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10114137082634871" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these new additions</a> and others still to come by posting to Facebook that more creator updates would be coming later in the week, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/facebooks-new-website-lets-fans-buy-stars-without-paying-the-app-stores-commissions/">the launch of the online Stars website</a> announced Tuesday. The new online store routes around the app stores&#8217; commissions as it&#8217;s web-only, and is currently passing the savings on to fans by offering more Stars (the virtual items used to tip creators) for the same amount of money as you&#8217;d pay inside the Facebook mobile app.</p>
<p>Among the new features being announced today, one of the most requested is Featured Links. This will allow creators to add website links to their live broadcasts which can be used to point fans to things like personal blogs, donation opportunities, shopping sites and more. Creators will be able to add multiple links to a broadcast that viewers can visit without leaving the live video, the company notes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245378" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2245400" style="width: 388px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245400" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2245400 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Featured-Link.png?w=378" alt="" width="378" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Featured-Link.png 659w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Featured-Link.png?resize=83,150 83w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Featured-Link.png?resize=167,300 167w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Featured-Link.png?resize=378,680 378w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Featured-Link.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245400" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Meta</p></div></p>
<p>The &#8220;Live With&#8221; feature is also being expanded to now support a total of four people &#8212; the host and up to three guests.</p>
<p>Creators are also now able to add polls to live videos on mobile. The feature was previously available on the desktop, but the refreshed experience for mobile allows creators to receive real-time feedback from fans during their live videos.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2245398" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245398" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2245398" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Polls-Side-by-Side.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="624" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Polls-Side-by-Side.png 1291w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Polls-Side-by-Side.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Polls-Side-by-Side.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Polls-Side-by-Side.png?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Polls-Side-by-Side.png?resize=680,624 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Polls-Side-by-Side.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245398" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Meta</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The fan Badges experience has been redesigned too, to make it easier for creators to see which fans are supporting them when viewing the comments, where badges appear next to fans&#8217; names.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2245397" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245397" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2245397 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Badges-Side-by-Side.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Badges-Side-by-Side.png 9018w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Badges-Side-by-Side.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Badges-Side-by-Side.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Badges-Side-by-Side.png?resize=768,453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Badges-Side-by-Side.png?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Badges-Side-by-Side.png?resize=1536,905 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Badges-Side-by-Side.png?resize=2048,1207 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Badges-Side-by-Side.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245397" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Meta</p></div></p>
<p>Meta says it will additionally test a new experience that gives creators an easy way to know who their most loyal fans are by placing these viewers in a dedicated &#8220;Front Row&#8221; section of the live broadcast. This feature, which resembles Clubhouse with its rounded profile pics, could make it even easier to identify their biggest fans during a livestream and give them shout-outs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2245402" style="width: 388px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245402" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2245402" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Front-Row.png?w=378" alt="" width="378" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Front-Row.png 659w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Front-Row.png?resize=83,150 83w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Front-Row.png?resize=167,300 167w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Front-Row.png?resize=378,680 378w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Facebook-Live-Front-Row.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245402" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Meta</p></div></p>
<p>The company is also rolling out support for Live in Stories, which allows creators to have their live videos discovered at the top of the News Feed. The feature allows creators to share their live broadcasts to Facebook Stories to maximize discovery.</p>
<p>When creators comment on public posts, they&#8217;ll have a Follow button next to their name and the post they comment on will pop up on their followers&#8217; feeds. Their comments will be ranked higher on their own discussion threads, so spammy and repetitive comments are less visible. Comment ranking will come to Reels, Facebook Live videos and Live Audio Rooms to ensure the creators&#8217; comments get seen first.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2245403" style="width: 399px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245403" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2245403 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Commenting-Elevation.png?w=389" alt="" width="389" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Commenting-Elevation.png 678w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Commenting-Elevation.png?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Commenting-Elevation.png?resize=172,300 172w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Commenting-Elevation.png?resize=389,680 389w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Commenting-Elevation.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245403" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Meta</p></div></p>
<p>Meta is also adding the ability for creators to react and respond to comments quickly from their notifications.</p>
<p>Plus, the company will begin testing a new posting format called Spotlight Conversations, which is designed to allow creators to better connect with their communities. Creators will invite guests to participate in text-based conversations which appear as posts with two separate comment sections in different tabs &#8212; one for the creator and their guests and one for everyone else following along and discussing. This allows people to just follow the main discussion without the clutter of other comments.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2245401" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245401" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2245401 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Spotlight-Conversations.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="410" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Spotlight-Conversations.png 1964w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Spotlight-Conversations.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Spotlight-Conversations.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Spotlight-Conversations.png?resize=768,463 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Spotlight-Conversations.png?resize=680,410 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Spotlight-Conversations.png?resize=1536,926 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Spotlight-Conversations.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245401" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Meta</p></div></p>
<p>Another test will involve a deep-dive experience that shows people content they may have missed from creators they follow directly in their News Feed.</p>
<p>Creators can also cross-post from Facebook to Instagram and they&#8217;ll now be able to quickly create new videos directly at the top of Facebook Watch.</p>
<p>Combined, the slate of new features represents a hefty upgrade to the creator experience on Facebook, which has sometimes seemed of lesser importance to the company than Instagram &#8212; which is where many new features, like Reels, are first launched.</p>
<p>Meta has been steadily rolling out the creator updates over the course of the week. In addition to the Star store, the company also yesterday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/facebook-tests-a-new-professional-mode-for-creator-profiles/">announced a new Professional Mode</a> for creators&#8217; Facebook profiles that gave them access to more monetization opportunities and analytics. It appears there are more features on the way, too, as Zuckerberg noted there will be &#8220;new controls and support features&#8221; coming for creators which have not yet been detailed.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Corporate spend and cash management company Rho today announced that it has raised a $75 million Series B funding round, alongside a redesign and rebranding.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Corporate spend and cash management company <a href="https://www.rho.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rho</a> today announced that it has raised a $75 million Series B funding round led by Dragoneer Investment Group. Participants included existing investors Inspired Capital, M13 and Torch Capital, as well as new investors such as DFJ Growth.</p>
<p>This adds up to a total of $205 million in equity and debt financing, which the New York-based fintech plans to primarily use to invest in technology and build &#8220;more expansive products to continue to cover the entirety of corporate spend and cash management,&#8221; its CEO Everett Cook told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>This focus on creating a one-stop shop is a response to customer demand, Cook said. With a sweet spot for companies with 30 to 500 employees, Rho sees SMBs looking for frictionless workflows across banking, cards and accounts payable. &#8220;The company is laser-focused on automating the back-office and building the platform to enable ‘self driving’ finance in the enterprise,” said Sam Fort, partner at DFJ Growth.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245191" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This integrated approach already led Rho to launch accounts payable product Rho AP <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/rho-a-startup-bank-aimed-at-high-growth-businesses-raises-15m-series-a-led-by-m13-ventures/">alongside its Series A round</a> last January, followed by its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210513005213/en/Rho-Technologies-Launches-First-Ever-Corporate-Card-Providing-Flexible-Terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corporate card</a> in May. The card is powered by a partner, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/05/2204238/0/en/Sterling-National-Bank-Signs-Agreement-with-Rho-Technologies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sterling National Bank</a>, as are other Rho services. Per the company: &#8220;Rho partners with various providers, including banks, to provide businesses with holistic financial services under the Rho brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like Rho AP, the Rho Card is part of Rho&#8217;s strategy to position itself as &#8220;the first and last platform finance teams should need.&#8221; But it is also arguably an attempt to capture a portion of America&#8217;s huge corporate card spend. According to the payments-focused <a href="https://nilsonreport.com/mention/1487/1link/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nilson Report</a>, commercial card purchase volume in the U.S. was close to $1.4 trillion this year. No wonder then that so many fintechs now offer their own cards &#8212; from Expensify and Bill.com&#8217;s Divvy to Brex and Ramp.</p>
<p>Despite these competitors, things seem to be going well for Rho. Per Cook, its annualized transaction volume grew from a little less than $2 billion in December 2020 to a cumulative volume of $3 billion between January and November 2021. According to Rho, November’s transaction volume gives the company a $6 billion annualized run rate, showing rapid acceleration from its 11-month $3 billion cumulative result. Not bad for a company founded in 2018, and that only launched in 2020. &#8220;This was a direct result of Rho continuing to expand the platform’s capabilities, building out corporate cards, and AP on top of the core banking platform,&#8221; Cook said.</p>
<p>In parallel, Rho&#8217;s team grew to 80 people, working both in New York and remotely. Recent recruits include its new Europe-based CTO, Sebastjan Trepca, who will free up time for Rho&#8217;s co-founder Alex Wheldon to &#8220;focus more exclusively on product strategy,&#8221; Cook said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Having previously co-founded U.K. fashion search platform Lyst, Trepca previously consulted with Rho and was involved in the redesign that the startup is unveiling alongside its funding announcement.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also some rebranding going on: The company&#8217;s product used to be known as Rho Business Banking, while its legal name was &#8212; and still remains &#8212; Rho Technologies. But from now on, you can just call it Rho, Cook said. Fingers crossed that it won&#8217;t get overshadowed by a new COVID-19 variant hungry for another Greek letter.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Usage-based pricing (UBP) has quickly gone from <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/2021-state-of-usage-based-pricing/#.YYQ-kmDMI2w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fringe to mainstream in SaaS</a>. Converts to UBP are drawn to the promise of accelerated revenue growth and a more efficient land-and-expand business model.</p>
<p>But achieving faster revenue growth isn’t as simple as just changing pricing. UBP is a company-wide effort and requires ditching the old SaaS metrics playbook.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			One way to think about usage-based revenue is that it’s product-led growth (PLG) in its purest form.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Consider Snowflake, a data warehousing company that went public in 2020 and now has a $100 billion market cap. While conventional wisdom suggests SaaS companies should aspire for net retention of 100% or greater, Snowflake reports an off-the-charts 169% net retention driven by an effective consumption-based pricing model. The company’s net retention actually rose from 158% in Q2 of fiscal 2021.</p>
<p>For Snowflake, $1,000 in initial spend from a new customer would theoretically turn into $13,000+ after five years. So how much should I spend on customer acquisition (CAC) to acquire a new logo? Do I compensate sales for the initial spend, or should reps share in that customer growth? How should I invest in product and engineering to ensure customers see better value as their costs increase?</p>
<p>Many usage-based companies ask themselves similar questions.</p>
<h2>Usage-based companies share their customers’ success</h2>
<p>Leading usage-based companies have the phenomenal ability to grow with their existing customers at extremely high rates. Top-quartile net retention for those with a largely usage-based pricing model was 122% compared to those with usage-based subscription tiers (110%) or no usage-based pricing (109%), according to OpenView data.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244755" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244755" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2244755" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image1-2.png" alt="Net dollar retention" width="600" height="476" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image1-2.png 439w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image1-2.png?resize=150,119 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image1-2.png?resize=300,238 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image1-2.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244755" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OpenView Partners</p></div></p>
<p>But such an expansion isn&#8217;t usually a result of selling more products or gating advanced features behind up-sell packages. It comes from customers increasing their consumption as they become more successful and discover new use cases.</p>
<p>For example, Twilio boasts a 132% net retention rate across an impressive base of 200,000+ active customers, and about 85% of Twilio’s net expansion comes from usage with only 15% coming from new products, according to the company’s 2020 <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/963721274/files/doc_presentations/2020/10/2020-Twilio-Investor-Day-FINAL-WEBSITE.pdf">investor presentation</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Like what Square did for payments, Shabodi aims to demystify 5G by providing APIs so developers can build Industry 4.0 applications without unexpected costs, complexity and domain disparity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While most of the market is focused on building and selling 5G infrastructure, an important piece that is overlooked is the application development on 5G networks, according to Vivek Ladsariya, general partner at SineWave Ventures. That’s what makes him excited to support a company like <a href="https://www.shabodi.com/">Shabodi</a>.</p>
<p>“Application developers have always wanted to abstract away network complexities and Shabodi is primed to serve that need,” Ladsariya said via email.</p>
<p>Shabodi raised $3.375 million in seed funding to enable enterprises, system integrators and telecommunications companies to accelerate the development and deployment of next-generation applications on 5G.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245019" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Toronto-based company was founded by telecom veterans Vikram Chopra and Harpreet Geekee in 2020 with an initial focus on 5G deployments through its application enablement platform. This is the pair’s second time working together.</p>
<p>Shabodi is already working with customers to leverage the full potential of the network by monetizing their 5G deployments to accelerate return on investment.</p>
<p>“5G is a couple of years away from everyone, but enterprise is ripe for this,” Chopra told TechCrunch. “Companies are deploying 5G across multiple sites, but building applications on it requires a new skill set, and right now, we are one of the few addressing it.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Likening it to what Square did for payments, Shabodi aims to demystify 5G by providing simple APIs so that developers can build Industry 4.0 applications without unexpected costs, complexity and domain disparity, he added.</p>
<p>Blumberg Capital led the seed round and was joined by Counterview Capital, Shasta Ventures, SineWave Ventures, MAVA Ventures, Green Egg Ventures, Maccabee Ventures, CEAS Investments, Supernode Ventures and Lorimer Ventures. Shabodi raised a $200,000 pre-seed round earlier this year led by Forum Ventures and former Cisco and Yahoo executives.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company has 15 employees and two patents, with a third coming next year.</p>
<p>Though Chopra could not reveal other customers, he said that the company is in talks with about a dozen enterprises. He intends to use the new funding to build out product and sales teams as it readies Shabodi’s first product for public consumption by the end of this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud to partner with Shabodi&#8217;s visionary team of industry experts to accelerate the deployment of 5G, one of the most impactful developments of this decade,&#8221; said Bruce Taragin, managing director at Blumberg Capital, via email. &#8220;5G will disrupt many aspects of enterprise technology, and Shabodi&#8217;s platform has the potential to significantly improve how application developers, organizations and entire industries make 5G a reality.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company touts this new round of funding as “the largest Series B round ever raised in Latin America.”]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to investment in e-commerce aggregators in Latin America lately, when it rains, it pours.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.merama.io/">Merama</a>, which acquires or launches Latin American digital brands, hit a $1.2 billion valuation — just 12 months after incorporation — following a new $60 million follow-on investment led by Series B investors Advent International and Softbank. It also comes a day after fellow LatAm e-commerce aggregator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/quinio-jumps-into-world-of-e-commerce-aggregators-with-20m-seed/">Quinio announced $20 million in initial funding</a> to acquire some 30 companies.</p>
<p>The investment follows a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210928005398/en/E-Commerce-Brand-Builder-Merama-Closes-US225-Million-Series-B-Financing-Co-Led-by-Advent-International-and-SoftBank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$225 million Series B investment</a>, announced in September, that put the Mexico- and Brazil based-company at an $850 million valuation. At the time, the company touted it as “the largest Series B round ever raised in Latin America.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245137" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We first profiled Merama back in April when it burst onto the e-commerce aggregator scene with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/merama-lands-160m-to-grow-e-commerce-product-business-in-latin-america/">$160 million in a combined debt-and-equity seed and Series A round</a>. In total, the company has raised $445 million, of which $345 million is equity and $100 million is debt.</p>

<p>The company was co-founded by CEO Sujay Tyle, co-founder and former CEO of Frontier Car Group; Felipe Delgado, previously CEO of Beetmann Energy; Olivier Scialom, co-founder and former COO of Petsy; Renato Andrade, previously associate partner at McKinsey; and Guilherme Nosralla, former head of growth at Wildlife Studios.</p>
<p>“Latin America is the fastest growing e-commerce region in the world yet brands are extremely nascent or non-existent,” Tyle told TechCrunch via email. “Merama believes several multi-billion dollar brands will be created in LatAm over the next five years.”</p>
<p>Today, Merama has more than 180 employees and a portfolio of 20 brands across Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru. It is poised to sell over $250 million of product merchandise this year, and will be “significantly cash flow positive,” Tyle said.</p>
<p>Its prominent brands include Mexican consumer electronics company Redlemon and Bebesit, a baby products seller in Chile. Overall, the $85 billion e-commerce market in Latin America is growing rapidly, with projections of it <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/445860/retail-e-commerce-sales-latam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching $116.2 billion in 2023</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aside from acquiring digital brands, the company launches its own as well as developing automation and scalability tools to help them grow across Latin America. It also plans to monetize the underlying technology it is building that automates brand management and supply chain.</p>
<p>The latest funding will enable the company to expand into Argentina and the United States. Merama also rounded out its executive team with the hires of former Mandae CTO Danilo Ferreira as Merama’s CTO, and former MercadoLibre director of marketplace Ignacio Nart, to be senior vice president of private label.</p>
<p>Overall, e-commerce aggregators have gained traction across the world in the past few years, with successful companies securing billions of venture-backed capital in recent years. In addition to Quinio, Beijing-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/chinese-amazon-aggregator-nebula-brands-raises-50m-led-by-l-catterton/">Nebula Brands took in $50 million</a> this week.</p>
<p>Before them was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/gravitiq-throws-its-hat-into-crowded-e-commerce-aggregator-ring/">Gravitiq</a>, focused on healthcare brands, and Heyday’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/heyday-raises-555m-to-buy-up-and-scale-more-d2c-brands-on-the-amazon-marketplace-universe/">$555 million Series C</a>. The big name in aggregators, Thrasio, announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/thrasio-the-amazon-aggregator-raises-1b-in-fresh-funding-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-10-billion/">$1 billion in October</a>, while Perch grabbed a large investment of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$775 million</a> in May.</p>
<p>Different from Thrasio and Perch, Tyle explained that “Latin America is a growth story and thus Merama focuses on significantly fewer brands and is focused on scale and expansion. The goal is to have a single category leader in each major e-commerce category rather than consolidate hundreds of brands.”</p>
<p>The funding also helps the company to launch Merama Labs, touting it as “the first-of-its-kind Latin American incubator for direct-to-consumer brands.” The internal incubator will create new D2C brands in categories like fashion, cosmetics, supplements and beverages. It is a new growth channel that incubates and launches digital D2C brands in multiple categories in-house.</p>
<p>“We will create brands alongside influencers,” Tyle added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company offers a data-driven approach to streamlining the retailer procurement process with brands while connecting consumers to a wider variety of products.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://podfoods.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pod Foods</a> is keeping grocery shelves full of the emerging food brands that consumers are asking for and announced today $13 million in funding, including $10 million in Series A dollars and $3 million in a previously unannounced seed round, to continue developing its digital wholesale business-to-business marketplace.</p>
<p>We profiled the Austin-based company’s founders Larissa Russell and Fiona Lee back in 2019 when they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/pod-foods/">raised $3 million</a> in a round led by Moment Ventures that also included M12. The company’s technology offers a data-driven approach to streamlining the retailer procurement process with brands while connecting consumers to a wider variety of products, including those from up-and-coming brands.</p>
<p>Following the seed round, Pod Foods launched in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles, and also launched a mobile app for more easy inventory management to match the right products to the right retailers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245004" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Then the global pandemic hit. In efforts to keep store shelves stocked, the company noticed emerging brands, the niche it focuses on, were displaced from the shelves in favor of established brands. So the company leaned in on creating brand awareness.</p>
<p>“That created acceleration and amplified all of the things we set out to change,” Russell told TechCrunch. “We took 2020 to lean into the challenges, as a result of the pandemic, and work on the business.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pod Foods gets VC backing to reinvent grocery distribution&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/pod-foods/embed/#?secret=jTe4o7J7gJ" data-secret="jTe4o7J7gJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Both M12 and Moment Ventures returned for the Series A, which was led by Industrious Ventures, and now gives the company $16 million in total funding. Additional investors participating in the round include Unshackled Ventures, Barrel Ventures, Relish Works, X Factor Ventures, XRC Labs, K2 Global and Graphene Ventures.</p>
<p>The latest investment is in line with Pod Foods’ growth trajectory, Russell said. The company is already in seven cities and will expand to 10 as it sees a 20% increase in repeat brand purchases today compared to pre-pandemic data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series A also enabled the company to do more hiring, growing to 58 employees from 33 last December. Pod Foods secured a chief technology officer, Timothy Wee, who has a background from Google, Amazon and Walmart, and will also invest in data to build out new services and products, Lee said.</p>
<p>Delivery services rapidly grew over the past two years, driven by consumer expectations of getting items delivered faster, causing retailers to struggle to keep up with demand. As a result, Pod Foods saw both its revenue and customer base triple year-over-year since 2019, while helping retailers adapt faster to resetting products faster based on what sells and what doesn’t, Russell said.</p>
<p>“We’ve had to adapt,” Lee added. “What used to sell would be things like grab-and-go products, but when the pandemic hit, products selling more were like frozen items and beverages. We have to pivot quickly, but because we are small and nimble, we could quickly say what they wanted and get brands on board and keep retailers’ shelves stocked.”</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/497691544?h=8b3999effb" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em><a href="https://vimeo.com/497691544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pod Foods 2021</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/theblankspacestudio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blank Space Studio</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vimeo</a>.</em></p>
<p>Next up, Pod Foods’ expansion plans include the Pacific Northwest and a greater footprint surrounding its New York and Chicago locations, the company’s largest market, and in Florida.</p>
<p>Christian Gammill, partner at Industrious Ventures, said Pod Foods’ approach “is the first to provide the logistics infrastructure needed to completely overhaul the grocery supply chain for the better, creating a true end-to-end system that enables both retailers and brands to thrive.”</p>
<p>With commerce setting the tone for the supply chain, the company put digital at the forefront, built a data-intelligent operation and is now leveraging an impending inflection point. If companies like Pod Foods can get the data play right, it will help customers and brands, he said.</p>
<p>“Larissa and Fiona are amazing and have a compatible skill set,” Gammill added. “I didn&#8217;t see a lot of attention on this space, but a ton in other supply chains, so it made sense and why we dug in.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://resolvepay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resolve</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which specializes in “buy now, pay later” capabilities for B2B transactions, announced today that it has raised $25 million in equity funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment comes just months after the company secured a combined $60 million asset and equity financing (the majority of which was asset, or debt). Insight Partners led its latest round, which also included participation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from existing backers Initialized Capital, KSD Capital, Haystack VC, Commerce Ventures and Clocktower Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching as a spinout from Affirm in 2019, </span><a href="https://resolvepay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resolve</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says it has seen “overwhelming” demand for its B2B buy now, pay later (BNPL) billing offering for business purchases. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245235" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Affirm — which is more focused on the consumer — Resolve is exclusively focused on business-to-business billing by automating the process of billing and purchasing on credit. What it’s doing is basically allowing businesses to defer payments digitally and on better terms than what they’ve seen historically via an automated underwriting process, the company claims. This, it says, can lead to faster invoice payment and thus, improved cash flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also claims it can offer extended payment terms with buyers not having to pay any interest or fees if accounts are repaid within the agreed-upon terms. Meanwhile, merchants receive full payment (minus any fees) as soon as an order is placed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The market for simplifying net terms payments and embedding BNPL payment options is exploding as companies work to mitigate the pain of payments caused by overextended and snarled supply chains,” said Chris Tsai, Resolve’s CEO and co-founder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup in particular is seeing an increasing number of small business service providers as of late embrace BNPL as a less risky way to offer net terms to customers who expect to pay later.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2245242" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245242" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2245242 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Resolve-Product-Images.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="529" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Resolve-Product-Images.jpg 1003w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Resolve-Product-Images.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Resolve-Product-Images.jpg?resize=300,234 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Resolve-Product-Images.jpg?resize=768,598 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Resolve-Product-Images.jpg?resize=680,529 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Resolve-Product-Images.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245242" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Resolve</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resolve, ahem, resolves to make net terms simple and easily embeddable. Historically, noted Tsai, a manufacturer, distributor or B2B marketplace that wanted to give their customers 30, 60 or 90 days to pay an invoice would have had to take on the obligations and characteristics of a bank, such as credit checks, onboarding and accounting reconciliation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was laborious and took a lot of time and money. In contrast, we offer ‘net terms-as-a-service’ so that companies can provide the professional net terms their customers expect with all the benefits and none of the hassle or risk,” Tsai told TechCrunch. “We make sure the merchant gets paid upfront without having to actually wait for the end of the payment term while facilitating the complex end to end process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resolve stands out from others in the space, according to Tsai, in that it both simplifies the net terms process and makes credit embeddable anywhere a business might want to accept B2B payments. Its ability to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">integrate into existing ERP/accounting tools that businesses already use is appealing to many users, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebecca Liu-Doyle, principal at Insight Partners, believes Resolve is using automation and a “delightful” digital experience to address an age-old problem &#8212; business’ access to working capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The company’s innovative product creates a win-win for B2B buyers and sellers that is analogous to buy now, pay later offerings that have changed the game for consumers,” she wrote via email. “We believe B2B BNPL remains a massive, untapped market, and early movers like Resolve are well-positioned to take advantage.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vercel</a>, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/vercel-raises-150m-series-d-as-it-looks-to-build-an-end-to-end-front-end-development-platform/">well-funded</a> front-end development platform from the team behind Next.js, today announced that it has acquired <a href="https://turborepo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turborepo</a>, a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos, an increasingly popular way for organizing source code into a single repository that includes all of the necessary packages to build an application.</p>
<p>As part of this acquisition, Vercel is open sourcing the Turborepo command-line interface and giving Turborepo users a path for migrating their caching infrastructure to Vercel. Turborepo founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredlpalmer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jared Palmer</a> will join Vercel to lead its build performance team. He will also continue to work on the Turborepo project.</p>
<p>When I last talked to Vercel co-founder and CEO Guillermo Rauch, he noted that &#8220;strategic acquisitions are always on the table&#8221; for the company. He noted that for a lot of companies, scaling their front-ends often becomes a major hassle, with increasingly long build times and teams that can reach hundreds of people.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244497" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Turborepo is a build system that sits atop of Next.js. It allows you to diversify your investment in different front-end projects and solutions. You can combine Next.js, Svelte, Vue.js and so on, while giving the team this organizational primitive, as well as really fast builds because the system can intelligently decide what to build and what to reuse across our teams. I&#8217;ve sometimes likened it to the Tesla self-driving fleet, where one car learns &#8212; and the whole fleet learns. In the case of this build system, when one team builds, those artifacts that are produced are shared by the entire organization. This way, everyone becomes faster and learns and gets helped by the efforts of the other teams.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two companies did not disclose the price of the acquisition, but Vercel does have a nice war chest to make these moves now that it has raised a total of $313 million, with the last round valuing it at $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw an incredible amount of complexity in the way most frontend development teams build, test, and deploy their code and set out to create the best way to scale and build a frontend codebase. Turborepo gives developers the ability to manage this complexity without the maintenance burden that comes with traditional monorepo architectures,&#8221; said Palmer in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;The combination of Turborepo with Vercel&#8217;s build time and build infrastructure bridges the gap between what every developer needs and what, until now, only the hyperscalers have had. It’s somewhat magical, and also really, really, really ridiculously fast. This is the platform for the future of business on the web.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Turborepo had not raised any external funding before this acquisition, but it was looking to raise its first round, which Vercel effectively pre-empted with this acquisition, as Rauch told me. The companies are not disclosing the terms of the deal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Italy’s competition authority <a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/12/A528-chiusura" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it had fined Amazon €1.129 billion, or roughly $1.3 billion at today’s exchange rate. According to the antitrust watchdog, Amazon has abused its dominant market position and pushed third-party sellers to use the company’s logistics service Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA).</p>
<p>The Italian authority, the Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM), details its thinking in a <a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/12/A528-chiusura" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> and a <a href="https://www.agcm.it/dotcmsdoc/allegati-news/A528_chiusura%20istruttoria.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">250-page report</a>. According to them, third-party sellers don’t get the same treatment if they’re leveraging FBA or using their own logistics stack.</p>
<p>Sellers who take advantage of FBA can participate in the company’s paid loyalty program, Amazon Prime. Subscribers get free deliveries on some products. In addition to Amazon’s own inventory, products from third-party sellers that come from Amazon’s warehouses thanks to FBA also get a Prime label.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245357" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This leads to far-reaching consequences as Prime products are then included in Amazon’s events, such as Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In other words, you have a better chance of getting featured in Amazon’s events if you use Fulfillment by Amazon.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. On Amazon’s product page, the company automatically selects a seller for the buy box. On a computer, the buy box is the box on the right side of the screen that lets you add a product to your cart or buy directly with the &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; button.</p>
<p>You can see other sellers in a tiny box below the buy box. According to Italy’s competition authority, sellers who use FBA have a higher chance of getting featured in the buy box compared to other third-party sellers.</p>
<p>I tried to find a good example on Amazon.it and here’s what I found on this <a href="https://www.amazon.it/WOLTU-Copriwater-Universale-Ammortizzata-Antibatterico/dp/B00H40PQ4O/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toilet seat</a>. Amazon itself doesn’t sell the product directly. You can only get it from third-party sellers. By default, Amazon features WOLTU GmbH in the buy box. The item is shipped by Amazon as WOLTU GmbH uses FBA. And you can get free expedited shipping with Amazon Prime.</p>

<p>Below that buy box, there’s a tiny box that says you can get it from another seller. This time, we can see WOLTU GmbH once again (and a used product from &#8220;Amazon Warehouse&#8221;). It’s the same seller, but they ship it directly to you and you also get free shipping.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2245362" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="526" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png 2998w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png?resize=768,395 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png?resize=680,350 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png?resize=1536,790 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png?resize=2048,1053 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Why does WOLTU GmbH list the same toilet seat twice? FBA isn’t a free logistics service. Amazon gets a larger cut from items that are sold through FBA. And it seems like WOLTU GmbH would get more revenue from a direct sale. But it&#8217;s unlikely that customers will choose to get the toilet seat from the seller directly because it&#8217;s hidden in a submenu.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://ilsr.org/amazons-toll-road/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study</a> from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance has highlighted that Amazon is generating more and more revenue from third-party sellers, highlighting that FBA is a vicious circle and that third-party sellers have become a captive audience:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a similar fashion, Amazon has compelled sellers to buy its warehousing and shipping service, Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA). Amazon’s algorithms heavily favor sellers who do so, making FBA all but required in order to generate sales on the site. As a result, the share of sellers who have left other carriers and signed on to FBA has soared in recent years. By compelling this captive base of businesses to use its shipping service, Amazon has grown into a major logistics provider almost overnight. Its parcel delivery operation now rivals that of the U.S. Postal Service in scale. And, over the last few years, Amazon has steadily raised its storage and shipping fees, using FBA as yet another way to squeeze revenue from sellers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Italian authority has asked Amazon to create a new set of standards that would be fair to third-party sellers whether they are using FBA or not. The company will also have to implement behavioral measures. A monitoring trustee will review the changes.</p>
<p>Amazon sent me a statement. “We strongly disagree with the decision of the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) and we will appeal. The proposed fine and remedies are unjustified and disproportionate,” the company said.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than half of all annual sales on Amazon in Italy come from SMBs, and their success is at the heart of our business model. Small and medium-sized businesses have multiple channels to sell their products both online and offline: Amazon is just one of those options. We constantly invest to support the growth of the 18,000 Italian SMBs that sell on Amazon, and we provide multiple tools to our sellers, including those who manage shipments themselves,&#8221; it added.</p>

<p>The fridge-sized satellite has three telescopes that can track and measure the direction, arrival time, energy, and polarization of light. When data from all those telescopes is combined, NASA can form images that could give us more insight into how mysterious celestial objects — those that emit X-ray — work. For instance, they&#8217;re hoping it can give us a more thorough look at the structure of the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant with a neutron star rapidly spinning in its center.</p>
<p>By observing black holes, the IXPE will help scientists gain more insight and broaden humanity&#8217;s knowledge on the regions of space we still barely know. It could provide clues on why they spin and how they gobble up cosmic materials, though it could also lead to new discoveries. Martin Weisskopf, the mission&#8217;s principal investigator, said during a briefing: &#8220;IXPE will help us test and refine our current theories of how the universe works. We may even discover more exciting theories about these exotic objects than what we&#8217;ve hypothesized.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245351" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>SpaceX used a Falcon 9 rocket from a previous mission for this launch. If all goes well, the rocket&#8217;s first stage will land on the company&#8217;s drone ship &#8220;Just Read the Instructions&#8221; after ferrying IXPE to space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a new chapter for virtual learning, giving a boost of attention to existing tools and spurring the creation of new services and use cases as students of all ages were ordered to stay home and stay out of classrooms. Today, one of the startups that&#8217;s been a strong benefactor of that trend is announcing some funding to continue its growth. <a href="https://atomlearning.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atom Learning</a> &#8212; a London startup that builds AI-based online education materials aimed at primary aged (7-11 years) children, their teachers and their parents &#8212; has raised $25 million, money that it will use to continue its growth in the U.K. market, to start to look at plans to expand internationally and to continue building out the data science and content that it provides to its users.</p>
<p>Specifically, Atom&#8217;s unique selling point is that it builds education materials that use machine learning and other AI tools to adapt to a users&#8217; specific levels of knowledge; it also applies data science to build analytics and other tools for educators and parents to also work in more targeted ways to encourage more learning. All of these will also be getting more investment.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from a single backer, SoftBank, via its Vision Fund 2, and Atom claims that this sum is the largest-ever for a Series A round for a U.K. edtech startup.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245338" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It is also notable for being Atom&#8217;s first outside funding. The company, founded in 2018, had been profitable and bootstrapped up to now, and it&#8217;s grown quite impressively in the last three years. Currently, Atom is used by 500 primary (elementary) schools in the U.K., totaling some 100,000 students. (Given that there are some 22,000 primary schools in the country, it has a lot of growing left to do here.)</p>
<p>Co-founded by Jake O&#8217;Keeffe and Alexander Hatvany, O&#8217;Keeffe tells me that the two had their first taste of online learning when they worked as online tutors when still at university &#8212; very much a common side-gig for undergrads in the U.K., where pre-university students face a battery of standardized tests as they go through their years in school, with each set narrowing the field for students and where they will end up for university, what they ultimately study and essentially do with their lives.</p>
<p>(And, as an expat parent raising U.K. students, I can tell you it&#8217;s a super stressful system that is very far from perfect in all kinds of ways.)</p>
<p>Covering all ages and all subjects, the pair quickly saw the shortcomings in the model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We could see that no two private tutors were the same, even if the costs were always high,&#8221; O&#8217;Keeffe said. &#8220;We thought there was an opportunity to build a fully automated platform to help standardize the quality and the price.&#8221;</p>
<p>They chose to focus on primary-aged children, he said, not only because there were already a number of online tutoring services out in the market for secondary-school students (aged 12-18), but also because they believed that the fundamentals of learning needed to be addressed at a younger age.</p>
<p>&#8220;If kids don’t learn those skills by the time they are 11, it’s hard to recover from that when you are older,&#8221; O&#8217;Keeffe said.</p>
<p>The obvious place for Atom to start was online learning aimed at students. Specifically, it has built a <a href="https://atomlearning.co.uk/tutors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three-tier model</a> aimed first at teaching students the basics according to the national core curriculum (priced at £9.99/month); and then two subsequent tiers (£49.99/month and £59.99/month) aimed at students who are preparing for senior school entry exams &#8212; a system here in the U.K. for students going to private schools or for certain upper-level grammar schools and other places requiring a test to get in that&#8217;s called the 11+).</p>
<p>Atom naturally evolved that into content for teachers, with &#8220;question banks&#8221; for them to create better learning materials for students online and in the classroom, and then tools for parents to better track how everything progressed. The adaptive element means that the platform &#8220;reads&#8221; how students work to provide subsequent work tailored to each person&#8217;s individual level, but it also means that Atom can continually amass feedback on how those students are doing, useful for Atom&#8217;s own content library evolution as well as to create ways to track student progress.</p>
<p>These days, there are really a lot of online learning materials for all ages both across proprietary, branded platforms that you pay to use, or are free to use, as well as across more open-ended and general platforms like YouTube. It&#8217;s a giant content trove made even bigger in the last two years with so many schools shuttering their doors and turning to remote learning. That means not only competition for Atom, but also a plethora of pedagogical approaches around what might work best in terms of acquiring knowledge, keeping it, keeping children engaged and so on.</p>
<p>Kahoot, for example, (another SoftBank-backed company) has borrowed heavily from the worlds of gaming, user-generated/creator content, and on-demand entertainment to create what has been described at times as a &#8220;Netflix for learning&#8221;: a huge library of short educational modules, many of which have been created by Kahoot&#8217;s user community, which are built around the dynamics of gamification to motivate and engage pupils in a subject. Others, such as Microsoft&#8217;s tailoring of Teams for education or Zoom, are simply tools to make it easier for good old-fashioned humans to connect over remote distances and work together on white-board style interfaces to teach and learn.</p>
<p>For now, O&#8217;Keeffe said that Atom is focused on continuing to build out more content to bolster the approach it has taken: more adaptive content that complements the work that a school teacher puts in, with the bigger aim being to make sure that kids are, at the most simple level, learning according to the national curriculum (as set out by the government), and hopefully, exceeding that and developing an appetite to learn more.</p>
<p>That means: maybe some gamification somewhere down the line, but not for now. But it also means: Atom is bringing private tutors into the mix soon, too (right now there is a <a href="https://atomlearning.co.uk/tutors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registration page</a> for early access).</p>
<p>“The utilization of edtech and adaptive learning within established curricula has accelerated rapidly both in school and the home”, said Yanni Pipilis, managing partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “Atom’s proprietary technology enables each child to progress at their optimal learning pace, and provides parents and teachers with real-time feedback on areas of strength and development. We’re excited to partner with the team in its vision to improve learning outcomes for every student.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Petra emerged from stealth this week, announcing a $30 million Series A. The round, led by DCVC, brings the robotics company’s funding up to $33 million, with additional participation from ACME Capital Congruent Ventures, 8VC, Real Ventures, Elementum Ventures and Mac Venture Capital.</p>
<p>“We’ve invented a completely new way to excavate rock and this will have profound implications on the future of tunneling,” co-founder and CEO Kim Abrams said in release tied to the news. “By delivering a boring solution that affordably undergrounds utilities through high-grade rock, we can finally protect communities from exposure to wildfires and ensure the safety of critical infrastructure in disaster-prone areas, especially in places like the Sierra Nevada mountains, Rocky Mountains, and coastal regions.”</p>
<p>The news arrives as the company is announcing a successful pilot of its robot, Swifty. According to the firm, the robot successfully bored a 20-foot tunnel through Sioux Quartzite at a rate of one inch-per-minute. The metamorphic rock is notoriously hard, making it a popular choice for buildings in the upper Midwest region in which it is found. That strength, however, also makes it a formidable challenge from infrastructure and other projects that require tunneling.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244474" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2244494" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244494" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2244494" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Recording-2021-12-07-at-4.23.01-PM.2021-12-07-16_24_45.gif" alt="" width="600" height="509" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244494" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Petra</p></div></p>
<p>“No tunneling method has been able to tunnel through this kind of hard rock until now. Petra’s achievement is due to Swifty’s thermal drilling method, which efficiently bores through rock without touching it,” said Tesla co-founder, Ian Wright, who has signed on as the company’s CTO. “Boring 20 feet through impossibly hard Sioux Quartzite proves our unique capability to affordably bury utility sized tunnels through high-grade hard rock.”</p>
<p>The robotic system utilizes machine vision, microtunneling through difficult materials with the use of thermal drilling, rather than making direct contact with the rock. The company notes in a release, “Switfy provides a number of novel advantages over conventional microtunneling methods. Conventional microtunneling machines are purpose-built for a single diameter. However, Swifty is the first robot capable of boring a range of diameters between 20-60 inches, dramatically reducing the cost of tunneling.”</p>
<p>The company cites a wide range of potential uses for such boring technologies, including construction, maintenance and the creation of tunnels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many edtech companies benefited from the disruption of the pandemic, attracting wads of cash from investors globally, it did feel like African startups </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out. Well, not anymore: Two-year-old startup <a href="https://ulesson.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uLesson</a> announced today that it closed a $15 million Series B round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment, which comes 11 months after uLesson raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/african-edtech-startup-ulesson-lands-a-7-5-million-series-a/">a $7.5 million Series A</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was completed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> five investors: Tencent, Nielsen Ventures, and existing investors Owl Ventures, TLcom Capital and Founder Collective. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the largest disclosed investment in an African edtech startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by Nigerian serial founder <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/simdul" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sim Shagaya</a> in 2019, uLesson came into the market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">when the pandemic hit last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a young company, it has had to switch business models a couple of times to see what sticks in a very tough African market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244905" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup first launched by </span>providing a product pack of SD cards and dongles with pre-recorded videos for K-12 students. They can either access lessons via streaming or use the SD cards to download and store the content.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But uLesson has introduced new features for an all-encompassing edtech play for this demographic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It added quizzes and a homework help feature to connect students with tutors from universities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The startup also launched a one-to-many live class feature with polls and leaderboards and a one-to-one live experience for DevKids, a coding class independent of the core uLesson platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevKids has since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been rolled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back, though. Shagaya said uLesson is making efforts to introduce the feature &#8212; which started as an experiment in teaching kids how to code and at some point made 30% of the company’s revenues  &#8212; into the uLesson platform by January next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we want </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is different strata of free users that can use the app and can pay for a premium experience to attend live classes or get the homework helper,” said the CEO, who also founded e-commerce platforms DealDey and Konga.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And because parents </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">do want to invest in the best for their kids, one of the ways you can do that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is personalized</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one-to-one instruction for their children, whether in coding through DevKids or math or science or English.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These features show that uLesson is now in the online home tutoring business; it is a market where most African edtech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made significant headway despite an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">apparent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But uLesson is taking a distinct approach by building around that single proposition as a feature, while other platforms have instead sought to sell home tutoring services as a product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The variety of uLesson’s services provides a stickiness (students spend an average of 57 minutes on the app) that has led to parents investing in smartphones for their kids’ schooling either</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">independently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or via uLesson’s “device+plan” bundle, which is only available in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents also allow their kids to learn on their phones (roughly 50% of uLesson’s learners do that). The p</span>rices on uLesson range from a monthly fee of ₦7500 (about $18) to a two-year “<span style="font-weight: 400;">device+plan” </span>of ₦137,000 ($334).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the uLesson app has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 million downloads, the company said. Over 12.3 million videos have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been watched,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with 25.6 million questions answered on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprisingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, uLesson kept growing despite K-12 students going back to school. Contrary to public perception of the product as a second option for K-12 students, Shagaya said uLesson has become ingrained in everyday schooling activities for its users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case, uLesson adopts a diversified method of charging schools and their stakeholders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While some schools, especially high-end ones, take up the cost for their students to access uLesson, others pass on the cost to parents via tuition fees or recommend the product to parents, who proceed to pay for it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">individually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Schools have become a big channel for us, and half of our subscribers are using us in schools,” he said. “We see</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all kinds of interesting applications for we build, and these are some of the leading schools in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So we’re not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">supplemental from that point of view. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our vision is to create these feedback loops between teacher and learner and parent and school that embraces virtuous cycles and feed themselves to the betterment of the educational system.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company uses 180 field sales agents to onboard schools and individual users across Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Ghana</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the countries receiving the most marketing attention from uLesson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform is available in other markets, such as South Africa, Sierra Leone, the UK, Liberia, Gambia and the US, but Shagaya said uLesson has spread in these countries via word of mouth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria remains uLesson’s largest market by far, said Shagaya. The country is responsible for 85% of uLesson’s paying users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding similar metrics, uLesson said its paying users grew 600% this past year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its monthly average users also increased 700%, while average daily users surged 430% within the same time frame</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said its live lesson demand grew by 222% since its introduction in September. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding learners’ performance, the Abuja-based startup claims that some learners have moved from the 50th percentile to the 90th percentile in their classes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, uLesson introduced <a href="https://blog.ulesson.com/the-ulesson-learning-centre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offline centers</a>. While these spaces were destinations for learning, going forward, they will be places to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> educate the public on uLesson’s importance and sign them up, said Shagaya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to be rolling out a lot of these things next year because we’ve seen that this is [how] people use them,” Shagaya remarked, adding that “2021 for us was a year of testing what works and we know what works now. So there’s a lot of experimentation in 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And 2022, it will be executing on what works</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidafrankel1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Frankel</a>, the managing partner at Founder Collective, compared what uLesson is doing with education in Africa to how Uber changed transportation and Coupang altered e-commerce in the U.S. and South Korea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that he is an “enthusiastic supporter of Shagaya and his vision for more accessible and affordable educational opportunities for millions of people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early this year, uLesson brought on Owl Ventures as a strategic investor in its second round of funding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has included another in the form of Chinese tech multinational Tencent in its third round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tech giant and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owl Ventures back Byju, the world’s most valuable edtech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s too early to say, but with both companies in each other’s radars (as a result of sharing similar investors) and given the Indian company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/daily-crunch-101/">acquisition spree</a> in the past three or more quarters, uLesson might likely become an acquisition target should the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/indian-edtech-giant-byjus-valued-at-18-billion-in-new-funding/">$18 billion behemoth</a> be interested in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shagaya offered no comment on that speculation. Instead, he’s particularly excited about getting Tencent onboard as the tech giant’s first edtech investment in Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tencent has made a couple of fintech investments in Africa, most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">notably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Paystack, and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently completed two new investments in South Africa: payment gateway <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/south-african-payments-gateway-ozow-raises-48m-series-b-led-by-tencent/">Ozow</a> and challenger bank <a href="https://www.news24.com/fin24/companies/banks/tymebank-international-arm-raises-over-r11bn-from-tencent-and-uk-financier-20211207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TymeBank</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tencent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">historically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prolific investor in edtech. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have a lot of learnings and that’s evident when you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">talk to them and the investments they’ve made not only in China but in India and across the world,” Shagaya commented.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In them, we saw the partner that was willing to kind of get in here, work with us, and then give us the fuel to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">double down on what works.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital will allow uLesson to continue to invest in product development, strengthen its core technology and add cohort-based learning features, said the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also wants to expand its science and mathematics content to include “social sciences and financial accounting to the secondary level content library and qualitative and quantitative reasoning to the primary level.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Embedded finance &#8212; where companies tap into APIs to integrate banking and other financial tools without having to build everything themselves from the ground up &#8212; has been one of the major trends in fintech in the last decade. Today, one of the biggest startups building those APIs and the backend technology behind them is announcing a major round of funding to double down on the opportunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mambu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mambu</a>, which has built a set of APIs to power lending, deposit and other banking products, along with a wide plethora of analytics and other tools to build financial services, has raised €235 million, a Series E that values the company at €4.9 billion (in today&#8217;s exchange rates that&#8217;s about $266 million at a $5.5 billion valuation).</p>
<p>The funding is being led by EQT Growth, a European private equity firm, and Amsterdam/London-based Mambu is not disclosing other investors. (Its last round, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mambu-raises-135m-at-a-2b-valuation-for-an-saas-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $135 million in January</a>, was led by TCV, with participation from Tiger Global, Arena Holdings, Bessemer Venture Partners, Runa Capital and Acton Capital Partners. Its valuation has more than doubled since then.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245310" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company today has more than 200 customers that collectively work with some 53 million users in some 65 countries. They include big neobanks like N26, but also incumbent banks like Raiffeisen Bank, BancoEstado and ABN Amro.</p>
<p>More widely, Mambu is also working with newer entrants to financial services like telcos and e-commerce companies that might not be equipped or interested in building financial services from scratch but can see a business or operational opportunity to provide their customers with some of these tools more directly, and to invest in building more tailored financial services tapping into building blocks provided by another company (that is, Mambu) &#8212; a model that opens the door to a much wider set of customers for Mambu down the line.</p>
<p>Indeed, Eugene Danilkis, Mambu&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, has big ambitions for where he believes Mambu can sit in the wider world of financial services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision is to create in financial services and banking what Salesforce did in CRM,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On that note, Salesforce&#8217;s own ambitions are pretty big, too. Still, these days, it is not a competitor but a strong partner, Danilkis said: Part of Mambu&#8217;s power lies not just in the financial services APIs that it provides, but in the webbing it also has built so that those services &#8220;play nice&#8221; with all of the rest of the IT infrastructure and apps that a company might use. Alongside Salesforce, Mambu integrates with a number of other third-parties like AWS, Google, Marqeta, Comply Advantage, Deloitte and many others. The number of API calls that Mambu handles daily now number at about 130 million.</p>
<p>Mambu still had a lot of money in the bank prior to this raise, so the plan for this latest round will be to use the funds to double down on expanding its business to more markets and to start considering what other adjacent areas the company would like to tackle next. Areas like insurance, Danilkis said, are definitely on its radar, although he declined to say when it might launch services, and what those services might be. One logical area, for example, could be property insurance, since it already offers mortgage APIs and works with those already active in property finance.</p>
<p>More immediately, he sees a lot of opportunity still in the area of simply improving on the financial services and the building blocks for creating them that it already offers. He actually bristles a little when you mention &#8220;embedded finance.&#8221; The company&#8217;s preferred term for what it does is &#8220;SaaS banking platform,&#8221; which speaks, he says, to the more fundamental role that Mambu is playing in helping its customers build tailored financial services for themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we step back in industry, what most banks and fintechs are focused on are high-volume products that need to be very digital but still need to feel customized for the individual,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It goes beyond lending and deposits.&#8221; Longer term, he said, Mambu wants to help them build &#8220;more complex commercial products where you might have lower volumes but higher values, too.&#8221; He notes that there remain challenges also with integrations and middleware in financial services, which is another area Mambu will be providing better tech to the market. The focus, he said, is &#8220;how to integrate better in the ecosystem,&#8221; which will include creating more pre-built integrations for third-party solutions. &#8220;We&#8217;re investing in bringing a lot of that ecosystem together,&#8221; he added. (That&#8217;s the Salesforce ethos right there.)</p>
<p>There may also be acquisitions, something which Mambu has yet to do, having grown only organically up to now. The space it&#8217;s working in is ripe for consolidation, though. There are, for starters, a number of direct competitors to Mambu itself, such as Thought Machine, Rapyd and Airwallex (among many others). All three of these are also very well capitalized, with the first <a href="https://thoughtmachine.net/newsroom/thought-machine-raises-200m-in-series-c-funding-to-bring-worlds-banks-to-the-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $200 million</a> just at the end of November; Rapyd now with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/rapyd-raises-300m-on-8-75b-valuation-as-fintech-as-a-service-continues-to-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over $800 million</a> raised to date; and Airwallex coming out of Asia now at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/airwallex-raises-200m-at-a-4b-valuation-to-double-down-on-business-banking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4 billion valuation</a>. There are also a number of smaller regional players and many &#8220;point solutions&#8221; handling different aspects of financial services and financial infrastructure in the cloud.</p>
<p>EQT was actually talking to Mambu ahead of the previous round but is only just investing for the first time in this Series E.</p>
<p>“We have been following Mambu’s journey and stellar execution for several years now,&#8221; said Carolina Brochado, a partner within EQT Growth’s Advisory Team. &#8220;We feel a strong connection to the vision of Mambu as an organization, given the close alignment on values of responsibility and sustainability, and believe that Mambu’s solution is making the financial system more accessible and affordable for millions around the world. We are excited to partner with one of the leading fintech companies and management teams in Europe, which offers an industry-unique and leading modern cloud platform to address the massive €100 billion market serviced by traditional banking software vendors and in-house solutions.” She will be joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy now, pay later (BNPL) offerings have existed for a long time, but increased in popularity as the pandemic made more people shop online and conserve cash</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though BNPL has taken off in most parts of the world, it’s yet to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pick up steam in Africa. But in countries such as South Africa and Egypt, there is a newfound surge in demand for such services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest development, <a href="https://sympl.ai/">Sympl</a>, an Egyptian fintech founded only five months ago, announced today that it has picked up $6 million in seed funding following a soft launch in October</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245234" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beco Capital led the five-month-old startup’s seed round, while A15 and Global Ventures participated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-el-shabrawy-el-feky-4071739">Mohamed El-Feky</a>, <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/yasmine-mohamed-henna-9ab474113">Yasmine Henna</a>, and <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/karim-tawfik-a8a3aa45">Karim Tawfik</a> started Sympl in August this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We all joined forces to establish Sympl because we all share the vision that there is a huge opportunity for the buy now, pay later here in Egypt, given its very populous market,” founder and CEO El-Feky told TechCrunch on a call.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a consumer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> driven market where we have a lot of accessibility to consumer products and services, online or offline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s a little twist to Sympl’s offerings which the founders made in a bid to localize its product for the Egyptian market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the CEO’s words, Sympl operates a save your money, pay later model rather than the normal buy now, pay later model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sympl says it targets over 50 million debit and credit cardholders in the country. And like any BNPL service, the company wants to incentivize a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of this demographic at checkout, in-store or online.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no pre-registration required and payment plans approved at checkout, Sympl allows merchants to sell </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to consumers on short-term, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interest-free (zero-interest) payment plans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A typical BNPL model involves a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> split into </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> equal payments. The first payment, usually 25% of the total </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at checkout, while the rest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are paid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in three installments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sympl operates a different method the company says will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">help its customers save better while making purchases</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The platform is an evolution of customers’ checkout experience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than promoting purchasing, it gives customers more choices at the checkout and promotes customer saving, flexible cash flow management, and a better matching of income and expenditure, without compromising their lifestyle,” the company said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When customers check out from one of Sympl’s merchants, the company acknowledges the funds in the customers’ bank accounts and charges them an upfront fixed fee of 100 Egyptian pounds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The fee covers the future collection of repayments and remains the same irrespective of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Sympl offers customers the option to use a zero-interest pay later plan. The rest of the payments can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between three to five installments. The company said that the plans</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">cater to different segments of customers’ employment status &#8212; gig workers, freelancers, self-employed and regular employees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the saving that we do to the customer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So instead of spending all your money right now on a single transaction, you can walk out of the store having the product and having your money in your pocket while paying it on three to five equal payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It can be on a monthly, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bi-weekly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or weekly basis,” said the CEO. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zip acquisition of Payflex means Africa is ripe for BNPL disruption&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/zip-acquisition-of-payflex-means-africa-is-ripe-for-bnpl-disruption/embed/#?secret=iIlkWVzuWu" data-secret="iIlkWVzuWu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sympl’s launch in October was strategic. For a week, it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exclusively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> partnered with Tradeline, the largest reseller of the iPhone 13 in Egypt, so customers could only buy the phone online or offline via Sympl</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During our launch, we were lucky enough because Mohamed and I had a lot of partners who worked with us at valU (the consumer fintech where both worked before Sympl). And because of our success back then, they came to us as merchants and wanted to partner with us at Sympl,” said CCO Henna.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They like the platform because they think it’s unique because, for the first time in Egypt, we’re offering debit or pay later options for the debit card population in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sympl has onboarded up to 240 merchants with products in electronics, fashion, appliances, furniture, travel, healthcare, jewellery and education, the company said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It plans to reach 1,000 stores by mid next year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henna also mentioned that Sympl is growing 25% week-on-week </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the number of transactions made on the platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sympl will use the investment to e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">xpand its merchant network, build technical upgrades and enhancements, hire more talent and expand its footprint across Egypt to cover all 27 governorates in the country (it’s currently in two)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">El-Feky said when the company raises its next round of investment, expansion outside Egypt will be on the cards. The most likely destination? Saudi Arabia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is one of the most vibrant markets and populous markets and has similar demographics and consumer behaviour. So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this would be our first regional step out of Egypt.”</span></p>
