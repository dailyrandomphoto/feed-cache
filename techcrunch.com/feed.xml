										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.pula-advisors.com/">Pula</a>, a Kenyan insurtech startup that specialises in digital and agricultural insurance to derisk millions of smallholder farmers across Africa, has closed a Series A investment of $6 million.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was led by Pan-African early-stage venture capital firm, </span><a href="https://tlcomcapital.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TLcom Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with participation from nonprofit</span> <a href="https://www.womensworldbanking.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women’s World Banking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The raise comes after Pula closed $1 million in seed investment from Rocher Participations with support from Accion Venture Lab, Omidyar Network and several angel investors in 2018.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by </span><a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/rose-goslinga-523926b3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rose Goslinga</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/thomas-njeru-75850028"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas Njeru</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2015, Pula delivers agricultural insurance and digital products to help smallholder farmers navigate climate risks, improve their farming practices and bolster their incomes over time.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agriculture insurance has traditionally relied on farm business. In the U.S. or Europe with typically large farms, an average insurance premium is $1,000. But in Africa, where smallholding or small-scale farms are the norms, the number stands at an average of $4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is particularly telling that the value of agricultural insurance premiums in Africa represents less than 1 percent of the world&#8217;s total when the continent has 17 percent of the world&#8217;s arable land. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This disparity stems from the fact that the traditional method of calculating insurance through farm visits is often unaffordable for these smallholder farmers. Thus, they are often neglected from financial protection against climate risks like flood, drought, pestilence and hail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pula is solving this problem by using technology and data. Through its</span><a href="https://www.pula-advisors.com/products-and-services/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Area Yield Index Insurance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> product, the insurtech startup leverages machine learning, crop cuts experiments and data points relating to weather patterns and farmer losses, to build products that cater to various risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But getting farmers on board has never been easy, Goslinga told TechCrunch. According to her, Pula has understood not to sell insurance directly to small-scale farmers, because they can suffer from optimism bias. “Some think a climate disaster wouldn’t hit their farms for a particular season; hence, they don&#8217;t ask for insurance initially. But if they witness any of these climate risks during the season, they would want to get insurance, which is counterproductive to Pula,” said the founder in a phone call.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2099839" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2099839" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2099839 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pula-Farmer-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1282" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pula-Farmer-1.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pula-Farmer-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pula-Farmer-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pula-Farmer-1.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pula-Farmer-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pula-Farmer-1.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pula-Farmer-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2099839" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pula</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the startup instead partners with banks. Banks provide loans to farmers and make it compulsory for them to have insurance. With the loan, banks can pay the insurance on behalf of the farmers at the start of the season. But at the end of the season, the farmer has to repay the loan with interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The unit economics doesn’t work for us to work with farmers directly. But with banks, we know they provide loans to farmers with much better margins to pay for insurance. Also, we work together with government subsidy programs since they&#8217;re also interested in protecting their farmers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through its partnerships with banks, governments and agricultural input companies, Pula is at the center of an ecosystem that provides insurance to smallholder farmers and has amassed 50 insurance partners and six reinsurance partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its clientele includes the likes of the World Food Programme and Central Bank of Nigeria as well as the Zambian and Kenyan governments.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Social enterprises like One Acre Fund, startups like Apollo Agriculture, and agribusiness giants like Flour Mills and Export Trading Group are also among Pula’s clients.</span></p>
<h3>Co-CEOs with agricultural backgrounds</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Goslinga met Njeru in 2008, she worked for Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture (SFSA). There, she started </span><a href="https://kilimosalama.wordpress.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilimo Salama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as a micro-insurance program for more than 200,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda. She met Njeru who was the lead actuary at UAP Insurance, a partner to the Kilimo Salama program, at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After staying with Syngenta for six years and recognising the need to provide standard insurance products for smallholder farmers, Goslinga left to start Pula with Njeru in 2015. However, it wasn&#8217;t until two years later that Njeru joined fulltime as he had a six-year engagement with Deloitte South Africa from 2012 as a consultant actuary. The pair both act as co-CEOs.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When Thomas and I launched Pula in 2015, we had one goal in mind: to build and deliver scalable insurance solutions for Africa’s 700 million smallholder farmers,&#8221; Goslinga said. &#8220;With our latest funding, now is the time to break into new ground. In our five years since launching, we’ve built strong traction for our products. However, the fact remains that across Africa and other emerging markets, there are still millions of smallholder farmers with risks to their livelihoods that have not been covered.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Goslinga, the COVID-19 pandemic helped Pula double its footprint and size as rural farming activities and operations continued despite pandemic-induced lockdowns. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2099838" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2099838" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2099838 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pula-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Thomas-Njeru-Rose-Goslinga-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="431" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pula-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Thomas-Njeru-Rose-Goslinga-1.jpg 1777w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pula-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Thomas-Njeru-Rose-Goslinga-1.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pula-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Thomas-Njeru-Rose-Goslinga-1.jpg?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pula-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Thomas-Njeru-Rose-Goslinga-1.jpg?resize=768,486 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pula-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Thomas-Njeru-Rose-Goslinga-1.jpg?resize=680,431 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pula-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Thomas-Njeru-Rose-Goslinga-1.jpg?resize=1536,972 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pula-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Thomas-Njeru-Rose-Goslinga-1.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2099838" class="wp-caption-text">Pula co-founders and Co-CEOs (Rose Goslinga and Thomas Njeru)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the new financing will scale up operations in its existing 13 markets across Africa, where it has insured over 4.3 million farmers. They include Senegal, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique. Likewise, the Kenyan startup hopes to propel its expansion for smallholder farmers in Asia and Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pula is one of the few African startups disrupting the farming industry with technology. Its Series A investment attests that investors&#8217; appetite for agritech startups is still on the rise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A week ago, Aerobotics, a South African startup that uses artificial intelligence to help farmers protect their trees and fruits from risks, raised a Series B round of $17 million. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/sunculture-wants-to-turn-africa-into-the-worlds-next-bread-basket-one-solar-water-pump-at-a-time/">SunCulture, a Kenyan startup</a> that provides solar power systems, water pumps and irrigation systems for small-scale farmers, raised $14 million. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another startup is Apollo Agriculture <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/kenyas-apollo-agriculture-raises-6m-series-a-led-by-anthemis/">which raised $6 million Series A</a>, akin to Pula. Not only did the pair raise the same round, Apollo Agriculture and Pula both deal with providing financial resources to smallholder farmers. But while both companies might look like competitors, even to the admission of Goslinga, she argues that the startups are partners and complement each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the new fundraise, TLcom’s senior partner </span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/omobola-johnson-b12461183"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omobola Johnson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will join Pula’s board. However, it was her colleague, <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/maurizio-caio-1580a97" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maurizio Caio</a>, the firm&#8217;s managing partner, who had something to say about the round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The potential for the insurance market for smallholder farmers in Africa is huge, and under the leadership of Rose and Thomas, Pula has rapidly established a strong presence throughout the continent and has several high-profile clients on their books. We are confident of Pula’s potential for growth in spite of the pandemic and look forward to partnering with them as they execute the next phase of their journey,” he said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>For the lead investor, Pula&#8217;s investment marks the culmination of its busiest run of investments having led and co-led rounds in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/nigerias-okra-raises-1m-from-tlcom-connecting-bank-accounts-to-apps/">Okra</a>, Shara, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/nigerias-autochek-raises-3-4m-for-car-sales-and-service-platform/">Autochek</a> and Ilara Health within the past year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinajuhasz"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina Juhasz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CIO at Women&#8217;s World Banking, the other investor in the round, explained that the organisation cut a check for Pula &#8220;given the legions of women engaged in small-hold farming and securing the food supply for communities around the globe.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://getalma.eu">Alma</a> is raising a $59.4 million Series B funding round (€49 million). The company has been building a new payment option for expensive good. You can choose to pay over three or four installments. This product sounds familiar if you’ve used <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/">Klarna</a> in the past. But Klarna isn’t available in France.</p>
<p>Cathay Innovation, Idinvest, Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund, Seaya Ventures and Picus Capital are participating in today’s funding round. In addition to today’s equity round, Alma is raising a credit line of $25.5 million (€21 million) to finance merchant payments.</p>
<p>What makes Alma attractive to merchants is that the startup is handling 100% of the risk involved with a payment over multiple installments. When a customer buys a bike over four installments, they’ll get charged over several months. But the merchant gets paid on day one.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since I first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/alma-is-a-klarna-like-payment-startup-that-lets-you-buy-now-and-pay-later/">covered</a> Alma, the startup has launched the ability to pay later. You enter your card information right now but you get charged 15 days or a month later. It can be particularly useful if you’re unsure about something you’re buying and if you think there’s a chance you’ll send it back.</p>
<p>And it’s an attractive option in France where debit cards are the norm — not credit cards. Alma also plans to offer longer plans, such as the ability to buy now and pay over 6, 10 or 12 installments.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new influx of cash, the startup plans to triple the size of its team and reach €1 billion in annual payment volume within two years. It’s also going to expand to other countries, but with a specific focus on helping French merchants reach European customers living in other European countries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dubai-based cybersecurity startup SpiderSilk has raised $2.25 million in a pre-Series A round, led by venture firms Global Ventures and STV.</p>
<p>In the past two years, SpiderSilk has discovered some of the biggest data breaches: Blind, the allegedly anonymous social network that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/blind-anonymous-app-data-exposure/">exposed private complaints</a> by Silicon Valley employees; a lab leaked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/samsung-source-code-leak/">highly sensitive Samsung source code</a>; an inadvertently public code repository revealed apps, code, and apartment building camera footage belonging to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/clearview-source-code-lapse/">controversial facial recognition startup Clearview AI</a>; and a massive spill of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/moviepass-thousands-data-exposed-leak/">unencrypted customer card numbers</a> at now-defunct MoviePass may have been the final nail in the already-beleaguered subscription service&#8217;s casket.</p>
<p>Much of those discoveries were found from the company&#8217;s proprietary internet scanner, SpiderSilk co-founder and chief security officer Mossab Hussein told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Any company would want their data locked down, but mistakes happen and misconfigurations can leave sensitive internal corporate data accessible from the internet. SpiderSilk helps its customers understand their attack surface by looking for things that are exposed but shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity startup uses its scanner to map out a company&#8217;s assets and attack surfaces to detect vulnerabilities and data exposures, and it also simulates cyberattacks to help customers understand where vulnerabilities are in their defenses.</p>
<p>&#8220;The attack surface management and threat detection platform we built scans the open internet on a continuous basis in order to attribute all publicly accessible assets back to organizations that could be affected by them, either directly or indirectly,&#8221; SpiderSilk&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive Rami El Malak told TechCrunch. &#8220;As a result, the platform regularly uncovers exploits and highlights how no organization is immune from infrastructure visibility blind-spots.&#8221;</p>
<p>El Malak said the funding will help to build out its security, engineering and data science teams, as well as its marketing and sales. He said the company is expanding its presence to North America with sales and engineering teams.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the company&#8217;s second round of funding, after a seed round of $500,000 in November 2019, also led by Global Ventures and several angel investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SpiderSilk team are outstanding partners, solving a critical problem in the ever-complex world of cybersecurity, and protecting companies online from the increasing threats of malicious activity,&#8221; said Basil Moftah, general partner at Global Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There is no lack of state funding for China&#8217;s smart driving startups nowadays as the country advances its goal to become a global leader in artificial intelligence in a decade&#8217;s time. The latest to get a financial boost is Uisee, a Beijing-based company founded by a group of tech veterans including the former head of Intel Labs China, Wu Gansha.</p>
<p>Uisee said Monday it has closed a funding round north of 1 billion yuan ($150 million) from investors including the National Manufacturing Transformation and Upgrade Fund, a $21 billion state-backed fund <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-fund-manufacturing-idUSKBN1XU02M">set up in 2019</a> to promote and upgrade the manufacturing value chain in China, with the Ministry of Finance as the biggest shareholder.</p>
<p>Five-year-old Uisee is the first autonomous driving company the Fund has ever backed, according to the announcement, and the firm is expected to help propel forward the public transit and logistics sectors and become a &#8220;benchmark&#8221; autonomous driving enterprise in China, said a manager from the Fund in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike Mobileye or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/momenta-profile/">China&#8217;s Momenta</a>, which sell advanced driver-assistance systems as they invest in the development of more advanced Level 4 driving, Uisee leapfrogs ADAS and focuses on unmanned driving, co-founder and CEO Wu Gansha said in a previous <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAwMzQ4OTE5Mg==&amp;mid=2654428948&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=084fc21c835bb132d0944f5fa0394c08&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=0511c877PeBIfwEO00dnrDCl&amp;key=b28b03434249256b4f0d164da8b6cfc72a9c9e9a8a9bb401e6169bfe8becd969bb8c14a2bae0ed85913a4b4d1085338f&amp;ascene=0&amp;uin=MTQxMjA2OTEyMQ%3D%3D&amp;devicetype=iMac+MacBookAir7%2C2+OSX+OSX+10.10.5+build(14F27)&amp;version=11000003&amp;pass_ticket=fkfoLtpBMPj4TCoqlnYMA10f4aEEjngtCXgMI7RzOzM7m%2FXCcITA0ZFszaoqf%2BQQ">interview</a>.</p>
<p>Uisee supplies technology for cases ranging from robotaxis and city buses to airports and logistics hubs. It&#8217;s secured a handful of major customers, including the Hong Kong International Airport, which is using Uisee&#8217;s solutions to <a href="https://www.hongkongairport.com/en/media-centre/news-stories-updates/AET">automate its baggage tractors</a>, alongside state-backed automakers FAW Group, Dongfeng Motor, and more.</p>
<p>The new financial injection, which also counts a number of undisclosed &#8220;industrial investors,&#8221; will allow Uisee to ramp up research and development and promote the industry&#8217;s at-scale monetization. The company claims that the joint venture between SAIC Motor, General Motors, and Liuzhou Wuling Motors has used its technology to enable 300,000 kilometers of vehicle operation without safety drivers inside a logistics hub.</p>
<p>Existing investors include Bosch the German electronics giant, which participated in Uisee&#8217;s Series B round last year, alongside Shenzhen government-backed Shenzhen Capital Group and state-backed CCI Investment.</p>
<p>Several other Chinese startups have also received sizable fundings in recent months to accelerate their smart driving solutions such as WeRide, which closed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/weride-200-million-funding/">Series B</a> of $310 million at the start of 2021; chipmaker Horizon Robotics, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/horizon-robotics-700-million-funding/">landed $150 million</a> in December; Pony.ai, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/chinese-autonomous-vehicle-startup-pony-ai-hits-5-3-billion-valuation/">pocked $267</a> million in November; and ride-hailing platform Didi, which from last May <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/softbank-pours-500m-into-didi-in-chinas-biggest-autonomous-driving-round/">raised $500 million</a> for its new entity dedicated to autonomous driving.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German drone technology startup <a href="https://wingcopter.com">Wingcopter</a> has raised a $22 million Series A – its first significant venture capital raise after mostly bootstrapping. The company, which focuses on drone delivery, has come a long way since its founding in 2017, having developed, built and flown its Wingcopter 178 heavy-lift cargo delivery drone using its proprietary and patented tilt-rotor propellant mechanism, which combines all the benefits of vertical take-off and landing with the advantages of fixed-wing aircraft for longer distance horizontal flight.</p>
<p>This new Series A round was led by Silicon Valley VC Xplorer Capital, as well as German growth fund Futury Regio Growth. Wingcopter CEO and founder Tom Plümmer explained to the in an interview that the addition of an SV-based investor is particularly important to the startup, since it&#8217;s in the process of preparing its entry into the U.S., with plans for an American facility, both for flight testing to satisfy FAA requirements for operational certification, as well as eventually for U.S.-based drone production.</p>
<p>Wingcopter has already been operating commercially in a few different markets globally, including in Vanuatu in partnership with Unicef for vaccine delivery to remote areas, in Tanzania for two-way medical supply delivery working with Tanzania, and in Ireland where it completed the world&#8217;s first delivery of insulin by drone beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS, the industry&#8217;s technical term for when a drone flies beyond the visual range of a human operator who has the ability to take control in case of emergencies).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>While Wingcopter has so far pursued a business as an OEM manufacturer of drones, and has had paying customers eager to purchase its hardware effectively since day one (Plümmer told me that they had at least one customer wiring them money before they even had a bank account set up for the business), but it&#8217;s also now getting into the business of offering drone delivery-as-a-service. After doing the hard work of building its technology from the ground up, and seeking out the necessary regulatory approvals to operate in multiple markets around the world, Plümmer says that he and his co-founders realized that operating a service business not only meant a new source of revenue, but also better-served the needs of many of its potential customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We learned during this process, through applying for permission, receiving these permissions and working now in five continents in multiple countries, flying BVLOS, that actually operating drones is something we are now very good at,&#8221; he said. This was actually becoming a really good source of income, and ended up actually making up more than half of our revenue at some point. Also looking at scalability of the business model of being an OEM, it&#8217;s kind of [&#8230;] linear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Linear growth with solid revenue and steady demand was fine for Wingcopter as a bootstrapped startup founded by university students supported by a small initial investment from family and friends. But Plümmer says the company say so much potential in the technology it had developed, and the emerging drone delivery market, that the exponential growth curve of its drone delivery-as-a-service model helped make traditional VC backing make sense. In the early days, Plümmer says Wingcopter had been approached by VCs, but at the time it didn&#8217;t make sense for what they were trying to do; that&#8217;s changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were really lucky to bootstrap over the last four years,&#8221; Plümmer said. &#8220;Basically, just by selling drones and creating revenue, we could employ our first 30 employees. But at some point, you realize you want to really plan with that revenue, so you want to have monthly revenues, which generally repeat like a software business – like software as a service.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1942346" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1942346" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-1942346" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/wingcopter-merck-NZYL5598.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/wingcopter-merck-NZYL5598.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/wingcopter-merck-NZYL5598.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/wingcopter-merck-NZYL5598.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/wingcopter-merck-NZYL5598.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/wingcopter-merck-NZYL5598.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/wingcopter-merck-NZYL5598.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/wingcopter-merck-NZYL5598.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/wingcopter-merck-NZYL5598.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1942346" class="wp-caption-text">Wingcopter 178 cargo drone performing a delivery for Merck.</p></div></p>
<p>Wingcopter has also established a useful hedge regarding its service business, not only by being its own hardware supplier, but also by having worked closely with many global flight regulators on their regulatory process through the early days of commercial drone flights. They&#8217;re working with the FAA on its certification process now, for instance, with Plümmer saying that they participate in weekly calls with the regulator on its upcoming certification process for BVLOS drone operators. Understanding the regulatory environment, and even helping architect it, is a major selling point for partners who don&#8217;t want to have to build out that kind of expertise and regulatory team in-house.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company will continue to act as an OEM as well, selling not only its Wingcopter 178 heavy-lift model, which can fly up to 75 miles, at speeds of up to 100 mph, and that can carry payloads up to around 13 lbs. Because of its unique tilt-rotor mechanism, it&#8217;s not only more efficient in flight, but it can also fly in much windier conditions – and take-off and land in harsher conditions than most drones, too.</p>
<p>Plümmer tells me that Wingcopter doesn&#8217;t intend to rest on its laurels in the hardware department, either; it&#8217;s going to be introducing a new model of drone soon, with different capabilities that expand the company&#8217;s addressable market, both as an OEM and in its drones-as-a-service business.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/99p6jYPHImE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>With its U.S. expansion, Wingcopter will still look to focus specifically on the delivery market, but Plümmer points out that there&#8217;s no reason its unique technology couldn&#8217;t also work well to serve markets including observation and inspection, or to address needs in the communication space as well. The one market that Wingcopter doesn&#8217;t intend to pursue, however, is military and defense. While these are popular customers in the aerospace and drone industries, Plümmer says that Wingcopter has a mission &#8220;to create sustainable and efficient drone solutions for improving and saving lives,&#8221; and says the startup looks at every potential customer and ensures that it aligns with its vision – which defense customers do not.</p>
<p>While the company has just announced the close of its Series A round, Plümmer says they&#8217;re already in talks with some potential investors to join a Series B. It&#8217;s also going to be looking for U.S. based talent in embedded systems software and flight operations testing, to help with the testing process required its certification by the FAA.</p>

<p>Plümmer sees a long tail of value to be built from Wingcopter&#8217;s patented tilt-rotor design, with potential applications in a range of industries, and he says that Wingcopter won&#8217;t be looking around for any potential via M&amp;A until it has fully realized that value. Meanwhile, the company is also starting to sow the seeds of its own potential future customers, with training programs in drone flights and operations it&#8217;s putting on in partnership with UNICEF&#8217;s African Drone and Data Academy. Wingcopter clearly envisions a bright future for drone delivery, and its work in focusing its efforts on building differentiating hardware, plus the role it&#8217;s playing in setting the regulatory agenda globally, could help position it at the center of that future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buzzy live voice chat app Clubhouse has confirmed that it has raised new funding – without revealing how much – in a Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz through the firm&#8217;s partner Andrew Chen. The app was reported to be raising at a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/clubhouse-gets-investment-interest-at-1-billion-valuation">$1 billion valuation in a report from The Information</a> that landed just before this confirmation. While we try to track down the actual value of this round and the subsequent valuation of the company, what we do know is that Clubhouse has confirmed it will be introducing products to help creators on the platform get played, including subscriptions, tipping and ticket sales.</p>
<p>This funding round will also support a &#8216;Creator Grant Program&#8217; being set up by Clubhouse, which will be used to &#8220;support emerging Clubhouse creators&#8221; according to the startup&#8217;s<a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/welcoming-more-voices"> blog post</a>. While the app has done a remarkable job attracting creator talent, including high-profile celebrity and political users, directing revenue towards creators will definitely help spur sustained interest, as well as more time and investment from new creators who are potentially looking to make a name for themselves on the platform, similar to YouTube and TikTok influencers before them.</p>
<p>Of course, adding monetization for users also introduces a method for Clubhouse itself to monetize. The platform is free to all users, and doesn&#8217;t yet offer any kind of premium plan or method of charging users, nor is it ad-supported. Adding ways for users to pay other users provides an opportunity for Clubhouse to retain a cut for its services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The plans around monetization routes for creators appear to be relatively open-ended at this point, with Clubhouse saying it&#8217;ll be launching &#8220;first tests&#8221; around each of the three areas it mentions (tipping, tickets and subscriptions) over the &#8220;next few months.&#8221; It sounds like these could be similar to something like a Patreon built right into the platform. Tickets are a unique option that would go well with Clubhouse&#8217;s more formal roundtable discussions, and could also be a way that more organizations make use of the platform for hosting virtual events.</p>
<p>The startup also announced that it will be starting work on its Android app (it&#8217;s been iOS only for now) and that it will also invest in more backend scaling to keep up with demand, as well as support team growth and tools for detecting and prevuing abuse. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495419/clubhouse-conversation-antisemitism-content-moderation">Clubhouse has come under fire for its failure in regards to moderation and prevention of abuse in the past</a>, so this aspect of its product development will likely be closely watched. The platform will also see changes to discovery aimed at surfacing relevant users, groups (&#8216;clubs&#8217; in the app&#8217;s parlance) and rooms.</p>
<p>During a regular virtual town hall the app&#8217;s founders host on the platform, CEO Paul Davison revealed that Clubhouse now has 2 million weekly active users. It&#8217;s also worth noting that Clubhouse says it now has &#8220;over 180 investors&#8221; in the company, which is a lot for a Series B – though many of those are likely small, independent investors with very little stake.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has set a new all-time record for the most satellites launched and deployed on a single mission, with its Transporter-1 flight on Sunday. The launch was the first of SpaceX&#8217;s dedicated rideshare missions, in which it splits up the payload capacity of its rocket among multiple customers, resulting in a reduced cost for each but still providing SpaceX with a full launch and all the revenue it requires to justify lauding one of its vehicles.</p>
<p>The launch today included 143 satellites, 133 of which were from other companies who booked rides. SpaceX also launched 10 of its own Starlink satellites, adding to the already more than 1,000 already sent to orbit to power SpaceX&#8217;s own broadband communication network. During a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/spacex-delivers-60-more-starlink-satellites-in-first-launch-of-2021-and-sets-new-falcon-9-rocket-reusability-record/">launch broadcast last week</a>, SpaceX revealed that it has begun serving beta customers in Canada and is expanding to the UK with its private pre-launch test of that service.</p>
<p>Customers on today&#8217;s launch included Planet Labs, which sent up 48 SuperDove Earth imaging satellites; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/swarm-prices-out-its-orbital-iot-networks-hardware-and-services/">Swarm, which sent up 36</a> of its own tiny IoT communications satellites, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/kepler-will-build-its-small-satellites-at-a-new-manufacturing-facility-in-toronto/"> Kepler, which added to its constellation</a> with eight more of its own communication spacecraft. The rideshare model that SpaceX now has in place should help smaller new space companies and startups like these build out their operational on-orbit constellations faster, complementing other small payload launchers like Rocket Lab, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/virgin-orbit-reaches-orbit-for-the-first-time/">new entrant Virgin Orbit</a>, to name a few.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This SpaceX launch was also the first to deliver Starlink satellites to a polar orbit, which is a key part of the company&#8217;s continued expansion of its broadband service. The mission also included a successful landing and recovery of the Falcon 9 rocket&#8217;s first-stage booster, the fifth for this particular booster, and a dual recovery of the fairing halves used to protect the cargo during launch, which were fished out of the Atlantic ocean using its recovery vessels and will be refurbished and reused.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Brazil to Nigeria, people turn to Bitcoin for different reasons than most of their speculating counterparts in North America. Namely, because it’s the most advantageous way for them to conduct international transactions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the case with a 28-year-old poker player in Brazil who simply goes by Felipe, for safety. Poker is a </span><a href="https://iclg.com/practice-areas/gambling-laws-and-regulations/brazil#:~:text=Currently%2C%20poker%20is%20considered%20a,land%2Dbased%20and%20online%20versions.&amp;text=After%20almost%20a%20decade%20of,of%20Provisional%20Measure%20168%2F2004"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of gambling in Brazil, so Felipe can use Brazilian banks and regulated exchanges to earn income from home. He dropped out of law school because playing poker against foreigners with Bitcoin to spend was more profitable than becoming a partner at a local law firm. Felipe said he now outearns his brother, a middle-tier executive at one of Brazil’s top corporations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bitcoin is the best medium of money exchange in the poker community,” Felipe said. “I withdraw earnings as Bitcoin, or as Tether, to a Brazilian crypto exchange and sell it there.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felipe said he is wary of his government because he believes the Brazilian economy will experience a catastrophic shock in the next few years. Back in 1992, President Fernando Collor de Mello was </span><a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1999-07-01/corruption-and-political-reform-brazil-impact-collors-impeachment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">impeached</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after</span><a href="https://www.joc.com/brazil-brings-end-its-failed-economic-plan_19920818.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> confiscating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> millions of civilian savings accounts to offset national debts. Felipe doesn’t want his bank account forcibly emptied when the next crisis hits. This inspires him to accumulate Bitcoin, avoiding more traditional options stocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pension funds system is completely broken,” Felipe added. “The thing with Bitcoin is, you don’t need it until you do.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manuel Folgueiras is one of many Cuban users who joined the Bitcoin ecosystem over the past year. This 33-year-old economist, who lost his tourism industry job in 2020, now supports himself using various cryptocurrency projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s very difficult to get Bitcoin, because we don’t have access to any exchanges and there are a lot of scams. Cuban banks don’t have relationships with crypto exchanges,” Folgueiras said. “Now I use Bitcoin for both savings and income, through trading arbitrage. We have to use a VPN and it’s very risky. If the exchange detects that you’re from Cuba, your account will get blocked.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global demand for Bitcoin has been </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/bitcoin-passes-20k-and-reaches-all-time-high/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the pandemic began in 2020, pushing dollar-denominated prices </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-hits-30k-for-1st-time-ever"><span style="font-weight: 400;">briefly past $34,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the first week of January, 2021. For residents in many emerging markets, demand for Bitcoin is driven by concerns about the overall health of their national economies, not pure speculation. Some of these countries where Bitcoin markets are spiking, especially in </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/money-reimagined-warnings-from-an-argentine-tragedy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/how-bitcoin-fits-into-lebanons-banking-crisis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle East</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, are seeing their domestic economies tailspin and are worried political controls could further threaten economic stability.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">since </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-remittances/in-blow-to-struggling-cubans-western-union-offices-close-as-sanctions-bite-idUSKBN2840CI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western Union</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stopped operating in Cuba, more Cubans are </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/50491/cuba-bitcoin-adoption"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than ever before. For people in a variety of countries, pandemic policy changes reduced access to the dollar-centric financial system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folgueiras estimated he is one of roughly 80,000 people on the island involved in an unofficial brokerage business called Trust Investing, often called a </span><a href="https://www.cubalite.com/trust-investing-cuba/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ponzi scheme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY_rfUfe1CM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local technologists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In short, the business promises to trade cryptocurrency on behalf of “investors,” to whom they deposit lucrative returns. The </span><a href="https://tulipresearch.com/es/trust-investing-esquema-ponzi-latinoamerica/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">project promises 200% returns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which seems impossible, and references questionable “partners” on the Trust Investing website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those partner companies are registered to people associated with a variety of <a href="https://www.jusbrasil.com.br/processos/nome/55224452/diego-ribeiro-chaves" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jusbrasil.com.br/processos/nome/55224452/diego-ribeiro-chaves&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1611605525458000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFC9wOxJzg4hqltr-QS3d5H7Bmznw">court cases</a> across Latin America and, both <a href="http://www.supervalores.gob.pa/attachments/article/10471/TRUST-INVESTING_esp.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.supervalores.gob.pa/attachments/article/10471/TRUST-INVESTING_esp.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1611605525458000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHMIRRQI7v7k9GfK-UIIuR1UYK7Yw">Panama</a>’s Superintendencia del Mercado de Valores (SMV) and Spain&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnmv.es/Portal/ResultadoBusqueda.aspx?tipo=1&amp;nombre=blue%20empire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnmv.es/Portal/ResultadoBusqueda.aspx?tipo%3D1%26nombre%3Dblue%2520empire&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1611605525458000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_6wBGkK1CoIhEVGMDON0qA_sAJA">National Securities Market Commission</a> (CNMV) published <span style="color: #000000;">warnings </span>not to trust the Trust Investing company itself. Even Folgueiras acknowledged that many people call this </span><a href="https://www.archyworldys.com/ponzi-trust-investing-scheme-under-scrutiny-as-cuba-becomes-its-new-hotbed-beincrypto/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business a scam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But he said returns from the Trust Investing program are helping him survive the abysmal job market. It’s a gamble whether the company will give him returns or run away with his money, a risk he’s willing to take. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, Folgueiras added, any form of Bitcoin business in Cuba is already “very risky.” There aren’t many regulated, trustworthy exchanges openly serving Cubans today, due to </span><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/cuba-sanctions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. sanctions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Aside from the remittance startup, </span><a href="https://bitremesas.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BitRemesas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cuba-libra-island-nation-slowly-explores-cryptocurrency-options"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last compliance-oriented startup </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that tried serving this market </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-cuba-youtube-influencer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shut down </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2019. As such, many Cubans turn to questionable schemes, or WhatsApp, instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cubans get Bitcoin via WhatsApp groups, peer-to-peer trading. The most popular mobile wallets are Coinomi, Enjin Wallet and Trust Wallet, because most people in Cuba only use a cell phone. It’s a mobile-only market,” Folgueiras said. “Bitcoin changed my life in a positive way and became an important source of income. Cryptocurrencies are also an interesting way for Cubans to shop online and send international payments or remittances.” </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With investors expecting a Latin American cryptocurrency boom, Mexico&#8217;s Bitso raises $62 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/with-investors-expecting-a-latin-american-cryptocurrency-boom-mexicos-bitso-raises-62-million/embed/#?secret=eSec137f3C" data-secret="eSec137f3C" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This grassroots, mobile-only environment is common across many small countries with underdeveloped economics. Likewise, Fodé Diop, founder of the Dakar Bitcoin Developers meetup in Senegal, told </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/africa-bitcoin-developer-dakar-cypherpunk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinDesk </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year that Senegal was not just a mobile-first market; it’s a mobile-only Bitcoin scene. Unlike North America and Europe, many emerging-market crypto communities only use cell phones for everything from research and trading to storage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, it would be a mistake to assume most emerging-market Bitcoin users are marginalized by the global banking system. To the contrary, in countries like Nigeria and Brazil, many upper-middle-class entrepreneurs and gamers use Bitcoin to conduct perfectly legal business. According to data from the global </span><a href="https://www.usefultulips.org/combined_Sub%20Saharan%20Africa_Page.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">peer-to-peer (P2P) markets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> LocalBitcoins and Paxful, there were more than </span><a href="https://www.usefultulips.org/combined_Latin%20America_Page.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$25.3 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worth of P2P Bitcoin trades last year in Brazil alone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in Africa, Nigerian P2P Bitcoin volumes dwarf those numbers with a cool</span><a href="https://www.usefultulips.org/combined_Sub%20Saharan%20Africa_Page.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $357 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Likewise, </span><a href="https://buycoins.africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BuyCoins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-founder Tomiwa Lasebikan said his Nigerian cryptocurrency exchange ballooned from an average of $5 million in monthly volume in December 2019 to $21 million by December 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said several factors spurred local growth, including anti-police brutality activists like the </span><a href="https://bitcoinundco.com/en/nigerian-feminist-coalition/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian Feminist Coalition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which collected bitcoin donations after being </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nigerian-activists-bitcoin-endsars-police-brutality"><span style="font-weight: 400;">denied banking access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-banks-currency/nigerian-banks-to-limit-debit-card-spending-abroad-to-ease-fx-risk-idUSKCN24K0E9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stricter banking limitations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Nigerians paying for international services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people in Nigeria are running into a problem that they couldn’t renew subscriptions, like Spotify or Amazon, with their Nigerian accounts,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lasebikan said. “Then, i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n October, there was a whole lot of interest in cryptocurrency, not just Bitcoin, for aggregating donations for people protesting police brutality. A lot of activists had their bank accounts shut down. Continued fundraising like this, both inside and outside the country, would not have been possible two decades ago.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added his exchange startup now serves roughly 12,000 active users a month. Nearby, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pwXPp2gcPQ&amp;feature=youtu.be"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> communications lead in Nigeria, Damilola Odufuwa, said her global exchange company facilitated hundreds of virtual events for 17,000 Nigerian crypto beginners in 2020. These educational programs covered basic terminology, trading strategies and guides to opening exchange accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the pandemic, it was hard to get things into the country, including remittances,” Odufuwa said. “Now there’s also this need to use cryptocurrency to donate [to activists]&#8230;we plan to at least quadruple educational programming this year.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the user&#8217;s socioeconomic background, people use Bitcoin to earn income from online games like poker, trading cryptocurrencies or offering freelance services to international clients.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such LocalBitcoins user in Latin American, Venezuelan journalist José Rafael Peña, has been earning the majority of his income in Bitcoin since late 2016. He estimated that cryptocurrency writing gigs account for 90% of his income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bitcoin, in some circumstances, is a very helpful tool, especially when you live in a country with a chaotic economy and limited financial tools,” Peña said. “I began using Bitcoin because it let me protect against the </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy/dollars-growing-dominance-in-venezuela-leaves-locals-short-changed-idUSKBN2951D8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bolivar’s devaluation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, even without a dollar bank account.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All things considered, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Odufuwa said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">emerging markets saw “tremendous” growth since the pandemic began. But Peña warned not to confuse that growth with a mainstream “solution” to local government woes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most people try to survive the crisis in any way,” he said. “Even here, crypto is a niche.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/PSIcspDHbu0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SpaceX is set to launch the very first of its dedicated rideshare missions – an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/spacex-will-now-offer-dedicated-rideshare-launches-for-small-satellites/">offering it introduced in 2019</a> that allows small satellite operators to book a portion of a payload on a Falcon 9 launch. SpaceX&#8217;s rocket has a relatively high payload capacity compared to the size of many of the small satellites produced today, so a rideshare mission like this offers smaller companies and startups a chance to get their spacecraft in orbit without breaking the bank. Today&#8217;s attempt is scheduled for 10 AM EST (7 AM PST) after a first try yesterday was cancelled due to weather. So far, weather looks much better for today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The cargo capsule atop the Falcon 9 flying today holds a total of 143 satellites according to SpaceX, which is a new record for the highest number of satellites being launched on a single rocket – beating out a payload of 104 spacecraft delivered by Indian Space Research Organization&#8217;s PSLV-C37 launch back in February 2017. It&#8217;ll be a key demonstration not only of SpaceX&#8217;s rideshare capabilities, but also of the complex coordination involved in a launch that includes deployment of multiple payloads into different target orbits in relatively quick succession.</p>

<p>This launch will be closely watched in particular for its handling of orbital traffic management, since it definitely heralds what the future of private space launches could look like in terms of volume of activity. Some of the satellites flying on this mission are not much larger than an iPad, so industry experts will be paying close attention to how they&#8217;re deployed and tracked to avoid any potential conflicts.</p>
<p>Some of the payloads being launched today include significant volumes of startup spacecraft, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/swarm-prices-out-its-orbital-iot-networks-hardware-and-services/">36 of Swarm&#8217;s tiny IoT network satellites</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/kepler-will-build-its-small-satellites-at-a-new-manufacturing-facility-in-toronto/">eight of Kepler&#8217;s GEN-1 communications satellites</a>. There are also 10 of SpaceX&#8217;s own Starlink satellites on board, and 48 of Planet Labs&#8217; Earth-imaging spacecraft.</p>
<p>The launch stream above should begin around 15 minutes prior to the mission start, which is set for 10 AM EST (7 AM PST) today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With record funding levels and three unicorns to show, local investors are buoyant about Romania&#8217;s prospects heading into 2021. We caught up with eight of them recently, and heard how the country&#8217;s technical talent pool, broadband access and low cost of living have positioned it for the era of remote-first global companies across industries.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The momentum from last year includes 58 startups that raised total funding of €30.39 million, <a href="https://www.howtoweb.co/romanian-venture-report-2020/">according to a new report</a> just out from long-time Romanian conference How To Web. This represents a 6% increase in the volume of investments overall, and a 51% increase of investments year on year overall. A significant part of these numbers came from companies raising money for the first time.</span></p>
<p>Key industries include cybersecurity, enterprise software and fintech, with many “super-geeky teams, with deep expertise in the field” as one investor put it. “We are very focused on Romanian founders,&#8221; said another. But because of significant emigration in recent years, &#8220;they can reside and launch anywhere in the world.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here are the investors in their own words, for any TechCrunch reader who is interested in hiring, investing or founding a company in the country:</p>

<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Given the incipient stage of Romanian ecosystem, our fund is industry agnostic. On a personal note, I&#8217;m interested in verticals like supply chain, mobility, proptech, circular/sharing economy.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Our latest investment is a start-up in the digital fitness industry.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
I would like to see more solutions in supply chain, as I believed that this industry needs a paradigm shift.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
1. Relevant market 2. Good product 3. Excellent team 4. Fit with us</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
I believe that in marketing and finance is difficult to enter or you need something really different. In terms of products/services, marketplaces need to evolve in order to be competitive</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We are strongly focused on Romania</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not long-term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Romanian ecosystem is still in infancy, but with a high velocity and very good prospects for the future. I believe that we will see soon more Romanian unicorns, including from our portfolio</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
As said above &#8211; still in early stages, but full of opportunities and going full speed</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Not for Romania. The ecosystem is still based on few cities like Bucharest, Cluj, Iasi and the hubs within those cities</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Apart from traditional HoReCa (Hotel/Restaurant/Café) businesses and overall trends, we didn&#8217;t see much impact. Actually, any start-up that promotes digitization in a specific industry (e.g. proptech) gained momentum in this period.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?</strong><br />
We tried to be as normal as possible and maintain a steady flow of business. We advise founders to look after their teams and customers and be careful with cash</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, as mentioned above.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
We always need to be positive and not exaggerate about the pandemic. It will pass.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Cristian Munteanu, Managing partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dancristianmunteanu/">Early Game Ventures</a></h3>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Given our limited geographical scope (we invest only in Romania), we have to have a generic approach and consider many verticals and trends. Just as an example, we are looking at startups applying technologies that reached mass adoption to niche fields: computer vision applied to specific crops (agritech) or applied to in-store customer behaviour (martech); biometric data (collected through wearable devices) applied to group interactions as opposed to single individuals; ultra-light blockchain ledgers applied to smart buildings&#8230; From another investment perspective, we are looking to invest in what we call &#8220;the infrastructure for innovation&#8221; such as startups building APIs &#8212; we believe that Romania is not yet API-fied enough.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
The last term sheet we signed was with a startup that is building technology to help enterprise-level companies to better manage their software licenses. Super-geeky team, with deep expertise in the field, creating a lot of value to their customers.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
I would like to find great teams trying to make in-game payments easier (building at the intersection of payments and gaming), or working on Irrigation-as-a-Service (agritech), or building a NASDAQ for energy.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
I am looking for founders that are both super competent and brave. Such people will dare tackle big problems and will have a chance to succeed at solving it.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve seen too many startups building apps to help people find parking spots, too many marketplaces that no one need, too much off the shelf technology for marketing, too many CRMs and ERPs.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We are investing only in Romania — 100% committed to the local ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not long-term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
I think that, given the natural potential of Romania, agritech has a big chance; still this space is not fully serviced yet. Otherwise, cybersecurity, enterprise software, and fintech are quite well represented. From our portfolio of almost 20 startups, CODA is enabling managed service providers with cybersecurity skills; Humans is building a hub for synthetic media technologies; Mechine is making agricultural equipment speak to each other; Tokinomo is collecting and analyzing data from the shelf (in-store marketing); BunnyShell is building next-gen cloud tech and making it easy for anyone to set up servers in three clicks.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
The startup ecosystem in Romania is very young, with the first local VC funds established three years ago with support from the European Investment Fund. And yet, Romania is home to three unicorns and many other promising startups. The large technical talent pool, the widely spread broadband access and the low costs of doing business and living turn Romania into a market to keep an eye on.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I expect founders from the big cities to stay in the big cities as setting up and working for a startup does not mean writing code on the laptop from a remote beach. In the tormenting search for product-market fit, founders need to talk business, visit partners, sign contracts, attend events, meet peers, do surveys, prototype and one thousand other things that cannot be done on Zoom to their full extent. The tech industry and the startupland took a hit from the pandemic as the rest of the world. And just as the rest of the world, they will survive, adapt, and mostly return to the normal interactions from before March 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Unfortunately, I saw urban mobility apps suffer from the restrictions imposed by the pandemic. Also, anything related to restaurants, hotels and conventional events was badly affected. We are invested in startups in these verticals and made everything we could to help them during the worst days of the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Our fund registered a 20% decrease in the numbers of investments in 2020 compared to 2019 and a 40% decrease in the total value of deals; so the impact of COVID was significant. At the same time, in terms of fund performance, 2020 was a good year, with companies in our portfolio raising new investment rounds with outside investors, increasing their valuation, and showing good returns. The first half of 2020 was dedicated to damage control measures and supporting the portfolio companies, but the situation changed towards the end of the year, with high new deals activity in the last quarter (higher than in Q4 2019). VC-backed startups had investors to turn to in harsh times and benefited from support and additional funds when needed; things were much more difficult for the rest of the startups though.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Probably the first thing we noticed the moment the pandemic started was a peak in productivity. During the months of mandatory shelter at home, the early-stage startups working on their prototypes put in extra-hours and gained speed. Personnel retention was good, people were focused, there was a positive spirit and a general desire to make things happen. Indeed, some startups reported an immediate boost of sales, such as Tokinomo whose robots replace the human promoters in supermarkets.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The highlight of 2020 was the week I spent on a magnificent yacht sailing with friends through the islands in Greece. It was a recharging moment that gave me a boost for the rest of the year. The next elating moment came in December with the Series A investments that increased our fund&#8217;s performance.</p>

<h3>Andrei Pitis, Founding partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/simplecapital/">Simple Capital</a></h3>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Startups creating world leading Intellectual Property with Romanian and broader Eastern European founders</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
<a href="http://Uniapply.com">Uniapply.com</a></p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Strong committed founders with deep understanding of the domain they are planning to disrupt on a global scale through innovative intellectual property.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
I think too many people are trying to launch platforms without much understanding of how hard it is to launch it in the absence of a major differentiator. Customer acquisition through other digital marketing platforms is very expensive if there is no other unfair advantage to launch such a platform.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We are very focused on Romanian founders — but they can reside and launch anywhere in the world. We have investments in many US-based companies started by Romanian founders.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not long-term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
I think Romania is very well positioned to win in cybersecurity and enterprise software as well as AI-based engines. I am very excited about pentest-tools.com, deepstash.com, uniapply.com from our portfolio as well as Fintech OS and TypingDNA that are not in our portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Bucharest is a thriving ecosystem with plenty of opportunities ripe for global expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Indeed we have seen a surge in founders from smaller cities in Romania. We are founding partners of the Innovation Labs pre-accelerator that has a nationwide footprint and we are seeing more and more students interested in becoming founders all over Romania.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Mobility solutions are impacted, local players are losing to bigger players like Lime.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
The pandemics delayed a lot of the investments, but we closed them toward the end of the year. Biggest worries for founders is that they have less and less leverage as a startup to attract tech talent. The problem is that the tech people can now work for any company in the world and this skyrocketed their salaries/rates.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes we have seen — some of them benefited from people staying at home and having more time.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The introduction of the vaccine and the pace at which people are vaccinated in Romania, that is not the fastest but also not the slowest either. An online platform for appointments is up and running and people are using it!</p>

<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Health &amp; wellbeing are areas that &#8220;helped&#8221; by the pandemic crisis are on brink of transformation and growth. A blend of software and hardware readiness is developing fast together with the openness of clients and regulatory authorities.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Food delivery services. It is still day 0 with great opportunities ahead in terms of consumer services and business growth: food, ready to cook meals, convenience items, grocery, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
It is still room to grow on B2C and B2B2C fintech space despite relatively high numbers of startups.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Bucharest and Romania in general have great potential when we look at talent pool from tech perspective and are a great place to start to scale regional and globally.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Great place to come: great infrastructure (internet cost &amp; speed, number of hubs), talent pool and increased number of investments transactions in last 3 years.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I expect to see a growth but not a surge of founders from other geographies. And I believe thats a good thing for the ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Travel is both exposed and in the same time with great potential for new startups to come. There will be a &#8220;revenge travel&#8221; period from consumers but they will look for something different and in the same time business travel will not be the same and this will generate new practices and behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
We see opportunities to grow and we are allocating more capital for investments and we are advising our startups to invest more and grow faster.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The start of the vaccine campaign across the globe and the initial results.</p>

<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
B2B platforms enabled by ML/automation/AI in fintech, SaaS enterprise software, cybersecurity, healthcare IT, low-code development environments, conversational technologies, automation in logistics</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
&#8211; <a href="https://www.eu-startups.com/2021/01/bucharest-based-druid-snaps-up-2-million-to-expand-its-conversational-tech-internationally/">Latest</a> investment was DruidAI, announced on January 12th, 2021. GapMinder led a $2.5M round.<br />
&#8211; Other 2020 exciting new investments or follow-ons: TypingDNA, FintechOS, DeepStash, Soleadify, Machinations, Innoship, Frisbo, Cartloop, XVision</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
&#8211; Stage: Seed or Series A<br />
&#8211; Technology: Automation or conversational technology assisted by ML or AI<br />
&#8211; Team: Mature with track-record for International expansion;<br />
&#8211; Product: B2B scalable international, with B2B platforms as main focus</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Copies of B2C models (from US) that are borne in CEE tend to be limited to small local markets, and evolve into highly crowded environments. Shared economy companies borne in Romania are such examples. Unit economics were simply not attractive for us as VC investor.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
More than 70%</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not long-term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
&#8211; Models we consider will continue to thrive: B2B platforms enabled by automation/conversational technologies (assisted by ML/AI) have a higher potential for internationalisation vs B2C models.<br />
&#8211; Reg verticals with higher potential, we mentioned above a few.<br />
&#8211; GapMinder portfolio exciting companies: FintechOS, TypingDNA, DeepStash, DruidAI, Soleadify, Machinations, Innoship, Frisbo, Cartloop, SmartDreamers, XVision, among others</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Romania (in cities such as Bucharest, Cluj, Timisoara, Brasov, Oradea and Iasi) is a high-opportunity market, with excellent teams, startups borne with international vision, excellent environment for automation and ML enabled projects.</p>
<p>The ecosystem becomes more mature, from coverage of pre-seed rounds towards Series A, while not overcrowded yet.<br />
Overall, a high opportunity environment for Series B and late Series A investors from US or rest of Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
The hubs are concentrated in terms of education pool, potential customers (B2B or more sophisticated B2C) to test new products, potential investors on the pre-seed phase that are crucial for the initial steps of start-up developments.</p>
<p>For more advanced start-ups, hyper-growth is important, therefore the capability to scale up and go international might be helped by the presence in certain hubs.<br />
In other words, there is a complex mix that the hubs are offering. So, at Romanian level, we do not expect a diminishing role of the hubs.</p>
<p>At European or US level, it is debatable if main hubs are too overcrowded or over-expensive for the teams. However, the business growth potential for the more advanced start-ups is important.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
The behaviour of users, both internal and external, has migrated towards a need for autonomy, which drives the need for:<br />
&#8211; Tools that allow conversational interactions (including in natural language) with evolved human like feeling<br />
&#8211; Remote collaborative low code development tools<br />
&#8211; A general need for all companies (from the smallest ones to enterprise) to move yesterday to digital interactions</p>
<p>In 2020 a lot of consumers and companies were forced to focus on core priorities, and move to secondary focus the &#8220;nice-to-have&#8221; services or products. The VCs have seen even a sharper delimitation between high-tech and tech-enabled companies, not to mention some &#8220;interesting&#8221; proofs of Fake Tech. This shift has impacted lots of verticals, and such shift might be here to stay.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
GapMinder&#8217;s strategy described above is focussed on companies that actually have been benefiting from the tide of urgency in accelerating digital transformations of companies. And we seen it in the 2x-3x growth of most of our portfolio companies in 2020.<br />
Our advices to our portfolio companies have been simple:<br />
1. Cash is king. Make sure you have an 18 months minimum runway. If an opportunity to raise, seriously consider it.<br />
2. Customers are the most important partners you have. Listen to them<br />
3. The team is your most important asset. Keep it close and take care of it in these daring times.<br />
4. Act fast</p>
<p>Of course, on top of the above, we had very specific conversations with each team.</p>
<p>To be candid, this all looks good at the end of 2020, but the first half of 2020 has been intense for founders in our portfolio and filled with doubts about decisional freeze in some verticals, stress on implementation in international markets wherever travel was needed, alignment between teams inside larger companies. Looking back, this was just normal. We feel fortunate to be part of the life of such great teams and start-ups, that proved so good during tough times.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, we already felt signs of recovery in second half of 2020, especially Q4.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Starting at scale the vaccination against COVID-19 in last 6 weeks is definitely the most important positive sign at human level, society level, but also from a pure business perspective.<br />
In our team, GapMinder, we feel optimistic!</p>

<p>Yes and no, in more established ecosystems a surge in founders coming from geographies outside major cities might be an outcome, the onset of remote work will bring a major boost to startups, although talented technical employees will become more and more difficult to onboard.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Our investment strategy remains unchanged, the most commons worries of founders in our portfolio are linked to attracting new funding partners, lack of foresight in some target markets and difficulty in finding employees in certain verticals.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey y&#8217;all. You’ve just landed on Human Capital, the weekly newsletter that details the latest in labor, and diversity and inclusion in tech. The week kicked off with GitHub making a public apology to the person the company terminated for cautioning his employees about Nazis in D.C. on the day of the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later in the week, Google revoked corporate access from AI ethicist Margaret Mitchell in what some are saying is reminiscent of the company&#8217;s treatment of Dr. Timnit Gebru. Meanwhile, Instacart is making some changes to its platform that will result in job loss. </span></p>

<p><b>GitHub’s head of HR resigns; company offers fired Jewish employee his job back</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A GitHub internal investigation revealed the company made &#8220;significant errors of judgment and procedure&#8221; in the firing of the Jewish employee who cautioned his coworkers about the presence of Nazis in the D.C. area on the day of insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/githubs-head-of-hr-resigns-in-light-of-termination-of-jewish-employee/">In a blog post</a>, GitHub COO Erica Brescia said the company&#8217;s head of HR took full responsibility for what happened and resigned from the company yesterday. GitHub did not disclose the name of the person who resigned, but it&#8217;s widely known that Carrie Olesen was the chief human resources officer at GitHub.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GitHub said it has &#8220;reversed the decision to separate with the employee&#8221; and is talking to his representative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To the employee we wish to say publicly: We sincerely apologize,&#8221; Brescia said in the blog post. However, the terminated employee previously told me that he did not want his job back but instead some other form of reconciliation.</span></p>
<p><b>Google AI ethicist under investigation </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google is investigating AI ethicist Margaret Mitchell for reportedly using automated scripts to find examples of mistreatment of Dr. Timnit Gebru, </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-google-is-investigating-the-actions-of-another-top-ai-ethicist-50030739-ea3d-4ea2-b452-c228b4fc9773.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Axios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Gebru says she was fired from Google while Google has maintained that she resigned. In a statement to Axios, Google said the company had locked Mitchell’s account:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our security systems automatically lock an employee’s corporate account when they detect that the account is at risk of compromise due to credential problems or when an automated rule involving the handling of sensitive data has been triggered. In this instance, yesterday our systems detected that an account had exfiltrated thousands of files and shared them with multiple external accounts. We explained this to the employee earlier today.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recently-formed Alphabet Workers Union </span><a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/press/releases/retaliation-against-margaret-mitchell/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">made a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saying it was concerned by Mitchell’s suspension of corporate access:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Regardless of the outcome of the company’s investigation, the ongoing targeting of leaders in this organization calls into question Google’s commitment to ethics—in AI and in their business practices. Many members of the Ethical AI team are AWU members and the membership of our union recognizes the crucial work that they do and stands in solidarity with them in this moment.”</span></p>
<p><b>Google’s Sundar Pichai to meet with HBCU leaders</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least five HBCU presidents are scheduled to meet with Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Chief Diversity Officer Melonie Parker later this month to discuss recent allegations of racism and discrimination at the company, </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/19/business/google-sundar-pichai-hbcus/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Additionally, the goal of the meeting is to ensure HBCUs have a good relationship with Google and that the company offers a good environment for its students and graduates.</span></p>

<p><b>Amazon launches anti-union website</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama gearing up to vote on whether to form a union, Amazon launched an anti-union website. Called Do It Without Dues, the site aims to dissuade workers from voting to unionize.</span></p>
<p><b>Instacart plans to terminate nearly 2,000 jobs </b></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/instacart-is-eliminating-the-jobs-of-unionized-workers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instacart plans to lay off nearly 2,000 of its workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including the 10 workers from the Kroger-owned Mariano&#8217;s who unionized early last year,</span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9deg/instacart-says-it-will-lay-off-all-of-its-unionized-workers"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These workers are responsible for in-store shopping and packing of groceries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Vice, 10 of the workers affected unionized with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1546 in Skokie, Illinois. However, they have yet to negotiate a contract with Instacart, according to Vice. Instacart notified the union of the planned changes earlier this week. </span><a href="https://www.ufcw.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/61/files/2021/01/Jan-2021-Instacart-Fires-Nearly-2000-Grocery-Workers.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Instacart said it planned to stop using in-store shoppers at Kroger-owned stores, which includes the Mariano&#8217;s store in Skokie, in Q1 and Q2 of this year, but no earlier than mid-March.</span></p>

<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>We’re shaking things up this weekend in the newsletter, focusing on a series of larger themes and news items instead of having a few discrete sections. Why? Because there was too much to fit into our usual format. If you were a fan of the original layout, we’ll be back to it next week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today we’re talking Coinbase’s growth, how Juked.gg tapped the equity crowdfunding market, a noodle or two on the a16z media game, Talkspace’s SPAC, VC and founder predictions for 2021, and where’s the right place to found a company.</p>
<p>Sound good? Let’s get into it!</p>
<h2>Coinbase’s deposits scale ahead of IPO</h2>
<p>Thanks to Kazim Rizvi of <a href="https://www.joindrop.com/">Drop</a>, parent company to <a href="https://www.cardify.ai/">Cardify</a> which provides data on consumer spending, we have a look into how quickly deposits have scaled at American cryptocurrency platform Coinbase. As Coinbase has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">filed to go public</a>, and we’re eagerly anticipating its eventual S-1 filing, we were stoked to get a directional look at how quickly consumer interest was growing for the assets it helps folks buy.</p>
<p>They are scaling rapidly. Using the first week of January 2019 as a baseline, by the last week of December 2020 deposits and withdrawals from Coinbase had grown by more than 12x apiece. That’s staggering growth, and while the data is somewhat volatile &#8212; and we’d treat it as directional instead of exact &#8212; on a week-to-week basis, it underscores how well companies like Coinbase may be performing as Bitcoin booms once again, bringing in more trading interest and consumer demand.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2099673" style="width: 1068px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2099673" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2099673 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-6.16.46-PM.png" alt="" width="1058" height="455" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-6.16.46-PM.png 1058w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-6.16.46-PM.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-6.16.46-PM.png?resize=300,129 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-6.16.46-PM.png?resize=768,330 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-6.16.46-PM.png?resize=680,292 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-6.16.46-PM.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1058px) 100vw, 1058px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2099673" class="wp-caption-text">Via Cardify, Cardify data.</p></div></p>
<p>The Cardify data also indicates a multiplying of new customer acquisition at Coinbase over the same time period, and deposits scaling alongside the price of Bitcoin. As Bitcoin has topped the $30,000 mark recently, sharply higher than in recent quarters, the price gains may have helped Coinbase not only a solid Q4 2020, but perhaps put it on a path for a bonkers Q1 2021 as well.</p>
<p>If we were 10/10 excited about the Coinbase S-1 before this dataset, we’re now a heckin’ 12/10.</p>
<h2>Equity crowdfunding seven-figures for esports content</h2>
<p>Esports is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/venture-investment-in-esports-looks-light-as-q1-races-to-a-close/">super cool</a> and if you don’t agree, you are incorrect. But it doesn’t matter if you or I are right or not on the question, as the market has <a href="https://twitter.com/JukedGG/status/1352660400974819328">largely decided</a> that competitive gaming is worth time, attention and investors&#8217; money.</p>
<p>The proliferation of esports leagues and games and the like has led to a decidedly fragmented universe, however, lacking a central hub akin to what ESPN provides the world of traditional sports.</p>
<p>But not to worry, <a href="http://juked.gg">Juked.gg</a> just raised capital to build a content hub for esports. This means that old folks like myself can still find out when tournaments are happening, and enjoy a dabble of League of Legends or Starcraft 2 pro play when we can, sans hunting around the internet for dates and times.</p>
<p>Juked.gg went through 500 Startups (more on its class <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/meet-500-startups-26th-batch-of-startups/">here</a>), catching our eye at the time as a neat nexus for esports-related content. Now flush with a little over $1 million that it <a href="https://republic.co/juked">raised on the Republic platform</a>, it has big plans.</p>
<p>The Exchange spoke with Juked.gg’s co-founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/FishStix">Ben Goldhaber</a> about his company’s performance to date. Per Goldhaber, Juked has scaled from 500 users when it launched in late 2019, to 50,000 in December of 2020. Ahead, Juked may invest more in journalism, more into social features, and more into user-generated content. We’ll have more on Juked as it gets its vision built, now powered by over a million dollars from 2,524 investors, each betting that the startup is building the right product to help unify a growing, if distributed, entertainment category.</p>
<h2>The a16z media push</h2>
<p>To preserve our collective sanity, I’m not going to bang on at length here, but <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/andreessen-horowitz-looks-to-launch-opinion-publication-as-its-media-ambition-grows">building out content at a VC firm is not new</a>. Hell, how long ago did the First Round Review launch? What a16z appears to have in mind is different in scale, not substance. We chatted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-only-take-about-the-future-of-media-is-that-media-is-the-future/">about it on Equity this week</a>, in case you need more on the matter.</p>
<h2>Talkspace’s maybe-not-stupid SPAC</h2>
<p>While it is <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1316021080906108936">enjoyable</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1351509195095494658">to</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1282680178653696000">mock</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1352338223725490185">SPACs</a>, featuring as many do companies that are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/2021-a-spac-odyssey/">nascent to say the least</a>, not all SPAC-led debuts are as silly as the rest. This is the case with the impending Talkspace deal, the deck for which you can read <a href="https://hudsoninvestcorp.com/investors">here</a>.</p>
<p>What matters is this set of charts:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2099665 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-4.31.17-PM.png" alt="" width="1018" height="506" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-4.31.17-PM.png 1018w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-4.31.17-PM.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-4.31.17-PM.png?resize=300,149 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-4.31.17-PM.png?resize=768,382 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-4.31.17-PM.png?resize=680,338 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-4.31.17-PM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1018px) 100vw, 1018px" /></p>
<p>Look at that! Historical revenue growth! Improving gross margins! Rising gross profit!</p>
<p>You may argue that the company is not really worth an enterprise value of $1.4 billion that it will sport after its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/talkspace-to-merge-with-hudson-executive-investment-corp-forming-the-only-publicly-traded-pure-play-virtual-behavioral-health-company-301207080.html">combination</a> with Hudson Executive Investment Corp., but, hey, at least it’s a real business.</p>
<h2>How VCs and founders see 2021 differently</h2>
<p>Seed VC <a href="https://www.nfx.com/">NFX</a> dropped a VC and founder survey the other day that I’ve been meaning to share with you. You can read the whole thing <a href="https://www.nfx.com/post/survey-results-14-predictions-for-2021/">here</a>, if you’d like.</p>
<p>I have two pull-outs for you this morning:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">VCs are more bullish on the economy than founders, with around 30% of founders expecting consumer spending to stay flat or decline, positions that only around 17% of VCs agreed with.</li>
<li aria-level="1">And when it comes to leaving the Bay Area &#8212; yes, that chestnut again &#8212; 35% of founders have itchy feet, while just 20% of investors are similarly inclined. I think this is because the latter have houses in the Bay Area while most founders do not. But it should temper the view that all the money and talent are leaving. They aren’t.</li>
</ol>
<h2>There’s no place like no place</h2>
<p><a href="https://initialized.com/">Initialized Capital</a> put together <a href="https://blog.initialized.com/2021/01/data-post-pandemic-silicon-valley-isnt-a-place/">some data</a> on where founders think it is best to found a company. In 2020, nearly 42% of surveyed founders said the Bay Area. By 2021 that number had slipped to a little over 28%, with a plurality of 42% indicating that a distributed company is the best way to go.</p>
<p>I hear about this a lot from early-stage founders. They are often building what I call micro-multinationals, small companies that have a few employees in one country, and then a handful in others. Making that setup work is going to be a hotspot for HR software I reckon.</p>
<p>Regardless, the requirement of founding companies in the Bay Area is kaput. The advantages of founding there will linger much longer.</p>
<h2>Coming up!</h2>
<p>Coming up on The Exchange next week: The first entries of our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups/">new $50 million ARR series</a>, featuring interviews with Assembly, SimpleNexus, Picsart, OwnBackup and others. And we have some $100 million ARR interviews in the can, as well.</p>
<p>Finally, to keep the The Powers That Be happy, The Exchange covered some neat stuff this week, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/in-2020-vcs-invested-428m-into-us-based-startups-every-day/">American VC results</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/fintech-startups-and-unicorns-had-a-stellar-q4-2020/">fintech and unicorn venture capital</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/how-vcs-invested-in-asia-and-europe-in-2020/">European and Asian venture capital results</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/hot-ipos-hang-onto-gains-as-investors-keep-betting-on-tech/">how the IPO market is even more bonkers than you thought</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/a-first-look-at-qualtrics-ipo-pricing/">notes on what Qualtrics may be worth when it goes public</a>.</p>
<p>Hugs, and let’s all get a nap in,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Howdy friends, this is the web version of my Week in Review newsletter, it&#8217;s here to entice you to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">sign up</a> and get it in your inbox every week.</p>
<p>Last week, I showcased how Twitter was looking at the future of the web with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/"> a decentralized approach</a> so that they wouldn&#8217;t be stuck unilaterally de-platforming the next world leader. This week, I scribbled some thoughts on another aspect of the future web, the ongoing battle between Facebook and Apple to own augmented reality. Releasing the hardware will only be the start of a very messy transition from smartphone-first to glasses-first mobile computing.</p>
<p>Again, if you so desire you can get this in your inbox from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><span class="s1">newsletter page</span></a>, and follow my tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny"><span class="s1">@lucasmtny</span></a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<hr />
<h1>The Big Thing</h1>
<p>If the last few years of new &#8220;reality&#8221; tech has telegraphed anything, it&#8217;s that tech companies won&#8217;t be able to skip past augmented reality&#8217;s awkward phase, they&#8217;re going to have to barrel through it and it&#8217;s probably going to take a long-ass time.</p>
<p>The clearest reality is that in 2021 everyday users still don&#8217;t seem quite as interested in AR as the next generation of platform owners stand to benefit from a massive transition. There&#8217;s some element of skating to where the puck is going among the soothsayers that believe AR is the inevitable platform heir etc. etc., but the battle to reinvent mobile is at its core a battle to kill the smartphone before its time has come.</p>
<p><strong>A war to remake mobile in the winner&#8217;s image</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s fitting that the primary backers of this AR future are Apple and Facebook, ambitious companies that are deeply in touch with the opportunities they could&#8217;ve capitalized on if they could do it all over again.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While Apple and Facebook both have thousands of employees toiling quietly in the background building out their AR tech moats, we&#8217;ve seen and heard much more on Facebook&#8217;s efforts. The company has already served up several iterations of their VR hardware through Oculus and has discussed publicly over the years how they view virtual reality and augmented reality hardware converging. </span></p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s hardware and software experiments have been experimentations in plain sight, an advantage afforded to a company that didn&#8217;t sell any hardware before they started selling VR headsets. Meanwhile Apple has offered up a developer platform and a few well-timed keynote slots for developers harnessing their tools, but the most ambitious first-party AR project they&#8217;ve launched publicly on iOS has been a measuring tape app. Everything else has taken place behind closed doors.</p>
<p>That secrecy tends to make any reporting on Apple&#8217;s plans particularly juicy. This week, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses">story</a> from Bloomberg&#8217;s Mark Gurman highlights some of Apple&#8217;s next steps towards a long-rumored AR glasses product, reporting that Apple plans to release a high-end niche VR device with some AR capabilities as early as next year. It&#8217;s not the most surprising but showcases how desperate today&#8217;s mobile kingpins are to ease the introduction of a technology that has the potential to turn existing tech stacks and the broader web on their heads.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TCh3jI8zG3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/apple-said-to-be-working-a-high-priced-standalone-vr-headset-as-debut-mixed-reality-product/">Apple said to be working a high-priced standalone VR headset as debut mixed reality product</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple said to be working a high-priced standalone VR headset as debut mixed reality product&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/apple-said-to-be-working-a-high-priced-standalone-vr-headset-as-debut-mixed-reality-product/embed/#?secret=TCh3jI8zG3" data-secret="TCh3jI8zG3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Both Facebook and Apple have a handful of problems getting AR products out into the world, and they&#8217;re not exactly low-key issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>hardware isn&#8217;t ready</li>
<li>platforms aren&#8217;t ready</li>
<li>developers aren&#8217;t ready</li>
<li>users don&#8217;t want it yet</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a daunting wall, but isn&#8217;t uncommon among hardware moonshots. Facebook has already worked its way through this cycle once with virtual reality over several generations of hardware, though there were some key difference and few would call VR a mainstream success quite yet.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there&#8217;s a distinct advantage to tackling VR before AR for both Facebook and Apple, they can invest in hardware that&#8217;s adjacent to the technologies their AR products will need to capitalize on, they can entice developers to build for a platform that&#8217;s more similar to what&#8217;s coming and they can set base line expectations for consumers for a more immersive platform. At least this would all be the case for Apple with a mass market VR device closer to Facebook&#8217;s $300 Quest 2, but a pricey niche device as Gurman&#8217;s report details doesn&#8217;t seem to fit that bill quite so cleanly.</p>
<p><strong>The AR/VR content problem </strong></p>
<p>The scenario I&#8217;d imagine both Facebook and Apple are losing sleep over is that they release serviceable AR hardware into a world where they are wholly responsible for coming up with all the primary use cases.</p>
<p>The AR/VR world already has a hefty backlog of burnt developers who might be long-term bullish on the tech but are also tired of getting whipped around by companies that seem to view the development of content ecosystems simply as a means to ship their next device. If Apple is truly expecting the sales numbers of this device that Bloomberg suggests &#8212; similar to Valve&#8217;s early Index headset sales &#8212; then color me doubtful that there will be much developer interest at all in building for a stopgap device, I&#8217;d expect ports of Quest 2 content and a few shining stars from Apple-funded partners.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this will me much of a shortcut for them.</p>
<p>True AR hardware is likely going to have different standards of input, different standards of interaction and a much different approach to use cases compared to a device built for the home or smartphone. Apple has already taken every available chance to entice mobile developers to embrace phone-based AR on iPhones through ARKit, a push they have seemed to back off from at recent developer-centric events. As someone who has kept a close eye on early projects, I&#8217;d say that most players in the space have been very underwhelmed by what existing platforms enable and what has been produced widely.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s really not great for Apple or Facebook and suggests that both of these companies are going to have to guide users and developers through use cases they design. I think there&#8217;s a convincing argument that early AR glasses applications will be dominated by first-party tech and may eschew full third-party native apps in favor of tightly controlled data integrations more similar to how Apple has approached developer integrations inside Siri.</p>
<p>But giving developers a platform built with Apple or Facebook&#8217;s own dominance in mind is going to be tough to sell, underscoring the fact that mobile and mobile AR are going to be platforms that will have to live alongside each other for quite a bit. There will be rich opportunities for developers to create experiences that play with 3D and space, but there are also plenty of reasons to expect they&#8217;ll be more resistant to move off of a mutually enriching mobile platform onto one where Facebook or Apple will have the pioneer&#8217;s pick of platform advantages. What&#8217;s in it for them?</p>
<p>Mobile&#8217;s OS-level winners captured plenty of value from top-of-funnel apps marketplaces, but the down-stream opportunities found mobile&#8217;s true prize, a vastly expanded market for digital ads. With the opportunity of a mobile do-over, expect to find pioneering tech giants pitching proprietary digital ad infrastructure for their devices. Advertising will likely be augmented reality&#8217;s greatest opportunity allowing the digital ads market to create an infinite global canvas for geo-targeted customized ad content. A boring future, yes, but a predictable one.</p>
<p>For Facebook, being a platform owner in the 2020s means getting to set their own limitations on use cases, not being confined by App Store regulations and designing hardware with social integrations closer to the silicon. For Apple, reinventing the mobile OS in the 2020s likely means an opportunity to more meaningfully dominate mobile advertising.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a do-over to the tune of trillions in potential revenues.</p>
<p><strong>What comes next</strong></p>
<p>The AR/VR industry has been stuck in a cycle of seeking out saviors. Facebook has been the dearest friend to proponents after startup after startup has failed to find a speedy win. Apple&#8217;s long-awaited AR glasses are probably where most die-hards are currently placing their faith.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there are any misgivings from Apple or Facebook in terms of what a wild opportunity this is to win, it&#8217;s why they each have more people working on this than any other future-minded project. AR will probably be massive and change the web in a fundamental way, a true Web 3.0 that&#8217;s the biggest shift of the internet to date.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t sound like something that will happen particularly smoothly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that these early devices will arrive later than we expect, do less than we expect and that things will be more and less different from the smartphone era&#8217;s mobile paradigms in ways we don&#8217;t anticipate. I&#8217;m also sure that it&#8217;s going to be tough for these companies to strong-arm themselves into a more seamless transition. This is going to be a very messy for tech platforms and is a transition that won&#8217;t happen overnight, not by a long shot.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-alphabet-is-shutting-down-loon-internet/"><strong>The Loon is dead</strong></a><br />
One of tech&#8217;s stranger moonshots is dead, as Google announced this week that Loon, it&#8217;s internet balloon project is being shut down. It was an ambitious attempt to bring high-speed internet to remote corners of the world, but the team says it wasn&#8217;t sustainable to provide a high-cost service at a low price. <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-alphabet-is-shutting-down-loon-internet/">More</a></strong></p>

I talked a couple weeks ago &#8212; what feels like a lifetime ago &#8212; about how Facebook&#8217;s temporary ban of Trump was going to be a nightmare for the company. I wasn&#8217;t sure how they&#8217;d stall for more time of a banned Trump before he made Facebook and Instagram his central platform, but they made a brilliant move, purposefully tying the case up in PR-favorable bureaucracy, tossing the case to their independent Oversight Board for their biggest case to date.<strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/facebook-oversight-board-trump-facebook-suspension/">More</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/jack-ma-resurfaces/"><strong>Jack is Back</strong></a><br />
Alibaba&#8217;s head honcho is back in action. Alibaba shares jumped this week when the Chinese e-commerce giant&#8217;s billionaire CEO Jack Ma reappeared in public after more than three months after his last public appearance, something that stoked plenty of conspiracies. Where he was during all this time isn&#8217;t clear, but I sort of doubt we&#8217;ll be finding out. <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/jack-ma-resurfaces/">More</a></strong></p>

Trump is no longer President, but in one of his final acts, he surprisingly opted to grant a full pardon to one Anthony Levandowski, the former Google engineer convicted of stealing trade secrets regarding their self-driving car program. It was a surprising end to one of the more dramatic big tech lawsuits in recent years. <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/former-google-engineer-anthony-levandowski-among-list-of-last-minute-trump-pardons/">More</a></strong></p>

I&#8217;m not sure how this stacks in importance relative to what else is listed here, but I&#8217;m personally pissed that Microsoft is hiking the price of their streaming subscription Xbox Live Gold. It&#8217;s no secret that the gaming industry is embracing a subscription economy, it will be interesting to see what the divide looks like in terms of gamer dollars going towards platform owners versus studios.  <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/xbox-live-gold-is-getting-a-big-price-increase/">More</a></strong></p>

Elon Musk, who is currently the world&#8217;s richest person, tweeted out this week that he will be donating $100 million towards a contest to build the best technology for carbon capture. TechCrunch learned that this is connected to the Xprize organization. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/elon-musk-is-donating-100m-to-find-the-best-carbon-capture-technology/">More details</a></p>

&#8220;After setting a $35 to $39 per-share IPO price range, Poshmark sold shares in its IPO at $42 apiece. Then it opened at $97.50. Such was the exuberance of the stock market regarding the used goods marketplace’s debut.<br />
But today it’s worth a more modest $76.30 — for this piece we’re using all Yahoo Finance data, and all current prices are those from yesterday’s close ahead of the start of today’s trading — which sparked a question: How many recent tech IPOs are also down from their opening price?&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/hot-ipos-hang-onto-gains-as-investors-keep-betting-on-tech/"><strong>More</strong></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Would you bet millions of dollars on a corporate travel comeback? Doesn’t matter. Andreessen Horowitz, Addition and Elad Gil are anyways.</p>
<p>This week, the trio led a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/tripactions-raises-155m-at-5b-valuation-as-corporate-travel-recovers-from-pandemic-lows/">nine-figure financing round</a> in TripActions, a software company that helps other companies book and manage corporate travel. But the news is (always) more than the number. I see TripActions’ growth as a signal to travel sector startups, which faced the brunt of the pandemic’s impact. We’ve heard the market is emerging again, but the fact that investors poured money into an up-round valued at $5 billion adds an extra layer of conviction.</p>
<p>TripActions, like many travel startups, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/tripactions-reportedly-lays-off-hundreds-amid-covid-19-travel-freeze/">laid off hundreds of employees</a> in the beginning of the pandemic as the coronavirus froze business travel. It still hasn’t returned to pre-pandemic levels, but a spokesperson for the company said that a more distributed working class could boost corporate travels. If you don’t have to commute every day, maybe you don’t mind hopping on a flight once a month instead.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s why this could be good news: Distributed work and corporate travel aren’t mutually exclusive categories. For founders in the remote work space, this is key wiggle room to consider as we wait for post-pandemic consumer behavior to be colored in. So often, founders pitch that their startup is remote-or-bust, and while that might make a good headline, it’s clear that everyone will come out of this time with a different mindset.</p>
<p>Read on, as we discuss Plaid’s new investment in early-stage founders, Israel’s startup ecosystem, and telehealth in two different ways. Also, here’s your weekly reminder that you can find me <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a>and send me tips on early-stage startup financings to <a href="mailto:natasha.m@techcrunch.com">natasha.m@techcrunch.com</a></p>
<h2>Plaid takes notes from Y Combinator</h2>
<p>Last week, I joked that ‘Plaid for X’ startups will live on, even though the business ended its plans to merge with Visa for $5.3 billion. This week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/plaid-launches-finrise-an-incubator-for-underrepresented-fintech-founders/ ">Plaid announced an accelerator</a> to boost Plaid for X startups. You can’t make this stuff up.</p>
<p><strong>What you need to know</strong>: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/plaid-launches-finrise-an-incubator-for-underrepresented-fintech-founders/ ">Finrise</a>, which began as an idea in an internal hackathon last summer, will help three to five entrepreneurs from underrepresented backgrounds navigate starting a fintech business. There’s no capital involved, but there is Plaid mentorship, a bootcamp, and access to a network of investors.</p>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Plaid is building out its own incubator program. Fintech as a sector has been booming. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/fintech-startups-and-unicorns-had-a-stellar-q4-2020/">The latest fintech data dive</a> shows un-exited fintech unicorns are now worth an all-time high. The “unicorn effect” is impacting average valuations and deal-size.</p>
<p>And in case other sectors are feeling left out, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/in-2020-vcs-invested-428m-into-us-based-startups-every-day/">VCs invested $428 million into U.S.-based startups</a> everyday in 2020.</p>

<h2>Telehealth enters a ‘unique, high-growth period’</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/8-vcs-agree-behavioral-support-and-remote-visits-make-digital-health-a-strong-bet-for-2021/ ">In our latest investor survey</a>, eight healthcare-focused venture capitalists talked about the future of digital health.</p>
<p><strong>What you need to know:</strong> Telehealth isn’t just growing in demand, it’s growing in definition. Investors examined the future of digital health financing, how the Biden administration will impact their portfolio companies, and how to balance opportunity with incentives in a sector as emotional as this. Here’s how Nan Li, managing director at Obvious Ventures, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/8-vcs-agree-behavioral-support-and-remote-visits-make-digital-health-a-strong-bet-for-2021/">puts the opportunity ahead:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>[This is] absolutely not a blip! We are headed into a unique, high-growth period in healthcare where many aspects of the healthcare ecosystem are being rebuilt. From insurance underwriting, the disease-specific standard of care protocols, clinical staffing models, to patient coordination and triage … every aspect of healthcare is fair game for innovative companies to address. This is a drastic expansion from the days where health tech was confined to “healthcare IT,” selling software to hospitals and the rise in investing attention reflects this generational opportunity.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Etc: </strong>Another investor survey for you this week: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/6-investors-on-2021s-mobile-gaming-trends-and-opportunities/">6 investors on 2021’s mobile gaming trends and opportunities.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Bridgerton,&#8221; the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/28/shonda-rhimes-talks-move-from-network-tv-to-netflix/">Shondaland</a> drama that launched last month on Netflix, offers a few key updates to the standard formula of Regency-era  romance.</p>
<p>For one thing, there&#8217;s a racially diverse cast, with Black actors taking on the role of early 19th-century English nobility and royalty. (At one point, one of the characters offers an unconvincing explanation for why this is the case, but we — and the show — mostly ignored it.) For another, there&#8217;s a healthy dose of sex; &#8220;Bridgerton&#8221; emphatically does not shy away from showing viewers what its unbelievably attractive cast gets up to in the bedroom.</p>
<p>On the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>, we have our quibbles — some of the character motivations can be a bit frustrating, and while we enjoyed the whole season, the first few episodes were by far the most addictive and compelling.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Overall, though, we loved it, comparing &#8220;Bridgerton&#8221; to seemingly dissimilar shows like &#8220;Emily in Paris&#8221; and &#8220;You&#8221; — all offering clever revamps of familiar soap opera and romance formulas. The show also benefits from breathless plotting, with each of its eight episodes packed with twists. And did we mention that the cast is insanely good-looking?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This week, we&#8217;re looking into how President Biden&#8217;s inauguration impacted news apps, the latest in the Parler lawsuit, and how TikTok&#8217;s app continues to shape culture, among other things.</p>
<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3>Judge says Amazon doesn&#8217;t have to host Parler on AWS</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2094291" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094291" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2094291" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aws-parler.jpg?w=680" alt="logos for AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Parler" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aws-parler.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aws-parler.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aws-parler.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aws-parler.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aws-parler.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aws-parler.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aws-parler.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aws-parler.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094291" class="wp-caption-text">Logos for AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Parler.

<p>U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein in Seattle this week ruled that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/judge-denies-parlers-bid-to-make-amazon-restore-service/">Amazon won&#8217;t be required to restore access to web services to Parler</a>. As you may recall, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-sues-amazon-leveling-far-fetched-antitrust-allegations/">Parler sued Amazon</a> for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/">booting</a> it from AWS&#8217; infrastructure, effectively forcing it offline. Like Apple and Google before it, Amazon had decided that the calls for violence that were being spread on Parler violated its terms of service. It also said that Parler showed an &#8220;unwillingness and inability&#8221; to remove dangerous posts that called for the rape, torture and assassination of politicians, tech executives and many others, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-media-social-media-web-services-courts-bf948fa0599ade9c8036b65534a00ea1">the AP reported</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="18zvnIJ5U6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/judge-denies-parlers-bid-to-make-amazon-restore-service/">Judge denies Parler&#8217;s bid to make Amazon restore service</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Judge denies Parler&#8217;s bid to make Amazon restore service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/judge-denies-parlers-bid-to-make-amazon-restore-service/embed/#?secret=18zvnIJ5U6" data-secret="18zvnIJ5U6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s decision shouldn&#8217;t have been a surprise for Parler. <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws">Amazon had reported 98 examples of Parler posts</a> that incited violence over the past several weeks before its decision. It told Parler these were clear violations of the terms of service.</p>
<p>Parler&#8217;s lawsuit against Amazon, however, went on to claim breach of contract and even made antitrust allegations.</p>
<p>The judge shot down Parler&#8217;s claims that Amazon and Twitter were colluding over the decision to kick the app off AWS. Parler&#8217;s claims over breach of contract were denied, too, as the contract had never said Amazon had to give Parler 30 days to fix things. (Not to mention the fact that Parler breached the contract on its side, too.) It also said Parler had fallen short in demonstrating the need for an injunction to restore access to Amazon&#8217;s web services.</p>
<p>The ruling only blocks Parler from forcing Amazon to again host it as the lawsuit proceeds, but is not the final ruling in the overall case, which is continuing.</p>
<h3>TikTok drives another pop song to No. 1 on Billboard charts, breaks Spotify&#8217;s record</h3>
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" style="max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@livbedumb/video/6915631405984763141" data-video-id="6915631405984763141">
<section><a title="@livbedumb" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@livbedumb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@livbedumb</a><a title="♬ drivers license - Olivia Rodrigo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/drivers-license-6914711053674760193" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ drivers license &#8211; Olivia Rodrigo</a></section>
</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>We already knew TikTok was playing a large role in influencing music charts and listening behavior. For example, Billboard <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9476983/tiktok-licensing-deal-sony-music-entertainment-payouts-labels/#:~:text=TikTok%20Now%20Has%20Short%2DTerm,including%20Columbia%2C%20RCA%20and%20Epic.">last year noted</a> how TikTok drove hits from Sony artists like Doja Cat (“Say So”) and 24kGoldn (“Mood”), and helped Sony discover new talent. Columbia also signed viral TikTok artists like Lil Nas X, Powfu, StaySolidRocky, Jawsh 685, Arizona Zervas and 24kGoldn. Meanwhile, Nielsen has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/28/nielsen-reports-a-record-half-a-trillion-on-demand-music-streams-in-u-s-so-far-this-year/">said</a> that no other app had helped break more songs in 2020 than TikTok.</p>
<p>This month, we&#8217;ve witnessed yet another example of this phenomenon. Olivia Rodrigo, the 17-year-old star of Disney+&#8217;s &#8220;High School Musical: The Musical: the Series&#8221; released her latest song, &#8220;Drivers License&#8221; on January 8. The pop ballad and breakup anthem is believed to be referencing the actress&#8217; relationship with co-star Joshua Bassett, which gave the song even more appeal to fans.</p>
<p>Upon its release the song was heavily streamed by TikTok users, which helped make it an overnight sensation of sorts. According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/olivia-rodrigo-drivers-license-tiktok-spotify-11611235409">a report by The WSJ</a>, Billboard counted 76.1 million streams and 38,000 downloads in the U.S. during the week of its release. It also made a historic debut <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9513814/olivia-rodrigo-drivers-license-five-burning-questions">at No. 1 on the Hot 100</a>, becoming the first smash hit of 2021.</p>
<p>On January 11, &#8220;Drivers License&#8221; broke Spotify&#8217;s record for most streams per day (for a non-holiday song) with 15.17 million global streams. On TikTok, meanwhile, the number of videos featuring the song and the views they received doubled every day, The WSJ said.</p>
<p>Charli D&#8217;Amelio&#8217;s dance to it on the app has now generated 5 million &#8220;Likes&#8221; across nearly 33 million views, as of the time of writing.</p>
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" style="max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@charlidamelio/video/6915579469969280261" data-video-id="6915579469969280261">
<section><a title="@charlidamelio" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@charlidamelio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@charlidamelio</a><a title="♬ drivers license - Olivia Rodrigo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/drivers-license-6914711053674760193" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ drivers license &#8211; Olivia Rodrigo</a></section>
</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>Of course, other TikTok hits have broken out in the past, too &#8212; even reaching No. 1 like &#8220;Blinding Lights&#8221; (The Weeknd) and &#8220;Mood&#8221; (24kGoldn). But the success of &#8220;Drivers License&#8221; may be in part due to the way it focuses on a subject that&#8217;s more relevant to TikTok&#8217;s young, teenage user base. It talks about first loves and being dumped for the other girl. And its title and opening refer to a time many adults have forgotten: the momentous day when you get your driver&#8217;s license. It&#8217;s highly relatable to the TikTok crowd who fully embraced it and made it a hit.</p>

The app relies on an open-source federated, encrypted messaging protocol called Matrix that uses &#8220;bridges&#8221; to connect to the various networks to move the messages. However, iMessage support is more wonky, as the company actually ships you an old iPhone to make the connection to the network. But this system allows you to access <a href="https://www.beeperhq.com/">Beeper</a> on non-Apple devices, the company says. The app is slowly onboarding new users due to initial demand.

<p><strong>[UPDATE: Today&#8217;s attempt was scrubbed due to weather conditions. Another launch window is available tomorrow at 10 AM ET]</strong></p>
<p>SpaceX is set to launch the very first of its dedicated rideshare missions – an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/spacex-will-now-offer-dedicated-rideshare-launches-for-small-satellites/">offering it introduced in 2019</a> that allows small satellite operators to book a portion of a payload on a Falcon 9 launch. SpaceX&#8217;s rocket has a relatively high payload capacity compared to the size of many of the small satellites produced today, so a rideshare mission like this offers smaller companies and startups a chance to get their spacecraft in orbit without breaking the bank.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The cargo capsule atop the Falcon 9 flying today holds a total of 133 satellites according to SpaceX, which is a new record for the highest number of satellites being launched on a single rocket – beating out a payload of 104 spacecraft delivered by Indian Space Research Organization&#8217;s PSLV-C37 launch back in February 2017. It&#8217;ll be a key demonstration not only of SpaceX&#8217;s rideshare capabilities, but also of the complex coordination involved in a launch that includes deployment of multiple payloads into different target orbits in relatively quick succession.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SpaceX will now offer dedicated &#8216;rideshare&#8217; launches for small satellites&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/spacex-will-now-offer-dedicated-rideshare-launches-for-small-satellites/embed/#?secret=1uHvxcIggb" data-secret="1uHvxcIggb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This launch will be closely watched in particular for its handling of orbital traffic management, since it definitely heralds what the future of private space launches could look like in terms of volume of activity. Some of the satellites flying on this mission are not much larger than an iPad, so industry experts will be paying close attention to how they&#8217;re deployed and tracked to avoid any potential conflicts.</p>
<p>Some of the payloads being launched today include significant volumes of startup spacecraft, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/swarm-prices-out-its-orbital-iot-networks-hardware-and-services/">36 of Swarm&#8217;s tiny IoT network satellites</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/kepler-will-build-its-small-satellites-at-a-new-manufacturing-facility-in-toronto/">eight of Kepler&#8217;s GEN-1 communications satellites</a>. There are also 10 of SpaceX&#8217;s own Starlink satellites on board, and 48 of Planet Labs&#8217; Earth-imaging spacecraft.</p>
<p>The launch stream above should begin around 15 minutes prior to the mission start, which is set for 9:40 AM EST (6:40 AM PST) today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Stripe-subsidiary <a href="https://paystack.com/">Paystack</a> raised its seed round of $1.3 million in 2016, it was one of the largest disclosed rounds at that stage in Nigeria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, seven-figure seed investments in African startups were a rarity. But over the years, those same seed-stage rounds have become more common, with some very early-stage startups even raising eight-figure sums. Nigerian fintech startup, Kuda, which bagged $10 million last year, comes to mind, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also notable amidst the growth in seven and eight-figure African seed deals have been gains in pre-seed fundraising. Typically, pre-seed rounds are raised when the startup is still in the product development phase, yet to make revenue or discover product-market fit. These investments are usually made by third-party investors (friends and family), and range between $25,000-$150,000.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the narrative as to how much an early-stage African startup can raise as pre-seed has changed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, African VCs who usually fund seed and Series A rounds began partaking in pre-seed rounds, and they don&#8217;t seem to be slowing down. Just a month into 2021,  Egyptian fintech startup </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cassbana"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cassbana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised a </span><a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2021/01/11/egyptian-fintech-startup-cassbana-raises-1m-pre-seed-funding-round/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1 million pre-seed investment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by VC firm </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/disruptech"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disruptech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a bid to drive expansion within the country.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aHIRrtsSEv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/nigerias-kuda-raises-10m-to-be-the-mobile-first-challenger-bank-for-africa/">Nigeria&#8217;s Kuda raises $10M to be the mobile-first challenger bank for Africa</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigeria&#8217;s Kuda raises $10M to be the mobile-first challenger bank for Africa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/nigerias-kuda-raises-10m-to-be-the-mobile-first-challenger-bank-for-africa/embed/#?secret=aHIRrtsSEv" data-secret="aHIRrtsSEv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why the sudden change in appetite from investors?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreata Muforo is a partner at TLcom Capital, a pan-African early-stage VC firm. She told TechCrunch that last year&#8217;s run of 23 pre-seed rounds (10 of which were $150,000+ deals) per </span><a href="https://www.briterintelligence.com/deals"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briter Bridges data</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> was due to the confidence investors had in the market, especially fintech.</span></p>
<h2>Startups building financial infrastructure got noticed</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most African pre-seed investments in 2020 went to fintech, there were exceptions, including Egyptian edtech startup </span><a href="https://zedny.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zedny,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which raised $1.2 million; Nigerian automotive tech startup </span><a href="https://www.autochek.africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autochek Africa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which raised $3.4 million; and Nigerian talent startup </span><a href="https://talentql.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TalentQL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which raised $300,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Paystack and Flutterwave built payment infrastructure for thousands of African businesses, these fintech startups are trying to make their mark in the sweet spots of credit and banking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fintech is compelling. But while most fintech startups play around the commodities side of fintech, it&#8217;s the companies building infrastructure around the market that got most of the pre-seed validation last year,&#8221; Muforo said. Her firm, TLcom, led the $1 million pre-seed investment in Okra.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://okra.ng/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an API fintech startup. So are </span><a href="https://mono.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://onepipe.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OnePipe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://pngme.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are building Africa&#8217;s API infrastructure that connects bank accounts with financial institutions and third-party companies for different purposes. Within the past 18 months, Mono and Pngme raised $500,000, while OnePipe raised $950,000 in pre-seed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is noteworthy that while these startups are clamoring to solve Africa&#8217;s open API banking issues, three of the four deals came after Visa&#8217;s</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year in January.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Visa-Plaid acquisition </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has now been called off</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is safe to say some African investors developed FOMO, handing out sizable checks to fund &#8220;Africa&#8217;s Plaid” in the process.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="co4UMRfdqL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">Visa will not acquire Plaid after running into regulatory wall</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Visa will not acquire Plaid after running into regulatory wall&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/embed/#?secret=co4UMRfdqL" data-secret="co4UMRfdqL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital lenders remain one of their most important customers for fintech API startups. They can access customers’ financial accounts to understand their spending patterns and know who to loan to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egypt&#8217;s </span><a href="https://shahry.app/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shahry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Nigeria&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.evolvecredit.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evolve Credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are fintech startups building credit infrastructure for their markets. Evolve Credit connects digital lenders to those who need loan services in Nigeria via its online loan marketplace. Shahry, on the other hand, employs an AI-based credit scoring engine so users in Egypt can apply for credit. The pair also secured impressive pre-seed funding &#8212; Evolve Credit, $325,000, and Shahry, $650,000.</span></p>
<h2>A recurring theme: Serial founders</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muforo points out that aside from startups building fintech infrastructure, the caliber of founders was another reason pre-seed funding peaked last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adewale Yusuf, co-founder and CEO of </span><a href="https://talentql.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TalentQL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that hires, manages and outsources talent for Nigerian and global companies, seemed to agree. He told TechCrunch that trust between the VCs and founders involved played a major role in most pre-seed rounds last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t surprising that a lot of investors put money in pre-seed rounds. I say this because we also saw existing founders and serial entrepreneurs coming back to the market. To me, these founders&#8217; credibility was a major part of why those rounds were large,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second-time founder himself, Yusuf is the co-founder of Nigerian tech media publication Techpoint Africa. His partner at TalentQL, Opeyemi Awoyemi, is also a serial entrepreneur. He co-founded Ringier One Africa Media-owned Jobberman, one of Africa&#8217;s most popular recruitment platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Adedayo Amzat, founder of </span><a href="https://zedcrest.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zedcrest Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is the lead investor in TalentQL’s round, the founders’ experience proved vital in closing the deal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He says investors are more comfortable backing experienced founders in pre-seed rounds because they have a more mature understanding of the problems they’re trying to solve. So, in essence, they tend to raise more capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you look at pre-seed sizes, experienced founders can demand a significant premium over first-time founders,&#8221; Amzat said. &#8220;Pre-seed valuation cap for first-time founders will typically be between 400K to $1 million while we frequently see up to $5 million for experienced founders.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a recurring theme last year. Yele Bademosi, who runs </span><a href="http://www.microtraction.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microtraction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a West African early-stage VC firm, is the CEO of </span><a href="https://bundle.africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bundle Africa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Nigerian-based crypto-exchange startup that raised $450,000 in April 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shahry co-founders Sherif ElRakabawy and Mohamed Ewis also run Egypt’s largest shopping engine and price comparison website, <a href="https://yaoota.com/en-eg/">Yaoota</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono co-founder and CEO Abdulhamid Hassan was the co-founder of Nigerian fintech startup OyaPay and data science startup Voyance. Also, Etop Ikpe, the co-founder and CEO of Autochek Africa, was CEO of DealDey and Cars45.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Fara Ashiru Jituboh of Okra and Akan Nelson of Evolve Credit as first-time founders got investments that most of their counterparts would only dream of. For Jituboh, her solid tech background spoke for her &#8212; boasting a senior software engineering job at Pexels and engineering consultant role at Canva before founding Okra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We backed Fara because she&#8217;s a strong tech founder. When you look at the core of what Okra does as a tech-heavy company, you see how important it was to make the decision,&#8221; Muforo said about backing Okra&#8217;s CEO and CTO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelson also told TechCrunch that his finance background helped Evolve Credit raise its six-figure sum. The team&#8217;s bullishness on finding product-market fit and the potential of Africa&#8217;s loan marketplace was also enough to bring foreign and local VCs like <a href="https://samurai-incubate-africa.asia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samurai Incubate</a>, <a href="https://www.future.africa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Future Africa</a>, <a href="https://ingressivecapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ingressive Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.microtraction.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microtraction</a> on board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While early-stage investments in African startups haven&#8217;t reached full speed, the explosion in the number of angel investors has lowered entry barriers into early-stage investing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now investors are beginning to show readiness toward African startups that have promise as they continue to search for the next Paystack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;More people are willing to take risks now in the market, especially angel investors. They can easily let go of $10K-$50K because of success stories like Paystack,&#8221; Yusuf said about the $200 million </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquisition by U.S. payments startup Stripe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5BFKB8wujp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/">Stripe acquires Nigeria&#8217;s Paystack for $200M+ to expand into the African continent</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all of its significance to the African tech ecosystem, what particularly stands out about Paystack&#8217;s exit is the return on investment made for early investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time it exited in October 2020, some angel investors had an ROI of more than 1,400% according to Jason Njoku in his </span><a href="https://jason.com.ng/paystack-acquisition-angel-investors-turned-1-3m-into-15-20m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Njoku, who took part in the round as an angel investor, is the CEO of</span><a href="http://iroko.ng/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> IROKO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Nigerian VOD internet company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Muforo, witnessing more early-stage investments is a big deal, one the African tech ecosystem should savor regardless of the round in question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Pre-seed or seed are just names investors and founders give,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What I think is most important is the fact that we&#8217;re getting more early-stage capital into Africa, and startups are getting more attention from investors, which is fantastic.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/small-cap/21/01/18914558/2020-the-year-of-the-spac">many</a> deemed <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/2020-is-the-year-of-the-spac/">2020</a> the year of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/19/business/dealbook/deals-mergers-acquisitions-2020.html">SPAC</a>, short for special purpose acquisition company, 2021 may well make last year look quaint in comparison.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably not premature to be asking: is there any company too big to be SPAC&#8217;d?</p>
<p>Just today, we saw the trading debut of the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/united-wholesale-mortgage-goes-public-in-biggest-spac-deal-ever-11611336319">most valuable company to date</a> go public through a merger with one of these SPACs: 35-five-year-old, Pontiac, Michigan-based <a href="https://www.uwm.com/">United Wholesale Mortgage</a>, which is among the biggest mortgage companies in the U.S.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its shares slipped a bit by the end of trading, closing at $11.35 down from their starting price of $11.54, but it&#8217;s doubtful anyone involved is crying into their cocktails tonight. The outfit was valued at a whopping $16 billion when its merger with the blank-check outfit Gores Holdings IV was approved earlier this week.</p>
<p>Why is this interesting? Well, first, despite UWM&#8217;s size, its path to going public took less than a year, beginning with Gores Holdings IV completing its IPO in late January 2020 and raising approximately $425 million in cash.</p>
<p>Alec Gores, the billionaire founder of of the private equity firm Gores Group, led the deal. The tie-up was announced <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-united-wholesale-mortgage-m-a-gores-h/united-wholesale-agrees-merger-with-gores-holdings-to-go-public-idUSKCN26E1PH">back in September</a> and ultimately included an additional $500 million private placement. (It&#8217;s typical to tack-on these transactions once a target company has been identified and accepts the terms of the proposed merger. Most targets are many times larger than the blank check companies with which they are joining forces.)</p>
<p>Also notable is that UWM is a mature company, one that says it generated $1.3 billion in revenue in the third quarter of last year alone and whose CEO, whose father started the company in 1986, <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/ahead-of-its-big-ipo-united-wholesale-mortgage-reports-record-volume-and-margins/">said last fall</a> that the company is &#8220;massively profitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a story unlike that of most outfits to go public recently through the SPAC process. Consider Opendoor, Luminar Technologies, and Virgin Galactic. Each is still developing a business that needs capital to keep going and which might not have found much more funding from private market investors.</p>
<p>SpaceX director Steve Jurvetson underscored the point pretty bluntly <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/steve-jurvetson-maryanna-saenko-on-space-spacs-great/id1498270180?i=1000505493210">last week</a>, saying, for example, that Virgin Galactic has seen &#8220;no positive business development&#8221; since being taken public. &#8220;They announced that they&#8217;re going to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352390/virgin-galactic-supersonic-aircraft-mach-3-rolls-royce">develop a hypersonic plane</a>, but that has zero synergy with the current business they&#8217;re trying to launch, which is suborbital spaceflights, which have yet to happen for customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>If more profitable, more mature, more businesses with a very clear path to future revenue &#8212; more companies like UMW &#8212; begin choosing SPACs over traditional IPOs, it could change widespread perceptions of SPAC candidates as businesses that had nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>It could also broaden thinking about what size companies are appropriate to take public this way and lead to much bigger transactions.</p>
<p>More certain: UWM isn&#8217;t likely to hold the record for &#8216;biggest SPAC deal ever&#8217; for long. Not only is interest in SPACs as feverish as ever, but one vehicle in particular seems poised to take the title, and that&#8217;s the SPAC of billionaire investor William Ackman, whose blank-check company raised $4 billion last summer.</p>
<p>Presumably, the deal will be a doozy. Reportedly, Ackerman was at one point looking to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/03/airbnb-spurns-approach-to-go-public-through-ackmans-blank-check-company.html">take public</a> Airbnb with his SPAC. When Airbnb passed on the proposed merger, he reportedly <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/michael-bloomberg-in-talks-to-take-his-media-empire-public/">reached out</a> to the privately held media conglomerate Bloomberg. (Bloomberg has said it&#8217;s untrue.)</p>
<p>Because SPACs typically complete a merger with a private company in two years or less, speculation has been running rampant about what Ackman &#8212; who plans to kick in an additional $1 billion in cash from his hedge fund &#8212; will piece together with all that money.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there have been 67 new SPAC offerings in the last 22 days alone &#8212; as many as in all of 2019. They&#8217;ve raised $19.2 billion. And there&#8217;s seemingly no end to the fundraising in sight.</p>
<p>Just this week, Fifth Wall Ventures, the four-year-old, L.A.-based proptech focused venture firm, registered plans to raise <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2020/08/04/blank-check-companies-make-a-comeback-in-real-estate/">$250 million</a> for a new blank-check company.</p>
<p>Intel Chairman Omar Ishrak, who previously ran medical device giant Medtronic, was reported to be planning to raise between <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-19/intel-chairman-said-to-eye-up-to-1-billion-health-tech-spac-ipo">$750 million and $1 billion</a> for a blank-check firm targeting deals in the health tech sector.</p>
<p>As for Gores Group, on Wednesday, it <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/75407/The-Gores-Groups-seventh-SPAC-Gores-Holdings-VII-files-for-a-$400-million-I">registered plans</a> to raise $400 million in an IPO for its newest blank-check company. It will be the outfit&#8217;s seventh SPAC to date.</p>

<p>Loon started out under Alphabet&#8217;s experimental projects group X, before spinning out as a separate company in 2018. Despite some successful deployments, it seems that Loon was never able to find a sustainable business model.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we’ve found a number of willing partners along the way, we haven’t found a way to get the costs low enough to build a long-term, sustainable business,&#8221; Loon CEO Alastair Westgarth wrote in a blog post. &#8220;Developing radical new technology is inherently risky, but that doesn’t make breaking this news any easier.”</p>
