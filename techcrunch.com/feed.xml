										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</a>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday morning? Sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p><em>Kicking off with a tiny bit of housekeeping: Equity is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/the-equity-podcast-is-getting-bigger-and-better/">now doing more stuff</a>. And TechCrunch has its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">Justice</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">Early-Stage</a> events coming up. I am <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/were-talking-startup-sales-with-zoom-cro-ryan-azus-at-techcrunch-early-stage/">interviewing the CRO of Zoom</a> for the latter. And The Exchange itself has some long-overdue stuff coming next week, including $50M and $100M ARR updates (Druva, etc.), a peek at consumption based pricing vs. traditional SaaS models (featuring Fastly, Appian, BigCommerce CEOs, etc.), and more. Woo! </em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week both DoorDash and Airbnb reported earnings for the first time as public companies, marking their real graduation into the ranks of the exited unicorns. We’re keeping our usual eye on the earnings cycle, quietly, but today we have some learnings for the startup world.</p>
<p>Some basics will help us get started. DoorDash <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/doordash-dash-q4-2020-earnings.html">beat growth expectations</a> in Q4, reporting revenue of $970 million versus an expected $938 million. The gap between the two likely comes partially from how new the DoorDash stock is, and the pandemic making it difficult to forecast. Despite the outsized growth, DoorDash shares initially fell sharply after the report, though they largely recovered on Friday.</p>
<p>Why the initial dip? I reckon the company’s net loss was larger than investors hoped &#8212; though a large GAAP deficit is standard for first quarters post-debut. That concern might have been tempered by the company’s <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/25/doordash-inc-dash-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcript/">earnings call</a>, which included a note from the company’s CFO that it is “seeing acceleration in January relative to our order growth in December as well as in Q4.” That’s encouraging. On the flip side, the company’s CFO did say “starting from Q2 onwards, we&#8217;re going to see a reversion toward pre-COVID behavior within the customer base.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Qf9D2lL5OD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/how-covid-19-accelerated-doordashs-business/">How COVID-19 accelerated DoorDash&#8217;s business</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How COVID-19 accelerated DoorDash&#8217;s business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/how-covid-19-accelerated-doordashs-business/embed/#?secret=Qf9D2lL5OD" data-secret="Qf9D2lL5OD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Big companies are anticipating a return to pre-COVID behavior, just not quite yet. Firms that benefited from COVID-19 are being heavily scrutinized. And they expect tailwinds to fade as the year progresses.</p>
<p>And then there’s Airbnb, which is up around 16% today. Why? It <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/airbnb-abnb-earnings-q4-2020.html">beat revenue expectations</a>, while also losing lots of money. Airbnb’s net loss in Q4 2020 was more than 10x DoorDash’s own. So why did Airbnb get a bump while DoorDash got dinged? Its large revenue beat ($859 million, instead of an expected $748 million), and potential for future growth; investors are expecting that Airbnb’s current besting of expectations will lead to even <em>more</em> growth down the road.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Provided that you have a good story to tell regarding future growth, investors are still willing to accept sharp losses; the growth trade is alive, then, even as companies that may have already received a boost endure increased scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>For startups, valuation <em>pressure</em> or <em>lift</em> could come down to which side of the pandemic they are on</strong>; are they on the tail end of their tailwind (remote-work focused SaaS, perhaps?), or on the ascent (restaurant tech, maybe?). Something to chew on before you raise.</p>
<h2>Market Notes</h2>
<p>It was one blistering week for funding rounds. Crunchbase News, my former journalistic home, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/yes-2021-is-shaping-up-as-a-wild-year-for-supergiant-rounds-we-break-down-where-the-money-is-going/">has a great piece out</a> on just how many massive rounds we’re seeing so far this year. But even one or two steps down in scale, funding activity was super busy.</p>
<p>A few rounds that I could not get to this week that caught my eye included a <a href="https://terminus.com/">$90 million round for Terminus</a> (ABM-focused GTM juicer, I suppose), <a href="https://anchorage.com/">Anchorage’s $80 million Series C</a> (cryptostorage for big money), and <a href="https://foxtrotco.com/">Foxtrot Market’s $42 million Series B</a> (rapid delivery of yuppie and zoomer essentials).</p>
<p>Sitting here now, finally writing a tidbit about each, I am reminded at the sheer breadth of the tech market. Termius helps other companies sell, Anchorage wants to keep your ETH safe, while Foxtrot wants to help you replenish your breakfast rosé stock before you have to endure a dry morning. What a <em>mix</em>. And each must be generating venture-acceptable growth, as they have not merely raised more capital but raised rather large rounds for their purported maturity (measured by their listed Series stage, though the moniker can be more canard than guide.)</p>

<p>I jokingly call this little section of the newsletter Market Notes, a jest as how can you possibly note the whole market that we care about? These companies and their recent capital infusions underscore the point.</p>
<h2>Various and Sundry</h2>
<p>Finally, two notes from earnings calls. The first from Root, which is a head scratcher, and the second from Booking Holdings’ results.</p>
<p>I chatted with Alex Timm, Root Insurance’s CEO this week moments after it <a href="https://ir.joinroot.com/static-files/a815dec9-e8fb-435b-9ab8-b422d4f773ca">dropped numbers</a>. As such I didn’t have much context in the way of investor response to its results. My read was that Root was super capitalized, and has pretty big expansion plans. Timm was upbeat about his company’s improving economics (on a loss ratio and loss-adjusted expenses basis, for the insurtech fans out there), and growth during the pandemic.</p>
<p>But then today its shares are off 16%. Parsing the analyst call, there’s movement in Root’s economic profile (regarding premium-ceding variance over the coming quarters) that make it hard to fully grok its full-year growth from where I sit. But it <em>appears</em> that Root’s business is still molting to a degree that is almost refreshing; the company could have gone public in 2022 with some of its current evolution behind it, but instead it raised a zillion dollars last year and is public now.</p>
<p>Sticking our neck out a bit, despite fellow neo-insurnace player Lemonade’s continued, and impressive valuation run, MetroMile’s stock is also softening, while Root’s has lost more than half its value from its IPO date. If the current repricing of some neo-insurance players continues, we could see some private investment into the space slow. (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/hippo-insurance-convertible-note--07be969a">Fewer things like this?</a>) It’s a possible trend we’ll have eyes on this year.</p>
<p>Next, Booking Holdings, the company that owns Priceline and other travel properties. Given that Booking might have notes regarding the future of business travel &#8212; which we care about for clues regarding what could come for remote work and office culture, things that impact everything from startup hub locations to software sales &#8212; The Exchange snagged a call slot and dialed the company up.</p>
<p>Booking Holdings’ CEO Glenn Fogel didn’t have a comment as to how his company is trading at all-time highs despite suffering from sharp year-over-year revenue declines. He did note that the pandemic has shaken up expectations for conversations, which could limit short-term business travel in the future for meetings that may now be conducted on video calls. He was bullish on future conference travel (good news for TechCrunch, I suppose), and future travel more generally.</p>
<p>So concerning the jetting perspective, we don’t know anything yet. Booking Holdings is not saying much, perhaps because it just doesn’t know when things will turn around. Fair enough. Perhaps after another three months of vaccine rollout will give us a better window into what a partial return to an old normal could look like.</p>
<p>And to cap off, you can read Apex Holdings’ SPAC presentation <a href="https://www.apexclearing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Apex-Northern-Star-Investor-Presentation-02222021.pdf">here</a>, and Markforged’s <a href="https://static.markforged.com/downloads/Markforged+Investor+Presentation.pdf">here</a>. Also I wrote about the buy-now-pay-later space <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/as-bnpl-startups-raise-a-look-at-klarna-affirm-and-afterpay-earnings/">here</a>, riffed on the Digital Ocean IPO with Ron Miller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/digitaloceans-ipo-filing-shows-a-two-class-cloud-market/">here</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/understanding-toasts-expected-ipo-through-the-lens-of-olos-2020-results/">doodled on Toast’s valuation and the Olo debut here</a>.</p>
<p>Hugs, and have a lovely weekend!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“A lot of founders mix up raising money with making money.&#8221;</p>
<p>This quote, which Career Karma founder Ruben Harris mentioned off-hand on a phone call with me, has been <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1285998617266753539">on my mind</a> for months. In fact, raising money can cost you money, in the form of that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/08/lemonade-ipo-dilution/">sweet, sweet ownership</a> and equity.</p>
<p>That’s why Clearbanc, a startup I have covered for years, has always had a compelling pitch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company, co-founded by Michele Romanow and Andrew D’Souza, positions itself as an alternative equity-free capital solution for early-stage founders. Flexing its “20-minute term sheet” the startup uses an algorithm to shift through a startup’s data, and if it has positive ad spend and positive unit economics, they make an investment worth anything from $10,000 to over $10 million. It makes money through a revenue-share agreement versus an equity stake.</p>
<p>“While we’ve invested in over 4,000 businesses using this model, we’ve also turned away over 50,000 who weren’t at this scale or level of repeatability,” D’Souza tells TechCrunch. So, the startup told me this week that they have raised $10 million to create a new product: ClearAngel.</p>
<p>The startup is trying to back anyone with an online business that has early revenue, but pre-broad traction. Clearbanc wants to replace friends and family money, a concept that D’Souza says is “quite elitist,” with its own version of an angel check, while also offering founder services such as supply chain analysis, introductions to networks and competitive landscape analysis.</p>
<p>The startup just needs to make around $1,000 in monthly revenue to qualify for cash. In return for an investment between $10,000 to $50,000, founders have to pay up to 2% of their revenue over four years.</p>
<p>Clearbanc’s repayment works for some startups, but for others, a traditional bank loan could work better. Its biggest hurdle, I’d argue, is that if a startup has great revenue already, you might not want to take a revenue-share agreement loan.</p>
<p>As for if a startup takes ClearAngel capital and doesn’t make the minimum revenue?</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the ClearAngel product isn’t working,” he said. “There are bound to be some companies who still can’t make it, that’s the risk we take.”</p>
<p>Alternative capital has pros and cons, just like venture capital has pros and cons. If the end goal is to become a billion-dollar business, what’s the best route to do that? Is taking a revenue-share agreement going to hurt your chances as a pre-seed startup trying to raise capital? Does YC care at all?</p>
<p>Those are some of my biggest questions, and we’ll explore all (and more!) in my alternative financing panel next week for TC Sessions: Justice. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/register-for-tc-sessions-justice-for-a-conversation-on-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-the-startup-world/">It costs $5 to attend the entire conference,</a> and speakers include Backstage Capital’s Arlan Hamilton and Congresswoman Barbara Lee.</p>

<h2><strong>Coinbase files to go public</strong></h2>
<p>After being valued at $100 billion in the secondary markets, Coinbase has finally filed to go public. The S-1, as Winnie founder Sara Mauskopf tweeted, is<a href="https://twitter.com/sm/status/1364976889434050560"> #goals. </a>The crypto unicorn, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/coinbase-files-to-go-public-in-a-key-listing-for-the-cryptocurrency-category/">my colleague Alex Wilhelm notes</a>, grew just over 139% in 2020, a massive improvement on its 2019 results.</p>

<h2><strong>Mobility-as-a-service </strong></h2>
<p>I caught up with Eric Eldon, managing editor at TechCrunch and former Startups Weekly writer, about the recent work he’s been doing with Kirsten Korosec, our transportation editor.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what he had to say:</strong> Startup employees may not be going into the office as often again — or ever. But everyone will still need to go places, or at least want to! How will they do it? What will we do? How will our altered set of needs and wants reshape cities, right as new technologies are fundamentally altering transportation, too? We’re going to be covering this topic in-depth this year, as we all figure out how to go back to work.</p>

<h2><strong>Spain wants startups to succeed on its soil</strong></h2>
<p>The Spanish government, led by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, has announced plans to turn itself into an entrepreneurial nation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/spains-ten-year-plan-to-put-startups-in-the-economic-driving-seat/">The Startup Act</a> is the first piece of dedicated legislation meant to help create tech innovation within Spain. The goals are to promote innovation, new capital through domestic and foreign investments, and to seed the future of Spain as a hub for new companies.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Driving innovation can start <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/spains-ten-year-plan-to-put-startups-in-the-economic-driving-seat/">with relaxing on regulatory concerns.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Among a package of some 50 support measures, the entrepreneurial strategy makes a reference to “smart regulation” and floats the idea of sandboxing for testing products publicly (i.e. without needing to worry about regulatory compliance first).</p></blockquote>

<p>As loyal Equity listeners may have already noticed, we’ve been quietly experimenting with the concept of adding on a third show to our weekly production. This week, we told the world!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.stormventures.com/our-team/">Storm Ventures</a>, a venture firm that focuses on early stage B2B enterprise startups, announced this week that it has promoted Pascale Diaine and Frederik Groce to partners at the firm.</p>
<p>The two new partners have worked their way up over the last several years. Groce joined Storm in 2016 and has invested in enterprise SaaS startups like Workato, Splashtop, NextRequest and Camino. Diaine joined a year later and has invested in firms like Sendoso, German Bionic, InEvent and Talkdesk.</p>
<p>Groce, who is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/blck-vc-launches-educational-initiative-to-bring-more-blacks-into-investing-ecosystem/">a founder at BLCK VC</a> and helped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/blck-vc-launches-educational-initiative-to-bring-more-blacks-into-investing-ecosystem/">organize the Black Venture Institute</a> to create a network of Black investors, says that these promotions show that venture needs to be more diverse, and Storm recognizes this.  &#8220;If you think about the way our team works, that&#8217;s the way I think venture teams will need to work to be able to be successful in the next 40 years. And so the hope is that over time everyone does this and we&#8217;re just early to it,&#8221; Groce told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unfortunately, right now that&#8217;s not the case, not even close. According <a href="https://about.crunchbase.com/blog/business-investment-to-women/#:~:text=Only%2012%20percent%20of%20venture,t%20have%20any%20female%20partners.">to research by Crunchbase</a>, just 12% of venture capitalists are women and two-thirds of firms don&#8217;t have any female investors. Meanwhile, only about <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/venture-capital-2020-still-really-white/#:~:text=As%20of%20now%2C%20only%20about,one%20person%20and%20it's%20done.">4% of ventures investors</a> are Black.</p>
<p>Those numbers have an impact on the number of Black and female founders because as Groce points out the lack of founders in underrepresented groups is in part a networking problem. &#8220;In a business that&#8217;s predicated on networks if you don&#8217;t have diversity in the network, or the teams that are driving those networks, you just can&#8217;t make sure you&#8217;re seeing great talent across all ecosystems,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Diaine, who is French and started her career by founding Orange Fab, the corporate accelerator of the European Telco Orange, has brought her international<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> business background to Storm where they helped her tune that experience to an investor focus and supported her as she learned the nuances of the investment side of the business.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t come from the VC world. I come from the innovative corporate world. So they had to train me and spend time getting me up to date. And they did spend so much time making sure I understood everything to make sure I got to this level,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Both partners bring their own unique views looking beyond Silicon Valley for investment opportunities. Diaine&#8217;s investment include a German, Brazilian and Portuguese company, while Groce&#8217;s investments include companies in Chicago, Atlanta and Seattle.</p>
<p>The two partners have also developed an algorithm to help find investments based on a number of online signals, something that has become more important during the pandemic when they couldn&#8217;t network in person.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frederik and I have been working on [an algorithm to find] what are the signals that you can identify online that will tell you this company&#8217;s doing well, this company growing.You have to have a nice set of startup search tracking [signals], but what do you track if you can&#8217;t just get the revenue in real time, which is impossible. So we&#8217;ve developed an algorithm that helps us identify some of these signals and create alerts on which startups we should pay attention to,&#8221; Diaine explained.</p>
<p>She says this data-driven approach should be helpful and augment their in-person efforts even after the pandemic is over and increase their overall efficiency in finding and tracking companies in their portfolios.</p>

<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.

<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/"> poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This week, we&#8217;re looking into what&#8217;s next for the future of one of the top social apps (Twitter), as well as Spotify&#8217;s latest announcements around its future plans for podcasts and subscriptions, along with other top stories, including the Clubhouse security problem.</p>

<p>Twitter over the years has been slow to roll out new features that dramatically impact its platform &#8212; even going so far at one time to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/12/a-first-look-at-twitters-new-prototype-app-twttr/">build an entirely separate app</a> just to test a new way to link together conversation threads. Its slow momentum and failure to build features users actually want, like an edit button, has left Twitter feeling a lot like the same experience it was in its earlier years &#8212; a public SMS of sorts (albeit one with more utilities for tweet discovery and management).</p>

<p>This has also contributed slow user growth, which opened up Twitter last year to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/twitter-strikes-investment-deal-with-elliott-management-silver-lake-after-attempt-to-oust-ceo-jack-dorsey.html">pressure</a> from activist investors to oust CEO Jack Dorsey, who was then planning to move to Africa, while also still running Square. (He decided not to go because of the pandemic&#8230; and, well, to keep his job, we&#8217;d guess.) Following this more intensive scrutiny of Twitter&#8217;s operations, the company in recent months has begun to speed things up on the product front.</p>

<p>Last year, it rolled out to its global audience a stories-like feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">Fleets</a>, offering a place for more ephemeral content to live on its platform. It began development on a Clubhouse rival, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">Twitter Spaces</a>, which is surging ahead with updates and new features. And it&#8217;s working on a community-led misinformation debunking effort, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/twitters-birdwatch-fights-misinformation-with-community-notes/">Birdwatch</a>.</p>

<p>Twitter also began to make a series of acquisitions to build out its product teams, with additions like social app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/twitter-acquires-screen-sharing-social-app-squad/">Squad</a>, stories template maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/twitter-chroma-stories/">Chroma Labs</a> and podcasting app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/twitter-acquires-social-podcasting-app-breaker-team-to-help-build-twitter-spaces/">Breaker</a>. And more recently, it bought<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/"> newsletter platform Revue,</a> which is already integrated on the Twitter website.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not done. This week, Twitter announced even more new products were in the works.</p>
<p>One, a new product called &#8220;Super Follow,&#8221; represents Twitter&#8217;s first-ever paid feature. The idea with the Super Follow is to turn Twitter into a platform where creators can monetize their fan base &#8212; with a &#8220;Super Follow&#8221; subscription, fans can access member-only perks. These can include whatever the creator wants &#8212; newsletters, videos, deals, community access and even paywalled content like tweets, fleets and audio chats in Twitter Spaces.</p>

<p>Along with this, Twitter introduced &#8220;Communities,&#8221; which, in addition to allowing social networking around interests, give Super Follow-using creators a place to organize their own private networks.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301388/twitter-auto-block-mute-abusive-accounts-safety-mode?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">finally working on tools</a> to auto-block and mute the trolls, too. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f64c.png" alt="🙌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>To put it mildly, this strategy represents one of the more radical shake-ups to Twitter&#8217;s platform to date. It not only challenges other networks &#8212; like Facebook, Discord, Patreon, Substack and Clubhouse &#8212; it positions Twitter&#8217;s slew of new features not just as fun add-ons, but rather as general-purpose tools that allow anyone to build and grow their own communities whichever way they want.</p>
<p>The one big miss on this front is that Twitter no longer has its own social video app to throw in the mix, too. Sadly, the company shut down both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine_(service)">Vine</a> and now, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/periscope-will-shut-down-by-march-twitter-confirms/">Periscope</a>. Though Twitter itself supports video, Vine&#8217;s closure led to a hole in the market that&#8217;s since been filled by TikTok. And unfortunately, sharing TikTok links on Twitter is poor experience &#8212; they just display as previews that take you to a new TikTok tab when clicked. To get TikTok videos to play in-line, you have to download them first &#8212; something not all creators permit.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Twitter is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitter-plans-to-double-revenue-by-2023-reach-315m-daily-users/">expecting the changes to help it to double its revenues</a> by 2023, and grow its daily user base to 315 million, up from the 192 million it has today.</p>

<p>Twitter isn&#8217;t the only one looking to new subscriptions to make more money. Spotify this week also announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-announces-beta-launch-of-audience-development-tool-for-artists-self-serve-marquee-ads/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">good</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-spotify-audience-network-an-audio-ad-marketplace/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">handful</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-test-paid-podcast-subscriptions-this-spring-via-new-anchor-feature/">updates</a>, including a high-end Premium add-on for higher-quality music streams, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/">called Spotify HiFi</a>.</p>
<p>The company also confirmed its plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-test-paid-podcast-subscriptions-this-spring-via-new-anchor-feature/">test paid podcast subscriptions</a>. The big bet here is that some podcasts are so compelling and have such a loyal fanbase that listeners will pay for their content, or maybe just their extras. These, of course, will no longer really be &#8220;podcasts&#8221; at this point &#8212; they&#8217;re paid audio programs. The feature will be introduced to Spotify&#8217;s creation app Anchor this spring.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>But overeager adoption of paywalls by podcasters (who can&#8217;t make a living from their ad sales) could push more users to new social audio platforms, like Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, where content is free and conversations are more participatory. Anchor&#8217;s solution for audience engagement is to roll out Q&amp;As and polls. But why bother clicking, when you can hit up a Clubhouse room and <em>talk</em>?</p>
<h3>Clubhouse&#8217;s exclusivity leads to discovery of security problems</h3>
<p>The demand for Clubhouse access is becoming so high that people are figuring out ways to reverse-engineer the experience, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/clubhouse-security/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">TechCrunch reported this week</a>. A developer found a way to broadcast Clubhouse audio feeds in real time to users who couldn&#8217;t get in because they didn&#8217;t have an invite or an iPhone. Though Clubhouse blocked the effort later in the week, the fact that a developer was able to gain access to Clubhouse audio feeds in the first place was an indication that the app isn&#8217;t as locked down as one might think.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TnipsrRBsP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/clubhouse-security/">A race to reverse-engineer Clubhouse raises security concerns</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In addition, other researchers have figured out ways to &#8220;ghost listen&#8221; to rooms without displaying user profiles &#8212; essentially, eavesdropping. And users in China appear to be able to listen to a room conversation facilitated by Clubhouse&#8217;s service provider Agora by using a VPN &#8212; even though they can&#8217;t technically &#8220;join&#8221; a room due to the app itself being banned.</p>
<p>Clubhouse&#8217;s appeal has a lot to do with how its social audio spaces aren&#8217;t recorded, so people can be themselves. There&#8217;s an expectation that you are only speaking to a group who&#8217;s listening and there&#8217;s no way to go back for a transcript or recording later. In other words, it&#8217;s not a podcast &#8212; it&#8217;s live. It&#8217;s social. And it&#8217;s semi-private.</p>
<p>These security breaches prove that&#8217;s not entirely true.</p>

<p>A new Slack competitor, <a href="https://quill.chat/">Quill</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/the-new-new-slack-quill/">launched out of stealth this week</a>, TechCrunch reported, with its apps for the web, Mac, Windows, Linux and Android and iOS on mobile. Like Slack, Quill lets co-workers communicate through channels, video and voice. But it also addresses some of the issues Slack overlooks. One, &#8220;structured channels,&#8221; lets admins enforce threads, for example. It also automatically moves up active conversations, limits notifications, has improved pinning, supports moving threads between channels and places video and chat side-by-side, to name a few. You can even interact with Quill via SMS and email.</p>

<p>Andy Allen, former head of Product at WeTransfer, teamed up with Mark Dawson, the lead graphics engineer from Allen&#8217;s former prior company Fifty Three, to create a new set of &#8220;default&#8221; apps with <a href="http://andy.works/">ANDY</a>. That is, the company&#8217;s new apps aim to update your basic set &#8212; like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/not-boring-weather/id1531063436">weather</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/not-a-boring-calculator/id1533591596">calculator</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/not-a-boring-timer/id1531048091">timer</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the default apps haven’t changed over the last 10 years. Yet we’re still using them. I see that as a sign that we’ll still need basic apps like weather, calculator and timer in another 10 years,&#8221; notes Allen.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118601" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118601" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2118601" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/widgets-weather.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="354" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/widgets-weather.jpg 1328w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/widgets-weather.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/widgets-weather.jpg?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/widgets-weather.jpg?resize=768,400 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/widgets-weather.jpg?resize=680,354 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/widgets-weather.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118601" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ANDY</p></div></p>
<p>What makes ANDY apps different is that they&#8217;re built inside a game engine to unlock new experiences that makes them feel more like games themselves. They&#8217;re also skinnable, with three skins available at launch and more to come every few months. The apps require a subscription to work &#8212; either $14.99/yr for all apps and basic skins or $69.99/yr for all apps plus basic and limited-edition skins, as well as limited-edition collector cards. The company plans to expand its app collection over time.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFTs (non-fungible tokens) &#8212; or scarce digital content represented as tokens &#8212; are driving a new wave of crypto adoption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the Ethereum blockchain, artists, gaming companies and content creators alike are utilizing token standards, which ascribe provenance to uniquely distinguishable assets. NFTs first made headlines in 2017 when Dapper Labs’ game </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/03/people-have-spent-over-1m-buying-virtual-cats-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CryptoKitties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accounted for 95% of Ethereum network usage at its peak. While someone paying $170,000 for a digital cat seemed like an anomaly, what’s happening today blows that headline out of the water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platforms like Nifty Gateway, SuperRare, Foundation and Zora are quickly emerging as the leading players for creatives to monetize work in a digital world.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The estimated total value of crypto art has now passed $100 million according to cryptoart.io/data &#8212; just one vertical of a growing ecosystem of NFTs.</span></p>

<h2>Collectible mania</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as we’ve seen an alternative asset class form around physical collectibles like Pokémon cards, NFTs are starting to showcase what this universe of rare hallmark brands looks like online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NBA Top Shot has seen close to $10 million in 24h volume according to </span><a href="https://cryptoslam.io/nba-top-shot"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CryptoSlam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with more than $100 million of “moments” being sold in less than one year of being live. The parent company behind NBA Top Shot, Dapper Labs, is said to be raising a $250 million round at a $2 billion valuation, as reported by </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nba-top-shot-cryptokitties-firm-dapper-labs-raising-250m-at-2b-valuation-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Block</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niche collectibles like </span><a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CryptoPunks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; or 10,000 unique collectible characters with scarce traits and qualities &#8212; now have a base floor of roughly $18,000 a piece. Just recently, Punk 4156 sold for 650 ETH, equivalent to roughly $1.3 million at today’s prices.</span></p>

<h2>Crypto art paradigms</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphic designs and 3D designers are finding new platforms to showcase their work, with marketplaces like Nifty Gateway facilitating Supreme style drops for exclusive digital art.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mad Dog Jones recently set a record for $3.9 million worth of art sold in one sale, topping the previous record held by beeple for his $3.5 million “Everydays 2020 Collection” drop. No wonder top art galleries like Christies are asking to team up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Bitcoin and Etherium reaching all-time high prices and investors looking for new places to allocate capital, the crypto art movement has given power back to the creatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vibrant collector communities like FlamingoDAO are forming around these drops, while protocols like Zora are quickly starting to support NFTs of all different verticals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musicians like Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park and Fort Minor has released NFTs as a part of their strategy for his new single “Happy Endings” featuring popstar Iann Dior. EDM DJ and producer 3LAU is tokenizing his debut album “Ultraviolet” and Grammy-award winning musician RAC broke the SuperRare record for the highest NFT primary sale with his piece “Elephant Dreams.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I even sold a blog post for 2 ETH (or roughly $4,000) using a crypto media publication called Mirror! </span></p>
<h2>Why should I care?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFTs have exposed a creative side of crypto that is not only fun to play, but digestible and accessible to new users. As bigger names host their first NFT drops, they bring a new wave of attention to their millions of followers noticing crypto for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leaves people in a unique position to curate and discover this growing wave of scarce digital content. Showtime is aggregating NFTs to offer an Instagram-like experience, and the forthcoming music-specific NFT marketplace Catalog is creating a digital record store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Nifty Gateway drops continue to sell out in seconds thanks to credit card payments and free transactions, new collectors are finding ways to collect their favorite artists and brands &#8212; a trend that is likely to take better form over the coming years.</span></p>
<h2>Areas of improvement</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the sales figures showcase a clear demand for NFTs, it’s not without hiccups. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority of NFT platforms today require users to be familiar with Ethereum wallets like MetaMask. This means collectors need to purchase ETH from an exchange like Coinbase and send it to a non-custodial address that consists of a long string of numbers and letters to get started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they’re there, they need to pay upwards of $100 worth of fees to make a transaction and place a bid. The same goes for artists creating NFTs, causing community funds like MintFund to pop up and cover the operational costs of launching their first NFT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, platforms like Audius are addressing these pain points head on. With 2 million monthly active users &#8212; the most of any Ethereum application today &#8212; Audius replaced MetaMask with an email and password login wallet called Hedgehog. By removing key management and transaction costs, users are able to access the wonderful world of crypto without significant start-up costs.</span></p>
<h2>NFT bubble?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s happening in the NFT ecosystem today is nothing short of a paradigm shift for a maturing sector of cryptocurrencies. As avid collectors frame their digital art using companies like Infinite Objects, there’s no denying the vast majority of buyers are here to speculate. This increased demand signals interest, but is highly reminiscent of the 2017 ICO boom that caused the market to crash many years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, out of that multi-year bear market came a strong wave of foundational companies and products like Uniswap and Compound that are here to stay. It’s this writer&#8217;s bet that the same will happen with NFTs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until then, remember that digital content does have value, and crypto collectors are flocking to lay their namesake on the biggest collections of tomorrow.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While Denmark and Copenhagen don’t often come up as a destination for European startups, it has a thriving local tech scene that&#8217;s home to some of the better startup conferences. After all, who doesn’t want to visit Copenhagen?</p>
<p>A highly educated population, great universities, excellent healthcare and great transport links to Europe make the city as good a place as any to start up a company.</p>
<p>Amongst our investors, we found the trends they were most interested in included sustainable supply chain logistics, esports and gaming, enterprise SaaS, climate tech, deep tech hardware, agritech and edtech. And many said they are interested in the future of work and the transition to different ways of working.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Companies they are excited by included: Afresh Technologies, Seaborg Technologies (nuclear reactors), Labster (virtual science labs), Normative.io (social and environmental impact measurement) and DEMI (connecting with chefs).</p>
<p>In general, investors said they are focused on their home ground but are also spreading their wings to the “New Nordics” (Nordic and Baltic) region. Some are also investing in large European and North American hub cities.</p>
<p>The &#8220;green shoots&#8221; of recovery they see are appearing in anything digital that comes with a community, as well as among startups that are able to leverage the pandemic to generate new business models that are faster than incumbents.</p>

<h2>Sara Rywe, associate, byFounders</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Software and tech (I&#8217;m personally extra excited about the &#8220;future of work,&#8221; fintech, and &#8220;future of food&#8221;).</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Digitail (a veterinary software provider solving the gap between the ever-growing expectations of millennial pet parents and the experience offered by veterinarians with their current tools).</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
I would like to see more founders with global ambitions in the &#8220;uniquely transformative&#8221; software category (the same way Airbnb transformed the hotel industry and Uber transformed the taxi industry). Many startups we see today are building a feature instead of a full solution and their vision is about making industries incrementally better. So, here&#8217;s a callout to all of you Nordic or Baltic visionary founders out there: Write me!</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We always look for competent, visionary and passionate founders building products that people love. As an industry-agnostic VC, we keep our eyes open for a range of different opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Some of the current trends that I see include:<br />
Fintech: salary advances, factoring, sustainability reporting and measurements.<br />
Food tech: alternative protein, pet food, food waste.<br />
Future of work: virtual offices, collaboration, productivity tools.<br />
If you decide to enter any of the above-mentioned industries, I therefore encourage you to really be thoughtful in how you differentiate yourself and/or how your team is better suited to execute on the mission.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
&lt;50%. We invest across the Nordics and Baltics and I&#8217;m covering Sweden, Norway and Denmark.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Denmark is very well positioned to succeed in sustainability and energy (many good talents coming from e.g., Vestas and DTU), consumer goods (there&#8217;s a large history in the country around building brands such as Lego, Carlsberg, etc.), and biotech (Novo Nordisk among others playing a big part). Moreover, software scaleups such as Peakon, Pleo, and Templafy are really leading the way for a new generation of tech startups to thrive in Denmark. When looking at Danish founder particularly, I&#8217;m very excited to see companies such as <a href="http://www.qvin.com">Qvin</a> revolutionizing healthcare for women by using period blood as an opportunity for a noninvasive blood test.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
They should be very excited! Just look at what we&#8217;ve seen in 2021 so far:<br />
Exits: Peakon $700 million exit and Humio $400 million exit.<br />
Large rounds: Public.com raising $220 million, Vivino raising $115 million and Labster raising $60 million led by Andreessen Horowitz</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Somewhat. We already see a lot of innovation outside of Copenhagen in cities such as Aarhus and Odense.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
One industry that has been hit hard by COVID-19 is of course travel and hospitality. The flipside of this is that we see a lot of innovation due to that. Examples from our own portfolio include:<br />
AeroGuest — a platform that allows for a &#8220;touch-free&#8221; travel experience (skipping lines and reception desks, direct online room booking, etc.).<br />
BobW — a new type of sustainable travel accommodation bringing the best of both worlds: &#8220;home meets hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID-19 has not impacted our investment strategy massively and we have the same focus as before (investing in software and tech). With that said, we are happy to see some industries getting an uplift in these difficult times, such as sustainability and impact.<br />
The biggest worries of our portfolio company founders have been around volatility and uncertainty. Since the first lockdown our advice has been simple: You can&#8217;t control the outcome. We&#8217;ve therefore worked together to ensure that they have some proper scenario planning in place and that we think creatively of how to mitigate eventual negative effects on their business.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Tame — one of our portfolio companies — expanded their event platform to also include virtual events, which made it really take off in COVID times.<br />
Corti — another portfolio company of ours — could in less than four weeks build a product for helping fight COVID-19 with artificial intelligence.<br />
Both of these companies are good examples of how &#8220;adapting their products&#8221; due to the pandemic led to great results.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The sudden rise of awareness around impact and ESG among VCs! Several great conversations have been held on how to improve our ways of working.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong><br />
Some of the extraordinary founders that I look up to from Denmark include:<br />
Jakob Jønck (Simple Feast), Andreas Cleve and Lars Maaløe (Corti), Sara Naseri and Søren Therkelsen (Qvin), Niels Martin Brochner, Jarek Owczarek and Viktor Heide (Contractbook), Jacob Hansen, Esben Friis-Jensen, Jakob Storm and Christian Hansen (Cobalt) among others.<br />
There&#8217;s also a range of great investors in Denmark including Helle Uth, Christel Piron, Alexander Viterbo-Horten and Anders Kjær amongst others at PreSeed Ventures and Daniel Nyvang Mariussen with his team at Bumble Ventures. Also, the Danish tech ecosystem would not be what it is without all the work that Vækstfonden does.</p>
<h2>Mads Hørlyck, associate, Maersk Growth</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Supply chain/logistics including sustainable supply chains.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Afresh Technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
In general there are still plenty of opportunities across various parts of the supply chain. We have no particular specific preferences as such at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Digital solution to drive efficiencies across one or more subparts of the supply chain, both upstream and downstream focus.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Freight forwarding has been maturing in Europe and North America with several large startups in both regions. However, the market is still large but it requires a strong new model as it&#8217;s also low margins.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Less/little focus on Denmark. Main priority in large European/North American hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Startups with the medical and supporting functions tech are doing well. We are excited about Onomondo in the Danish scene — also a portfolio company of ours.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
As an upcoming opportunity. Several tech hubs have been created and there is a general good environment including state-backed loans/pre-seed investments and fairly many angels to get going.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
We don&#8217;t expect any significant changes to the founder-environment in Denmark (too little country).</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
We see an increased focus on our investment area: Supply chain/logistics as people throughout the pandemic have been much more exposed to and dependent on flexible and reliable supply chains. All the way from supply resilience, supply chain visibility, fulfillment and to last-mile delivery. Consumers have the power to drive changes in supply chains.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Sales conversion rates decreasing/pipelines drying out. Advice is, like everyone else, to minimize cost and extend runway by getting as close to profitability as model allows. Based on this funding needs can be discussed.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, we have seen some startups being able to leverage the pandemic over incumbents due to their more flexible and digital structure.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
We have yet to see a default wave both globally within our investment area but also in general in Denmark.</p>
<h2>Henrik Møller Kristensen, associate, Bumble Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Some of the trends we&#8217;re excited about are (1) the growing market of digital media and entertainment, in particular esports and gaming, (2) enterprise SaaS, e.g., related to the future of work, (3) climate change solutions, e.g., deep tech hardware and software, and (4) e-commerce businesses, in particular digital native vertical brands and direct-to-consumer cases.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Products and services to satisfy the needs of the aging population. The number of elderly people will be growing significantly over the next decades, establishing a growing market for products and services to satisfy the needs from this demographic change and reduce the pressure on societies.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We highly value team and traction. We are looking for exceptional founders with strong competencies in engineering, product and commercial, preferably with years of experience from the industry they are entering with a new solution. We prefer some indication of product-market fit. We like methodical revenue growth driven by paying customers, rich cohort grids and controllable funnels that proves a robust core business. We don’t like products that are still 2-3 years away from monetization. This means that we will miss the next Facebook, but we are okay with that.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Traditional social media and apps that require millions of users before being able to turn on the business model. SaaS marketing tools also seem crowded.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Next week we will announce our first investment outside Denmark. This is our first step toward being present not only in Denmark, but in the Nordics.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Well-positioned industries in Denmark are medtech, fintech, gaming and clean tech. We&#8217;re excited about GamerzClass, Pie Systems, LeadFamly, Omnigame, Organic Basics, Cap desk, Roccamore, Too Good To Go, Pleo, Tradeshift, SYBO, Unity and more. Exceptional founders are Victor Folmann from GamerzClass, Sunny Long from Pie Systems, Frederikke Antonie Schmidt from Roccamore and Christian Gabriel from Capdesk.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Historically, there has been a need for more capital and talent to keep successful growth-stage startups in Denmark and not have to move to foreign countries to attract talent and capital. However, the investment climate is getting better. Greater access to capital and talent go hand in hand, and what is really changing the investment climate for the better is founders of successful Danish startups turning back to Denmark and reinvesting in the startup community.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I think we&#8217;ll see more attraction to remote work in the future. However, I believe it is important for startups to be close to other great like-minded startups, founders, advisors and investors, not only virtually but in real life. Establishing a great network and personal relationships are very important factors to succeed and remote is not suited very well for that in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
The travel and hospitality industry look weaker and we&#8217;ll see a shift toward lower demand due to remote work and sustainability issues. On the other side, gaming, e-commerce and digital products and services are growing as you will have more people online behind the screens.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
We are still happy to invest despite COVID-19. Gaming has, for example, been positively affected by COVID-19, however, many startups are also struggling due to COVID-19. The best a startup can do is to manage the runway, have close dialogue with their investors, cut costs and try to pivot to the changes. Look for opportunities, not boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Not yet. Only a few of our portfolio companies are negatively affected by COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Investors are willing to make new investments and help out struggling portfolio companies. Founders are keeping their heads high and making the best out of the new circumstances. In some cases it actually stimulates new innovations.</p>
<h2>Benjamin Ratz, partner, Nordic Makers</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Energy and the transition to a fossil fuel society, data as governance and the changing role of education.</p>

Seaborg — building modular, small and safe nuclear reactors.<br />
Labster — virtual science labs that help students all over the world immerse in science and STEM.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Improving the public sector.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Views on how and if the world has permanently changed in behavior due to the pandemic.</p>

Micromobility, teledocs.</p>

100%.</p>
<p><strong>What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Willa. Corti.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
A lot of founders leaving success stories of the region.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come?</strong><br />
No but we expect the cities to produce more.</p>

I&#8217;d love to see more food tech companies that &#8220;get food&#8221; — the human element of it that is. Too many startups focus only on the technology, less on the fact that it should be deeply human centered. This is so prevalent that I instinctively stay away from startups dubbing themselves as &#8220;food tech&#8221; — food is not tech and tech is not food and therein lies the challenge and the prize. Here&#8217;s a read that kind of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/burgers-arent-broken/416727/">sums it up</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Anything that reminds me of these first lines from &#8220;On The Road&#8221;: &#8220;They danced down the streets like dingledodies, and I shambled after as I&#8217;ve been doing all my life after people who interest me, because the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones that never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn …”.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
DNVB.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
25% local (DK is still immature from a startup standout — yet the opportunity is that the VC footprint is small and relatively unsophisticated).</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Companies: Online communities such as <a href="https://demi.community/">DEMI</a>.<br />
Founder: Erez Galonska of Infarm.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Tons of opportunity if you have access to the right deal flow/pedigree.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Communities that transcend digital (like Tonsser and DEMI).</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Worries: Uncertainty and recruitment strategy.<br />
Advice: Survive and prepare.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Anything physical that has retail footprint. Anything digital that has a community footprint.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
That everyone&#8217;s pumped for what&#8217;s about to come (post-COVID) and the realization (or hope?) that nothing will be as before.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally?</strong><br />
Kasper Ottesen, Highbridge (legal).<br />
Kasper Hulthin (entrepreneur and investor).<br />
Christian Tang-Jespersen (investor).</p>
<h2>Eric Lagier, managing partner, byFounders</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Future of work, productivity improvement platforms.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
<a href="http://Normative.io">Normative</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Future of recruiting.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Passionate founders, solving big problems to build a better tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We are focused on the New Nordics (Nordic and Baltic) region having shown the biggest growth potential in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Climate tech, health tech, fintech. Normative, Corti, Lucinity.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Copenhagen is booming and there is now a strong foundation of experienced founders building really transformative companies.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
No — but I expect to see much more diverse teams with a priority on remote first.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
An acceleration of online, remote, e-commerce and general faster pace of transactions.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COvid-19 is a giant accelerator of future trends. Those founders that have adapted best will be the winners of tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
How founders persevere in these times of massive change.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally?</strong><br />
Jakob Jønck, founder, SimpleFeast; Kristian Rönn, founder, Normative; Andreas Cleve and Lars Maal<em>ø</em>e, founders, Corti.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Non-fungible tokens have been around for two years, but these NFTs, one-of-one digital items on the Ethereum and other blockchains, are suddenly becoming a more popular way to collect visual art primarily, whether it&#8217;s an <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://foundation.app/NyanCat/nyan-cat-219">animated cat</a> or an <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/">NBA clip</a> or <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://robbreport.com/shelter/art-collectibles/andres-reisinger-virtual-furniture-attracts-over-450000-auction-1234598157/">virtual furniture.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Suddenly&#8221; is hardly an overstatement. According to the outlet Cointelegraph, during the second half of last year, $9 million worth of NFT goods sold to buyers; during one 24-hour window earlier this week, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-report-predicts-nfts-will-explode-in-popularity-during-2021">$60 million</a> worth of digital goods were sold.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on? A thorough New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/nft-nba-top-shot-crypto.html">piece</a> on the trend earlier this week likely fueled new interest, along with a <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a35500985/who-is-beeple-mike-winkelmann-nft-interview/">separate piece</a> in Esquire about the artist Beeple, a Wisconsin dad whose digital drawings, which he has created every single day for the last 13 years, began selling like hotcakes in December. If you need further evidence of a tipping point (and it is <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/finance/news/benchmark-leads-50-million-investment-050000309.html">ample</a> right now), consider that the work of Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, was just made available <a href="https://www.christies.com/features/Monumental-collage-by-Beeple-is-first-purely-digital-artwork-NFT-to-come-to-auction-11510-7.aspx">through Christie&#8217;s</a>. It&#8217;s the venerable auction house&#8217;s first sale of exclusively digital work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To better understand the market and why it&#8217;s blowing up in real time, we talked this week with David Pakman, a former internet entrepreneur who joined the venture firm Venrock a dozen years ago and began tracking Bitcoin soon after, even mining the cryptocurrency at his Bay Area home beginning in 2015. (&#8220;People would come over and see racks of computers, and it was like, &#8216;It&#8217;s sort of hard to explain.'&#8221;)</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s no surprise that he also became convinced early on of the promise of NFTs, persuading Venrock to lead the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dapper-labs-the-company-behind-cryptokitties-raises-15m-in-financing-to-drive-consumer-adoption-of-blockchain-technology-300741850.html">$15 million Series A round</a> for a young startup, <a href="https://www.dapperlabs.com/">Dapper Labs</a>, when its primary offering was CryptoKitties, limited-edition digital cats that can be bought and bred with cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>While the concept baffled some at the time, Pakman has long seen the day when Dapper&#8217;s offerings will be far more extensive, and indeed, a recent Dapper deal with the NBA to sell <a href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/">collectible highlight clips</a> has already attracted so much interest that Dapper is reportedly right now raising <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/daily/94772/dapper-labs-nba-topshot-fundraise-250-million">$250 million in new funding</a> at a post-money valuation of $2 billion. While Pakman declined to confirm or correct that figure, he did answer our other questions in a chat that&#8217;s been edited here for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: David, dumb things down for us. Why is the world so gung-ho about NFTs right now?</strong></p>
<p>DP: One of the biggest problems with crypto &#8212; the reason it scares so many people &#8212; is it uses all these really esoteric terms to explain very basic concepts, so let&#8217;s just keep it really simple. About 40% of humans collect things &#8212; baseball cards, shoes, artwork, wine. And there&#8217;s a whole bunch of psychological reasons why. Some people have a need to complete a set. Some people do it for investment reasons. Some people want an heirloom to pass down. But we could only collect things in the real world because digital collectibles were too easy to copy.</p>
<p>Then the blockchain came around and [it allowed us to] make digital collectibles immutable, with a record of who owns what that you can&#8217;t really copy. You can screenshot it, but you don&#8217;t really own the digital collectible, and you won&#8217;t be able to do anything with that screenshot. You won&#8217;t be able to to sell it or trade it. The proof is in the blockchain. So I was a believer that crypto-based collectibles could be really big and actually could be the thing that takes crypto mainstream and gets the normals into participating in crypto &#8212; and that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s happening now.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You mentioned a lot of reasons that people collect items, but one you didn&#8217;t mention is status. Assuming that&#8217;s one&#8217;s motivation, how do you show off what you&#8217;ve amassed online? </strong></p>
<p>DP: You&#8217;re right that one of the other reasons why we collect is to show it off status, but I would actually argue it&#8217;s much easier to show off our collections in the digital world. If I&#8217;m a car collector, the only way you&#8217;re going to see my cars is to come over to the garage. Only a certain number of people can do that. But online, we can display our digital collections. NBA Top Shop, for example, makes it very easy for you to show off your moments. Everyone has a page and there&#8217;s an app that&#8217;s coming and you can just show it off to anyone in your app, and you can post it to your social networks. And it&#8217;s actually really easy to show off how big or exciting your collection is.</p>
<p><strong>TC: It was back in October that Dapper rolled out these video moments, which you buy almost like a Pokemon set in that you&#8217;re buying a pack and know you&#8217;ll get something &#8220;good&#8221; but don&#8217;t know what. Yet almost half its sales have come in through the last week. Why?</strong></p>
<p>DP: There&#8217;s only about maybe 30,000 or 40,000 people playing right now. It&#8217;s growing 50% or 100% a day. But the growth has been completely organic. The game is actually still in beta, so we haven&#8217;t been doing any marketing other than posting some stuff on Twitter. There hasn&#8217;t been attempt to market this and get a lot of players [talking about it] because we&#8217;re still working the bugs out, and there are a lot of bugs still to be worked out.</p>
<p>But a couple NBA players have seen this and gotten excited about their own moments [on social media]. And there&#8217;s maybe a little bit of machismo going on where, &#8216;Hey, I want my moment to trade for a higher price.&#8217; But I also think it&#8217;s the normals who are playing this. All you need to play is a credit card, and something like 65% of the people playing have never owned or traded in crypto before. So I think the thesis that crypto collectibles could be the thing that brings mainstream users into crypto is playing out before our eyes.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How does Dapper get paid?</strong></p>
<p>DP: We get 5% of secondary sales and 100% minus the cost of the transaction on primary sales. Of course, we have a relationship with the NBA, which collects some of that, too. But that&#8217;s the basic economics of how the system works.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Does the NBA have a minimum that it has to be paid every year, and then above and beyond that it receives a cut of the action?</strong></p>
<p>DP: I don&#8217;t think the company has gone public with the exact economic terms of their relationships with the NBA and the Players Association. But obviously the NBA is the IP owner, and the teams and the players have economic participation in this, which is good, because they&#8217;re the ones that are creating the intellectual property here.</p>
<p>But a lot of the appreciation of these moments &#8212; if you get one in a pack and you sell it for a higher price &#8212; 95% of that appreciation goes to the owner. So it&#8217;s very similar to baseball cards, but now IP owners can participate through the life of the product in the downstream economic activity of their intellectual property, which I think is super appealing whether you&#8217;re the NBA or someone like Disney, who&#8217;s been in the IP licensing business for decades.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just major IP where this NFT space is happening. It&#8217;s individual creators, musicians, digital artists who could create a piece of digital art, make only five copies of it, and auction it off. They too can collect a little bit each time their works sell in the future.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Regarding NBA Top Shot specifically, prices range massively in terms of what people are paying for the same limited-edition clip. Why?</strong></p>
<p>DP: There are two reasons. One is that like scarce items, lower numbers are worth more than higher numbers, so if there&#8217;s a very particular LeBron moment, and they made 500 [copies] of them, and I own number one, and you own number 399, the marketplace is ascribing a higher value to the lower numbers, which is very typical of limited-edition collector pieces. It&#8217;s sort of a funny concept. But it is a very human concept.</p>
<p>The other thing is that over time there has been more and more demand to get into this game, so people are willing to pay higher and higher prices. That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s been a lot of price appreciation for these moments over time.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You mentioned that some of the esoteric language around crypto scares people, but so does the fact that 20% of the world&#8217;s bitcoin is permanently inaccessible to its owners, including because of forgotten passwords. Is that a risk with these digital items, which you are essentially storing in a digital locker or wallet?</strong></p>
<p>DP: It&#8217;s a complex topic,  but I will say that Dapper has tried to build this in a way where that won&#8217;t happen, where there&#8217;s effectively some type of password recovery process for people who are storing their moments in Dapper&#8217;s wallet.</p>
<p>You will be able to take your moments away from Dapper&#8217;s account and put it into other accounts, where you may be on your own in terms of password recovery.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why is it a complex topic?</strong></p>
<p>DP: There are people who believe that even though centralized account storage is convenient for users, it somehow can be distrustful &#8212; that the company could de-platform you or turn your account off. And in the crypto world, there&#8217;s almost a religious ferocity about making sure that no one can de-platform you, that the things that you buy &#8212; your cryptocurrencies or your NFTs &#8212; are your own. Long term, Dapper supports that. You&#8217;ll be able to take your moments anywhere you want. But today, our customers don&#8217;t have to worry about that I-lost-my-password-and-I&#8217;ll-never-get-my-moments-again problem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Astra, the Alameda-based space launch startup that recently announced its intent to go <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/rocket-startup-astra-is-going-public-vis-spac/">public via a SPAC merger</a>, has secured a contract to deliver six cube satellites to space on behalf of NASA. Astra stands to be paid $7.95 million by the agency for fulfilment of the contract. This will be a key test of Astra&#8217;s responsive rocket capabilities, with a planned three-launch mission profile spanning up to four months, currently targeting sometime between January 8 and July 31 of 2022.</p>
<p>The satellites are for NASA&#8217;s Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation Structure and Storm Intensity with a Constellation of SmallSats (TROPICS) mission, which is a science mission that will collect data about hurricanes and their formation, including temperature, pressure and humidity readings. Like the extremely long, tortured-for-an-acronym name of the mission suggests, the data will be collected using a small constellation of satellites, each roughly the size of a shoebox.</p>

<p>Astra completed late last year its second of three planned launches designed to ultimately achieve orbit, and exceeded its own expectations by reaching space and nearly achieving orbit. The company said that based on the data it collected from that mission, the final remaining barriers to actually making orbit are all fixable via changes to its software. Based on that, Astra CEO and founder Chris Kemp said that it believes it&#8217;s now ready to begin flying commercial payloads.</p>
<p>Kemp was formerly CTO of NASA, and has co-founded a number of technology companies over the years, as well. This latest NASA mission isn&#8217;t its first contracted launch &#8212; far from it, in fact, since the company has said it currently has more than 50 total missions on its slate from both private and government customers, with a total value of more than $150 million in revenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wall Street investors can be fickle beasts. Take <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> as an example. The CRM giant announced a $5.82 billion quarter when it reported earnings yesterday. Revenue was up 20% year over year. The company also reported $21.25 billion in total revenue for the just-closed FY2021, up 24% YoY. If that wasn&#8217;t enough, it raised its FY2022 guidance (its upcoming fiscal year) to over $25 billion. What&#8217;s not to like?</p>
<p>You want higher quarterly revenue, Salesforce gave you higher revenue. You want high growth and solid projected revenue &#8212; check and check. In fact, it&#8217;s hard to find anything to complain about in the report. The company is performing and growing at a rate that is remarkable for an organization of its size and maturity &#8212; and it is expected to continue to perform and grow.</p>
<p>How did Wall Street react to this stellar report? It punished the stock with the price down over 6%, a pretty dismal day considering the company brought home such a promising report card.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2118635" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118635" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2118635" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-5.12.45-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="2/6/21 Salesforce stock report with stock down 6.31%" width="680" height="354" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-5.12.45-PM.jpg 1516w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-5.12.45-PM.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-5.12.45-PM.jpg?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-5.12.45-PM.jpg?resize=768,400 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-5.12.45-PM.jpg?resize=680,354 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-5.12.45-PM.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118635" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>So what is going on here? It could be that investors simply don&#8217;t believe the growth is sustainable or that the company overpaid <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">when it bought Slack at the end of last year</a> for over $27 billion. It could be it&#8217;s just people overreacting to a cooling market this week. But if investors are looking for a high-growth company, Salesforce is delivering that.</p>
<p>While Slack was expensive, it reported revenue over $250 million yesterday, pushing it over the $1 billion run rate with more than 100 customers paying over $1 million in ARR. Those numbers will eventually get added to Salesforce&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>Canaccord Genuity analyst David Hynes Jr. wrote that he was baffled by investors&#8217; reaction to this report. Like me, he saw a lot of positives. Yet Wall Street decided to focus on the negative, and see &#8220;the glass half empty,&#8221; as he put it in his note to investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stock is clearly in the show-me camp, which means it’s likely to take another couple of quarters for investors to buy into the idea that fundamentals are actually quite solid here, and that Slack was opportunistic (and yes, pricey), but not an attempt to mask suddenly deteriorating growth,&#8221; Hynes wrote.</p>
<p>During the call with analysts yesterday, Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse asked how well the company could accelerate out of the pandemic-induced economic malaise, and Gavin Patterson, Salesforce&#8217;s president and chief revenue officer, says the company is ready whenever the world moves past the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;And let me reassure you, we are building the capability in terms of the sales force. You&#8217;d be delighted to hear that we&#8217;re investing significantly in terms of our direct sales force to take advantage of that demand. And I&#8217;m very confident we&#8217;ll be able to meet it. So I think you&#8217;re hearing today a message from us all that the business is strong, the pipeline is strong and we&#8217;ve got confidence going into the year,&#8221; Patterson said.</p>
<p>While Salesforce execs were clearly pumped up yesterday with good reason, there&#8217;s still doubt out in investor land that manifested itself in the stock starting down and staying down all day. It will be, as Hynes suggested, up to Salesforce to keep proving them wrong. As long as they keep producing quarters like the one they had this week, they should be just fine, regardless of what the naysayers on Wall Street may be thinking today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When I needed a new sofa several months ago, I was pleased to find a buy now, pay later (BNPL) option during the checkout process. I had prepared myself to make a major financial outlay, but the service fees were well worth the convenience of deferring the entire payment.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I was siting on said sofa this morning and considering that transaction when Alex Wilhelm submitted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/as-bnpl-startups-raise-a-look-at-klarna-affirm-and-afterpay-earnings/">a column that compared recent earnings for three BNPL providers</a>: Afterpay, Affirm and Klarna.</p>
<p>I asked him why he decided to dig into the sector with such gusto.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<hr />
<p>&#8220;What struck me about the concept was that we had just seen earnings from Affirm,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So we had three BNPL players with known earnings, and I had just covered a startup funding round in the space.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Toss in some obvious audience interest, and it was an easy choice to write the piece. Now the question is whether I did a good job and people find value in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I avoid running Extra Crunch stories that focus on best practices; you can find those anywhere. Instead, we look for &#8220;here&#8217;s what worked for me&#8221; articles that give readers actionable insights.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a much better use of your time and ours.</p>
<p>With that ethos in mind, Lucas Matney interviewed Pilot CEO Waseem Daher to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/pilot-ceo-waseem-daher-tears-down-his-companys-60m-series-c-pitch-deck/">deconstruct the pitch deck that helped his company land a $60M Series C round</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Series A was about, &#8216;Do you have the right ingredients to make this work?&#8217; then the Series B is about, &#8216;Is this actually working?'&#8221; Daher tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then the Series C is more, &#8216;Well, show me that the core business is really working and that you have unlocked real drivers to allow the business to continue growing.'&#8221;</p>

<p>A global survey of automobile owners found three hurdles to overcome before consumers will widely embrace electric vehicles:</p>
<ul>
<li>30-minute charging time</li>
<li>300-mile range</li>
<li>$36,000 maximum cost</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Theoretically, solid state batteries (SSB) could deliver all three,&#8221; but for now, lithium-ion batteries are the go-to for most EVs (along with laptops and phones).</p>
<p>In our latest market map, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">we&#8217;ve plotted the new and established players in the SSB sector</a> and listed many of the investors who are backing them.</p>
<p>Although SSBs are years away from mass production, &#8220;we are on the cusp of some pretty incredible discoveries using major improvements in computational science and machine learning algorithms to accelerate that process,&#8221; says SSB startup founder Amy Prieto.</p>

<p>Founded in 1996, F5 has repositioned itself in the networking market several times in its history. In the last two years, however, it spent $2.2 billion to acquire Shape Security, Volterra and NGINX.</p>
<p>&#8220;As large organizations age, they often need to pivot to stay relevant, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/why-f5-spent-2-2b-on-3-companies-to-focus-on-cloud-native-applications/">I wanted to explore one of these transformational shifts</a>,&#8221; said enterprise reporter Ron Miller.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spoke to the CEO of F5 to find out the strategy behind his company&#8217;s pivot and how he leveraged three acquisitions to push his organization in a new direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>I asked Alex Wilhelm to dial back the profanity he used to describe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/oscar-healths-initial-ipo-price-is-so-high-it-makes-me-want-to-swear/">Oscar Health&#8217;s proposed valuation</a>, but perhaps I was too conservative.</p>
<p>In March 2018, the insurtech unicorn was valued at around $3.2 billion. Today, with the company aiming to debut at $32 to $34 per share, its fully diluted valuation is closer to $7.7 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;The clear takeaway from the first Oscar Health IPO pricing interval is that public investors have lost their minds,&#8221; says Alex.</p>
<p>His advice for companies considering an IPO? &#8220;Go public now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poring through LinkedIn and reviewing past speaker lists at industry conferences are good places to find decision-makers, for example.</p>

<p>The most effective marketing uses good storytelling, not persuasion.</p>
<p>According to Caryn Marooney, general partner at Coatue Management, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/ribs-the-messaging-framework-for-every-company-and-product/">every compelling story is relevant, inevitable, believable and simple</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Behind most successful companies is a story that checks every one of those boxes,&#8221; says Marooney, but &#8220;this is a central challenge for every startup.&#8221;</p>

<p>On a recent episode of Extra Crunch Live, Ironclad founder and CEO Jason Boehmig and Accel partner Steve Loughlin discussed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/ironclads-jason-boehmig-the-objective-of-pricing-is-to-become-less-wrong-over-time/">the pitch that brought them together almost four years ago</a>.</p>
<p>Since that $8 million Series A, Loughlin joined Ironclad&#8217;s board. &#8220;Both agree that the work they put in up front had paid off&#8221; when it comes to how well they work together, says Jordan Crook.</p>
<p>“We’ve always been up front about the fact that we consider the board a part of the company,” said Boehmig.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If Southern California-based <a href="https://www.roadrunnermedia.com">Road Runner Media</a> succeeds, you&#8217;ll start seeing a lot more ads while you&#8217;re driving.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the startup is placing digital screens on the back of technicians&#8217; vans, delivery vehicles, buses and other commercial vehicles. Those screens can show both ads and serve as a brake light — according to founder and chairman Randall Lanham, the brake light functionality is required if you&#8217;re putting a sign on the back of a vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way we look at it, we are a digital brake light,&#8221; Lanham said. Yes, the brake light is showing ads, but &#8220;the driver touching the brakes interrupts the ad.&#8221; (The sign can also indicate turns, reversing and emergency flashers. You can see a mock-up ad in the image above, and real footage in the video below.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To pursue this idea, Lanham (who described himself as a &#8220;recovering attorney&#8221;) enlisted Chris Riley as CEO — Riley&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisrriley/">experience</a> includes several years as CEO of PepsiCo Australia and New Zealand. And the company announced this week that it has secured $62.5 million in debt financing from Baseline Growth Capital.</p>
<p>The idea of putting ads on moving vehicles isn&#8217;t new. There are, of course, ads on the tops of taxis, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/firefly-strong-outdoor/">startups like Firefly</a> are also putting digital signage on top of Ubers and Lyfts. But Riley said Road Runner&#8217;s ruggedized, high-resolution LCD screens are very different, due to their size, quality and placement.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aHLqgphZuv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/firefly-strong-outdoor/">Rideshare and taxi ad startup Firefly acquires Strong Outdoor’s out-of-home ad business</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rideshare and taxi ad startup Firefly acquires Strong Outdoor’s out-of-home ad business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/firefly-strong-outdoor/embed/#?secret=aHLqgphZuv" data-secret="aHLqgphZuv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;[Taxi-top ads] don&#8217;t have the color, the brilliance, the clarity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can run a true video ad on the screen.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDX1hFXCmNE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Riley also said the ads can be targeted based on GPS and time of day, and that the company eventually plans to add sensors to collect data on who&#8217;s actually seeing the ads.</p>
<p>As for concerns that these big, bright screens might distract drivers, Lanham argued they&#8217;re actually attracting driver&#8217;s eyes to exactly where they should be, and creating a brake light that&#8217;s much harder to ignore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your eyes are affixed on the horizon, which is what the [Department of Transportation] wants — as opposed to on the floor or the radio or directly off to the left or right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That’s where your safest driving occurs, when your eyes are up above the dashboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, Lanham said he&#8217;s &#8220;very passionate&#8221; about the company&#8217;s mission, which in his view will make roads safer, and is creating a platform that could also be used to spread public service messages.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have the ability to retrofit any vehicle and make it safer on the highways,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I really, truly believe that we will save lives, if we already haven’t.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company says it already has 150 screens live in Atlanta, Boulder, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles, with plans to launch screens in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yelp released <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/2021/02/yelp-launches-trust-safety-site-and-releases-2020-trust-safety-report">its very first trust and safety report</a> this week, with the goal of explaining the work that it does to crack down on fraudulent and otherwise inaccurate or unhelpful content.</p>
<p>With its focus on local business reviews and information, you might think Yelp would be relatively free of the misinformation that other social media platforms struggle with. But of course, Yelp reviews are high stakes in their own way, since they can have a big impact on a business&#8217; bottom line.</p>
<p>Like other online platforms, Yelp relies on a mix of software and human curation. On the software side, one of the main tasks is sorting reviews into recommended and not recommended. Group Product Manager for Trust and Safety Sudheer Someshwara told me that a review might not be recommended because it appears to be written by someone with a conflict of interest, or it might be solicited by the business, or it might come from a user who hasn&#8217;t posted many reviews before and &#8220;we just don&#8217;t know enough information about the user to recommend those reviews to our community.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We take fairness and integrity very seriously,&#8221; Someshwara said. &#8220;No employee at Yelp has the ability to override decisions the software has made. That even includes the engineers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;We treat every business the same, whether they&#8217;re advertising with us or not.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118565" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118565" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2118565" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-3.13.00-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="Yelp trust and safety report" width="680" height="537" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-3.13.00-PM.jpg 1090w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-3.13.00-PM.jpg?resize=150,118 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-3.13.00-PM.jpg?resize=300,237 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-3.13.00-PM.jpg?resize=768,606 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-3.13.00-PM.jpg?resize=680,537 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-3.13.00-PM.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118565" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yelp</p></div></p>
<p>So the company says that last year, users posted more than 18.1 million reviews, of which 4.6 million (about 25%) were not recommended by the software. Someshwara noted that even when a review is not recommended, it&#8217;s not removed entirely — users just have to seek it out in a separate section.</p>
<p>Removals do happen, but that&#8217;s one of the places where the user operations team comes in. As Vice President of Legal, Trust &amp; Safety Aaron Schur explained, &#8220;We do make it easy for businesses as well as consumers to flag reviews. Every piece of content that’s flagged in that way does get reviewed by a live human to decide whether it should should be removed for violating our guidelines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yelp says that last year, about 710,000 reviews (4%) were removed entirely for violating the company&#8217;s policies. Of those, more than 5,200 were removed for violating the platform&#8217;s COVID-19 guidelines (among other things, they prohibit reviewers from claiming they contracted COVID from a business, or from complaining about mask requirements or criticizing a business had to close due to safety regulations). Another 13,300 were removed between May 25 and the end of the year for threats, lewdness, hate speech or other harmful content.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any current event that takes place will find its way onto Yelp,&#8221; acknowledged Vice President of User Operations Noorie Malik. &#8220;People turn to Yelp and other social media platforms to have a voice.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIaOBxcntqw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>But expressing political beliefs can conflict with what Malik said is Yelp&#8217;s &#8220;guiding principle,&#8221; namely &#8220;genuine, first-hand experience.&#8221; So Yelp has built software to detect unusual activity on a page and will also add a Consumer Alert when it believes there are &#8220;egregious attempts to manipulate ratings and reviews.&#8221; For example, it says there was a 206% increase in media-fueled incidents year over year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that you can&#8217;t express political opinions in your reviews, but the review has to come from firsthand experience, rather than being prompted by reading a negative article or an angry tweet about the business. Sometimes, Malik added, that means the team is &#8220;removing content with a point of view that we agree with.&#8221;</p>
<p>One example that illustrates this distinction: Yelp will take down reviews that seem driven by media coverage suggesting that a business owner or employee behaved in a racist manner, but at the same time, it also labeled two businesses in December 2020 with a &#8220;Business Accused of Racism&#8221; alert reflecting &#8220;resounding evidence of egregious, racist actions from a business owner or employee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond looking at individual reviews and spikes in activity, Someshwara said Yelp will also perform &#8220;sting operations&#8221; to find groups that are posting fraudulent reviews.</p>
<p>In fact, his team apparently shut down 1,200 user accounts associated with review rings and reported nearly 200 groups to other platforms. And it just rolled out <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/2021/02/yelp-updates-recommendation-software-to-better-target-and-mitigate-content-from-online-review-exchange-groups">an updated algorithm</a> designed to better detect and unrecommend reviews coming from those groups.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">What can we learn from the best 40 venture capital investments of all time? Well, we learn to invest exclusively in men, preferably white or Asian.</p>
<p>We reviewed CB Insights’ global list of <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/best-venture-capital-investments/#Cer">“40 of the Best VC Bets of all Time.”</a> All of the 40 companies’ 92 founders were male.</p>
<ul>
<li>Of the 43 U.S.-based founders, 35 were white American; four were white immigrant/first generation, from France, Ukraine, Russia and Iran; and four were Indian immigrant/first generation.</li>
<li>Of the 19 Western Europe/Israel-based founders, all were white.</li>
<li>Of the 30 Asia-based founders, all were natives of the country in which they built their businesses: 23 Chinese, three Japanese, two Korean and two Indian.</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2118540" style="width: 886px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118540" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2118540" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/founders-by-nationality.png" alt="top founders by nationality, according to CB Insights’ global list of “40 of the Best VC Bets of all Time.”" width="876" height="506" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/founders-by-nationality.png 876w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/founders-by-nationality.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/founders-by-nationality.png?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/founders-by-nationality.png?resize=768,444 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/founders-by-nationality.png?resize=680,393 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/founders-by-nationality.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118540" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://versatilevc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Versatile Venture Capital <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, this dataset is incomplete. There are numerous examples of founders from underrepresented backgrounds who have generated extremely impressive returns. For example, Calendly’s Tope Awotona is Nigerian American; Sendgrid’s Isaac Saldana is Latinx; and Bumble’s Whitney Wolfe Herd is the second-youngest woman to take a company public.</p>
<p>That said, the pattern in the dataset is striking.<b> So, why invest in anyone who’s not a white or Asian male? </b></p>
<p>The conventional answer is that diversity pays. Research from BCG, Harvard Business Review, First Round Capital, the Kauffman Foundation and Illuminate Ventures shows that investors in diverse teams get better returns:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/bias.html">Paul Graham</a>, co-founder of Y Combinator (2015): “Many suspect that venture capital firms are biased against female founders. This would be easy to detect: among their portfolio companies, do startups with female founders outperform those without? A couple months ago, one VC firm (almost certainly unintentionally) published a study showing bias of this type. First Round Capital <a href="http://10years.firstround.com/#one">found</a> that among its portfolio companies, startups with female founders outperformed those without by 63%.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kauffmanfellows.org/journal_posts/the-pipeline-myth-ethnicity-fund-managers">Kauffman Fellows Report</a> (2020): “Diverse Founding Teams generate higher median realized multiples (RMs) on Acquisitions and IPOs. Diverse Founding Teams returned 3.3x, while White Founding Teams returned 2.5x. The results are even more pronounced when looking at the perceived ethnicity of the executive team. Diverse Executive Teams returned 3.3x, while White Executive Teams only returned 2.0x. As mentioned above, we report realized multiples (RMs) only for successful startups that were acquired or went through the IPO process.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet">BCG</a> (June 2018): “Startups founded and co-founded by women actually performed better over time, generating 10% more in cumulative revenue over a five-year period: $730,000 compared with $662,000.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/how-diverse-leadership-teams-boost-innovation">BCG</a> (January 2018): “Companies that reported above-average diversity on their management teams also reported innovation revenue that was 19 percentage points higher than that of companies with below-average leadership diversity — 45% of total revenue versus just 26%.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.piie.com/system/files/documents/wp16-3.pdf">Peterson Institute for International Economics</a> (2016): “The correlation between women at the C-suite level and firm profitability is demonstrated repeatedly, and the magnitude of the estimated effects is not small. For example, a profitable firm at which 30% of leaders are women could expect to add more than 1 percentage point to its net margin compared with an otherwise similar firm with no female leaders. By way of comparison, the typical profitable firm in our sample had a net profit margin of 6.4%, so a 1 percentage point increase represents a 15% boost to profitability.”</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How do we reconcile these two sets of data? </b>Research going back a decade shows that diverse teams, companies and founders pay, so why are all of the VC home runs from white men, or Asian men in Asia, plus a few Asian men in the U.S.?</p>
<p>First Round did not include their investment in Uber in their analysis we reference above on the grounds that it was an outlier. Of course, one could rebut that by saying traditional VC is all about investing in outliers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seth Levine analyzed data from Correlation Ventures (21,000 financings from 2004-2013) and <a href="https://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2014/08/venture-outcomes-are-even-more-skewed-than-you-think.html">writes</a> that “a full 65% of financings fail to return 1x capital. And perhaps more interestingly, only 4% produce a return of 10x or more, and only 10% produce a return of 5x or more.” In Levine’s extrapolated model, he found that in a “hypothetical $100 million fund with 20 investments, the total number of financings producing a return above 5x was 0.8 — producing almost $100 million of proceeds. My theoretical fund actually didn’t find their purple unicorn, they found four-fifths of that company. If they had missed it, they would have failed to return capital after fees.”</li>
<li>Benedict Evans <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/4/28/winning-and-losing">observes</a> that the best investors don’t seem to be better at avoiding startups that fail. “For funds with an overall return of 3x-5x, which is what VC funds aim for, the overall return was 4.6x but the return of the deals that did better than 10x was actually 26.7x. For &gt;5x funds, it was 64.3x. The best VC funds don’t just have more failures and more big wins — they have bigger big wins.”</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The first problem with the outlier model of investing in VC is that it results in, on average, poor returns and is a risker proposition compared to alternative models. </b><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/kloeckner/kauffman-foundationventurecapital">The Kauffman Foundation</a> analyzed their own investments in venture capital (100 funds) over a 20-year period and found “only 20 of the hundred venture funds generated returns that beat a public-market equivalent by more than 3% annually,” while 62 “failed to exceed returns available from the public markets, after fees and carry were paid.”</p>
<p><b>The outlier model of investing in VC also typically results in a bias toward investing in homogeneous teams. </b>We suggest that the extremely homogeneous profiles of the big wealth creators above reflect the fact that these are people who took the biggest risks: financial, reputational and career risk. The people who can afford to take the biggest risks are also the people with the most privilege; they’re not as concerned about providing for food, shelter and healthcare as economically stressed people are. According to the <a href="https://www.kauffman.org/entrepreneurship/reports/the-anatomy-of-an-entrepreneur/">Kauffman Foundation</a>, a study of “549 company founders of successful businesses in high-growth industries, including aerospace, defense, computing, electronics and healthcare” showed that “more than 90% of the entrepreneurs came from middle-class or upper-lower-class backgrounds and were well-educated: 95.1% of those surveyed had earned bachelor’s degrees, and 47% had more advanced degrees.&#8221; But when you analyze the next tier down of VC success, the companies that don’t make Top 40 lists but land on Top 500 lists, you see a lot more diversity.</p>
<p>In VC, 100x investment opportunities only come along once every few years. If you bet your VC fund on opportunities like that, you’re relying on luck. Hope is not a strategy. There are many 3x-20x return opportunities, and if you’re incredibly lucky (or Chris Sacca), you might get one 100x in your career.</p>
<p>We prefer to invest based on statistics, not luck. That’s why <a href="http://versatilevc.com">Versatile VC</a> provides companies with the option of an “alternative VC” model, using a nontraditional term sheet designed to better align incentives between investors and founders. We also proactively seek to invest in diverse teams. Given the choice of running a fund with one 100x investment, or a fund with two 10x investments, we’ll take the latter. The former implies that we came perilously close to missing our one home run, and therefore we’re not doing such a great job investing.</p>
<p>“While we all want to have invested in those exciting home runs/unicorns, most investors are seeking the data points to construct reliable portfolios,” Shelly Porges, co-founder and managing partner of <a href="https://beyondthebillion.com/">Beyond the Billion</a>, observed. “That&#8217;s not about aiming for the bleachers but leveraging experience to reliably deliver on the singles and doubles it takes to get to home base. A number of the institutional investors we&#8217;ve spoken to have gone so far as to say that they can no longer meet their targets without alternatives, including venture investments. “</p>
<p>Lastly, the data above reflects companies that typically took a decade to build. As the culture changes, we anticipate that the 2030 “Top 40” wealth creators list will include many more people with diverse backgrounds. Just in 2018, 15 unicorns were <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/more-female-founded-unicorns-were-born-in-2019-that-before-data-shows/">born</a> with at least one woman founder; in 2019, 21 startups founded or co-founded by a woman became unicorns. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>“All else being equal, a larger pool of female-founded companies to select from</b> for VC investing should increase the odds of a higher number of female-founded VC home runs,” said Michael Chow, research director for the National Venture Capital Association and Venture Forward. According to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/vc-funding-female-founders-drops-low">PitchBook</a>, investments in women-led companies grew approximately 54% from 2015 to 2019, from 459 to 709. In the first three quarters of 2020, there have been 468 fundings of women-led companies; this figure beats 2015, 2016 and nearly 2017 total annual fundings. <a href="https://www.projectdiane.com/">ProjectDiane</a> highlights that from 2018 to 2020, the number of Black women who have raised $1 million in venture funding nearly tripled, and the number of Latinx women doubled. Their average two-year fail rate is also 13 percentage points lower than the overall average.</li>
<li><b>“Millennials value a diverse workforce,”</b> Chow added, according to Gallup and Deloitte Millennial surveys. “In the battle for talent, diverse founders may have the edge in attracting the best and brightest, and talent is what is required for going from zero to one.”</li>
<li><b>The rise in popularity of alternative VC models</b>, which are disproportionately <a href="https://teten.com/blog/2019/08/20/why-are-revenue-based-vcs-investing-in-so-many-women-underrepresented-founders/">attractive</a> to women and underrepresented founders. We are in the very early days of this wave; according to research by <a href="https://bootstrapp.co">Bootstrapp</a>, 32 U.S. firms have launched an inaugural Revenue-Based Finance fund. <a href="http://clearbanc.com">Clearbanc</a> notes on their site they have “invested in thousands of companies using data science to identify high-growth funding opportunities. This data-driven approach takes the bias out of decision-making. Clearbanc has funded 8x more female founders than traditional VCs and has invested in 43 states in the U.S. in 2019.”</li>
<li><b>More VCs are working proactively to market to underrepresented founders. </b>“<a href="http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-implicit-bias.pdf">Implicit biases are robust and pervasive</a>; it takes a proactive and intentional approach to shift the current status quo of funding,” <a href="https://www.dreamersdoers.com/">Dreamers &amp; Doers</a> Founder Gesche Haas said. Holly Jacobus, an investment partner at <a href="https://www.joyancepartners.com/team-1/2018/10/20/holly-jacobus">Joyance Partners and Social Starts</a>, noted that “we&#8217;re proud to boast a portfolio <a href="https://www.joyancepartners.com/blog/2020/5/25/why-we-are-strong-in-the-mighty-middle">featuring ~30% female founders</a> in core roles — well above the industry average — without specific targeting of any sort. However, there is still work to be done. That&#8217;s why we lean heavily on our software and CEOs to find the best tech and teams in the best segments, and we are always <a href="https://www.joyancepartners.com/blog/2020/7/15/inception-with-venture-partner-charles-smith">actively working</a> on improving the process with new systems that remove bias from the dealflow and diligence process.&#8221;</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s internal R&amp;D group, NPE Team, is today launching its next experimental app, called <a href="http://bars.app/">BARS</a>. The app makes it possible for rappers to create and share their raps using professionally created beats, and is the NPE Team&#8217;s second launch in the music space following its recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/facebook-publicly-launches-its-collaborative-music-video-app-collab/">public debut of music video app Collab</a>.</p>
<p>While Collab focuses on making music with others online, BARS is instead aimed at would-be rappers looking to create and share their own videos. In the app, users will select from any of the hundreds of professionally created beats, then write their own lyrics and record a video. BARS can also automatically suggest rhymes as you&#8217;re writing out lyrics, and offers different audio and visual filters to accompany videos as well as an autotune feature.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a &#8220;Challenge mode&#8221; available, where you can freestyle with auto-suggested word cues, which has more of a game-like element to it. The experience is designed to be accommodating to people who just want to have fun with rap, similar to something like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smule.autorap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Smule&#8217;s AutoRap</a>, perhaps, which also offers beats for users&#8217; own recordings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2118130" style="width: 605px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118130" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2118130" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.30.17-PM.jpg?w=595" alt="" width="595" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.30.17-PM.jpg 1486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.30.17-PM.jpg?resize=131,150 131w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.30.17-PM.jpg?resize=263,300 263w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.30.17-PM.jpg?resize=768,878 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.30.17-PM.jpg?resize=595,680 595w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.30.17-PM.jpg?resize=1344,1536 1344w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.30.17-PM.jpg?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118130" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>The videos themselves can be up to 60 seconds in length and can then be saved to your Camera Roll or shared out on other social media platforms.</p>
<p>Like NPE&#8217;s Collab, the pandemic played a role in BARS&#8217; creation. The pandemic shut down access to live music and places where rappers could experiment, explains NPE Team member DJ Iyler, who also ghostwrites hip-hop songs under the alias &#8220;D-Lucks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know access to high-priced recording studios and production equipment can be limited for aspiring rappers. On top of that, the global pandemic shut down live performances where we often create and share our work,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>BARS was built with a team of aspiring rappers, and today launched into a closed beta.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118131" style="width: 556px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118131" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2118131" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.29.54-PM.jpg?w=546" alt="" width="546" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.29.54-PM.jpg 1520w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.29.54-PM.jpg?resize=121,150 121w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.29.54-PM.jpg?resize=241,300 241w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.29.54-PM.jpg?resize=768,956 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.29.54-PM.jpg?resize=546,680 546w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.29.54-PM.jpg?resize=1234,1536 1234w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.29.54-PM.jpg?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118131" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Despite the focus on music, and rap in particular, the new app in a way can be seen as yet another attempt by Facebook to develop a TikTok competitor &#8212; at least in this content category.</p>
<p>TikTok has already become a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rappers-sharing-music-on-tiktok-2019-7">launchpad for up-and-coming musicians</a>, including rappers; it has helped <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/tiktok-championxiii-freestyles-1097255/">rappers test their verses</a>, is favored by many <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504619/ricky-desktop-tiktok-beat-creator-interview-musician-viral-hits">beatmakers</a> and is even <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/tiktok-baby-rap">influencing</a> what sort of music is being made. <a href="https://www.intheknow.com/post/tiktok-diss-tracks/">Diss tracks</a> have also become a hugely popular format on TikTok, mainly as a way for influencers to stir up drama and chase views. In other words, there&#8217;s already a large social community around rap on TikTok, and Facebook wants to shift some of that attention back its way.</p>
<p>The app also resembles TikTok in terms of its user interface. It&#8217;s a two-tabbed vertical video interface &#8212; in its case, it has  &#8220;Featured&#8221; and &#8220;New&#8221; feeds instead of TikTok&#8217;s &#8220;Following&#8221; and &#8220;For You.&#8221; And BARS places the engagement buttons on the lower-right corner of the screen with the creator name on the lower-left, just like TikTok.</p>

<p>However, in place of hearts for favoriting videos, your taps on a video give it &#8220;Fire&#8221; &#8212; a fire emoji keeps track. You can tap &#8220;Fire&#8221; as many times as you want, too. But because there&#8217;s (annoyingly) no tap-to-pause feature, you may accidentally &#8220;fire&#8221; a video when you were looking for a way to stop its playback. To advance in BARS, you swipe vertically, but the interface is lacking an obvious &#8220;Follow&#8221; button to track your favorite creators. It&#8217;s hidden under the top-right three-dot menu.</p>
<p>The app is seeded with content from NPE Team members, which includes other aspiring rappers, former music producers and publishers.</p>
<p>Currently, the BARS beta is live on the iOS App Store in the U.S., and is opening its waitlist. Facebook says it will open access to BARS invites in batches, starting in the U.S. Updates and news about invites, meanwhile, will be announced on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/getbarsapp/">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s recent launches from its experimental apps division include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/facebook-launches-collab-a-mix-and-match-app-for-making-collaborative-music-videos/">Collab</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/facebook-launches-e-gg-an-experimental-collage-making-app/">collage maker E.gg,</a> among others. Not all apps stick around. If they fail to gain traction, Facebook shuts them down &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/facebook-shuts-down-hobbi-its-experimental-app-for-documenting-personal-projects/">as it did last year</a> with the Pinterest-like video app Hobbi.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The freemium marketing approach has become commonplace among B2C and B2B software providers alike. Considering that most see fewer </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2014/05/making-freemium-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">than 5%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of free users move to paid plans, even a slight improvement in conversion can translate to significant revenue gains. The (multi) million-dollar question is, how do they do it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer lies in product analytics, which offer teams the ability to ask and answer any number of questions about the customer journey on an ad-hoc basis. Combined with a commitment to testing, measurement and iteration, this puts data in the driver’s seat and helps teams make better decisions about what’s in the free tier and what’s behind the paywall. Successful enterprises make this evaluation an ongoing exercise.</span></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Often, the truth of product analytics is that actionable insights come from just a fraction of the data and it can take time to understand what’s happening.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Sweat the small stuff</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A freemium business model is simply a set of interconnected funnels. From leads all the way through to engagement, conversion and retention, understanding each step and making even small optimizations at any stage will have down-funnel implications. Start by using product analytics to understand the nuances of what’s working and what isn’t, and then double down on the former.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, identify specific personas that perform well and perform poorly. While your overall conversion average may be 5%, there can be segments converting at 10% or 1%. Understanding the difference can shine a light on where to focus. That’s where the right analytics can lead to significant results. But if you don’t understand </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">why</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to improve, you’re left with guesswork. And that’s not a modern way of operating.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a misconception that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">volume </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of data equals </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">value </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of data. Let’s say you want to jump-start your funnel by buying pay-per-click traffic. You see a high volume of activity, with numbers going up at the beginning of your funnel and a sales team busy with calls. However, you come to learn the increased traffic, which looked so promising at the outset, results in very few users converting to paid plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, this is a story as old as PPC, but in the small percentage that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">convert, there’s a lot to learn about where to focus your efforts — which product features keep users hooked and which ones go unused. Often, the truth of product analytics is that actionable insights come from just a fraction of the data and it can take time to understand what’s happening. Getting users on board the free plan is just the first step in conversion. The testing and iteration continue from there.</span></p>
<h2>The dropped and the languished</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the free tier, users may languish — satisfied with whatever features they can access. If your funnel is full of languishing users, you’ve at least solved the adoption problem, so why are they stuck? Without a testing and tracking approach, you’ll struggle to understand your users and how they respond, by segment, to changes.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lightspeed Venture Partners, the well-known Silicon Valley venture capital firm that has backed the likes of DoubleClick and Snapchat, is in the midst of hiring a second London-based investment partner as it looks to put down further roots in Europe, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>According to multiple sources, Paul Murphy, whose investments include Tier, Hopin, Klang and Bunch, is being hired away from Northzone, the European VC firm that’s probably best known for being an early backer of Spotify. The signing is still in progress but could be announced in the next few weeks. Murphy has been at Northzone for three years and was promoted to general partner in late 2019 when the firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/17/northzone-raises-new-500m-fund/">raised a new $500 million fund</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve reached out to Murphy and Lightspeed for comment and will update this article if or when I hear back.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VI6Vaiwfa3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/vcs-are-chasing-hopin-upwards-of-5-6b-valuation/">VCs are chasing Hopin upwards of $5-6B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;VCs are chasing Hopin upwards of $5-6B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/vcs-are-chasing-hopin-upwards-of-5-6b-valuation/embed/#?secret=VI6Vaiwfa3" data-secret="VI6Vaiwfa3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Prior to VC, Murphy co-founded Dots, the mobile games company in New York. He also built and invested in various companies at startup studio Betaworks. (Notably, Murphy helped launch Giphy in the U.S., which Lightspeed ended up backing and later sold to Facebook for $400 million). Before that, he held several roles at Microsoft in the U.S., U.K. and India. He also holds a BS in Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech and an MBA from The IE Business School in Spain, according to the Northzone website.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the fact that Lightspeed is formally putting more people on the ground in Europe should come as no surprise to close watchers of the ecosystem here. TechCrunch first heard rumors that the Menlo Park-based VC was recruiting a partner in London as far back as August in 2019. That saw Rytis Vitkauskas join the U.S. firm as its first partner in London the following September, according to LinkedIn. Should Murphy&#8217;s recruitment be confirmed it would signal a significant expansion of a Lightspeed London &#8220;office,&#8221; and confirmation that the VC is doubling down in the region.</p>
<p>Those rumors in late last 2019 coincided with news spreading that another Silicon Valley VC heavyweight, Sequoia, was also doing the same &#8212; along with talk of other U.S. VC firms &#8212; as European tech companies continue to create more value than ever before. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/7-things-we-just-learned-about-sequoias-european-expansion-plans/">Sequoia&#8217;s own plans</a> were finally announced in November, including that it had poached Luciana Lixandru away from rival Accel Partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lisa Wu, a partner at Norwest with investments like Calm, Plaid, Opendoor and Grove Collaborative, has a message for founders: Think like a VC during your pitch presentation. After all, accepting capital isn&#8217;t simply adding more money to your balance sheet. It is about picking a venture partner who will be there with you through the highs and lows. Some even liken it to a marriage that you can&#8217;t divorce from.</p>
<p>No pressure, of course.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, we won’t leave you hanging: Wu is joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=dawnbeltpost&amp;display=true">TechCrunch Early Stage</a>, our annual event with content specifically tailored to first-time founders and investors, to talk about exactly this.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before Norwest, Wu worked in Amazon’s corporate development team, Bessemer Venture Partners and founded BANZAI, which brought food focused on quality and nutrition to schools.</p>
<p>With experience on both sides of the investing table, Wu is going to talk about how founders can make the most out of each minute within a one-hour pitch presentation. She’ll discuss ways that founders can read the virtual room, how to take advice and how to talk big-picture ideas to convey market size and competition.</p>
<p>Wu joins a fantastic cast of top experts, discussing topics such as fundraising, operations and marketing. Her workshop is part of the two days of events that explore seed and Series A fundraising, recruiting and more for early-stage startups at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage – Marketing and Fundraising</a> on July 8 &amp; 9. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=dawnbeltpost&amp;display=true">Grab your ticket now</a> before prices increase tonight!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’re less than a week away from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TC Sessions: Justice 2021</a>, a deep, day-long exploration of diversity, inclusion and equity in tech. On Wednesday, March 3, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">leading experts, founders and social justice warriors</a> will discuss topics ranging from systemic bias, essential workers’ rights and formerly incarcerated people to accountability in social media and funding for underrepresented communities. And that’s just for starters.</p>
<p><strong>Pause for a cause:</strong> Tickets to this event are just $5 — we want as many diverse voices at the table as possible. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#tickets">Secure your seat at this event today</a> and join this essential conversation.</p>
<p>In addition to panel discussions and workshops (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#1fa16903-b3ec-435b-ba68-d43e00bd8d70">you’ll find the agenda here</a>), don’t miss the smaller breakout sessions where you’ll have more opportunity to ask questions and share specific challenges with our speakers, editors and each other.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The smaller breakouts at every TC Sessions — regardless of their focus — lend themselves to deeper conversations, as noted by Karin Maake, senior director of communications at FlashParking, who attended TC Sessions: Mobility.</p>
<blockquote><p>I enjoyed the big marquee speakers, but it was the individual presentations where you really started to get into the meat of the conversation.</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s no shortage of fascinating presentations, but be sure to leave room in your day to dig a little deeper into these breakout sessions waiting for you at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TC Sessions: Justice 2021</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Black Female Unicorns in the Making:</strong> With all of the economic and racial disparities that have become so pronounced, this timely session will unpack the skills, tools and networks required along every stage of this journey. We will also share insights on what role policy, philanthropy and civic organizations might play in helping to address the systemic challenges, roadblocks and obstacles that have historically served as barriers. Brought to you by <a href="https://www.blackfemalefounders.org/">Black Female Founders</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Latinx Founders Leading with Inclusion:</strong> Hear from Latinx founders who are leading with inclusion through diverse teams and/or supporting a diverse mission. Inclusion is a part of their DNA.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aurora, the autonomous vehicle company that recently closed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">acquisition</a> of Uber’s self-driving subsidiary, has snapped up another startup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, Aurora is buying OURS Technology, the second lidar startup it has acquired in less than two years. Aurora <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/fresh-off-a-530m-round-aurora-acquires-lidar-startup-blackmore/">acquired Blackmore</a>, a Montana-based lidar startup, in May 2019. Aurora declined to disclose the acquisition price or other financial terms of the deal. OURS Technology, which was founded in 2017 by a team of University of California-Berkeley researchers and PhDs, employs 12 people. The entire team is heading to Aurora, according to the company.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are always on the lookout for how we can make progress as quickly as possible and <span class="il">OURS</span>’s expertise in developing <span class="il">lidar</span> chips adds to the expertise we already have and accelerates our work,” an Aurora spokesperson said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidar, or </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/12/wtf-is-lidar/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">light detection and ranging radar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is considered by most companies developing autonomous driving systems </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a critical and necessary sensor to safely deploy self-driving vehicles at scale. A future where millions of self-driving vehicles coursing through cities is still years — even decades some argue — away. But that hasn&#8217;t prevented dozens of lidar companies from launching, each one aiming to cash in on that eventual demand. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fresh off a $530M round, Aurora acquires lidar startup Blackmore&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/fresh-off-a-530m-round-aurora-acquires-lidar-startup-blackmore/embed/#?secret=1TAaWLBLTr" data-secret="1TAaWLBLTr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority of the 70-odd companies that exist in the industry today are developing and trying to sell time-of-flight lidar sensors, which send out pulses of light outside the visible spectrum and then measure how long it takes for each of those pulses to return. As they come back, the direction of, and distance to, whatever those pulses hit are recorded as a point and eventually forms a 3D map. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some lidar companies, including Blackmore and OURS Technology, are pursuing Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) lidar, which emits a low-power and continuous wave, or stream, of light. FMCW lidar developers tout two primary benefits of this technology. It can measure distance with a higher dynamic range and instant velocity, meaning it can gauge the speed of the objects coming to or moving away from them. It also doesn&#8217;t struggle with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interference from the sun or other other sensors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But FMCW is also complex. FMCW starts as a range finder on a chip. To make it a 3D lidar, many FMCW developers use big mirrors and other components to provide the field of view, which pushes up the size of the sensors. OURS Technology claims to be a lidar-on-a-chip company, which suggests that this four-year-old company has developed a way to combine everything into a solid-state scanning mechanism. This would allow the sensor to shrink in size, solving one of FMCW&#8217;s primary issues.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Aurora unveiled last summer its so-called <a href="https://medium.com/aurora-blog/aurora-debuts-firstlight-lidar-c8d850f0cbe7">FirstLight Lidar</a>, a sensor based on Blackmore&#8217;s technology that was developed for its fleet of self-driving vehicles, namely long-haul trucks. Aurora is clearly interested in OURS&#8217;s speed of development, <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/the-power-of-fmcw-lidar-and-scale-acquiring">noting in its announcement</a> that the startup been able to produce four generations of <span class="il">lidar</span> in just three years and developed a solid-state scanning mechanism compatible with its technology.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company plans to use the startup&#8217;s expertise and development know-how to make its sensor scalable. In short: Aurora hopes to use OURS&#8217;s team and their blueprint for key elements such as the solid-state scanning mechanism and development process to accelerate development.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now, as we look to expand our fleet and commercialize our driverless trucks, FirstLight lidar must be increasingly scalable &#8212; it needs to be smaller and less expensive, but just as powerful,&#8221; the company said.</span></p>
