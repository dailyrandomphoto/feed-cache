					<description><![CDATA[We'll have to wait to see how public investors value the company once it begins to float later this year. But as far as unicorn SPAC deals go, there have been worse ones that we've viewed.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Better.com, a venture-backed digital mortgage lender, announced this morning that it will combine with a SPAC, taking itself public in the second half of 2021. The unicorn&#8217;s news comes as the American IPO market is showing signs of fresh life after a modest April.</p>
<p>The Better.com deal comes just over a month after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/mortgage-is-suddenly-sexy-as-softbank-pumps-500m-in-better-com-at-6b-valuation/">sold $500 million of its existing shares to SoftBank</a> at a valuation of $6 billion. At the time, TechCrunch described the deal as &#8220;further proof&#8221; that unsexy industries were able to secure attractive valuations despite their relative lack of pizzazz.</p>
<p>The SoftBank secondary round was hardly Better&#8217;s only recent mega-deal; the company raised a $200 million round <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-to-invest-500-million-in-mortgage-startup-better-11617899907">at a $4 billion valuation in November 2020</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.Â  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But the company&#8217;s SPAC combination will affix an even higher price than its April round managed, providing <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bettermortgage/company_financials">the Kleiner Perkins-backed Better</a> with what <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210511005602/en/Digital-Homeownership-Platform-Better-to-Become-a-Publicly-Listed-Company-via-Merger-with-Aurora-Acquisition-Corp.-Company-is-Redefining-the-Homeownership-Experience">it describes</a> as a &#8220;post-money equity value of approximately $7.7 billion.&#8221;</p>
<p>SoftBank is doubling down on Better, putting together a $1.5 billion private investment in the deal&#8217;s public equity, or PIPE, in effect repricing its own preceding investment. For the Japanese telecom and investing powerhouse, making successive bets in companies at ever-higher prices is essentially gospel. So, don&#8217;t read <em>too</em> much into the commitment.</p>
<p>As with all SPAC combinations, we have a pile of new data from the company that is going public as part of the transaction. So, this morning, we&#8217;re getting our hands dirty.</p>
<p>Our goals are simple: We want to understand whether Better is a weak business, an acceptably strong business, or a great business. To get there, we&#8217;ll have to start by digging into how the company functions. From there, we&#8217;ll discuss its valuation stacked against its trailing metrics. We&#8217;ll also take a look at its growth expectations and bring in the recent Compass IPO, a company that focuses on a different part of the mortgage market, to see if we can get a better handle on Better&#8217;s new valuation.</p>
<p>Ready? The deck is <a href="https://aurora-acquisition.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/better-roadshow-deck.pdf">here</a>. Let&#8217;s have some fun.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Better.com?</h2>
<p>If you have heard of Better but really had no idea what it does before this morning, welcome to the club. Mortgage tech is like pre-kindergarten applications &#8212; it applies to a very specific set of folks at a very particular moment. And they care a lot about it. But the rest of us aren&#8217;t really aware of its existence.</p>
<p>For the rest of us: Better is an online mortgage lender that aims to offer lower-than-standard fees to consumers looking for credit to help them buy a house. As the company <a href="https://better.com/content/how-does-better-make-money/">explains</a> on its website, it generates income by selling loans that it helps generate. Per its investor deck, Better also derives top line from selling insurance products.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup that has built a neobank specifically to address the needs of freelancers and sole traders has picked up a growth round to continue expanding its business after seeing its usage grow by 1500% in a year.</p>
<p><a href="https://lili.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lili</a>, which provides a way for freelancers to use a single account both to manage their work and personal financial lives, along with tools to help manage the particular financial and accounting demands that come with being a one-person business, has picked up $55 million in a Series B round that it will be using to continue expanding its platform.</p>
<p>Today the company already provides users with a single account and payment card that can be used both for personal and business expenses, and an &#8220;assistant&#8221; that analyses expenses and budget for paying future taxes based on your incomings. Down the line it will also be expanding into invoicing, payment management and credit (eg, loans or cash advances) for its customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is about financial services for freelancers,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Lilac Bar David said in an interview. &#8220;We are redefining a new kind of user, who is between a consumer and a business and has specific needs. If you look at the economy and what the future of work will look like, this really needs to be addressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lili is based out of New York and Israel, and its focus is primarily on the U.S. market, where Bar David said the opportunity is big enough to keep Lili occupied for some time. It is estimated that currently 40% of workers are freelance, and that proportion is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/921593/gig-economy-number-of-freelancers-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">projected</a> to rise to just over 50% of all working people by 2027.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Group 11, a VC with a <a href="https://group11.vc/portfolio/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong focus on fintech</a>, with Target Global, AltaIR and previous investors also participating. (That list of past backers include Zeev Ventures, Foundation Capital and the Google for Startups accelerator.) The company has now raised $80 million and is not disclosing its valuation yet.</p>
<p>Launched in January 2020, just before the pandemic really kicked off, Lili has picked up 200,000 customers to date, Bar David tells me.</p>
<p>Its growth was very much on the back of a significant shift in the working world put into motion by the Covid-19 crisis, both in terms of a new cadre of potential users; and in terms of how the product is delivered.</p>
<p>On new users, while freelancers have always been present in the economy, their numbers suddenly swelled. In some cases, people were being forced into pausing their normal employment (for example when say a public venue like a theater had to temporarily close its doors; and in others they were simply laid off as businesses no longer appeared viable. In both cases, it led to a sudden surge of people becoming enterprising with their skills to make a living, rather than trying to apply for new full-time work during the pandemic.</p>
<p>It turns out this was a particularly acute predicament for women. More than 5 million women lost jobs in the wake of the pandemic, Bar David said, and many of them turned to freelance work. Lili says that more than half, almost 60%, of its new users are women.</p>
<p>In terms of the technology, Bar David noted that for those looking for a new kind of account to help manage finances needed something flexible and completely usable without the need to visit a physical bank branch.</p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;We were definitely in the right place at the right time,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Not only did Covid have an impact on freelance economy, but it mean no access to bank branches. That meant a greater willingness to adopt a service like ours, and that had a huge effect.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p5">Freelancing &#8212; whatever your actual skill or profession happens to be &#8212; has a lot to recommend it. You are, as they say, your own boss: you can choose which hours your work, what work you take on, how to execute it, and whether you want to promote yourself to work on other things without worrying if your manager will endorse or beat down or perhaps worst of all ignore or dismiss your ambition. You have only your own motivation, and luck, to praise or constructively criticize or sympathize with in your annual reviews with yourself about how you have been doing.</p>
<p>But &#8212; and I can say this from very direct experience &#8212; it can be a real pain in the ass. You have to figure out how to healthily manage your time well, and not take on too much, or panic when not enough work is coming in. You are constantly fighting your own corner when those contracting your services to exploit you or underpay you, with the understanding that pushing back too much might find out you out of a job altogether. You may not get the chances and work you were hoping to get, and then you don&#8217;t get paid for the shots you never take.</p>
<p>And that is before the considerable efforts you need to put in to effectively become your own business manager. That&#8217;s tracking your expenses, deciding how to itemize things that you spend money on to align them with your taxes, and of course budgeting yourself each month based on your incomings, and using that budget wisely in ways that make the most sense for you as a consumer in the world, and you as a business person. If this kind of stuff is not your strongest suit, well, that&#8217;s tough. You have to do it anyway.</p>
<p>Lili is an interesting and catchy idea because of how it&#8217;s identified all of those transactional issues, and is building tools to help people manage all of it. This is not just about having a business card to manage payments, but a bigger system that tracks what you are spending and learns from it to give you advice on how to manage your taxes and expenses, what you should be keeping back each month to pay towards income tax filings, and more. Typically, freelancers either do this on the fly from their personal accounts or set up separate business accounts to try to manage it, but neither of those options really presents a clean and easy to use user experience.</p>
<p>Over time, the plan will be to continue adding in more tools and integrate with a wider set of third-party applications that freelancers might use to invoice customers or pay out invoices themselves. It already has integrations with Venmo and QuickBooks, and more will be coming, Bar David said, &#8220;w<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">hatever a self-employed person needs to be successful,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p>There are now dozens of neobanks on the market, but Lili&#8217;s specific focus on these self-employed freelancers is what has helped it stand out.</p>
<p class="p5">âLili is currently the only fintech platform designed to address the needs of this rapidly growing sector of entrepreneurs,â said Group 11 Founding Partner Dovi Frances, in a statement. âWe anticipate the freelancer economy will continue to robustly grow well beyond the pandemic tailwinds. Lili is poised to see exponential growth by continuing to offer this demographic essential, effective and intuitive tools to manage what was previously an extremely complex and inefficient way of doing business.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://datarobot.com/">DataRobot</a>, the Boston-based automated machine learning startup, had a bushel of announcements this morning as it expanded its platform to give technical and non-technical users alike something new. It also announced it has acquired <a href="https://www.zepl.com/">Zepl</a>, giving it an advanced development environment where data scientists can bring their own code to DataRobot. The two companies did not share the acquisition price.</p>
<p>Nenshad Bardoliwalla, SVP of Product at DataRobot says that his company aspires to be the leader in this market and it believes the path to doing that is appealing to a broad spectrum of user requirements from those who have little data science understanding to those who can do their own machine learning coding in Python and R.</p>
<p>&#8220;While people love automation, they also want it to be [flexible]. They don&#8217;t want just automation, but then you can&#8217;t do anything with it. They also want the ability to turn the knobs and pull the levers,&#8221; Bardoliwalla explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To resolve that problem, rather than building a coding environment from scratch, it chose to buy Zepl and incorporate its coding notebook into the platform in a new tool called Composable ML. &#8220;With Composable ML and with the Zepl acquisition, we are now providing a really first class environment for people who want to code,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Zepl was founded in 2016 and raised $13 million along the way, according to Crunchbase data. The company didn&#8217;t want to reveal the number of employees or the purchase price, but the acquisition gives it advanced capabilities, especially a notebook environment to call its own to attract those more advanced users to the platform.The company plans to incorporate the Zepl functionality into the platform, while also leaving the stand-alone product in place.</p>

<p>Bardoliwalla said that they see the Zepl acquisition as an extension of the automated side of the house, where these tools can work in conjunction with one another with machines and humans working together to generate the best models. &#8220;This [generates an] organic mixture of the best of what a system can generate using DataRobot AutoML and the best of what human beings can do and kind of trying to compose those together into something really interesting [&#8230;],&#8221; Bardoliwalla said.</p>
<p>The company is also introducing a no-code AI app builder that enables non-technical users to create apps from the data set with drag and drop components. In addition, it&#8217;s adding a tool to monitor the accuracy of the model over time. Sometimes, after a model is in production for a time, the accuracy can begin to break down as the data the model is based is no longer valid. This tool monitors the model data for accuracy and warns the team when it&#8217;s starting to fall out of compliance.</p>
<p>Finally the company is announcing a model bias monitoring tool to help root out model bias that could introduce racist, sexist or other assumptions into the model. To avoid this, the company has built a tool to identify when it sees this happening both in the model building phase and in production. It warns the team of potential bias, while providing them with suggestions to tweak the model to remove it.</p>
<p>DataRobot is based in Boston and was founded in 2012. It has raised over $750 million and has a valuation of over $2.8 billion, according to Pitchbook.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli security startup <a href="https://cycode.com/">Cycode</a>, which specializes in helping enterprises secure their DevOps pipelines and prevent code tampering, today announced that it has raised a $20 million Series A funding round led by <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/">Insight Partners</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/cycode-raises-4-6m-seed-round-to-keep-your-source-code-safe/">Seed investor</a> <a href="https://www.ylventures.com/">YL Ventures</a> also participated in this round, which brings the total funding in the company to $24.6 million.</p>
<p>Cycode&#8217;s focus was squarely on securing source code in its early days, but thanks to the advent of infrastructure as code (IaC), policies as code and similar processes, it has expanded its scope. In this context, it&#8217;s worth noting that Cycode&#8217;s tools are language and use case agnostic. To its tools, code is code.</p>
<p>&#8220;This &#8216;everything as code&#8217; notion creates an opportunity because the code repositories, they become a single source of truth of what the operation should look like and how everything should function, Cycode CTO and co-founder Ronin Slavin told me. &#8220;So if we look at that and we understand it &#8212; the next phase is to verify this is indeed what&#8217;s happening, and then whenever something deviates from it, it&#8217;s probably something that you should look at and investigate.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company&#8217;s service already provides the tools for managing code governance, leak detection, secret detection and access management. Recently it added its features for securing code that defines a business&#8217; infrastructure; looking ahead, the team plans to add features like drift detection, integrity monitoring and alert prioritization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cycode is here to protect the entire CI/CD pipeline &#8212; the development infrastructure &#8212; from end to end, from code to cloud,&#8221; Cycode CEO and co-founder Lior Levy told me.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Tn27tBN0uG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/cycode-raises-4-6m-seed-round-to-keep-your-source-code-safe/">Cycode raises $4.6M seed round to keep your source code safe</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cycode raises $4.6M seed round to keep your source code safe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/cycode-raises-4-6m-seed-round-to-keep-your-source-code-safe/embed/#?secret=Tn27tBN0uG" data-secret="Tn27tBN0uG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;If we look at the landscape today, we can say that existing solutions in the market are kind of siloed, just like the DevOps stages used to be,&#8221; Levy explained. &#8220;They don&#8217;t really see the bigger picture, they don&#8217;t look at the pipeline from a holistic perspective. Essentially, this is causing them to generate thousands of alerts, which amplifies the problem even further, because not only don&#8217;t you get a holistic view, but also the noise level that comes from those thousands of alerts causes a lot of valuable time to get wasted on chasing down some irrelevant issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>What Cycode wants to do then is to break down these silos and integrate the relevant data from across a company&#8217;s CI/CD infrastructure, starting with the source code itself, which ideally allows the company to anticipate issues early on in the software life cycle. To do so, Cycode can pull in data from services like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and Jenkins (among others) and scan it for security issues. Later this year, the company plans to integrate data from third-party security tools like Snyk and Checkmarx as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem of protecting CI/CD tools like GitHub, Jenkins and AWS is a gap for virtually every enterprise,&#8221; said Jon Rosenbaum, principal at Insight Partners, who will join Cycodeâs board of directors. &#8220;Cycode secures CI/CD pipelines in an elegant, developer-centric manner. This positions the company to be a leader within the new breed of application security companies &#8212; those that are rapidly expanding the market with solutions which secure every release without sacrificing velocity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to accelerate its R&amp;D efforts, and expand its sales and marketing teams. Levy and Slavin expect that the company will grow to about 65 employees this year, spread between the development team in Israel and its sales and marketing operations in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been a flurry of investments in startups focused on acquiring third-party sellers on Amazon and helping them build their businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest is <a href="https://www.acqu.co">Acquco</a>, which aims to stand out from the others in that it was formed by a pair of founders &#8212; Raunak Nirmal and Wiley Zhang &#8212; who actually worked at Amazon, and then built multimillion-dollar businesses on its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York City-based startup has raised $160 million in debt and equity in a Series A round that it says will fund its âaggressive growth plans.â CoVenture, Singh Capital Partners, Crossbeam and other notable investors such as GoDaddy CEO Aman Bhutani put money in the equity portion of the round. Acquco would not disclose the valuation at which the money was raised, nor the exact breakdown of debt and equity, other than to say &#8220;a significant portion was equity.&#8221; But CEO Raunak Nirmal did share a few other notable things.Â </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, the company has already scaled to over $100 million in revenue since its founding (in a yearâs time) while deploying less than $2 million of equity capital. Plus, itâs been profitable âsince day one,â he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nirmal also claims that Acqucoâs proprietary technology and âproven playbooksâ give it an edge against competitors such as Thrasio and Perch. Specifically, the company says it helps Amazon sellers exit their business within 30 days and continue to scale their business âto the next levelâ post-acquisition. It also claims to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offer flexible terms and that it does not prevent entrepreneurs from selling again on Amazon.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Target Global leads $150M round for Amazon Marketplace consolidator Branded&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/embed/#?secret=AN2UsHomhg" data-secret="AN2UsHomhg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquco says it identifies the best businesses to acquire, and leverages what it describes as âflexible founder-friendly deal structures,â which essentially gives sellers a way to make money from the exit and then still get a cut of revenues down the line. The company claims that it on average achieves over 100% revenue growth after migrating brands onto its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forming Acquco was not an overnight story, but rather was years in the making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âMy first job out of college was actually at Amazon. I worked as a business analyst on the merchant technologies team there, which was really focused on third-party selling and helping empower third-party sellers to grow on the platform and then just growing that segment of the business,â Nirmal recalls. âAt the time, third-party selling was smaller than the retail side for Amazon.â</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ec9I3UYGSU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/">Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/embed/#?secret=Ec9I3UYGSU" data-secret="Ec9I3UYGSU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot has changed since then, of course, as that segment of the e-commerce giantâs business has grown dramatically.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, most sales on Amazon have come through Amazon Marketplace, where millions of outside sellers compete to find customers. Many pay Amazon to store and ship their goods, making them eligible for Prime shipping through an arrangement known as Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA. This is where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquco</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is focusing.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at Amazon years ago, Nirmal was tasked with starting a brand on the site so he could better understand sellersâ pain points, as well as the tools that could be built âto really help them grow.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, Nirmal left Amazon to pursue selling on Amazon full time because the brand heâd started ended up selling over $7 million in its first year. After that, he and COO Zhang built and sold multiple brands in the Amazon ecosystem before going on to consult for âsome of the largest sellers in the marketplace,â primarily based in China but selling in the U.S. market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âA lot of these guys are actually public companies now,â Nirmal said.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The duo went on to co-found a seller outsourcing firm in the Philippines, which helps to minimize the cost of operating the brands for sellers and make it more accessible for sellers that don&#8217;t have a huge team to build something on Amazon.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then they founded a company called Refund Labs, a seller tool that helps sellers essentially automatically identify issues in the payments that they receive from Amazon as well as recover money on their behalf for things like inventory that gets damaged or lost or the fees that are being charged that might be incorrect.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nirmal stepped down as CEO of Refund Labs to form Acquco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âWhat we wanted to do is take this knowledge and experience that we really have built up over the last seven years, and apply it in the best way possible,â Nirmal told TechCrunch. âAnd rather than building brands from the ground up, or consulting for some of these large sellers, we thought, &#8216;Why not go and buy the best brands, and then help grow them using our expertise?&#8217; â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says its proprietary algorithms analyze thousands of criteria sets and millions of data inputs âto automate and maximize the performance of the core functions within supply chain and brand managementâ across their portfolio.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquco plans to use its new capital to enter âhypergrowth mode,â according to Chief Strategy Officer Jerel Ho, who most recently led corporate development and strategy at WeWork, where he closed over $40 billion in M&amp;A deals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has the ambitious goal of scaling its portfolio to over $500 million in revenue by 2022. It plans to put the new money toward continuing to build out its technology platform &#8212; including tools that can automate the management of an entire brand on Amazon and across other retail channels &#8212; as well as continuing to acquire brands. Itâs also, naturally, going to do some hiring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âWeâve done a lot with very little,â Ho told TechCrunch. âBut hyper growth plans require a much larger team across all functions.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoVenture founder Ali Hamed says that the Amazon third-party seller ecosystem does $200 billion of revenue and is growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 50%.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âIt&#8217;s the most attractive market we&#8217;ve seen since founding our firm,â he told TechCrunch. âAnd of all the people we&#8217;ve talked to, Raunak is as plugged into the Amazon ecosystem as anyone we could find. In many ways, he taught us how to look, think and deploy capital into the market.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To say Hamed is bullish on Acquco would be an understatement. Since first investing in the company in 2020, Nirmal âhas exceededâ all of CoVentureâs expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âWe&#8217;ve been begging him to take more money every three months since writing our first check,â Hamed added. âRaunak is able to help buy businesses and make them better than they ever were before. He has a vision of how to operate these assets post-purchase that other operators who are not Amazon-native just don&#8217;t have.â</span></p>
<p>Besides Thrasio, other players in the space that have recently raised funding includeÂ Branded, which recentlyÂ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched its own roll-up business on $150 million in funding,Â </a>as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berlin Brands Group</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SellerX</a>,Â <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/press-releases/heyday-emerges-from-stealth-with-175m-series-a-funding-to-accelerate-marketplace-native-brands-15493868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heyday</a>,Â <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroes</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perch</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ultium Cells LLC, a joint venture between General Motors and LG Chem, has been steadily building up its battery cell manufacturing capacity in the U.S. since the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/gm-reveals-ultium-the-heart-of-its-ev-strategy/https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/gm-reveals-ultium-the-heart-of-its-ev-strategy/">venture was first announced</a> in December 2019. But with each battery cell they produce, theyâll also produce waste â tricky-to-handle waste that also has too much inherent valuable to toss into a landfill.</p>
<p>Instead of throwing it away, Ultium is sending it to a recycler. The venture has executed an agreement with Canadian company <a href="https://li-cycle.com/">Li-Cycle</a> to recycle critical materials from the scrap produced from Ultiumâs manufacturing processes from its Lordstown plant, starting later in 2020. The materials from the Lordstown location will be sent to Li-Cycleâs recycling location in Rochester, New York, to be processed and returned to the battery supply chain.</p>
<p>General Motors and LG Chem are clearly determined to scale their battery cell manufacturing. Around 5-10% of the output of a cell manufacturer is this excess scrap. Considering that the Lordstown facility will be capable of producing 30 gigawatt hours of capacity annually, itâs sure to produce a sizable amount of waste material. (For perspective, Teslaâs factory in Nevada has a 35 GW-hour capacity.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Li-Cycle&#8217;s approach is different from more traditional recycling processes, co-founder Ajay Kochhar told TechCrunch. Traditional recycling use a pyrometallurgical, or high temperature, process. With this process, batteries go into a furnace and excess material, like plastics and the electrolyte, are burned off, leaving around a 50% recovery rate for the valuable raw materials.</p>
<p>Li-Cycle also differs from competitors like Redwood Materials, which also use high-temperature, Kochhar explained. Redwood processes things like consumer electronics, which requires different approaches. Li-cycle uses a hydrometallurgical process that shreds â actually shreds, like a paper shredder â the battery materials in a submerged, proprietary solution. Doing it this way reduces the thermal risk of a fire and recovers up to 95% of the battery materials (Redwood also claims a recovery rate of 95-98%). By not burning anything off, the company also avoids producing potentially toxic emissions, Kochhar said.</p>

<p>The cathode and anode material is converted into battery-grade chemicals, like lithium carbonate, nickel sulfate and cobalt sulfate. Li-Cycle works with a company Traxys, which buys the chemical material.</p>
<p>âAnd where it goes from there is back into cathode making and back into the broader economy and battery supply chain,â Kochhar said. The next step would be a âtrue circular economy closed loopâ where the same material used by a manufacturer is returned back to it.</p>
<p>The company has two recycling &#8220;spokes,&#8221; where shredding and mechanical separation occurs, in Rochester and Ontario, Canada, with a third commercial facility being built in Arizona. Once the Arizona facility becomes operational, Li-Cycle will be able to process around 20,000 metric tons, or 4 gigawatt-hours, of lithium-ion batteries annually. It&#8217;s also building what it calls a &#8220;hub&#8221; to make the battery chemicals in Rochester, which will have an annual capacity to process around 60,000 metric tons of battery scrap and &#8220;black mass&#8221; (a mix of cathode and anode material, and one of the outputs from the company&#8217;s &#8220;spokes&#8221;).</p>
<p>It works with 14 different automotive and battery manufacturers (though not all of those deals are public), as well as auto dealers and auto recyclers to accept and process spent lithium-ion batteries.</p>

<p>Ultium in April announced a second $2.3 billion U.S.-based battery factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee that is due to open in 2023. Both factories will supply the automaker with the cells needed for the 30 electric vehicle models it plans to launch by mid decade. However, it is not known if Li-Cycle will process waste from this plant, too.</p>
<p>Notably, the company also recycles R&amp;D scrap from various automakers, giving Li-Cycle âa kind of first look at whatâs coming down the pipeâ in terms of battery technology, Kochhar said. That helps the company stay on top of the newest battery chemistries and technologies, like solid-state or lithium iron phosphate (LFP), and develop recycling processes accordingly. Li-Cycle already processes some LFP batteries; in those instances it remakes the phosphate back into a fertilizer additive.</p>
<p>In this case, Kochhar said he hopes people see this partnership as a proof point for the economic and environmental case for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>âThis should be one commercial example [. . .] that EV batteries will not go into a landfill,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Theyâre very valuable. The technologyâs here to deal with that in an economically and environmentally friendly fashion.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The University of California has always embraced the startup ecosystem in the state, including running a few of its own incubators and accelerators. Now Berkeley will have a huge new incubator of its own, <a href="https://bakarlabs.berkeley.edu/">Bakar Labs</a>, which will host as many as 80 young companies a year and provide access university facilities and networks.</p>
<p>Hosted at the lovely brutalist Woon Hon Fai Hall, formerly the Berkeley Art Museum, the incubator is just part of the greater Bakar BioEnginuity Hub, an ongoing cross-disciplinary initiative within the university. It will be run by QB3, a pan-UC organization that organizes entrepreneurship efforts, and replaces a much smaller biotech-focused program at Berkeley.</p>
<p>Rather than provide a set curriculum of achieving product fit, building the team and so on that you might find at an accelerator, Bakar Labs will be more of a benevolent host with all the best toys. Berkeley is of course a world class research institution with an enviable faculty and extensive resources â and those in the incubator will have (limited) access to them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Startups need not be affiliated with Berkeley in any way â the hub is hoping to attract founders from all over the place with its promise of inexpensive office and lab space and the aforementioned extensive resources. The term &#8220;incubator&#8221; seems apt for both the topic and the method â bring in the organisms, provide plenty of nutrients, and watch them grow.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150049" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150049" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2150049" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg" alt="Students in a lab space working in white coats." width="1024" height="663" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg?resize=1536,995 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg?resize=2048,1326 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2150049" class="wp-caption-text">Artist&#8217;s impression of what a lab space in Bakar will be like.</p></div></p>
<p>The relatively hands-off approach applies to funding as well. Companies will pay for their places at the Labs, but there&#8217;s no contract to sign over equity or first rights to Berkeley or its associated organs. A QB3 representative explained that investments may still occur, through an affiliated VC fund, but that it&#8217;s not baked into the program.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no connection with Berkeley&#8217;s Skydeck, another university entrepreneurship program that has produced some highly valued companies in and out of biotech. The team that will be helping select companies for Bakar Labs helped Skydeck with its biotech applicants, so it seems going forward like there will be a friendly bifurcation of streams.</p>
<p>As for entry, companies will be judged on their potential (both business and scientific), but the exact requirements and preferences will no doubt be flexible. Managing director of Bakar Labs Gino Segre explained that they would hope a company has more on its mind than either a buyout or a big paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;We encourage teams with a double bottom line to apply&#8211; they aim to better human health and are pursuing a profit-driven business model. Entrepreneurship for good,&#8221; he wrote in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;We are already seeing interest in therapeutics, diagnostics, research tool, foodtech and agtech.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The strongest teams will be two to 15 people, with operating capital for at least 6 months, and are leveraging an innovative technology for which a lab is required to advance their program,&#8221; he continued. There&#8217;s no limit on how long startups can stay, but after a couple years you might wonder whether there&#8217;s been a failure to launch. Ideally the startup raises money and moves to its own office and lab, but until that&#8217;s an option the incubator would be far superior to garages and temporarily vacated conference rooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bakar BioEnginuity Hub holds enormous promise as a space for mobilizing our vibrant changemaking students and faculty, our powerful research enterprise, and a community of innovators who will maximize societal benefit over profit,&#8221; said UC Chancellor Carol T. Christ in a Berkeley news release.</p>
<p>If this all sounds like a good match for your company (or maybe your roommate&#8217;s, currently operating out of the spare bedroom) <a href="https://bakarlabs.berkeley.edu/get-in-touch">head over here to apply</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boston-based <a href="https://apptopia.com/">Apptopia</a>, a company providing competitive intelligence in the mobile app ecosystem, has closed on $20 million in Series C funding aimed at fueling its expansion beyond the world of mobile apps. The new financing was led by ABS Capital Partners, and follows three consecutive years of 50% year-over-year growth for Apptopia&#8217;s business, which has been profitable since the beginning of last year, the company says.</p>
<p>Existing investors, including Blossom Street Ventures, also participated in the round. ABS Capital&#8217;s Mike Avon, a co-founder of Millennial Media, and Paul Mariani, are joining Apptopia&#8217;s board with this round.</p>
<p>The funding follows what Apptopia says has been increased demand from brands to better understand the digital aspects of their businesses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, Apptopia&#8217;s customers include hundreds of corporations and financial institutions, including Google, Visa, Coca-Cola, Target, Zoom, NBC, Unity Technologies, Microsoft, Adobe, Glu, Andreessen Horowitz and Facebook.</p>
<p>In the past, Apptopia&#8217;s customers were examining digital engagement and interactions from a macro level, but now they&#8217;re looking to dive deeper into specific details, requiring more data. For example, a brand may have previously wanted to know how well a competitor&#8217;s promotion fared in terms of new users or app sessions. But now they want to know the answers to specific questions &#8212;Â  like how many unique users participated, whether those users were existing customers, whether they returned after the promotion ended, and so on.</p>
<p>The majority of Apptopia&#8217;s business is now focused on delivering these sorts of answers to enterprise customers who subscribe to Apptopia&#8217;s data &#8212; and possibly, to the data from its competitors like Sensor Tower and App Annie, with the goal of blending datasets together for a more accurate understanding of the competitive landscape.</p>
<p>Apptopia&#8217;s own data, historically, was not always seen as being the most accurate, admits Apptopia CEO Jonathan Kay. But it has improved over the years.</p>
<p>Kay, previously Apptopia COO, is now taking over the top role from co-founder Eliran Sapir, who&#8217;s transitioning to chairman of the board as the company enters its next phase of growth.</p>
<p>Apptopia&#8217;s rivals like Sensor Tower and App Annie use mobile panels to gather app data, among other methods, Kay explains. These panels involve consumer-facing apps like VPN clients and ad blockers, which users would download <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/vpn-and-ad-blocking-apps-sensor-tower">not necessarily understanding</a> that they were agreeing to having their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/your-vpn-or-ad-blocker-app-could-be-collecting-your-data/">app usage data collected</a>. This led to some controversy as the app data industry&#8217;s open secret was <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/vpn-and-ad-blocking-apps-sensor-tower">exposed to consumers by the media,</a> and the companies tweaked their disclosures, as a result.</p>
<p>But the practice continues and has not impacted the companies&#8217; growth. Sensor Tower, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/sensor-tower-raises-45m-as-demand-for-app-data-grows/">raised $45 million last year,</a> as demand for app data continued to grow. And all involved businesses are expanding with new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/app-annie-ascend/">products</a> and <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/q1-2021-product-updates">servicesÂ </a>for their data-hungry customer bases.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150069" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150069" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2150069" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-18.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="582" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-18.png 2256w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-18.png?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-18.png?resize=300,257 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-18.png?resize=768,658 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-18.png?resize=680,582 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-18.png?resize=1536,1315 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-18.png?resize=2048,1754 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-18.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2150069" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apptopia</p></div></p>
<p>Apptopia, meanwhile, decided not to grow its business on the back of mobile panels. (Though in its earlier days it did test and then scrap such a plan.)</p>
<p>It gains access to data from its app developer customers &#8212; and this data is already aggregated and anonymized from the developers&#8217; Apple and Google Analytics accounts.</p>
<p>Initially, this method put Apptopia at a disadvantage. Rivals had more accurate data from about 2016 through 2018 because of their use of mobile panels, Kay says. But Apptopia made a strategic decision to not take this sort of risk &#8212; that is, build a business that Apple or Google could shut off at any time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead, what we did is we spent years investing into data science and algorithms,&#8221; notes Kay. &#8220;We figured out how to extract an equal or greater signal from the same data set that [competitors] had access to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using what Kay describes as &#8220;huge, huge amounts of historical data,&#8221; Apptopia over time learned what sort of signals went into an app&#8217;s app store ranking. A lot of people still think an app&#8217;s rank is largely determined by downloads, but there are now a variety of signals that inform rank, Kay points out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, a rank is just an accumulation of analytical data points that Apple and Google give points for,&#8221; he explains. This includes things like number of sessions, how many users, how much time is spent in an app, and more. &#8220;Because we didn&#8217;t have these panels, we had to spend years figuring out how to do reverse engineering better than our competitors. And, eventually, we figured out how to get the same signal that they could get from the panel from rank. That&#8217;s what allowed us to have such a fast-growing, successful business over the past several years.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Apptopia was already profitable, it didn&#8217;t need to fundraise. But the company wanted to accelerate its expansion into new areas, including its planned expansion outside of mobile apps.</p>
<p>Today, consumers use &#8220;apps&#8221; on their computers, on their smartwatches and on their TV, in addition to their phones and tablets. And businesses no longer want to know just what&#8217;s happening on mobile &#8212; they want the full picture of &#8220;app&#8221; usage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We figured out a way to do that that doesn&#8217;t rely on any of what our competitors have done in the past,&#8221; says Kay. &#8220;So, we will not be using any apps to spy on people,&#8221; he states.</p>
<p>However, the company was not prepared to offer further details around its future product plans at this time. But Kay said Apptopia would not rule out partnerships or being acquisitive to accomplish its goals going forward.</p>
<p>Apptopia also sees a broader future in making its app data more accessible. Last year, for instance, it partnered with Bloomberg to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apptopia-brings-mobile-signals-to-investors-via-the-bloomberg-app-portal-301187599.html">bring mobile data to investors</a> via the Bloomberg App Portal on the Bloomberg Terminal. And it now works with Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/">AWS Data Exchange</a> and <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/data-marketplace/">Snowflake</a> to make access to app data available in other channels, as well. Future partnerships of a similar nature could come into play as another means of differentiating Apptopia&#8217;s data from its rivals.</p>
<p>The company declined to offer its current revenue run rate or valuation, but notes that it tripled its valuation from its last fundraise at the end of 2019.</p>
<p>In addition to product expansions, the company plans to leverage the funds to grow its team of 55 by another 25 in 2021, including in engineering and analysts. And it will grow its management team, adding a CFO, CPO, and CMO this year.</p>
<p>To date, Apptopia has raised $30 million in outside capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Imagine if you could settle/rekindle domestic arguments by asking your smart speaker when the room last got cleaned or whether the bins already got taken out?</p>
<p>Or &#8212; for an altogether healthier use-case &#8212; what if you could ask your speaker to keep count of reps as you do squats and bench presses? Or switch into full-on &#8216;personal trainer&#8217; mode &#8212; barking orders to peddle faster as you spin cycles on a dusty old exercise bike (who needs a Peloton!).</p>
<p>And what if the speaker was smart enough to <em>just know</em> you&#8217;re eating dinner and took care of slipping on a little mood music?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now imagine if all those activity tracking smarts were on tap without any connected cameras being plugged inside your home.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">nother bit of fascinating research from researchers at Carnegie Mellon Universityâs </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="http://www.figlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Future Interfaces Group</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> opens up these sorts of possibilities &#8212; demonstrating a novel approach to activity tracking that does not rely on cameras as the sensing tool.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Installing connected cameras inside your home is of course a horrible privacy risk. Which is why the CMU researchers set about investigating the potential of using millimeter wave (mmWave) doppler radar as a medium for detecting different types of human activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The challenge they needed to overcome is that while mmWave offers a &#8220;signal richness approaching that of microphones and cameras&#8221;, as they put it, data-sets to train AI models to recognize different human activities as RF noise are not readily available (as visual data for training other types of AI models is). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Not to be deterred, they set about sythensizing doppler data to feed a human activity tracking model &#8212; devising a software pipeline for training privacy-preserving activity tracking AI models.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The results can be seen in <a href="https://karan-ahuja.com/vid2dop.html">this video</a> &#8212; where the model is shown correctly identifying a number of different activities, including cycling, clapping, waving and squats. Purely from its ability to interpret the mmWave signal the movements generate &#8212; and purely having been trained on public video data.Â </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We show how this cross-domain translation can be successful through a series of experimental results,&#8221; they write. &#8220;Overall, we believe our approach is an important stepping stone towards significantly reducing the burden of training such as human sensing systems, and could help bootstrap uses in human-computer interaction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Researcher Chris Harrison confirms the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">mmWave doppler radar-based sensing doesn&#8217;t work for &#8220;very subtle stuff&#8221; (like spotting different facial expressions). But he says it&#8217;s sensitive enough to detect less vigorous activity &#8212; like eating or reading a book. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The motion detection ability of doppler radar is also limited by a need for line-of-sight between the subject and the sensing hardware. (Aka: &#8220;It canât reach around corners yet.&#8221; Which, for those concerned about future robots&#8217; powers of human detection, will surely sound slightly reassuring.)<br />
</span></p>
<p>Detection does require special sensing hardware, of course. But things are already moving on that front: Google has been dipping its toe in already, via <a href="https://atap.google.com/soli/">project </a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><a href="https://atap.google.com/soli/">Soli</a> &#8212; adding a</span> radar sensor to the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Pixel 4, for example. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Google&#8217;s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/googles-soli-returns-to-track-sleep-on-the-new-nest-hub/">Nest Hub</a> also integrates the same radar sense to track sleep quality.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Googleâs Soli radar returns to track sleep on the new Nest Hub&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/googles-soli-returns-to-track-sleep-on-the-new-nest-hub/embed/#?secret=KCqR6ZZQWQ" data-secret="KCqR6ZZQWQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;One of the reasons we havenât seen more adoption of radar sensors in phones is a lack of compelling use cases (sort of a chicken and egg problem),&#8221; Harris tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Our research into radar-based activity detection helps to open more applications (e.g., smarter Siris, who know when you are eating, or making dinner, or cleaning, or working out, etc.).&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked whether he sees greater potential in mobile or fixed applications, Harris reckons there are interesting use-cases for both.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see use cases in both mobile and non mobile,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Returning to the Nest Hub&#8230; the sensor is already in the room, so why not use that to bootstrap more advanced functionality in a Google smart speaker (like rep counting your exercises).</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a bunch of radar sensors already used in building to detect occupancy (but now they can detect the last time the room was cleaned, for example).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall, the cost of these sensors is going to drop to a few dollars very soon (some on eBay are already around $1), so you can include them in everything,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;And as Google is showing with a product that goes in your bedroom, the threat of a &#8216;surveillance society&#8217; is much less worry-some than with camera sensors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/vergesense-raises-12m-series-b-for-its-workplace-analytics-service/">VergeSense</a> are already using sensor hardware and computer vision technology to power real-time analytics of indoor space and activity for the b2b market (such as measuring office occupancy).</p>
<p>But even with local processing of low-resolution image data, there could still be a perception of privacy risk around the use of vision sensors &#8212; certainly in consumer environments.</p>
<p>Radar offers an alternative to such visual surveillance that could be a better fit for privacy-risking consumer connected devices such as &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/take-peloton-style-classes-through-a-smart-mirror/">smart mirrors</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is processed locally, would you put a camera in your bedroom? Bathroom? Maybe Iâm prudish but I wouldnât personally,&#8221; says Harris.</p>
<p>He also points to <a href="https://chrisharrison.net/index.php/Research/SyntheticSensors">earlier research</a> which he says underlines the value of incorporating more types of sensing hardware: &#8220;The more sensors, the longer tail of interesting applications you can support. Cameras canât capture everything, nor do they work in the dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cameras are pretty cheap these days, so hard to compete there, even if radar is a bit cheaper. I do believe the strongest advantage is privacy preservation,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Of course having any sensing hardware &#8212; visual or otherwise &#8212; raises potential privacy issues.</p>
<p>A sensor that tells you when a child&#8217;s bedroom is occupied may be good or bad depending on who has access to the data, for example. And all sorts of human activity can generate sensitive information, depending on what&#8217;s going on. (I mean, do you really want your smart speaker to know when you&#8217;re having sex?)</p>
<p>So while radar-based tracking may be less invasive than some other types of sensors it doesn&#8217;t mean there are no potential privacy concerns at all.</p>
<p>As ever, it depends on where and how the sensing hardware is being used. Albeit, it&#8217;s hard to argue that the data radar generates is likely to be less sensitive than equivalent visual data were it to be exposed via a breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any sensor should naturally raise the question of privacy &#8212; it is a spectrum rather than a yes/no question,&#8221; agrees Harris.Â  &#8220;Radar sensors happen to be usually rich in detail, but highly anonymizing, unlike cameras. If your doppler radar data leaked online, itâd be hard to be embarrassed about it. No one would recognize you. If cameras from inside your house leaked online, well&#8230; &#8221;</p>
<p>What about the compute costs of synthesizing the training data, given the lack of immediately available doppler signal data?</p>
<p>&#8220;It isnât turnkey, but there are many large video corpuses to pull from (including things like Youtube-8M),&#8221; he says. &#8220;It is orders of magnitude faster to download video data and create synthetic radar data than having to recruit people to come into your lab to capture motion data.</p>
<p>&#8220;One is inherently 1 hour spent for 1 hour of quality data. Whereas you can download hundreds of hours of footage pretty easily from many excellently curated video databases these days. For every hour of video, it takes us about 2 hours to process, but that is just on one desktop machine we have here in the lab. The key is that you can parallelize this, using Amazon AWS or equivalent, and process 100 videos at once, so the throughput can be extremely high.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while RF signal does reflect, and do so to different degrees off of different surfaces (aka &#8220;multi-path interference&#8221;), Harris says the signal reflected by the user &#8220;is by far the dominant signal&#8221;. Which means they didn&#8217;t need to model other reflections in order to get their demo model working. (Though he notes that could be done to further hone capabilities &#8220;by extracting big surfaces like walls/ceiling/floor/furniture with computer vision and adding that into the synthesis stage&#8221;.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The [doppler] signal is actually very high level and abstract, and so it&#8217;s not particularly hard to process in real time (much less &#8216;pixels&#8217; than a camera).&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Embedded processors in cars use radar data for things like collision breaking and blind spot monitoring, and those are low end CPUs (no deep learning or anything).&#8221;</p>
<p>The research is being presented at the ACM CHI conference, alongside another Group project &#8212; called <a href="https://karan-ahuja.com/poseotg.html">Pose-on-the-Go</a> &#8212; which uses smartphone sensors to approximate the user&#8217;s full-body pose without the need for wearable sensors.</p>
<p>CMU researchers from the Group have also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/11/google-funded-super-sensor-project-brings-iot-powers-to-dumb-appliances/">previously demonstrated</a> a method for indoor &#8216;smart home&#8217; sensing on the cheap (also without the need for cameras), as well as &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/worldgaze-uses-smartphone-cameras-to-help-voice-assistants-cut-to-the-chase/">last year</a> &#8212; showing how smartphone cameras could be used to give an on-device AI assistant more contextual savvy.</p>
<p>In recent years they&#8217;ve also investigated using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/new-tech-lets-robots-feel-their-environment/">laser vibrometry</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/09/how-a-tap-could-tame-the-smart-home/">electromagnetic noise</a> to give smart devices better environmental awareness and contextual functionality. Other interesting research out of the Group includes using conductive spray paint to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/08/new-technique-turns-anything-into-a-touch-sensor/">turn anything into a touchscreen</a>. And various methods to extend the interactive potential of wearables &#8212; such as by using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/20/skin-buttons-are-working-buttons-projected-onto-the-skin/">lasers to project virtual buttons</a> onto the arm of a device user or incorporating another wearable (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/06/want-more-screen-space-on-your-smartwatch-put-a-ring-on-it/">a ring</a>) into the mix.</p>
<p>The future of human computer interaction looks certain to be a lot more contextually savvy &#8212; even if current-gen &#8216;smart&#8217; devices can still stumble on the basics and seem more than a little dumb.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Munich-based <a href="https://parcellab.com/en/">parcelLab</a>, which offers a final-mile fulfillment service for online retailers, has closed a $112 million (GBÂ£80 million) Series C funding round led by the US VC/PE firm Insight Partners.</p>
<p>Germanyâs Endeit Capital participated as a co-investor, alongside existing investors Capnamic Ventures and coparion. parcelLab last raised an undisclosed Series B in October 2019. The new funding will feed into parcelLabâsÂ global expansion plans and new product development.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015 by TobiasÂ Buxhoidt (CEO), JulianÂ Krenge (CTO), and Anton Eder (COO), the startup has managed to bag such customers as Lidl, to which it provides automated personalized shipping messages. This means that as much as 85% of Lidl customers return to its website.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It also works with IKEA and Farfetch to increase basket sizes and email open rates of &#8211; it claims &#8211; over 90%, 25% reductions in WISMO (where is my order), and increases of customer reviews.Â Â Â </p>
<p>In a statement TobiasÂ Buxhoidt, CEO and FounderÂ of parcelLab,Â said: âAs e-commerceÂ becomes increasingly competitive, providing unique and branded experiences will drive growth.Â Identifying opportunities to further connect withÂ peopleÂ and build a better, stronger relationship is a key differentiator.&#8221;Â Â Â <br />
Â <br />
Matt Gatto, Managing Director at Insight Partners, said: &#8220;We pride ourselves in identifying and investing in softwareÂ ScaleUpÂ companies that are driving transformative change in their industries. InÂ parcelLab, we see true potential to transform how brands and people connect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Endeit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/endeit-capital-plans-to-boost-european-b-stage-startups-with-its-new-e250m-growth-fund/">only recently raised</a> a â¬250 million fund to invest in B-stage European startups, so this is its most recent deployment of capital.</p>
<p>Philipp Schroeder Partner atÂ EndeitÂ commented: âParcelLabâsÂ team is the perfect example of internet entrepreneurs that we want to support &#8211; entrepreneurs who can drive the change to make Europe more competitive and who have the ambition to become global market leaders.âÂ </p>
<p>ParcelLab&#8217;s main competitor is US-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/narvar">Narvar</a> which has raised $64M, with its last round being a Series C funding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 16, Uganda-based two-wheel ride-hailing platform SafeBoda <a href="https://twitter.com/safeboda_nga/status/1382987165731274752">announced </a>that it had completed 1 million rides in Ibadan, a southwestern city in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his might not seem spectacular from a global perspective because it took the startup a year and two months to achieve but it&#8217;s a noteworthy feat in African markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ibadan is one of the cities where SafeBoda operates. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which first launched in Uganda, is disrupting the offline market of local motorcycles referred to as boda-bodas in Uganda and okadas in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, SafeBoda </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started operations in Kampala and almost immediately began to deal with the threat posed by new entrants at the time: uberBODA and Bolt boda</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber and Bolt are two of the most well-known ride-hailing companies in the markets in which they operate. Uganda was the first African country the pair decided to test out their two-wheel ride-hailing ambitions and it was the second market globally after Thailand for Uber. So given the clout and money these companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hold</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most people anticipated they</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">would give SafeBoda a run for its money. But that didn&#8217;t happen.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber and Taxify are going head-to-head to digitize Africa&#8217;s two-wheeled taxis&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/30/uber-and-taxify-are-going-head-to-head-to-digitize-africas-two-wheeled-taxis/embed/#?secret=8wcL5lHbkl" data-secret="8wcL5lHbkl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://ug.linkedin.com/in/alastair-sussock">Alastair Sussock</a>, co-CEO of SafeBoda, who founded the company with <a href="https://ug.linkedin.com/in/rapa-thomson-ricky-164ba863">Ricky Rapa Thomson</a> and <a href="https://ug.linkedin.com/in/maxime-dieudonn%C3%A9-7595a06">Maxime Dieudonne</a>, SafeBoda was clocking about 1,000 rides daily at the time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He argued that even though the company&#8217;s volumes were one of the best, there was a misrepresentation in the media that SafeBoda wasn&#8217;t in the league as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â other platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everyone thought Uber and Bolt would enter Africa to revolutionize the informal boda market,&#8221; Sussock told TechCrunch. &#8220;There was mention of other players, some of which have folded now, but no one mentioned SafeBoda although we were actually doing quite good stuff. And that energized us to prove the perception wrong, which was that SafeBoda didn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exist&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategy, hard work and a large Series B investment followed the next couple of years, which has established SafeBoda as a market leader in Uganda</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sussock said the company now completes about 80,000 rides a day. Uber and Bolt barely complete 10,000 rides in the country.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150288" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150288" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2150288" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20210511_103558.png?w=680" alt="SafeBoda" width="680" height="595" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20210511_103558.png 1454w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20210511_103558.png?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20210511_103558.png?resize=300,263 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20210511_103558.png?resize=768,672 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20210511_103558.png?resize=680,595 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20210511_103558.png?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2150288" class="wp-caption-text">Ricky Rapa Thomson, Alastair Sussock, and Maxime Dieudonne</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what has been instrumental to this growth? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before founding SafeB</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">oda, Rapa Thomson was also a boda rider. As the company&#8217;s director of operations, he&#8217;s pivotal in making sure the company adopts localized methods with its riders. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And despite its exciting features, pieces of equipment and safety measures employed, what stands out is how SafeBoda adapts to the boda boda community. This has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">responsible for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the 80% year-on-year retention the company currently enjoys, Sussock said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We tend to localize our product and take a local approach where we hire local guys to be part of the team. They help to have boots on the ground and of course, what you see with Nigeria, is not as much a dissimilar story,&#8221; the co-CEO added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When starting in Nigeria, most two-wheel ride-hailing startups begin from Lagos, the nation&#8217;s hotbed of commerce and transport. In recent times, the city has had entrants like Opera&#8217;s OPay, Gokada and MAX.ng. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These startups, like SafeBoda, are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">heavily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> backed by U.S., Chinese and Japanese investors. They have been at loggerheads with each other to capture on-demand mobility market share in Africa&#8217;s most populous country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SafeBoda first hinted at a possible expansion into Nigeria in 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aforementioned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ride-hailing companies were already in operation and it appeared as if SafeBoda was a very late entrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But according to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://ng.linkedin.com/in/babajide-duroshola-a1249342&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiojJDozsHwAhWSbsAKHUB7BPwQjjgwAHoECAMQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw1lG6N8LjtKakkz8uw4WaV0">Babajide Duroshola</a>, the country head for SafeBoda in Nigeria, the team knew it was going to thrive despite the timing and what competition looked like.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For us, it was a no-brainer decision to come into Nigeria and do the same thing that we did at Kampala, which is to grow quickly and make SafeBoda a household name,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the time came to reveal which city it was going to start with, <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/03/02/safeboda-launches-in-ibadan/">it was Ibadan, not Lagos</a>. SafeBoda caught everyone unawares with the decision and subsequently </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">faced heavy backlash. This was in December 2019 but fast-forward to February 2020; it proved to be a masterstroke because in one fell swoop, the Lagos State government rendered <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/nigerias-war-on-wheels/">bike-hailing operations obsolete with new regulations</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the next couple of months, SafeBoda was the only reliable source of two-wheel ride-hail service in the country. While the regulations forced others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pivot into asset financing for bikes and logistics services, SafeBoda was waxing strong with its ride-hailing operations in Ibadan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its first five months, SafeBoda had completed more than 250,000 rides and onboarded thousands of drivers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, adopting a local strategy and community building proved vital to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seemingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> modest but explosive growth it experienced in a market no company had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the things that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> separated us from all the other guys in the market was a localization play. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that we could connect with and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these people who were okada drivers right off the streets to become part of our operations team was very key,&#8221; Duroshola said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country manager added that SafeBoda&#8217;s progress showed other two-wheel operators that a market outside Lagos existed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lagos is the commercial capital. There&#8217;s a lot of money in the city and income per household is high. But then, it is not a true representation of Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We saw that if you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want to scale across the country, Ibadan was actually a very good place to start because it had all the kinds of people you&#8217;d </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> find in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ease of doing business for a ride-hailing platform in Ibadan is also easier than in Lagos. The latter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for endorsing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union_of_Road_Transport_Workers">NURTW</a>, a transport group known to legally extort riders daily or weekly in the city</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Such activities </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are prohibited in Ibadan giving</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SafeBoda a smooth path to achieving scale and allowing its drivers to work effectively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year in the city has rewarded the company with over 2,500 drivers and 40,000 customers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they performed more than 750,000 trips in SafeBoda&#8217;s first year, which has since surpassed more than 1 million trips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SafeBoda&#8217;s progress in Uganda and Nigeria makes it one of the most active players in Sub-Saharan Africa. The company has completed more than 35 million rides across both countries, with over 25,000 registered riders. It also claims to hold more than 80% market share in the two countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this success, SafeBoda struggled in its third market, Kenya &#8212; a market it expanded to and left before Nigeria. The company had onboarded over 1,500 riders in less than a year, but it wasn&#8217;t growing at the pace it wanted. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic made SafeBoda&#8217;s struggles obvious and <a href="https://www.the-star.co.ke/business/kenya/2020-03-03-safeboda-riders-complain-on-low-returns-from-the-app/">per this report</a>, riders&#8217; dissatisfaction with pricing caused an upheaval that sent the company out of the Kenyan market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to rider troubles, Sussock noted that Kenya&#8217;s motorcycle taxi market wasn&#8217;t as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dense as Uganda and Nigeria which, according to him, contributed to the exit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were the market leader in Kenya, and we were doing like the most rides in Kenya. But it was still quite small </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> volume compared to Uganda. And we knew what the potential would be in Nigeria, which we hadn&#8217;t done at the time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quite clear that Kenya, while very developed for tech, and developed per capita, was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quite hard to scale </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> motorcycle taxi transportation,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150326" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150326" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2150326" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1441-small.jpg?w=680" alt="SafeBoda" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1441-small.jpg 5472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1441-small.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1441-small.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1441-small.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1441-small.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1441-small.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1441-small.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1441-small.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2150326" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SafeBoda</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SafeBoda isn&#8217;t ruling out a return to the East African market. But with the East African market out of the way for now, it has the resources to focus ride-hailing efforts on Uganda and Nigeria. The ultimate goal, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is to scale its <a href="https://techcabal.com/2020/08/21/factsheet-super-app-africa/">super app</a> play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Uganda, it is already in motion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SafeBoda offers on-demand food, grocery, pharmacy, essentials and beverages delivery services, of which more than 500,000 orders have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been completed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This model </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is inspired by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Go-Pay model at GoJek, where two-wheel ride-hailing was an entry point to high-frequency wallet spend behavior</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Asian multi-service company is one of the investors in SafeBoda via its GoVentures arm. Other backers include Transsion Holdings, Beenext, and serial entrepreneur Justin Kan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SafeBoda has no real competition in the bike-hailing wars in Uganda and Nigeria as it stands. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s challenge remains the large offline market, where more than 1.5 million rides </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are completed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> daily in Uganda alone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan for SafeBoda is to convert more of this base to its existing online market share. Additionally, it wants to expand into P2P, merchant and bill payments and grow its on-demand business in Uganda. Its plan in Nigeria? Maintaining its core transport business before venturing into payments and deliveries.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As schools move more widely into reopening their doors for in-person learning, many educational institutions have also learned a critical lesson in the last year. Having better tools to teach remotely are critical for situations when the physical experience has to be shut down, but even when things are &#8220;back to normal&#8221;, better tech can still enhance what educators and students can do, and to whom teaching can be delivered. Now, a startup betting on virtual learning in higher education &#8212; and investing in the innovation to deliver that &#8212; is announcing a round of funding as it continues to expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="http://engageli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engageli</a>, which has built an online teaching platform from the ground up &#8212; providing not just its own built-in-house video technology to deliver lectures and enable conversations, but tools to enable students to &#8220;sit&#8221; in study groups to work together; and features to share and annotate lecture notes, take quizzes and more &#8212; has picked up $33 million in funding.</p>
<p>CEO Dan Avida &#8212; who co-founded the company with his wife Daphne Koller (the Coursera co-founder) and Serge Plotkin &#8212; said the startup will be using to continue building more tools and scaling its platform and opening it up to more schools, specifically the bracket of higher learning colleges and universities that it targets as customers, as these institutions continue to embrace the promise of better video tools both for delivering live lessons, and also to develop more on-demand and other features around Engageli&#8217;s video platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;At first the priority was on the best synchronous experience,&#8221; Avida said in an interview of the priorities of universities when it came to remote learning. &#8220;Now everyone is much more focused on multi-modality.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding, a Series A, is being co-led by Maveron and another (unnamed) investor and also includes participation from Corner Ventures, Good Friends, Educapital, and what Engageli describes as several &#8220;prominent individual technology executives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notably, the funding is coming only seven months after the startup first emerged from stealth in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/engageli-comes-out-of-stealth-with-14-5m-and-a-new-approach-to-teaching-by-video-remotely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 2020</a>, and investors from the $14.5 million seed round that it announced at the same time are also participating. The startup has now raised over $47 million and is not disclosing its valuation.</p>
<p>While there are now dozens, maybe even hundreds, of tools to help students learn things without being inside a traditional classroom, Engageli has taken a slightly different approach from the pack by building its video-based platform from the ground up with educational aims in mind.</p>
<p>This is already a step change, when you think about it, from the likes of Teams from Microsoft, Google Classroom, or Zoom. These are three of the most commonly used video platforms in educational settings, but they are all based on technology that was, essentially, originally built with more enterprise and generic purposes in mind.</p>
<p>From this, Engageli has worked on expanding the platform with tools that enhance not just the video experience, but enhance it in ways that make sense for educators and learners &#8212; that is, tools that are intuitive to use for those teaching and studying.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2150333,2150334,2150335,2150336,2150337"]</p>
<p>Up to now, these have focused on both the kinds of conversations that students can have with each other and the teacher, and ways for the teacher to keep their students engaged, by way of quizzes, notes that they can download and annotate and Q&amp;A channels. For now, Engageli is focused on building its own technology, but over time you can see how the platform might open up to link up with bigger learning management systems and the other tools that institutions might already be using regularly.</p>
<p>Avida said that Engageli is not yet disclosing any metrics on engagement time, customer or user numbers or any other figures. For now, he said the startup is picking up university customers across the U.S., in the UK and Israel (where the founders hail from and all originally cut their tech teeth in the country&#8217;s military units), where classes are already handling up to &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of concurrent students.</p>
<p>He also added that even as more schools return to in-person learning, he is expecting a boost of new users in the fall quarter because the genie, so to speak, is out of the bottle with remote learning and the fact that it can continue to be effective.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even before the pandemic there were tens of millions of students online, half of all students were taking some form of online course, and we expect this to go much further, not unlike online grocery or telemedicine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One professor described it to me like this: the trough of disillusionment&#8221; &#8212; a reference to the Gartner Magic Quadrant visualization &#8212; &#8220;is very shallow here. We ain&#8217;t going back.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is also a sentiment that educators also seem to be picking up.</p>
<p>âItâs hard to go back once you raise the bar on engagement. With Engageli, I felt the experience was the most like a real classroom. Students are sitting at tables, I can quickly see what they are doing, they can ask others at their table questions, they are chatting and interacting,â said Dr. Theodora Christou, a professor at Queen Mary University of London, in a statement. âI finally have an easy way to lead meaningful group work and case studies online. I would choose Engageli over any other existing tool that my university offers.â</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s funding and growth come at a time when we&#8217;re indeed seeing a wider wholesale adoption and development of more tools to accommodate digital modes of learning, in many cases also to complement what is happening offline, and also in younger age groups, too.</p>
<p>Just in the last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/kahoot-acquires-clever-the-us-based-edtech-portal-for-up-to-500m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kahoot acquired Clever</a> in the U.S. to bring on a popular platform used by many K-12 schools to manage their online learning interctions, and yesterday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/studocu-raises-50m-as-its-note-sharing-network-for-college-students-passes-15m-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StuDocu raised funding</a> for a platform that crowdsources, rates and shares university class notes, a platform that has now passed 15 million students and is growing very fast. All of these spell higher expectations for better technology in the future, something Engageli will also be hoping to engage.</p>
<p>âDan Avida and his team at Engageli, that includes professors, talented technologists and accomplished ed-tech executives, are uniquely suited to building a digital education solution that actually feels like a classroom and functions even better than some in-person courses,â said Jason Stoffer, Partner at Maveron, in a statement. âPandemic or not, every school needs Engageli to drive better outcomes for students, whether theyâre taking remote classes full time or opt to tune in digitally when they need the flexibility. Weâre passionate about leveling the playing field in higher education, and Engageliâs unique platform will help institutions reach and support the needs of every type of student.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google Pay users in the U.S. can now send money to GPay users in India and Singapore, Google said on Tuesday, making its first push into the remittances market.</p>
<p>The company has partnered with Western Union and Wise, both of which have integrated their services into Google Pay. This is the first time either of the cross-border payments firms have inked such a deal.</p>
<p>Josh Woodward, Director of Product Management at Google, told TechCrunch in an interview that the company is kickstarting its cross-border payments feature with India and Singapore and intends to expand this worldwide by the end of the year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;As we do with a number of Google products, we will test, learn, and iterate and then start scaling,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As part of the partnership, Western Union will power cross-border payments on Google Pay in over 200 countries, while Wise &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/">formerly known as TransferWise</a> &#8212; will extend the support in over 80 countries.</p>
<p>When Google Pay users in the U.S. attempt to send money to someone in India or Singapore, they will be informed about the exact amount that the recipient will receive. From within the Google Pay app, users also get to choose which payments provider &#8212; Wise or Western Union &#8212; they wish to use and how long it would take for the recipient to receive the money.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2150295" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PayFriend-Hero.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="577" /></p>
<p>The remittance feature currently allows only Google Payâs US users to send money to those in India and Singapore &#8212; and not the other way around. Woodward said the company picked India and Singapore in part because of how crucial they are in the remittances world.</p>
<p>India was the largest receiving country for remittances in 2019, receiving more than $80 billion in the year, according to the World Bank. The U.S., meanwhile, is the largest sender.Â Eventually, Google intends to enable fully cross-border remittances worldwide.</p>
<p>Also worth noting: The cross-border payments is only available for person-to-person payments. (Businesses on GPay in the U.S. canât send money to individuals or businesses in India, for instance.)</p>
<p>The partnership with Google will help Wise and Western Union to expand their presence in several markets and more aggressively compete with rivals such as PayPal, which has a wider reach (but has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/paypal-is-shutting-down-domestic-payments-business-in-india/">struggled to make inroads in India</a>). Wise and Western Union will shoulder the liability and risk.</p>
<p>Nearly 250 million people across the world send over $500 billion in cross-border remittances annually, a report by Citi said last month. But the space is ripe for disruption. &#8220;The fees are extremely high. It is embarrassing that we have not solved this issue so far,&#8221; Citi analysts wrote.Â Global average cost for sending money is around 6.5%.</p>
<p>Western Union said in a statement that receivers will pay no charges and will get the exact value in their local currency as chosen by the user in the U.S. Wise said it will charge the actual foreign exchange rate and additional transfer fees, which will wary from country to country.Â (&#8220;The easiest way to find out how much itâll cost is to find a friend on Google Pay, select Wise as a partner, tap Pay, and enter the amount youâd like to transfer,&#8221; it said.)</p>
<p>In either case, Google will not levy any additional fee to customers. Also, until June 16, Western Union will offerÂ unlimited free transfers when sending money with Google Pay, and Wise will make the first transfer free for new customers on transfers up to $500.</p>
<p>âThe pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on communities, customers and colleagues in many parts of Asia, especially in India and Latin America. This convenient channel will help people continue supporting one another in these trying times as they reimagine how they can pay and move money worldwide,&#8221; said Shelly Swanback, President of Western Union Product and Platform, in a statement.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s announcement comes months after Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/google-pay-gets-a-major-redesign/">redesigned the GPay app in the U.S.</a>, and made a push into banking services with checking accounts feature from lenders such as Citi.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lisbon-based food delivery startup <a href="https://www.kitch.io/">Kitch</a> hopes to hands back control to restaurants dogged by the mess of food delivery apps today, by aggregating the apps onto one tablet and platform. Restaurants then get one place to manage all their delivery orders, track couriers, and update their menus across all the delivery apps. Itâs now raised a â¬3.25 ($4M) Seed round led by Atlantic Food Labs, with the participation from Market One Capital and the companyâs initial investors, Seedcamp and Lisbon-based Mustard Seed MAZE.</p>
<p>Launched in March 2020 Kitch developed its own proprietary technology to support independent restaurants<br />
Rui Bento, co-founder and CEO at Kitch said: âWe are committed to making available and to keep developing the tools that enable restaurants to retain their independence and to regain control of their digital businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick Huber, Partner at Atlantic Food Labs said: &#8220;Kitch has shown remarkable traction within a very short time, in a market that continues to grow rapidly.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the Kitch app, restaurants create an online store, enabling them to sell their dishes on delivery and takeaway and can own a relationship with their customers. Kitch takes care of payments, deliveries, and customer support and interfaces with apps such as Uber Eats, Glovo, and Deliveroo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Say what you will, Nothing has been doing a fine job milking its upcoming launch for all itâs worth. The company has spent the last several monthâs teasing the arrival of its first product. The launch will find the company entering the already extremely crowded earbuds category in June, with the arrival of the simply named Ear 1.</p>
<p>Founder Carl Pei teased the forthcoming product in a blog post today, while adding that the company was still a ways off from fully achieving its mission statement of hardware products that simply disappear.</p>
<p>âFor those hoping for a disappearing act overnight, Ear 1 falls short,â Pei writes. âThe greatest visions are not realized with the flip of a switch, but instead through countless small successes. Ear 1 is just the start. Design is still top secret but what we can tell you is that Ear 1 combines notes of transparency, iconic form, and refinedÂ  functionality. It is the starting point that will define the artistry, confidence and craftsmanship that will carry our products and services for years to come.â</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pre-launch hype around the company and product is certainly understandable. Beyond teasing the launch piece by piece, Pei has earned goodwill as the co-founder of OnePlus. The company grew at an impressive rate, courtesy of quality smartphones at an affordable price point, all while maintaining a direct line to its fanbase.</p>
<p>The forthcoming product maintains OnePlusâ simple naming scheme. âCan you guess what the sequel will be called?â the executive asks rhetorically. âGood. Us too.â</p>
<p>OnePlus has also entered the earbuds game, including, most recently, the launch of the fully wireless OnePlus Buds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sweden&#8217;s <a href="https://www.exeger.com/news/exeger-secures-usd-38-million-to-start-building-new-solar-cell-factory/">Exeger</a>, which for over a decade has been developing flexible solar cell technology (called <a href="https://www.exeger.com/technology/">Powerfoyle</a>) that it touts as efficient enough to power gadgets solely with light, has taken in another tranche of funding to expand its manufacturing capabilities by opening a second factory in the country.</p>
<p>The $38 million raise is comprised of $20M in debt financing from Swedbank and Swedish Export Credit Corporation (SEK), with a loan amounting to $12M from Swedbank (partly underwritten by the Swedish Export Credit Agency (EKN) under the guarantee of investment credits for companies with innovations) and SEK issuing a loan amounting to $8M (partly underwritten by the pan-EU European Investment Fund (EIF)); along with $18M through a directed share issue to Ilija Batljan Invest AB.</p>
<p>The share issue of 937,500 shares has a transaction share price of $19.2 &#8212; which corresponds to a pre-money valuation of $860M for the solar cell maker.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Back in 2019 <a href="https://group.softbank/en/news/press/20190304">SoftBank </a>also put $20M into Exeger, in two investments of $10M &#8212; entering a strategic partnership to accelerate the global rollout of its tech and further extending its various investments in solar energy.</p>
<p>The Swedish company has also previously received a loan from the Swedish Energy Agency, in 2014, to develop its solar cell tech. But this latest debt financing round is its first on commercial terms (albeit partly underwritten by EKN and EIF).</p>
<p>Exeger says its solar cell tech is the only one that can be printed in free-form and different colors, meaning it can &#8220;seamlessly enhance any product with endless power&#8221;, as its PR puts it.</p>
<p>So far two devices have integrated the Powerfoyle tech: A <a href="https://www.exeger.com/news/first-self-charging-helmet-by-poc/">bike helmet with an integrated safety taillight</a> (by POC), and <a href="https://www.exeger.com/news/introducing-urbanista-los-angeles-solar-powered-headphones-with-virtually-infinite-playtime/">a pair of wireless headphones</a> (by Urbanista). Although neither has yet been commercially launched &#8212; but both are slated to go on sale next month.</p>
<p>Exeger says its planned second factory in Stockholm will allow it to increase its manufacturing capacity tenfold by 2023, helping it target a broader array of markets sooner and accelerating its goal of mass adoption of its tech.</p>
<p>Its main target markets for the novel solar cell technology currently include consumer electronics, smart home, smart workplace, and IoT.</p>
<p>More device partnerships are slated as coming this year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150265" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150265" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2150265" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/urbanista-powerfoyle.jpg?w=544" alt="" width="544" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/urbanista-powerfoyle.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/urbanista-powerfoyle.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/urbanista-powerfoyle.jpg?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/urbanista-powerfoyle.jpg?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/urbanista-powerfoyle.jpg?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/urbanista-powerfoyle.jpg?resize=1229,1536 1229w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/urbanista-powerfoyle.jpg?resize=1638,2048 1638w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/urbanista-powerfoyle.jpg?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2150265" class="wp-caption-text">Exeger&#8217;s Powerfoyle solar cell tell integrated into a pair of Urbanista headphones (Image credits: Exeger/Urbanista)</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We donât label our rounds but take a more pragmatic view on fundraising,&#8221; said Giovanni Fili, founder and CEO. &#8220;Developing a new technology, a new energy source, as well as laying the foundation for a new industry takes time. Thus, a company like ours requires long-term strategic investors that all buy into the vision as well as the overall strategy. We have spent a lot of time and energy on this, and it has paid off. It has given the company the resources required, both time and money, to bring an invention to a commercial launch, which is where we are today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fili added that it&#8217;s chosen to raise debt financing now &#8220;because we can&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same answer as when asked why we build a new factory in Stockholm, Sweden, rather than abroad. We have always said that once commercial, we will start leveraging the balance sheet when securing funds for the next factory. Thanks to our long-standing relationship with Swedbank and SEK, as well as the great support of the Swedish government through EKN underwriting part of the loans, we were able to move this forward,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Discussing the forthcoming two debut gizmos, the POC Omne Eternal helmet and the Urbanista Los Angeles headphones &#8212; which will both go sale in June &#8212; Fili says interest in the self-powered products has &#8220;surpassed all our expectations&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any product which integrates Powerfoyle is able to charge under all forms of light, whether from indoor lamps or natural outdoor light. The stronger the light, the faster it charges. The POC helmet, for example, doesnât have a USB port to power the safety light because the ambient light will keep it charging, cycling or not,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Urbanista Los Angeles wireless headphones have already garnered tremendous interest online. Users can spend one hour outdoors with the headphones and gain three hours of battery time. This means most users will never need to worry about charging. As long as you have our product in light, any light, it will constantly charge. Thatâs one of the key aspects of our technology, we have designed and engineered the solar cell to work wherever people need it to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>âThis is the year of our commercial breakthrough,&#8221; he added in a statement. &#8220;The phenomenal response from the product releases with POC and Urbanista are clear indicators this is the perfect time to introduce self-powered products to<br />
the world. We need mass scale production to realize our vision which is to touch the lives of a billion people by 2030, and thatâs why the factory is being built now.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart has hit the market to raise about $1 billion at up to $30 billion valuation in a pre-IPO financing round, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-based startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/09/walmart-confirms-16b-flipkart-investment-giving-it-77-in-indias-e-commerce-leader/">sold majority stake to Walmart for $16 billion in 2018</a>, initiated fundraise possibilities with some investors earlier this year and has since grown more serious and hired bankers.</p>
<p>In recent months, the company has also internally discussed pushing its public listing timeline to early next year, the people said, requesting anonymity as details are private. (The firm still intends to file for an IPO later this year. A listing takes an additional few months. Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/ctech-us-flipkart-ipo-spac-idCAKBN2AW114-OCATC">reported</a> last year that Flipkart might list overseas in 2021.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Several major investors of Flipkart declined to comment on fundraise talks early this month and the e-commerce firm didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment.Â An early Flipkart investor, who has since sold all its stake, said it made sense that the e-commerce group was planning to raise some capital as the market currently has no shortage of it.</p>
<p>11 Indian startups have turned unicorn this year, more than half of them last month, as some high-profile investors including Tiger Global and Falcon Edge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/?tpcc=ECTW2020">double down on the world&#8217;s second largest internet market</a>.</p>
<p>Flipkart, which was last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/walmart-invests-additional-1-2-billion-in-indias-flipkart-to-increase-stake/">valued at about $24.9 billion last year when it raised $1.2 billion</a> in a round led by Walmart, hasn&#8217;t finalized the new investment and the deal size as well as the valuation may change, one of the sources said.</p>
<p>In an earnings call in November last year, Walmart said Flipkart and its payments entity PhonePe had reached an all-time high monthly active customers base.Â In an earnings call in February this year, Judith McKenna, President and Chief Executive Officer of Walmart International, said Flipkart&#8217;s GMV growth was impacted by a 53-day national lockdown in India in the first half of the last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the business rebounded and exited Q4 with strong momentum, delivering GMV growth roughly double that of the full year,&#8221; said McKenna, adding that more than 250 million customers in India engaged with the e-commerce platform during last year&#8217;s festival sales.</p>
<p>India was hit by a second wave of the coronavirus in early April, which has again prompted some states to enforce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/walmarts-flipkart-to-cover-insurance-for-all-sellers-in-india-and-waive-additional-fees/">restrictions on servicing of non-essential items</a> on e-commerce platforms. Flipkart announced on Tuesday that it is working to strengthen its grocery infrastructure as it expands the new category.</p>

<p>The Bangalore-headquartered firm competes neck to neck with Amazon in India. The American e-commerce group has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">invested over $6.5 billion in the South Asian market</a>.</p>
<p>Both the firms are struggling to aggressively expand their footprint in India, where physical stores continue to drive the vast majority of retail sales. An additional heavily-funded player <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/23/jiomart-the-e-commerce-venture-by-indias-richest-man-launches-in-additional-cities/">arrived in the market last year to further increase the competition</a>.</p>
<p>E-commerce platform JioMart, a joint venture between Reliance Retail (Indiaâs largest retail chain) and Google and Facebook-backed Jio Platforms (Indiaâs largest telecom operator), launched last year in over 200 cities and towns across the nation.</p>
<p>At stake is one of the worldâs fastest-growing e-commerce markets that is poised to grow even further as more first-time internet users begin to shop online. Indiaâs e-commerce market is estimated to reach more than 300 million shoppers by 2025, according to estimates by Bain &amp; Company. These shoppers would have bought items worth more than $100 billion from online platforms, the firm projected.</p>
<p>In recent years, Flipkart and Amazon have made a number of bets to expand their reach in India. Both of them have rolled out support for Hindi language (Flipkart has added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/walmarts-flipkart-makes-local-languages-push-to-win-small-indian-cities-and-towns/">several additional Indian languages as well</a>), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amazon-launches-smart-stores-in-india-to-win-mom-and-pop/">partnered with neighborhood stores</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;34% of the population [in India] are millennials, young people. By 2030, there is an estimate that this young population of millennials and GenZ will be 75% of the total population. 700 million Indians are digital today. And I also want to just quickly acknowledge that Digital India vision of the Government of India, which has actually enabled this. So you have a unique combination of a big market, completely digital, getting wealthier and very young,&#8221; said Kalyan Krishnamurthy, CEO of Flipkart, in February.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even the most sanguine industry observer has to be stunned at times by the pace of dealmaking right now. Not quite halfway through 2021, startups are routinely closing new rounds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/tiger-global-leads-100-million-investment-in-indian-social-commerce-dealshare/">just months apart</a> and sometimes seeing their valuations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/mobile-bank-current-raises-220-million-series-d-triples-valuation-to-2-2b/">triple</a> and even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/uruguayan-payments-startup-dlocal-quadruples-valuation-to-5b-with-150m-raise/">quadruple</a> with every new round.</p>
<p>Maybe they will all become trillion-dollar companies. It&#8217;s more likely, however, that they will not, which is where year-old <a href="https://about.caplight.io/">Caplight</a> comes in. Led by Javier Avalos, a former investment banker who recently spent more than three years with the secondaries platform Forge, Caplight is developing tech to enable institutional investors to take long and short private company positions via synthetic, cash-settled derivatives, so whether or not they own any actual shares in certain startups, they can bet on their rise or fall.</p>
<p>Caplight isn&#8217;t the first company drawn to the idea. Another young startup in New York, Apeira Capital, is also looking to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/overvalued-startups-could-be-shorted-by-new-firm-11607337001">&#8220;short&#8221; overvalued startups</a>.Â  More, Avalos and his cofounder, Justin Moore, a former engineering manager at Forge, could also face competition, from their old firm, for example, as well as Carta, the venture-backed company that makes software to manage equity stakes in other startups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, Avalos thinks he&#8217;s on to something. Caplight already has $400 million worth of interest from more than 30 institutions, he says. It also just closed on $1.7 million in pre-seed funding led by Fin VC, with participation from Susquehanna Private Equity Investments, Clocktower Ventures, and Dash Fund. We talked with him late last week to learn more; below are excerpts from that chat, edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You were at Forge, which helps people buy and sell pre-IPO shares. What opportunity did you see while working there?</strong></p>
<p>JA:Â  I think what platforms like Forge have done really well is build tech solutions for startup employees, for startup founders, and for the companies themselves, and that&#8217;s great. What we&#8217;re really focused on are larger institutions who need true liquidity, meaning higher frequency of trading, whether that&#8217;s <b> </b> buying and selling option contracts, or entering swap-type agreements. [They need a way] to quickly move in and out of positions, as well as hedge themselves.</p>
<p>Caplight [aims to become the] infrastructure that enables any other fund that is looking to take directional positions in private companies. It&#8217;s meant to be the plumbing that connects that fund to a market, but not just the marketplace &#8211;all of the infrastructure that comes with that. So holding assets in prime brokerage; being able to quickly settle transactions through clearinghouses; being able to provide [the] data to inform a mark to market to value those contracts.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Even more specifically, what are you offering?</strong></p>
<p>JA: So we [want to] allow institutional investors to hedge their private company stock &#8212; to generate income on their private company stock by selling out-of-the-money option contracts, for instance. We also allow institutional investors to take short or long positions [and] we&#8217;re doing all of our transactions synthetically, so the underlying shares don&#8217;t don&#8217;t actually have to move.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is that private company stock used as collateral or encumbered in any way? Do you need the permission of the startup?</strong></p>
<p>JA: The pre-IPO stock <em>can</em> be used as collateral. It doesn&#8217;t always need to be though. The great thing about building a synthetic platform is you can inject liquidity into the market by working with sellers who don&#8217;t actually own the stock. If I&#8217;m a hedge fund, and I don&#8217;t own shares of a pre-IPO company, but I still want to express a short interest &#8212; a negative view on that company &#8212; I could use Caplight to do that. I&#8217;d just need to hold other tradable securities as collateral. That&#8217;s part of the beauty of what makes this a marketplace that can have very rapid settlement and execution.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So if a hedge fund wants to go short, it just needs to needs to find another party on your service who&#8217;s willing to take that trade?Â </strong></p>
<p>JA: What you need is two parties &#8212; one who one who&#8217;s interested in going short on the name, and another who&#8217;s interested in going long on the name. Beyond that, you need a model that helps these parties arrive at not just an agreed-upon valuation of the company today, but also where they&#8217;re comfortable striking a contract at some point in the future, and then a methodology for valuation at any point in time in between those two points.What we&#8217;re talking about here is a methodology to create a mark to market on what the value of that contract is at any given time between the time you enter the contract and the time you ultimately go to settle the contract. Those are really the three main ingredients that are needed here.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you develop this methodology? How automated is it?</strong></p>
<p>JA: We&#8217;re in the process of building that out now. There&#8217;s quite a bit of work, as you can imagine, that goes into that. And part of the mandate that we have having raised this pre seed funding is to go out and find the best talent to come in and help us with this.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Assuming some of these inputs would include fund-raising announcements, any announced revenues, and where things are trading on the secondary market, what are other inputs might surprise people?</strong></p>
<p>JA: Maybe a less obvious one is that when public mutual funds own private tech companies&#8217; stock, they have to report out on at least a quarterly basis where they&#8217;re marking those positions, and that&#8217;s all public information. So that&#8217;s another alternative data set that we would love to pull into our platform in product form.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why does your company make sense now versus earlier in time? Does it tie to smart contracts?</strong></p>
<p>JA: Smart contracts are are definitely an enabler. But I think it&#8217;s more of a function of where we are in the markets. Forge alone is [ approaching a billion dollars a quarter of volume] and that&#8217;s just one platform. When you sum up all the activity, we think there is $20 billion of transaction volume, meaning pre IPO shares that are trading hands each year. For that size marketplace to exist without the ability to have directional bets on top of that, or hedging that is made very easy, it just didn&#8217;t make sense to us that hedging and derivative-type transactions don&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p><strong>TC: This is a work in progress. In the meantime, what&#8217;s to stop Forge or Carta from doing what you&#8217;re doing?</strong></p>
<p>JA: It&#8217;s something I spend a lot of time thinking about. It goes back to a point that I mentioned earlier, which is that I think Carta and Forge have done a really good job of building tech solutions that serve the companies, and I think a lot of future growth from Carta and Forge and some of the other players is pegged on their ability to develop company relationships. And when you have a lot of [your] growth pegged on building out these relationships &#8212; a lot of the valuation that&#8217;s being ascribed to Forge and Carta and other secondary platforms is tied their ability to maintain those relationships &#8212; to turn around and stand up a marketplace that allows institutions to go short on the same companies that you&#8217;re fighting to build relationships with is a direct conflict.</p>

<p>Founded in 2015, Radish originally focused on user-generated content, but now the core of its business is <a href="https://radishfiction.com/users/RadishOriginals">Radish Originals</a>, or serial fiction series designed specifically for the app. The company said the launch of Radish Originals in 2018 helped propel its growth, with revenue increasing more than 10 times in 2020 from the previous year.</p>
<p>Radish monetizes content through its micropayments system, which allows users to read several free episodes before making payments of about 20 to 30 cents to unlock new episodes (users also have the option of waiting an hour to unlock episodes for free). About 90% of its revenue now comes from Radish Originals.</p>
<p>The acquisition means that Radish Originalsâ intellectual property will now be adapted by Kakao into webtoons, videos and other content, increasing their reach. Since 2016, Kakao Entertainment has adapted several web novels including âWhatâs Wrong with Secretary Kim?,â âA Business Proposalâ and âSolo Levelingâ into webtoons and other media.</p>

<p>Lee told TechCrunch that Radish started exclusively distributing several of Kakao Entertainmentâs most popular original series, like âWhatâs Wrong with Secretary Kim?â last month. It plans to launch more content from Kakao Entertainmentâs portfolio and are also âlooking at ways in which we can make original localized novel adaptions of Kakaoâs popular stories,â he added.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Kakao Entertainment CEO Jinsoo Lee said, âRadish has firmly established itself as a leading web novel platform and yet we see even greater growth potentialâ¦ With the combination of Kakaoâs expertise in the IP business and Radishâs strong North American foothold, we are excited about what we can achieve together.â</p>
<p>The acquisition has been approved by Radishâs board of directors, which includes a representative from SoftBank Ventures Asia, its largest investor, and the majority of its shareholders. Radishâs other backers include Lowercase Capital, K50 Ventures, Nicolas Bergruen, Charlie Songhurst, Duncan Clark and Amy Tan, the best-selling author.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toyota has tapped Japanese company ENEOS to help develop the hydrogen fuel cell system that will power its futuristic prototype city Woven City.</p>
<p>The vision for the 175-acre city, where people will live and work amongst all of Toyotaâs projects, including its autonomous e-Palette shuttles and robots, is to build a fully connected ecosystem powered by hydrogen fuel cells.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Woven Planet, the innovation-focused subsidiary of Toyota that is in charge of the project, announced Monday that ENEOS, a Japanese petroleum company thatâs investing heavily into hydrogen, will help make Toyotaâs âhuman-centeredâ city of the future. <span style="font-weight: 400;">This new partnership not only signifies Toyotaâs backing of hydrogen over electric, but it also could help Japan achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.</span></span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two companies will work together to test the feasibility of a hydrogen-based supply chain, from production to delivery to usage. To facilitate this, ENEOS will further its technological developments in hydrogen production in order to achieve a fully carbon-free supply chain.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âAs Japan&#8217;s leading integrated energy company, ENEOS has demonstrated its valuable expertise in all vital processes from hydrogen production to sales and we are confident they have the holistic perspective we require for success,â said Akio Toyoda, president and CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation, in a statement. âTo realize a hydrogen-based society, in addition to the evolution of individual technologies, it is essential to seamlessly integrate all the processes of production, delivery, and use.âÂ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toyota is positioning hydrogen as a top viable clean energy source for the future with this partnership, although it certainly has more electric vehicles on the market than hydrogen, including</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/toyota-to-bring-three-new-electrified-vehicles-to-u-s-market/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> three new ones this year.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Its iconic hydrogen fuel-cell powered car, the Toyota Mirai, saw a 2021 upgrade, and it&#8217;s the same tech that Toyota used in its Kenworth T680 tractor. Toyota may still consider using electric in Woven City, a Woven Planet spokesperson told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of its partnership with Woven City, ENEOS will use its expertise of operating 45 commercial hydrogen refueling stations in the four major metropolitan areas in Japan to establish one outside of Woven City. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Operation of the hydrogen refueling station to be built by ENEOS is targeted to begin by the end of financial year 2023, and Toyota plans to introduce fuel cell commercial vehicles, stationary fuel cell power generators and other equipment in succession,&#8221; according to a Woven Planet spokesperson.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ENEOS will also be expected to produce hydrogen derived from renewables, to help install stationary fuel cell generators inside Woven City and to work with Toyota to research hydrogen supply.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We believe that hydrogen energy will play an integral role in the realization of carbon neutrality on a global scale,â Katsuyuki Ota, president of ENEOS said in a statement. âBy working together with Toyota to fully explore hydrogenâs potential, we believe we can make a significant contribution to the creation of new hydrogen-based lifestyles.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction at the Woven City site in Susono City, Shizuoka Prefecture, at the base of Mount Fuji began in February. A month later, the Toyota subsidiary launched Woven Capital, a new venture fund that will invest in technologies that will build the future of safe mobility. Woven Capital&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/woven-capital-kicks-off-portfolio-with-investment-in-autonomous-delivery-company-nuro/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investment is in autonomous delivery company Nuro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.Â </span></p>
