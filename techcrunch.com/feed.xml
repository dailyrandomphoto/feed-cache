										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Micromobility startup Voi has raised $45 million, funds it says will be used to research and develop technology that will improve safety, keep users from riding on sidewalks and ensure scooters are properly parked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The funding comes a month after Voi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/the-station-rimac-bugatti-is-born-tesla-releases-fsd-beta-v9-and-ola-raises-500m/">launched a pilot</a> in Northhampton, UK with Irish startup Luna to test how computer vision technology might be used to solve parking and sidewalk riding issues. The R&amp;D spending will include &#8220;pioneering the use of computer vision software to prevent pavement riding,&#8221; according to a statement released by the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We are leading the way in that technology – we want to embrace that technology, like Luna, to make available next year on our fleet for the masses,&#8221; a spokesperson for Voi told TechCrunch, who also noted the company is open outfitting its e-bikes with computer vision technology.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Voi spokesperson told TechCrunch the company is happy with the progress it’s made to date and is exploring its own proprietary technology, which could include acquiring Luna. No decisions or acquisitions have been made so far, but Voi is also investing in its next generation scooter. It’s possible that the next vehicle comes with computer vision built in, rather than retro-fitted to the stem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voi, which already has scooters in 70 cities across the U.K. and Europe, is aiming to expand. And technology that solves parking, safety and sidewalk clutter is viewed by Voi as key to winning city partnerships and maintaining the ones it already has.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voi is also using the funds to work on the sidewalk parking problem by adding physical parking racks. On Wednesday, Voi installed 100 parking racks in Stockholm in agreement with the city. Voi already has over 300 physical parking racks in the UK.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voi uses a swappable battery system that’s popular with other operators like Lime and Spin, which means the racks are just there for keeping scooters out of the public right of way. Voi says having physical racks will help “create a sustainable service for cities and the people living in them.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">This latest round brings Voi&#8217;s total funding to $205 million. The round was led by The Raine Group and existing investors like VNV Global participated alongside new investors. The company did not specify who those new investors are.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While Amsterdam garners the lion&#8217;s share of attention in the Netherlands tech ecosystem, the not-so-far-away region around Utrecht has its fair share of tech startups and investors, as is evidenced by our latest survey of locals, below.</p>
<p>Area ecosystem wranglers such as StartupUtrecht, UtrechtInc, Holland Startup, Utrecht Community and others bring startups, scaleups, corporates, angels, VCs, local government, banks and universities together to build the local startup ecosystem. They also benefit from the formidable Netherlands tech advocate initiative StartupDelta and The Netherlands Enterprise Agency, which promote the Netherlands more widely.</p>
<p>Utrecht is the fourth-largest city in the Netherlands, with 350,000 inhabitants. Its offices and co-working spaces include Dotslash Utrecht, De Stadstuin, MindSpace and Tribes; as well as accelerator programs like Startupbootcamp and Techleap.</p>
<p>Notable startups from the region include Distimo (acquired by AppAnnie), unicorn GitLab, MoneyMonk and StuComm. Plus there are newer ones such as SnappCar, Blendle, Merus, Nibblr, United Wardrobe, Näpp, Lalaland, 2DAYSMOOD and Remind2Change.</p>
<p>Our survey respondents think the ecosystem is strong in sustainable energy, medtech, food tech, life sciences, marketplaces, deep tech, gaming and media. However, they seem to think it’s weaker in design, hardware, fintech, robotics and agritech.</p>
<p>Notable startups named by our respondents include Channable, Pepscope, Goin&#8217; Connect, Fundsup, Tover, Faqta, Sensorfact, SODAQ, Picnic, Neurolytics, De Clique, Solease, BikeFlip, Packaly, DiManEx, Trunkrs, DialogueTrainer, EatMyRide, CART-Tech, Prolira, among many, many others. It just goes to show the region has a strong and growing ecosystem.</p>
<p>The investment scene is described variously as focusing on software, clean tech, life sciences, biotech, organoids, 3D bioprinting, AI and VR/AR. One says: “In Amsterdam it&#8217;s ok. Utrecht is a bit lagging.” Another said, “The investor scene focuses on early-stage, scalable tech in healthcare, sustainability and education. [There are] many local informal investors and nationally operating VCs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the shift to remote working, many respondents think people will “preferably move out of the city center toward the villages nearby” as there is “a lot of nature/space around.” That said, Utrecht is “a growing hub” and many will “stay in the city. But fewer people will move in, and remote working is there to stay.” It’s also easy to work remotely in the Netherlands given its proximity to other big European cities, so it may attract new digital nomads, “thanks to the central position of Utrecht in the middle of the country and the attractiveness of the ecosystem.”</p>

<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Good access to funding. Investor scene focuses on early-stage, scalable tech in healthcare, sustainability and education.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
We see an increase in startups coming to the city, due to livability in the lovely city and the facilities for flex working.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)? </strong><br />
Jorg Kop (director of UtrechtInc startup incubator), Heerd Jan Hoogeveen (director of StartupUtrecht), Arjan Van Den Born (director, ROM Utrecht).</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years&#8217; time?</strong><br />
Growing fast, in top five in Europe in five years.</p>
<h2>Irene Van de Poll, investment manager, ROM Utrecht Region</h2>
<p><strong>What industry sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?</strong><br />
The Utrecht region is strong in life sciences, medtech, software (smart services), gaming and media.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Channable, Faqta, Sensorfact, <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;SODAQ&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:6659,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16777215},&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Roboto, RobotoDraft, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif&quot;}">SODAQ</span>, Picnic, <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Neurolytics&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:6659,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16777215},&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Roboto, RobotoDraft, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif&quot;}">Neurolytics</span>, <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;De Clique&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:6659,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16777215},&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Roboto, RobotoDraft, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif&quot;}">De Clique</span>.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
A lot of focus is on life sciences, biotech, as there is a lot of research at the Utrecht science park and also spin-offs. At the science park, organoids, 3D bioprinting, organ on a chip, medtech are areas of interest. Also a number of the VCs in the area are health focused. IT/software/data/AI and VR/AR are also important focus areas for investors.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
I think they will stay as Utrecht is very centrally located in the Netherlands and Europe. It’s easy to work remotely in the Netherlands, internet speed is no problem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s apex court on Friday ruled in favor of Amazon to stall the sale of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/29/indias-reliance-retail-to-acquire-future-groups-retail-wholesale-and-logistics-businesses-for-3-4-billion/">Future Group to Reliance Industries</a> in a major victory for the American e-commerce giant in the key overseas market.</p>
<p>The Indian Supreme Court said the order by a Singapore arbitration court last year &#8212; which had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/25/reliance-says-its-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-fully-enforceable-under-indian-law-despite-amazon-winning-an-arbitration-order/">ruled to stall the deal between the two Indian giants</a> &#8212; is enforceable in India.</p>
<p>Reliance Retail said a year ago it had reached an agreement with Future Group to acquire the latter’s retail and wholesaler business, as well as its logistics and warehousing business, for $3.4 billion.</p>
<p>Amazon, which had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/amazon-future-coupons/">invested in one of Future Group&#8217;s units</a>, accused the Indian firm of violating its contract and reached the Singapore arbitrator to halt the deal.</p>
<p>Amazon’s deal with Future Retail had given the American e-commerce giant the first right to refusal on purchase of more stakes in Future Retail, Amazon argued.</p>
<p>The Indian firms had argued at the time that a Singapore’s court order wasn’t valid in the South Asian market. India&#8217;s watchdog Competition Commission of India last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/india-approves-reliances-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-brings-a-new-headache-to-amazon/">approved the deal</a> between the Indian firms.</p>
<p>Shares of Future Retail, which operates 1,700 retail stores across 400 Indian cities, dropped 6% on the order, while Reliance Industries &#8212; the conglomerate that runs Reliance Retail &#8212; were down 1.3%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon, Walmart’s Flipkart and Ambani’s Reliance Industries, the most valuable firm in India, are locked in an intense battle to command the Indian retail market.</p>
<p>With e-commerce commanding only between 3 -7% of all retail sales in India — and Reliance Retail launching its own e-commerce business to fight Amazon and Flipkart — Amazon’s reported future deal with Reliance Retail is already seen by many industry analysts as crucial for the American e-commerce firm’s future in India.</p>
<p>Amazon, which kickstarted its journey in India eight years ago, has invested more than $6.5 billion in its local business in the country.</p>
<p>Founded in 2006, Reliance Retail serves more than 3.5 million customers each week (as of early this year) through its nearly 12,000 physical stores in more than 6,500 cities and towns in the country.</p>
<p>The retail chain, run by India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, raised over $7 billion last year. Ambani’s other venture, Jio Platforms, also raised over $20 billion from more than a dozen marquee investors, including Google and Facebook last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. electric automaker Fisker expects operating expenses to reach between $490 million and $530 million this year, a slight increase in its business outlook for the year that is driven by R&amp;D spending on prototypes for its Ocean SUV, testing and validation of advanced technology, hiring and its &#8220;accelerating&#8221; partnership with Foxconn.</p>
<p>The company, which reported its second-quarter earnings Thursday after market close, raised its business outlook for expectations for key non-GAAP operating expenses and capital expenditures for the full year up from its previous guidance of $450 million to $510 million. The earnings report pointed to R&amp;D spending on prototype activities in 2021 driven by testing and validation on advanced driver assistance systems, powertrain and user interface. The company also noted an increase in spending on in-house costs, such as virtual validation software tools, hiring and virtual and physical testing to account for recently tightened Euro NCAP and IIHS safety regulations.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">Co-founder, CFO and COO Geeta Gupta Fisker added during an investor call that the company </span><span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">made</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">a</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">strategic</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">decision</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">to</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">develop</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">internal</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">capabilities</span> to <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">test</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">and</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">validate,</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">instead</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">of</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">relying</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">solely</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">on</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">third</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">parties.</span></p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Henrik Fisker said in an interview Thursday its partnership with Foxconn, which is &#8220;moving faster than expected,&#8221; also is contributing to an increase in spending.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were really aligned,&#8221; Fisker said in an interview Thursday. &#8220;I mean it&#8217;s a very unique business deal because we are both investing into this program; it&#8217;s not like we just hired Foxconn to make a car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fisker has two vehicle programs in the works. Its first electric vehicle, the Fisker Ocean SUV, will be assembled by automotive contract manufacturer Magna Steyr in Europe. The start of production is still on track to begin in November 2022, the company reiterated Thursday. Deliveries will begin in Europe and the United States in late 2022, with a plan to reach production capacity of more than 5,000 vehicles per month during 2023. Deliveries to customers in China are also expected to begin in 2023.</p>
<p>In May, Fisker signed an agreement with Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that assembles iPhones, to co-develop and manufacture a new electric vehicle. Henrik Fisker said the two companies moved on the design &#8220;fairly quickly,&#8221; and are now diving into the engineering and technical details that include working on a patent for a new way of opening a trunk and other technological innovations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have accelerated really quite fast and we probably will have some early prototypes already by the end of this year,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The companies have also decided that this EV will be designed for the urban lifestyle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t make a car for everybody,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t make a car for a farmer and for somebody who lives in an apartment; those are two different vehicles, so we chose the urban lifestyle for this vehicle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Production on the Project PEAR car, which stands for Personal Electric Automotive Revolution, will be sold under the Fisker brand name in North America, Europe, China and India. Pre-production is expected begin in the U.S. by the end of 2023, and will then ramp up into the following year, Fisker said Thursday.</p>
<p>Henrik Fisker didn&#8217;t reveal the U.S. manufacturing location. He did make a recent visit to Foxconn&#8217;s manufacturing facility in Wisconsin, noting it was an &#8220;impressive&#8221; facility, as was the region&#8217;s supply chain. The final decision is Foxconn&#8217;s, Fisker noted. However, Fisker wants to produce the electric vehicle in a state that allows automakers to sell directly to customers. Wisconsin currently prohibits this practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s going to be one of the main things that has to change for us to go to the store and sell our electric vehicle,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<h2>Earnings results</h2>
<p>Here are the basics from the company&#8217;s second-quarter earnings. Keep in mind two important factors: Fisker wasn&#8217;t publicly traded at this time last year, there are no year-over-year comparisons available yet; and this company is essentially pre-revenue, although they did bring in $27,000 from merchandise sales.</p>
<p>Fisker reported it generated $27,000 in revenue, a 22% bump up from the previous quarter. The automaker reported a net loss of $46.2 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to a net loss of $176.8 million in the previous quarter. That large net loss in the first quarter comes from changes in how the SEC treated non-cash items and resulted in warrants liability of $138 million in Q1. The public warrants are now retired and the company says will no longer have these impacts on future earnings.</p>
<p>Loss from operations were $53.1 million in the second quarter compared to a loss of $33 million in the first quarter. Importantly, the company has held onto its cash using what it describes as an &#8220;asset light&#8221; approach, which means it&#8217;s not building a factory, instead relying on partners. Cash and cash equivalents were $962 million as of the quarter ended June 30, slightly lower than the $985.1 million in the first quarter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last summer, in the wake of George Floyd&#8217;s murder, Best Buy committed to </span><a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/a-note-from-best-buys-ceo-we-will-do-better/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“do better</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” when it came to supporting communities of color. As part of the retail giant’s self-proclaimed mission to better address underrepresentation and technology inequities, the company announced today that it is investing up to $10 million in </span><a href="https://brownventuregroup.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown Venture Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota-based Brown Venture Group is a three-year-old venture capital firm that has pledged to exclusively back Black, Latino and Indigenous technology startups in “emerging technologies.” Black and Latin communities were the recipients of</span><a href="http://about.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020_crunchbase_diversity_report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just 2.6% of total funding in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to Crunchbase data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown Venture Group is in the process of fundraising for its </span><a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-based-venture-capital-firm-for-founders-of-color-aims-to-raise-50-million/600011855/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">targeted inaugural $50 million fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 75% of which has been committed, according to its principals. This means that Minneapolis-based Best Buy’s pledge to invest “up to $10 million” could represent as much as 20% of the total capital raised, making it a lead LP in the fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown Venture Group co-founder and managing partner Dr. Paul Campbell said that in the early days of forming the firm, he and co-founder Dr. Chris Brooks were told by “multiple people locally” that they should leave the Twin Cities metro area because “all the capital was on the coasts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We just made a firm decision in the very early stages to stay put in the Twin Cities and that we wanted this to be a Twin City story,” Campbell told TechCrunch. “So when we thought about our Twin Cities ecosystem and who we wanted to be leading partners with, Best Buy was at the top of the list. So we are just more than excited to have Best Buy as a lead LP in our fund.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Best Buy &#8212; which </span><a href="https://fortune.com/company/best-buy/fortune500/#:~:text=As%20screen%20time%20soared%20in,%2C%20climbed%20a%20hefty%2016.7%25."><span style="font-weight: 400;">notched $47 billion in revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year &#8212; said the move is aimed at helping “break down the systemic barriers often faced by Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) entrepreneurs — including lack of access to funding — and empowering the next generation within the tech industry.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company added: “The partnership with Brown Venture Group will work toward making the technology startup landscape more inclusive and creating a stronger community of diverse suppliers.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with announcing Best Buy’s commitment to the fund, the company and venture firm said they would jointly launch an entrepreneurship program at Best Buy Teen Tech Centers to help develop young entrepreneurs through education, mentorship, networking and funding access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown Venture Group &#8212; whose name was chosen to represent an &#8220;inclusive&#8221; skin color of the groups it represents &#8212; has so far invested in five companies, including clean energy startup </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/brown-venture-group-to-provide-ecolution-kwh-with-seed-financing-to-achieve-net-zero-emissions-for-transportation-301176317.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecolution kwh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten million dollars seems like a drop in the bucket for a company that generated sales of $47 billion last year. Best Buy said this initiative is just one of several that it has underway to support BIPOC businesses, including plans to </span><a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/best-buy-commits-more-than-44-million-to-diversity-inclusion-and-community-efforts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">provide $44 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to expand college prep and career opportunities for BIPOC students and a pledge to spend at least </span><a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/best-buy-commits-to-spending-1-2b-with-bipoc-and-diverse-businesses-by-2025/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.2 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with BIPOC and diverse businesses by 2025. The company has also said that by 2025 it will fill one out of three new non-hourly corporate positions with BIPOC employees and </span><a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/best-buy-sets-ambitious-goal-for-hiring-diverse-tech-talent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hire 1,000 new employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to its technology team, with 30% of them being diverse, specifically Black, Latinx, Indigenous and women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re committed to taking meaningful action to address the challenges faced by BIPOC entrepreneurs,” Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said in a written statement. “Through partnerships like this, we believe we can begin to do this by helping to build a stronger, more vibrant community of diverse innovators in the tech industry, some of whom we hope will become partners of Best Buy in the future.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Extra Crunch for August 5, 2021. What goes up must come down. Mostly. That’s the lesson from Robinhood’s stock this week. It shot higher yesterday. And today it fell sharply. Something something stonks. Regardless, we have big news from Apple, Facebook, a host of startups and even some drones for you today.</p>
<p>A quick reminder that tomorrow is the last day for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/tomorrows-the-final-day-for-early-bird-passes-to-tc-disrupt-2021/">early-bird Disrupt tickets</a>. Be there or be a big lame! We’re also excited to announce that TechCrunch is launching another newsletter! This Week in Apps by Sarah Perez launches this Saturday morning, August 7, and is the place to go for all of your app news goodness. Be sure to sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">Apple to scan iPhones for abusive content involving children:</a> </strong>Apple’s privacy push is running into its efforts to limit the sharing of known child sexual abuse material. Its plan, that it has yet to roll out, will work at the device level to “identify if a user uploads known child abuse imagery to iCloud without decrypting the images until a threshold is met and a sequence of checks to verify the content are cleared.”</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">When a startup should leave a market:</a> </strong>In the wake of news that Deliveroo may leave the Spanish market, TechCrunch wanted to learn more about when a startup should leave a particular city or country to its competitors. So we rounded up some smart VCs and got to asking questions. The short answer is that you want gold and silver medals to build a unicorn, not bronze.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/oh-facebook-changed-its-privacy-settings-again/">Facebook redesigns its privacy settings:</a> </strong>And TechCrunch’s Devin Coldeway is not impressed, writing that Facebook has “taken the ‘privacy settings’ settings and scattered them mischievously among the other categories.” If you are a Facebook user, it’s always a good time to check your privacy setup on the social platform. It just may take a little longer now.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We have a strong batch of startup stories below, but to kick things off have a bite of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/robotics-roundup-23/">the latest drone story from Brian Heater</a>. It’s rather tasty. Heater dug into the <em>warehouse</em> drone space, a somewhat natural environment for the tech as large storage buildings aren’t bothered by buzzy sounds, and often boxes in those buildings feature bar codes and are stacked vertically.</p>
<p>Now, our usual rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/creators-can-now-monetize-their-expertise-on-quora/"><strong>Quora launches subscriptions to access certain answers:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Creators who love answering questions, Quora would like your attention. Long-running Q&amp;A site Quora is rolling out Quora+ &#8212; natch &#8212; that will cost $5 per month, and allow access to content that creators decide should cost money to access.</li>
<li>When is a startup going to build the hub for all our subscriptions to digital content so that we can stop having to use password managers for everything? Someone build that, please.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/allocations-sees-a-world-where-myriad-smaller-private-equity-funds-are-the-norm/"><strong>Allocations raises $4M to power small PE funds:</strong></a><strong> </strong>This one is cool. Allocations has built tech that enables fund managers to quickly spin up new private equity funds and SPVs. And the startup’s tech handles boring things like paperwork and capital calls. The thesis here is that there will be many more smallish PE funds in the future. The solo GP movement indicates that Allocations might be barking up the correct money tree.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/astra-targets-first-commercial-orbital-launch-for-august-27/"><strong>Ad astra for Astra:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the news from space launch vehicle company Astra, which is targeting August 27 for its first commercial launch. Sure, Boeing is struggling to make its rocket go up, but seeing Astra chase better-known launch systems is good news. More competitors, more rockets in time. And then you and I can go to space.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/plant-based-cereal-startup-offlimits-pours-2-3m-into-new-products/"><strong>OffLimits raises $2.3M for healthy cereal:</strong></a> Here in America we like our breakfasts sweet. That means our cereals are often loaded with sugar, and are thus both killing us while also making us smile. OffLimits is making cereal that is healthy (alas) but tasty, as well as &#8220;organic, vegan [and] gluten-free.” That sounds less fun than Cap’n Crunch, but as I’d like to avoid eventual limb amputation, perhaps the startup is onto something.</li>
<li>From the world of edtech, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">TechCrunch’s Natasha Mascarenhas</a> has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/as-edtech-evolves-latam-reskilling-platforms-raise-millions-to-bring-outcomes-into-the-mix/">big piece out today looking at two companies</a> &#8212; <strong>Coderhouse </strong>and<strong> Crehana</strong> &#8212; that are working in the reskilling space in Latin America. Reskilling, the teaching of new tricks to workers already in the market, is a big market. And Latin America is becoming a pretty key market for edtech, so make sure you don’t miss this one.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/cent-the-platform-that-jack-dorsey-used-to-sell-his-first-tweet-as-an-nft-raises-3m/"><strong>Cent raises 300,000,000 cents to help make sense of NFTs:</strong></a> Remember when @Jack sold his first tweet as an NFT? The platform that made that transaction possible just raised $3 million. Or as we noted before, 300 million cents. Regardless of how you prefer to write out monetary sums &#8212; 12,000,000 quarters! &#8212; the latest Cent deal indicates that VCs are still more than willing to bet on NFTs in particular, and the cryptoeconomy more broadly.</li>
</ul>
<p>TechCrunch’s <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron Miller</a> covered a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/bluecore-lands-125m-series-e-on-1b-valuation-as-e-commerce-personalization-grows/">huge $125 million Series E for Bluecore</a> today. The new capital made the e-commerce personalization platform the world’s newest unicorn. At least for a few hours. I asked Miller why he covered the round. Here’s what he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bluecore is part of the omnichannel personalization market. It&#8217;s an area that thrived during the pandemic as more commerce shifted online and it became more imperative to offer more targeted messaging. The round is a sign that investors see the value in this and are willing to bet big money on companies like Bluecore being successful long term.</p></blockquote>
<p>There, a look behind the curtain!</p>
<h2>A blueprint for building a great startup founding team</h2>
<p>Assembling a startup&#8217;s team is harder than assembling 10 IKEA dressers and the stakes are much higher.</p>
<p>Starting with the assumption that 90% of startups will fail and the most successful ones take an average of six years to IPO, founders have to make careful decisions about who they invite to join the founding team.</p>
<p>Is a stellar engineer a great choice? Or a terrible choice? Should your product person be opinionated or a team player? Are you even the best choice for CEO?</p>
<p>ThoughtSpot CEO Sudheesh Nair shared some of his thoughts about building a sturdy leadership team and drafted a thorough checklist for entrepreneurs who are putting a crew together. His initial advice?</p>
<p>&#8220;Investors love founder-CEOs, and founders are often fantastic candidates for this role. But not everyone can do it well, and more importantly, not everyone wants to.&#8221;</p>

Yes, Spaces, Big Tweet’s chatroom tool, is expanding its feature set. You can now have a host, two co-hosts and up to 10 speakers at once. Just don’t, because that would be more noise than signal.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/qualcomm-wants-to-buy-veoneer-for-4-6b-beating-magnas-offer/">Qualcomm wants to buy Veoneer:</a></strong> Qualcomm is offering $800 million more than what Magna International offered for Swedish automotive tech company Veoneer. The chip company is willing to cough up $4.6 billion for the asset. Why? Because Veoneer builds “advanced driver assistance systems, decision-making vehicle hardware and software.” So consider this a long-term bet by Qualcomm that self-driving tech is going to be everywhere. Eventually.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/automakers-urge-greater-government-investment-to-meet-bidens-ev-sales-target/">Automakers want more government money:</a></strong> Cars are going electric, and the U.S. government has big goals to boost their domestic market share and production volume. Automakers are like, hey, how about some help. To that end a group of automotive OEMs are asking for the “timely deployment of the full suite of electrification policies committed to by the Administration in the Build Back Better Plan.” That means money in the form of consumer incentives and a charging network.</li>
<li>Which feels a bit odd given that GM is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/gms-earnings-dragged-down-by-chevy-bolt-recall/">making oodles of money at the moment</a>. Surely it can deploy some of that capital? Also I hear that money is cheap at the moment.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/googles-nest-cams-and-doorbell-get-a-refresh/">Google refreshes its Nest lineup:</a></strong> Finally for the day, Google’s Nest division has refreshes ready for its Nest lineup of cameras and doorbells. Nest is a bit of a dark horse inside of Google, given that it’s a hardware division at what is nearly entirely a software business. Still, the new hardware looks quite nice.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uber’s second-quarter earnings revealed greater than expected losses, in large part due to the company’s massive<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uber-entices-drivers-back-post-pandemic-with-250-million-stimulus/"> $250 million stimulus package</a> launched in April to incentivize drivers back onto the app after a pandemic-induced shortage.</p>
<p>The company reported a loss of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/uber-shares-fall-despite-revenue-beat-as-its-core-operations-continue-to-lose-money/">$509 million before EBITDA</a>. For comparison,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/lyft-reaches-adjusted-profitability-milestone-despite-continuing-net-losses/"> Lyft reported a positive adjusted EBITDA</a> in the quarter at $23.8 million the day before. Uber&#8217;s losses point to a larger problem facing the app-based ride-hailing industry: The triple threat of lagging driver supply, the cost of attracting them, and the COVID-19 delta variant looming in the periphery.</p>
<p>“Drivers increasingly want to get back on the road,” said CEO Dara Khosrowshahi during the earnings call on Wednesday. “In June, 60% of inactive drivers told us they intended to start driving again within a month. That&#8217;s up from 40% in April. And 90% of drivers told us they expect to come back by September. We&#8217;re also beginning to see marketplace metrics revert to normalcy in several markets with surge levels and wait times back to nearly normal in Miami, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Phoenix. But in major cities like New York, San Francisco and LA, demand continues to outpace supply and prices in late times remain above our comfort levels.”</p>
<p>Khosrowshahi said Uber is expecting the driver momentum that has been picking up over the last few months to continue, even as Uber tapers off its “post-pandemic” incentives for drivers. But the thing is, the pandemic is far from over. Only 50% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, and the CDC has said the highly contagious delta variant has caused between 80% and 87% of all U.S. COVID-19 cases in the last two weeks of July. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/what-does-delta-variant-have-store-us-we-asked-coronavirus-experts">Many computer models predict</a> case counts will peak sometime between mid-August and early September, bringing as many as 450,000 daily cases.</p>
<p>Lockdowns haven’t been the only things causing driver shortages: Drivers don’t want to risk their lives during a pandemic for what is often argued to be meager pay. Uber’s losses and attempts to attract more drivers also come as the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/uber-ceo-calls-massachusetts-gig-economy-ballot-measure-the-right-answer/">is back on stage as a potential threat to gig workers’ labor rights.</a> Uber is part of a coalition of app-based ride-hailing and on-demand delivery companies that filed a petition this week to introduce a ballot measure in Massachusetts that would define drivers as independent contractors, not employees — similar to what happened last year in California with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/07/human-capital-the-gig-economy-in-a-post-prop-22-world/"> Proposition 22</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I took the incentives that they used to get people back, and I think most drivers that have any brains did the same,&#8221; an Uber driver called Jay who&#8217;s been driving since 2013 told TechCrunch. &#8220;And once the incentives ran out, I stopped driving, because I&#8217;m losing money when I drive for them now. They have cut the rates so low that it doesn&#8217;t make any sense anymore to work for them, and that&#8217;s why people are having such a hard time getting an Uber. You have these disgustingly out of touch billionaires running this company into the ground.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite these setbacks, Khosrowshahi — presumably one of the “out of touch billionaires” Jay references — went on to assure investors that Uber expects to achieve total company EBITDA profitability by the end of the year. Uber is hoping its investments in what it calls the “earner experience” will help retain workers.</p>
<p>“From doubling down on our app quality to targeted and personalized reengagement campaigns, to completely redesigning our onboarding flow to make it easier and faster than ever to earn safely, to rolling out unique programs like free language learning from Rosetta Stone, or free tuition with ASU, our earner super app is unique in the depth and breadth of earnings opportunities we can offer drivers and couriers globally,” he said.</p>
<p>If mobility continues to take a hit, as it has recently in cities like Sydney, Australia due to persistent lockdowns, Khosrowshahi says Uber can fall back on its other businesses, like freight, Uber Eats and courier service. Khosrowshahi said there&#8217;s been a trend of Uber Eats and courier orders increasing as rides decrease.</p>
<p>Last November,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/"> Uber acquired online food delivery app Postmates</a>, which the company says has resulted in nearly 5 million additional consumers, 160,000 couriers and over 25,000 merchants migrating from Postmates to Uber Eats, as well as helping Uber establish itself as a category leader in Los Angeles and New York City.</p>
<p>Uber has also expanded into new verticals recently like grocery, convenience and alcohol delivery, with U.S. gross bookings in June nearly tripling from December 2020 levels and doubling in the U.K. and France.</p>
<p>“The differentiator that we have is the audience and the Uber platform,” said Khosrowshahi. “We were actually one of the latest players to build up a delivery business, and we built it based on the Uber brand, the marketplace-matching technology that we have, the pricing technology, routing, etc. [ … ] We’ve got bigger datasets than anyone else. We&#8217;re able to train our algorithms over much larger global data points versus our competitors, which allow us to build a matching, routing, incentives, marketing engine that is more personalized and just has greater capabilities than anyone else.”</p>
<p>Khosrowshahi also noted that the company has ops teams on the ground in every market so it can understand the right inventory per marketplace.</p>
<p>“It all translates into: Lower cost of customer acquisition, higher lifetime value, lower overheads and greater tech capabilities. That&#8217;s the differentiator.”</p>
<p>Aside from hitting its EBITDA goals by Q4, Khosrowshahi said Uber expects total company gross bookings to be between $22 and $24 billion, and total company adjusted EBITDA to be better than a loss of $100 million for Q3.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Duolingo, best known for its whimsical owl and language-learning app, is working on a new product to add to its growing suite: a math app, according to CEO Luis von Ahn. The co-founder mentioned the app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/31/5-lessons-from-duolingos-bellwether-edtech-ipo-of-the-year/">during an interview last week</a>, the same day that Duolingo officially listed in the stock market.</p>
<p>After the interview, TechCrunch reached out to Duolingo to get more information about the app, but the company declined to provide more detail because it is “still very early” in the development process. It did say that users may learn more about it later this month at <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/duocon">Duocon</a>, Duolingo’s annual free conference. A May job posting shows that Duolingo has been looking for a <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/duolingo/jobs/5243613002">learning scientist </a>with a PhD in mathematics to help build out a new math app alongside a “small cross-functional team.”</p>
<p>The listing hints that the app will be focused on serving younger learners. It mentions that Duolingo wants candidates to have classroom experience and knowledge about teaching K-12 level math, especially with younger students between 3rd and 8th grade.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/49111031/Duolingo-venturing-into-maths">Duolingo&#8217;s current users feel mixed</a> about the idea of Duolingo getting into math.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WBgWuLCuwL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">Duolingo can&#8217;t teach you how to speak a language, but now it wants to try</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Duolingo can&#8217;t teach you how to speak a language, but now it wants to try&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/embed/#?secret=WBgWuLCuwL" data-secret="WBgWuLCuwL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In an interview on IPO day, CEO Luis von Ahn said that users may see Duolingo accelerate its math app and that the company plans to expand beyond language learning through upcoming acquisitions. That may calm some qualms around Duolingo needing to put a ton of resources toward an entirely new piece of software or curriculum.</p>
<p>“If there are other subjects where we think somebody is doing a pretty good job and they have a similar mission to us, and they have a similar company culture,” Duolingo may consider acquiring the company, von Ahn said in the interview.</p>
<p>Math-focused edtech companies include Khan Academy, <a href="https://brilliant.org/">Brilliant.org</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/math-learning-app-photomath-raises-23-million-as-it-reaches-220-million-downloads/"> Photomath</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/numerade-lands-100m-valuation-for-short-form-stem-videos/">Numerade</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/course-hero-symbolab-makes-a-rare-edtech-acquisition/">the recently acquired Symbolab. </a></p>
<p>For Duolingo, the math app is another chapter in its history of experimentation. The company has churned through hundreds of ideas in its decade of existence, which have had varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, it built a product suite beyond its core app, which includes Duolingo ABC, a literacy app for kids and the Duolingo English Test. Meanwhile, Duolingo’s “graveyard” of failed ideas includes a few retired monetization strategies and AI-powered chatbots. Popular features like leaderboards sputtered before they succeeded. And math, interestingly, has always been in the back of von Ahn’s head.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-origin/">As mentioned in the Duolingo EC-1</a>, von Ahn has always said that he and his co-founder, Severin Hacker, were thinking about making Duolingo a math app before they eventually decided on language learning.</p>
<p>“I love math, but if you learn math, math itself can’t make you any money,” von Ahn said in a previous interview. “You learn math to learn physics to become an engineer, whereas knowledge of English directly improves your income potential in most countries of the world.”</p>
<p>One user<a href="https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/49111031/Duolingo-venturing-into-maths"> wrote that</a> “[math] is such a key skill to learn…[and] hopefully this may provide better resources especially to those with such limited access, while being inspirational and equally engaging to those of us with more opportunities.”</p>
<p>Others seemed to want Duolingo to invest inwardly on its language-learning service before moving outward to other areas. “It&#8217;s odd that Duo should consider branching into Maths when its coverage of the majority of languages (with the notable exception of French and Spanish) leaves a great deal to be desired,” <a href="https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/49111031?comment_id=49113260">one user wrote. </a></p>
<p>The company can only teach from a beginner to a low-intermediate level of language fluency according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). About 30% to 40% of Duolingo courses are in some stage of CEFR alignment, per the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">company’s last pull of metrics</a> from May.</p>
<p>It may be too soon to assume how Duolingo’s math app would look, what it would offer or even if it will be monetized. Regardless, it will be Duolingo’s first formal foray into an area of education beyond language.</p>
<p>The company will need to find not only the product, but the philosophical overlap between the two subjects. Language learning is a skill that is benefited by cultural context and nuance, while math revolves around the goal of getting to the one right answer. However, both areas of education require methodical thinking and the ability to apply functions to get to answers. Ultimately, both rely on what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">Duolingo often argues is its biggest product</a>: motivation to open up an app, and pay attention to what’s happening on the screen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ward van Gasteren embraces the “growth hacker” term, despite the fact that some in the profession prefer the term “growth marketing” or simply “growth.” What’s the difference to him? The hacking part should be a distinct effort on top of ongoing marketing, he says.</p>
<p>“Growth hacking is great to kickstart growth, test new opportunities and see what tactics work,” he tells us. “Marketeers should be there to continue where the growth hackers left off: build out those strategies, maintain customer engagement and keep tactics fresh and relevant.”</p>
<p>Based in The Netherlands, he has developed his own growth hacking courses, <a href="https://growwithward.com/">Grow With Ward</a>, and worked with large companies like TikTok, Pepsi and Cisco, and startups like Cyclemasters, Somnox and Zigzag. In the conversation below, van Gasteren shares the importance of building internal processes around growth for the long term, the state of growth today and his own development.</p>
<p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>You’re a certified growth hacker &#8212; how do you think this sets you apart from others? How has this certification changed the way you approach working with clients?</strong></p>
<p>I was part of the first-ever class from Growth Tribe (when they still offered multimonth traineeships), which was an amazing experience. The difference that a certification shows is that you know that a certified growth hacker has knowledge of the beginning-to-end process of growth hacking, and that this person is supposed to look at more than just a single experiment to hack their growth.</p>
<p>There are a lot of cowboy growth hackers who simply repeat the same tactics, instead of trying to work from a repeatable process, where you identify problems through data, have a non-biased prioritization process for ideas and will focus on long-term learnings over direct impact. A proper certificate shows that you know what it takes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>When do you think clients should invest in the beginner growth hacking course you offer on your website rather than investing in working with you directly? </strong></p>
<p>I created the course to make growth hacking available to a larger audience. I noticed that almost all other growth hacking courses fell into one of two buckets: (1) cheap (&lt;$200), but focused on superficial growth tactics, or (2) good quality in-depth content, but very expensive ($1,500-$5,000). And I believe everybody should have access to that knowledge of how to build a systematic process to achieve long-term sustainable growth, so I created my own course, since I know that working one-on-one with me is also too expensive for most people.</p>
<p>Especially if you’d look at students or junior marketeers, for whom I created a proper beginner growth hacking course that will teach you 20% of the knowledge that is necessary to achieve the first 80% of the results.</p>
<p><strong>Growth hacking does have some noticeable differences from marketing, as outlined on your <a href="https://growwithward.com/what-is-growth-hacking/">website</a>. How should clients make the decision between working with you, a growth hacker, instead of with a marketer? </strong></p>
<p>The choice between working with a growth hacker versus a digital marketer is not a one-or-the-other choice; the fields are very different in focus and actually complementary to each other. Growth hacking is great to kickstart growth, test new opportunities and see what tactics work. Marketeers should be there to continue where the growth hackers left off: build out those strategies, maintain customer engagement and keep tactics fresh and relevant. You shouldn’t hire a growth hacker to maintain your marketing strategies; they’re excited to make new growth steps and would get bored when they can’t test new ideas.</p>
<p>Most of the time, I help a client get up to speed, show which opportunities are valuable and give them a strategy to execute. Then I hand it over to marketing for the long-term execution and coach them on the execution, and step back in when there’s a need for new growth input.</p>
<p><strong>What are some common misconceptions about growth hacking? </strong></p>
<p>A lot of growth hackers still present growth hacking as a perfect approach, where thanks to our data-driven way of working we can always make the right moves. But that’s not true: The hard data that you see in your analytics tools, can only tell you what is slowing down your growth, but not why your growth slows down there. While the &#8220;why&#8221; is what we build our experiments on top of … many growth hackers just fill that with their own assumptions to keep their speed, but that’s not sustainable long term.</p>
<p>Next to the hard data, you need soft data: the why. And that comes from talking with customers, running hypothesis-focused experiments (not result-focused) and maybe by looking at your feedback from customer support or surveys. Every time I implement a soft data feedback loop with my clients, I see that we increase our experiment effectiveness from 1 in 10 up to 1 in 3.</p>
<p><strong>What trends are you seeing in the growth hacking world right now? </strong></p>
<p>The growth industry is definitely maturing. Less hacks, more teams, more focus on velocity. Everybody within the field is getting to know the best practices very quickly and implementing them even quicker. So then what? We need more knowledge, more qualitative feedback and a more systematic approach to scale up our impact, to be able to rise above best practices and implement truly relevant and sophisticated tactics for our businesses. Since the field is maturing, you see people starting to get rid of the shoestring tools.</p>
<p>For this reason, I’m currently rolling out a growth management tool for growth teams, called Upgrow, where teams can more easily manage their experiment velocity, report to stakeholders with the click of a button and make sure that they systemize the knowledge retention from their articles to build companywide knowledge. And you see that mature growth teams need this kind of software to really level up and manage these trends that are putting stress on their process due to the growth of their company.</p>
<p><strong>What do startups continue to get wrong? </strong></p>
<p>Most startups just keep perfecting their product forever-and-ever: “Just this one extra feature and then we go live.” I can understand that, since north-star metrics, NPS scores and product-led growth are dominating the conversation around startup growth nowadays, but let me be real: You will never be fully done. There will always be a next feature. And you will only have a benefit if you grow alongside your customers. Put a &#8220;coming soon&#8221; on your website for the features that are in the making, and just start selling and scaling up your growth efforts: Different channels bring different kinds of users, who will have new demands, so you have to be adapting all the time. Not just now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple later this year will roll out new tools that will warn children and parents if the child sends or receives sexually explicit photos through the Messages app. The feature is part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">a handful of new technologies Apple is introducing</a> that aim to limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) across Apple&#8217;s platforms and services.</p>
<p>As part of these developments, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">will be able to detec</a>t known CSAM images on its mobile devices, like iPhone and iPad, and in photos uploaded to iCloud, while still respecting consumer privacy.</p>
<p>The new Messages feature, meanwhile, is meant to enable parents to play a more active and informed role when it comes to helping their children learn to navigate online communication. Through a software update rolling out later this year, Messages will be able to use on-device machine learning to analyze image attachments and determine if a photo being shared is sexually explicit. This technology does not require Apple to access or read the child&#8217;s private communications, as all the processing happens on the device. Nothing is passed back to Apple&#8217;s servers in the cloud.</p>
<p>If a sensitive photo is discovered in a message thread, the image will be blocked and a label will appear below the photo that states, &#8220;this may be sensitive&#8221; with a link to click to view the photo. If the child chooses to view the photo, another screen appears with more information. Here, a message informs the child that sensitive photos and videos &#8220;show the private body parts that you cover with bathing suits&#8221; and &#8220;it&#8217;s not your fault, but sensitive photos and videos can be used to harm you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also suggests that the person in the photo or video may not want it to be seen and it could have been shared without their knowing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186143" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186143" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2186143" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png 2046w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=1536,803 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/messages-sensitive-material.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186143" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>These warnings aim to help guide the child to make the right decision by choosing not to view the content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, if the child clicks through to view the photo anyway, they&#8217;ll then be shown an additional screen that informs them that if they choose to view the photo, their parents will be notified. The screen also explains that their parents want them to be safe and suggests that the child talk to someone if they feel pressured. It offers a link to more resources for getting help, as well.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still an option at the bottom of the screen to view the photo, but again, it&#8217;s not the default choice. Instead, the screen is designed in a way where the option to <em>not</em> view the photo is highlighted.</p>
<p>These types of features could help protect children from sexual predators, not only by introducing technology that interrupts the communications and offers advice and resources, but also because the system will alert parents. In many cases where a child is hurt by a predator, parents <a href="https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/katies-apps-piece/289-d399ac48-f052-4378-bfd3-4589a83e9632">didn&#8217;t even realize</a> the child had begun to talk to that person online or by phone. This is because <a href="https://www.bark.us/blog/grooming-signs-sexual-predators/">child predators are very manipulative</a> and will attempt to gain the child&#8217;s trust, then isolate the child from their parents so they&#8217;ll keep the communications a secret. In other cases, the predators <a href="https://www.sexualassaultvictimlawyers.com/the-grooming-process-how-sexual-predators-con-you-and-your-child/">have groomed the parents</a>, too.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s technology could help in both cases by intervening, identifying and alerting to explicit materials being shared.</p>
<p>However, a growing amount of CSAM material is what&#8217;s known as self-generated CSAM, or imagery that is taken by the child, which may be then shared consensually with the child&#8217;s partner or peers. In other words, sexting or sharing &#8220;nudes.&#8221; According to a 2019 <a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent00.net/hubfs/7145355/Research/08112020_SG-CSAM_AttitudesExperiences-Report_2019.pdf?__hstc=208625165.d727c87a690279499c0437f031133788.1607630830912.1608068247513.1608130036388.3&amp;__hssc=208625165.2.1608130036388&amp;__hsfp=4238489979">survey </a>from Thorn, a company developing technology to fight the sexual exploitation of children, this practice has become so common that 1 in 5 girls ages 13 to 17 said they have shared their own nudes, and 1 in 10 boys have done the same. But the child may not fully understand how sharing that imagery puts them at risk of sexual abuse and exploitation.</p>
<p>The new Messages feature will offer a similar set of protections here, too. In this case, if a child attempts to send an explicit photo, they&#8217;ll be warned before the photo is sent. Parents can also receive a message if the child chooses to send the photo anyway.</p>
<p>Apple says the new technology will arrive as part of a software update later this year to accounts set up as families in iCloud for iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey in the U.S.</p>
<p>This update will also include updates to Siri and Search that will offer expanded guidance and resources to help children and parents stay safe online and get help in unsafe situations. For example, users will be able to ask Siri how to report CSAM or child exploitation. Siri and Search will also intervene when users search for queries related to CSAM to explain that the topic is harmful and provide resources to get help.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Many VCs tout their mentorship and hands-on approach to founders, especially those who run early-stage startups. But in the recent era of lightning-fast rounds closing at sky-high valuations, the cap tables of early-stage startups are becoming increasingly crowded.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that the value VCs bring has diminished. If anything, it’s quite the opposite — this new dynamic is forcing founders to be extremely selective about exactly who is sitting around their mentorship table. It’s simply not possible to have numerous deep and meaningful relationships to extract maximum value at the early stage from seasoned investors.</p>
<p>Founders should definitely pursue big rounds at sky-high valuations, but it’s important that they recognize how important it is to manage who they allow into their mentorship circles. Initially, founders should make sure their first layer consists of the real &#8220;doers&#8221; — usually angels and early venture investors who founders meet with weekly (or more frequently) to help solve some of the most granular problems.</p>
<p>Everything from hiring to operational hurdles all the way to deeper, more personal challenges like balancing family life with a rapidly growing startup.</p>
<p>This circle is where the real mentorship happens, where founders can be open and vulnerable. For obvious reasons, this circle has to be small, and usually consist of two to six people at most. Anything more simply becomes unwieldy and leaves founders spending more time managing these relationships than actually building their company.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			How founders manage their VC circles can mean the difference in success or failure for a thousand different reasons.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The second layer should consist of the “quarterly crowd” of investors. These aren’t necessarily people who are uninterested or unwilling to participate in the nitty gritty of running the company, but this circle tends to consist of VCs who make dozens of investments per year. They, like their founders, aren’t capable of managing 50 relationships on a weekly basis, so their touch points on company issues tend to move slower or less frequently.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In May, Yahoo! Answers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/06/technology/yahoo-answers-shutting-down.html">shut down</a> after helping the internet answer its most burning questions since 2005. But now, Quora, which began as a question-and-answer site but expanded to incorporate blogging, is making its platform more appealing to creators.</p>
<p>Quora says it&#8217;s &#8220;on track to be cash flow positive from ads alone,&#8221; implying that the platform isn&#8217;t currently in the black. But Quora sees tapping into the creator economy and subscriptions as a way to turn a profit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make sharing knowledge more financially sustainable for creators,&#8221; Quora CEO Adam D&#8217;Angelo wrote in <a href="https://quorablog.quora.com/New-Quora-Subscription-Products">a blog post</a>. &#8220;Even though many people are motivated and able to spend their time writing on Quora just to share their knowledge, many others could share much more with financial justification to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quora&#8217;s first new product is Quora+ &#8212; subscribers will pay a <a href="https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059646852-How-much-do-people-pay-for-their-Quora-membership-">$5 monthly fee</a> or a $50 yearly fee<em> </em>to access content that any creator chooses to put behind a paywall. These are the same rates that Medium, which has <a href="https://blog.medium.com/ad-free-medium-aeee8ef5dacf">no ads</a>, charges for its <a href="https://medium.com/membership">membership</a> program.</p>
<p>Rather than paying select creators, subscribers will pay Quora. Then, each subscriber&#8217;s payment will be distributed to creators &#8220;in proportion to the amount each subscriber is consuming their content, with more of a subscriber’s contribution going to writers and spaces the subscriber follows.&#8221; Creators have the option to enable a <a href="https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060063591-What-does-the-selective-audience-paywall-option-entail-">dynamic paywall</a> on Quora+ content, which would give free users access to certain posts if Quora thinks they&#8217;re likely to convert to paid membership; there&#8217;s also an &#8220;<a href="https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059641832-What-does-the-Adaptive-paywall-mode-entail-">adaptive</a>&#8221; paywall option, which uses an algorithm to decide whether to paywall content for a specific user on a case-by-case basis. This is supposed to help creators strike a balance between monetizing their content and growing their audience to find new potential subscribers.</p>
<p>Quora told TechCrunch that it is still experimenting with Quora+ and can&#8217;t yet say what percentage it will take from subscriptions.</p>
<p>The other option is for creators to write paywalled posts on <a href="https://quorablog.quora.com/Introducing-Spaces">Spaces</a>, which are like user-created publications on Quora. Quora will take 5% of the subscription fee, which the creator can choose at their own discretion &#8212; comparatively, the direct-to-consumer blogging platform Substack takes <a href="https://substack.com/going-paid?utm_source=menu-dropdown">10% of writers&#8217; profits</a>, which makes Quora a competitive alternative. Other platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/ghost-cms-adds-open-source-subscription-and-membership-options/">Ghost</a> ask for a $9 monthly fee, but let writers retain their revenue &#8212; for writers making at least $180 per month, Ghost would be more profitable than Quora.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We’re able to sustainably commit to taking only a minimal fee without needing to increase it in the future because we make enough revenue from ads to fund most of the platform’s development and operations,&#8221; D&#8217;Angelo wrote. Substack, meanwhile, doesn&#8217;t have ads.</p>
<p>Quora reached a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/21/uniquorn/">$1.8 billion valuation</a> in 2017 after raising $85 million, and at the time, the platform had 190 million monthly users. Now, according to D&#8217;Angelo&#8217;s blog post, over 300 million people use Quora each month. Despite this user growth, Quora <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/layoffs-hit-qa-startup-quora/">laid off</a> an undisclosed amount of staff in its Bay Area and New York City offices in January 2020.</p>
<p>Space subscriptions will launch today for English language users in <a href="https://www.quora.com/about/earnings_eligible_countries">25 countries</a>, including the U.S. The rollout of Quora+ will be less immediate as Quora invites select writers to test the platform and determine what works best for subscribers and creators.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Later this year, Apple will roll out a technology that will allow the company to detect and report known child sexual abuse material to law enforcement in a way it says will preserve user privacy.</p>
<p>Apple told TechCrunch that the detection of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is one of several new features aimed at better protecting the children who use its services from online harm, including filters to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/new-apple-technology-will-warn-parents-and-children-about-sexually-explicit-photos-in-messages/">block potentially sexually explicit photos</a> sent and received through a child&#8217;s iMessage account. Another feature will intervene when a user tries to search for CSAM-related terms through Siri and Search.</p>
<p>Most cloud services — Dropbox, Google, and Microsoft to name a few — already scan user files for content that might violate their terms of service or be potentially illegal, like CSAM. But Apple has long resisted scanning users&#8217; files in the cloud by giving users the option to encrypt their data before it ever reaches Apple&#8217;s iCloud servers.</p>
<p>Apple said its new CSAM detection technology — NeuralHash — instead works on a user&#8217;s device, and can identify if a user uploads known child abuse imagery to iCloud without decrypting the images until a threshold is met and a sequence of checks to verify the content are cleared.</p>
<p>News of Apple&#8217;s effort leaked Wednesday when Matthew Green, a cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins University, revealed the existence of the new technology in <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1423071186616000513">a series of tweets</a>. The news was met with some resistance from some security experts and privacy advocates, but also users who are accustomed to Apple&#8217;s approach to security and privacy that most other companies don&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>Apple is trying to calm fears by baking in privacy through multiple layers of encryption, fashioned in a way that requires multiple steps before it ever makes it into the hands of Apple&#8217;s final manual review.</p>
<p>NeuralHash will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-wwdc-2021-privacy-security/">land in iOS 15</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-unveils-macos-12-monterey/">macOS Monterey</a>, slated to be released in the next month or two, and works by converting the photos on a user&#8217;s iPhone or Mac into a unique string of letters and numbers, known as a hash. Any time you modify an image slightly, it changes the hash and can prevent matching. Apple says NeuralHash tries to ensure that identical and visually similar images — such as cropped or edited images — result in the same hash.</p>

<p>Before an image is uploaded to iCloud Photos, those hashes are matched on the device against a database of known hashes of child abuse imagery, provided by child protection organizations like the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) and others. NeuralHash uses a cryptographic technique called private set intersection to detect a hash match without revealing what the image is or alerting the user.</p>
<p>The results are uploaded to Apple but cannot be read on their own. Apple uses another cryptographic principle called threshold secret sharing that allows it only to decrypt the contents if a user crosses a threshold of known child abuse imagery in their iCloud Photos. Apple would not say what that threshold was, but said — for example — that if a secret is split into a thousand pieces and the threshold is ten images of child abuse content, the secret can be reconstructed from any of those ten images.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s at that point Apple can decrypt the matching images, manually verify the contents, disable a user&#8217;s account and report the imagery to NCMEC, which is then passed to law enforcement. Apple says this process is more privacy mindful than scanning files in the cloud as NeuralHash only searches for known and not new child abuse imagery. Apple said that there is a one in one trillion chance of a false positive, but there is an appeals process in place in the event an account is mistakenly flagged.</p>
<p>Apple has <a href="http://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Apple_PSI_System_Security_Protocol_and_Analysis.pdf">published technical details</a> on its <a href="http://www.apple.com/child-safety/">website</a> about how NeuralHash works, which was reviewed by cryptography experts and praised by child protection organizations.</p>
<p>But despite the wide support of efforts to combat child sexual abuse, there is still a component of surveillance that many would feel uncomfortable handing over to an algorithm, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfWoodward/status/1423156599347154946">some security experts are calling</a> for more public discussion before Apple rolls the technology out to users.</p>
<p>A big question is why now and not sooner. Apple said its privacy-preserving CSAM detection did not exist until now. But companies like Apple have also faced considerable pressure from the U.S. government and its allies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/03/five-eyes-governments-call-on-tech-giants-to-build-encryption-backdoors-or-else/">to weaken or backdoor the encryption</a> used to protect their users&#8217; data to allow law enforcement to investigate serious crime.</p>
<p>Tech giants have refused efforts to backdoor their systems, but have faced resistance against efforts to further shut out government access. Although data stored in iCloud is encrypted in a way that even Apple cannot access it, Reuters reported <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive-idUSKBN1ZK1CT">last year</a> that Apple dropped a plan for encrypting users&#8217; full phone backups to iCloud after the FBI complained that it would harm investigations.</p>
<p>The news about Apple&#8217;s new CSAM detection tool, without public discussion, also sparked concerns that the technology could be abused to flood victims with child abuse imagery that could result in their account getting flagged and shuttered, but Apple downplayed the concerns and said a manual review would review the evidence for possible misuse.</p>
<p>Apple said NeuralHash will roll out in the U.S. at first, but would not say if, or when, it would be rolled out internationally. Until recently, companies like Facebook were forced to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55399509">switch off</a> their child abuse detection tools across the European Union after the practice was inadvertently banned. Apple said the feature is technically optional in that you don&#8217;t have to use iCloud Photos, but will be a requirement if users do. After all, your device belongs to you but Apple&#8217;s cloud does not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fleets <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">weren&#8217;t long for this world</a>, but Twitter&#8217;s product teams aren&#8217;t slowing down on bringing new stuff to Spaces, the company&#8217;s own take on audio rooms. Twitter introduced Spaces in a limited test last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/twitter-spaces-to-launch-publicly-next-month-may-include-spaces-only-tweets/">expanding</a> the Clubhouse copycat feature more broadly to anyone with at least 600 followers in May.</p>
<p>Now, Twitter is giving Space hosts the ability to add two co-hosts, who they can rope in through an invite system. Spaces will allow one main host, two additional co-hosts and up to 10 speakers. Additional co-hosts will make the task of moderation much more manageable, as they&#8217;ll be able to vet speaker requests, tap speakers and give anyone in the Space the boot.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>&#8211; hosts have two co-host invites they can send<br />&#8211; the table just got bigger: 1 host, 2 co-hosts, and 10 speakers<br />&#8211; co-hosts can help invite speakers, manage requests, remove participants, pin Tweets and more! <a href="https://t.co/s76JFbhTL2">pic.twitter.com/s76JFbhTL2</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>With Fleets out of the picture, Twitter&#8217;s Spaces are the only feature for now that lives above the main feed in the Twitter app. That virtual real estate, which has echoes of Instagram&#8217;s Stories, draws the eye to anything that a social network wants its users to check out first. Twitter also began rolling out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-redesigns-its-mobile-app-to-make-spaces-the-center-tab/">dedicated tab to make it easier to discover Spaces</a>, surfacing live audio rooms in real time in a central location.</p>
<p>A number of major apps spliced live audio chat rooms into their platforms in light of Clubhouse&#8217;s breakout run. In June, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Spotify launched Greenroom</a>, a standalone app that allows people to create 1,000-person voice events. Naturally, Facebook also launched its own spin on live audio rooms (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">called Live Audio Rooms</a>) in June. Discord, already a leader in voice-based chat, added its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Clubhouse-like event channels</a> in March. Twitter followed the same trend with Spaces, but unlike with Fleets, it looks like the company plans to continue supporting the relatively new feature.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In a company’s early days, the difference between C-level executives and the rest of the organization is simple — employees can walk away from a failure, but the leaders cannot. Under these conditions, certain kinds of people thrive in leadership roles and can take a company from ideation to production.</p>
<p>While there’s no magic formula for what works and what doesn’t, successful startups share common traits in terms of the way their foundational leadership teams are built.</p>
<p>We’ve all experienced what it looks like on the negative end of the spectrum — people making points simply to hear their own voice, leaders competing for credit and clashing agendas. When people would rather be heard than contribute, the output suffers. Members of a healthy leadership team are unafraid to let others have the limelight, because they trust the mission and the culture they’ve built together.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			An honest self-assessment is necessary and this is something that only exceptional and selfless founders are capable of.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We are all imperfect human beings, founders included. There are always going to be moments that leaders can’t predict, and mistakes come with the territory. The right leadership team should be able to mitigate the unexpected, and sometimes make the future easier to predict. Putting the right people in the right roles early on can be the difference between success and failure — and that starts at the top.</p>
<h2>Start by determining who will lead as CEO</h2>
<p>Investors love founder-CEOs, and founders are often fantastic candidates for this role. But not everyone can do it well, and more importantly, not everyone wants to.</p>
<p>Startup founders should ask themselves a few questions before they lose sleep over the prospect of handing over the reigns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I even want to be CEO? If yes, for how long?</li>
<li>Can I maximize the potential of the company if I’m not the CEO?</li>
<li>Am I really the best person for this job at this stage?</li>
</ul>
<p>An honest self-assessment is necessary and this is something that only exceptional and selfless founders are capable of. In many cases, founders decide they need outside help to fill the role. While a CEO may not be your first hire — or even one of the first five — the person you choose will ultimately occupy your organization’s most critical leadership role, so choose wisely.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Ambitious vision grounded in execution reality. Your CEO should have hands-on experience that allows them to see around corners, predict pitfalls and identify opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>What to watch out for:</strong> Leaders who lack respect for the founding vision or the ability to hire and balance an executive team quickly. A good CEO should be able to manage short-term cash flow and go-to-market needs without compromising the true north, while building a foundation and culture for the long term.</p>
<h2>Then, hire a leader for your engineering team<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walter Isaacson, the biographer who chronicled the lives of Steve Jobs, Benjamin Franklin and Leonardo da Vinci, is turning his attention to the life and career of Elon Musk. The Tesla CEO announced the project in a tweet Wednesday.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1423104512479334402?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Musk said that Isaacson has shadowed him “for several days so far,” though he later added that an autobiography might still be in the cards one day. It’s unclear when the book will be released or how far along Isaacson is in the project. His biography on Steve Jobs (aptly titled &#8220;Steve Jobs<em>&#8220;</em>) took more than two years and included interviews with more than 100 of Jobs’ peers.</p>
<p>Musk has been the subject of a number of books, but Isaacson is the most high-profile biographer yet to take on his story. The author is currently a professor at Tulane University and was previously the CEO of the Aspen Institute and the CEO of CNN. Isaacson appeared onstage at TechCrunch&#8217;s Disrupt in 2014.</p>

<p>Other books on Musk’s life and work include Ashlee Vance’s 2015 biography, &#8220;Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future,&#8221; in which Musk participated; Ed Niedermeyer&#8217;s &#8220;Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors&#8221; and this month&#8217;s release of Tim Higgins’ &#8220;Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk, and the Bet of the Century.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musk and Higgins had a brief back-and-forth about a section of &#8220;Power Play&#8221; describing a particularly spicy interaction between him and Apple CEO Tim Cook. The conversation, which Higgins reported in his book and took place over the phone, was over Cook’s purported interest in acquiring Tesla back in 2016. As Higgins tells it, Musk tells Cook he’s interested, but on the condition that he be instated as CEO of Apple &#8212; to which Cook replies, “F—you.”</p>
<p>Musk maintained in a tweet that he and Cook have never spoken or written to each other. Higgins replied that the anecdote came from people who reported as hearing Musk’s recounting of the conversation at the time. He added that Musk was given plenty of opportunities to comment on the anecdote. “He didn’t,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the world of robotic startups, acquisition is often as good an outcome as any. And when it comes to robotic tractor startups, you could do worse than being acquired by John Deere. The agricultural technology giant announced today that <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/john-deere-acquires-bear-flag-robotics-to-accelerate-autonomous-technology-on-the-farm-301349496.html">it’s set to acquire Bear Flag Robotics</a> for $250 million.</p>
<p>The Bay Area-based firm, which specializes in autonomous farming heavy machinery, was founded in 2017. They first crossed our radar the following year, as a member of YC’s Winter 2018 cohort.</p>
<p>“We got a tour of an orchard and just how pronounced the labor problem is,” co-founder Aubrey Donnellan told TechCrunch at the time. “They’re struggling to fill seats on tractors. We talked to other growers in California. We kept hearing the same thing over and over: Labor is one of the most significant pain points. It’s really hard to find quality labor. The workforce is aging out. They’re leaving the country and going into other industries.”</p>
<p>In the intervening years, John Deere tapped Bear Flag for its own Startup Collaborator initiative. And the robotics firm has also begun to deploy its technology to an undisclosed (“limited,” per their wording) number of sites in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the biggest challenges farmers face today is the availability of skilled labor to execute time-sensitive operations that impact farming outcomes. Autonomy offers a safe and productive alternative to address that challenge head on,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Igino Cafiero, says in a release. &#8220;Bear Flag&#8217;s mission to increase global food production and reduce the cost of growing food through machine automation is aligned with Deere&#8217;s and we&#8217;re excited to join the Deere team to bring autonomy to more farms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Agricultural is one of several robotics categories that have seen a spike in interest in the past year, due to labor shortages that predate but were exacerbated by the global pandemic. Of course, that interest doesn’t make anyone immune from the difficulties of launching a robotics startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last month, apple-picking robotics firm Abundant<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/robotics-roundup-19/"> confirmed it was closing up shop</a>, noting, “After a series of promising commercial trials with prototype apple harvesters, the company was unable to raise enough investment funding to continue development and launch a production system,” the company noted at the time.</p>
<p>An acquisition seems like a reasonable outcome for a company like Bear Flag. The startup gains a lot of resources from its massive new owner, and its new owner adds some new tech to its portfolio. Indeed, John Deere has been pretty aggressively looking to expand into more cutting-edge technologies like robotics and drones in recent years.</p>
<p>Bear Flag will retain operations in the Bay Area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies developing driver detection technology could get a boost from a provision tucked inside the 2,702-page <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e/a/ea1eb2e4-56bd-45f1-a260-9d6ee951bc96/F8A7C77D69BE09151F210EB4DFE872CD.edw21a09.pdf">$1 trillion infrastructure bill</a> that would require automakers to build into new cars technology that can tell if drivers have had a few cold ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The provision in the bill, which is actually a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Reduce Impaired Driving for Everyone Act that was introduced in April 2021, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">would direct the U.S. Department of Transportation to establish a technology safety standard for automakers within three years. Automakers would then have another two years to comply and implement tech that detects and prevents drunk driving. Reuters was the first to</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-bill-seeks-require-anti-drunk-driving-vehicle-tech-2021-08-02/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">notice the language</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the provision doesn’t dictate what type of tech has to be in these vehicles, industry experts believe that companies developing camera-based driver monitoring systems (DMS) stand to benefit the most. DMS systems are already mature in the auto industry, representing a technological byproduct of autonomous driving developments. While the auto industry explores self-driving cars as a way to drastically reduce road deaths in the future, advocates and regulators say there&#8217;s room to use some of this tech to solve problems that exist <em>now,</em> like drunk or distracted driving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s happening in the U.S. Senate this week potentially opens the door to a camera-based real-time solution, which will be the first time that the U.S. automakers will have the ability and the requirement to look at real-time physiological changes in your body that occur when you are inebriated,” Dr. Mike Lenné, chief science and innovation officer at Seeing Machines told TechCrunch. &#8220;There are distinct reliable changes to the way you scan the environment, to the way your eyes respond to stimuli, which is why the police use that ‘follow the finger’ test.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system would have to monitor the performance of a driver to detect impairment and prevent or limit vehicle operation if impairment is detected; detect whether BAC (blood alcohol concentration) is equal to or greater than the legal limit, potentially preventing operation of the vehicle at all; or a combination of both systems. </span></p>
<p>Cameras aren&#8217;t the only solution that has been trotted out in recent years.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety (DADSS) program, a technology that’s been developed in partnership between the Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), has advocated using a breath or touch-based approach to determine BAC levels. The touch-based approach involves measuring BAC through the skin&#8217;s surface by shining an infrared light through the driver&#8217;s fingertip.</span><a href="https://www.dadss.org/faq"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">According to DADSS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the current timeline for bringing the breath-based approach to vehicles is by 2024, and the touch-based approach by 2025. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lenné argues that a camera-based approach would be far more successful than a breath or touch-based approach because BAC levels can rise within minutes. Someone could theoretically down a bunch of shots immediately before getting behind the wheel and it wouldn’t show up on a reading for several minutes. Or they could get wasted while driving. And BAC detection doesn’t help at all when it comes to drug-impaired driving. </span></p>
<h2>Europe versus U.S.</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moves are already being made in Europe to encourage automakers to include drunk driving detection technology, specifically through camera-based DMS approaches, whereas most of the discussion on this type of tech in the U.S. has been, until recently, focused on DMS for assisted driving and Level 2 autonomous driving and above. (According to the Society of Automotive Engineers, Level 2 autonomy means the vehicle has combined functions like steering and acceleration but requires the driver to remain engaged.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. provision could propel an industry that has already seen growth in recent years as automakers like GM and Ford implement hands-free advanced driver assistance systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From an integration viewpoint, it’s actually not a step change at all from what the OEMs are doing right now for distracted driving and drowsy driving with camera-based DMS. It’s just another feature to offer, another algorithm on the chip, if you like,” Lenné said. </span></p>
<h2>Near-term tech</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Billions of dollars have gone into developing the technology to make AVs a reality but they are really far off,&#8221; Stephanie Manning, chief government affairs officer at Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), told TechCrunch. &#8220;In the process, automakers have developed a lot of technology that can help us right now in terms of saving lives. If this passes, it&#8217;s going to be the biggest safety rulemaking that NHTSA has ever done in terms of lives saved, and it couldn&#8217;t have come at a better time. But the more we wait, the more we delay, the more people die.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology is not at all far from market, said Lenné, and he would know. Seeing Machines provides the DMS that is used in Super Cruise, GM&#8217;s hands-free advanced driver assistance system. Super Cruise, once relegated to just one Cadillac model, has expanded in capability and GM&#8217;s portfolio and is now in the Cadillac CT6, CT4, CT5, Escalade and Chevrolet Bolt. Seeing Machine&#8217;s tech is also used in the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class and EQS sedans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once it&#8217;s regulated, we can expect to see more entrants to the market because what this does is it creates a top-down demand,” said Lenné. &#8220;It takes it out of the consumers&#8217; hands and tells vehicles they must have these safety features, so the market size will increase dramatically, and so will the market opportunity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The global DMS market is estimated to surpass $2.1 billion by 2026, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 9.8% from this year, <a href="https://www.industryarc.com/Report/172/driver-monitoring-systems-global-market-report.html">according to IndustryARC</a>. Top-down demand due to regulations like the infrastructure bill will certainly increase demand, but it won&#8217;t make the problem easier to solve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to assess what&#8217;s going on in someone&#8217;s head, and that&#8217;s really different from having a forward-facing radar that&#8217;s trying to look at what&#8217;s 30 meters in front of you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re trying to interpret whether or not this person is safe to drive. So it&#8217;s a really difficult technical problem to solve. Our company is 21 years old. Smart Eye has been around for over 10 years. Whilst the market size has increased dramatically, it&#8217;s a hard problem to solve as a new entrant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Newcomers will face competition from established and large Tier 1 suppliers like Seeing Machines and Smart Eye, a Swedish computer vision company that people familiar with the industry say works with Ford (Ford did not confirm or deny this). IndustryARC also names major players as Faurecia, Aptiv PLC, Bosch, Denso, Continental AG and others. But new players are finding their way into the scene, like Israel-based Cipia, formerly Eyesight Technology, and Sweden-based Tobii Tech.</p>
<h2>Room for growth in the market</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More entrants to market means more advancements to the technology. Smart Eye&#8217;s recent acquisition of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/emotion-detection-software-startup-affectiva-acquired-for-73-5m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emotion-detection startup Affectiva for $73.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hints at the potential future applications of DMS in passenger vehicles. Today it might be distracted, drowsy or drunk driving, but in a few years DMS could detect other types of drug impairment, cognitive impairments or even road rage.</span></p>
<p>Tobii, an eye-tracker technology company, just announced its entrance into the DMS market, a space it&#8217;s been exploring for the past few years as it has watched the legislative changes happening first in Europe and now in the U.S.</p>
<p>While a new entrant to the automotive space, Tobii has been in the eye tracking space since 2001, working in industries like marketing, scientific research, virtual reality, gaming and more. Anand Srivatsa, Tobii&#8217;s division CEO, told TechCrunch he thinks one of the biggest challenges will be scaling across different populations, given the different eye shapes of different ethnicities, which he says puts Tobii at an advantage, even with its limited automotive experience.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Emotion-detection software startup Affectiva acquired for $73.5M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/emotion-detection-software-startup-affectiva-acquired-for-73-5m/embed/#?secret=8hdnxcuY6m" data-secret="8hdnxcuY6m" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Because of this long history, we have what it takes to deliver a full solution from a component level all the way to end software because we&#8217;ve done it in other parts of our business,&#8221; Srivatsa told TechCrunch. &#8220;Some of our automotive partners see that as a unique capability from Tobii where we can talk about the compute that is needed for eye tracking because we build our own asix, we&#8217;ve built our own sensor. We have end user software in some aspects of our business, so we understand the implications and the constraints of each of these parts of the stack, and we can work with them to create a more disruptive solution. And that&#8217;s something that I think is going to be quite important in this space. How do you reduce the total cost of the solution to allow it to scale efficiently across all cars?&#8221;</p>
<p>Srivatsa also said there&#8217;s room to extend into other spaces the biometrics or physiological signals that eye tracking yields, reconfiguring information based on outside road conditions or what else is going on in the car in a way that optimizes the tech to ensure drivers are spending the bulk of their time looking at the road.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I am hoping and dreaming for is technologies like forward collision warning, or blind spot warning or even the lane swerving warnings help me out when I need it most by understanding if I&#8217;m becoming complacent or tired, perhaps distracted, and then adjust how the systems perform, the warning timing and things like that, based on what I need in the moment,” Kelly Funkhouser, program manager of vehicle interface testing and head of connected and automated vehicles at Consumer Reports, told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Counter to that is I would like it to not bother me and nag and annoy me when I am fully paying attention. I&#8217;m like ‘Yeah I know exactly what I&#8217;m doing, I am purposely driving over this line so that I don&#8217;t hit the mom and kids.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lenné said there&#8217;s a potential for driver monitoring systems that capture what is really going on inside of a car to become more personalized in order to provide a better driving experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think in all of this, writing a better driving experience is absolutely pivotal,” said Lenné. “If it doesn’t do that, it risks not being accepted by the consumers.”</span></p>
<h2>Advancing existing ADAS tech</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automakers have been a part of the conversation regarding drunk driving technology for years. Back in 2007,</span><a href="https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/release-95e86dba49c0e8277e3c7b662e6aac68-070803-02-e"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nissan revealed a drunk driving concept car</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would use alcohol odor sensors, facial monitoring and vehicle operational behavior to detect driver impairment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same year,</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna16449687"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Toyota announced a similar system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it said would be in cars by 2009. More recently,</span><a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/volvo-drunk-driving-distracted-cameras-sensors-safety/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo announced in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it would install cameras and sensors in cars to monitor drivers for signs of being drunk or distracted and then signal the vehicle to intervene, but that tech is designed for Volvo&#8217;s SPA2 architecture for hands-free driving, which hasn&#8217;t been released yet. The bottom line is without legislation mandating drunk driving prevention and detection, automakers haven’t really moved forward on implementing the tech, despite much of the building blocks being in place already. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manning thinks that’s because automakers want to be able to upcharge for safety features. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Automakers want to test their supercomputers on the open road, but they don&#8217;t want to put the money and time and energy into solving drunk driving, because they don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s their responsibility, and they don&#8217;t want this rule-making,” she said. “We fully expect that they&#8217;re going to fight us tooth and nail throughout the rule-making process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representatives from GM and Ford could not be reached for comment, but John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which worked with NHTSA on the DADSS program, told TechCrunch that the auto industry is committed to supporting public and private efforts to address this threat to road safety.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We appreciate the efforts of congressional leaders and other stakeholders to advance a legislative approach that provides NHTSA the ability to review all potential technologies as options for federal regulation and, consistent with the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, to make a well-informed decision as to whether any specific technologies meet the standard for consumer vehicles,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Inspector General will review the FDA’s accelerated approval pathway, the office announced Wednesday. This sweeping review comes just two months after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/alzheimers-is-open-for-business-controversial-fda-approval-could-pave-the-way-for-future-drugs/">controversial approval of Biogen’s Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm</a>.</p>
<p>The review will focus on the FDA’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-health-care-professionals-drugs/accelerated-approval-program">accelerated approval pathway</a> — a route that allows drugs for serious diseases without existing treatments to be approved if they hit certain interim benchmarks (called surrogate endpoints). These drugs are thought to provide clinical benefit, but that benefit hasn’t actually been demonstrated before the drug is approved. Once the drug is approved, a phase four study would need to demonstrate clinical efficacy.</p>
<p>This is the pathway that allowed for the highly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/after-contentious-debate-fda-approves-first-alzheimers-drug-since-2003/">controversial approval</a> of Aduhelm, the first Alzheimer’s drug to be approved since 2003. It’s this approval that set the HHS-OIG review process in motion, per the Inspector General’s <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/workplan/summary/wp-summary-0000608.asp">Wednesday announcement</a>.</p>
<p>“The FDA&#8217;s approval of Aduhelm raised concerns due to alleged scientific disputes within the FDA, the advisory committee&#8217;s vote against approval, allegations of an inappropriately close relationship between the FDA and the industry, and the FDA&#8217;s use of the accelerated approval pathway,” the announcement reads.</p>
<p>“In response to these concerns, we will assess how the FDA implements the accelerated approval pathway.”</p>
<p>While the FDA has <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2111960">defended its decision</a> to approve Aduhlem via this pathway, there has been significant backlash about the drug’s efficacy and how it got approved in the first place.</p>
<p>Aduhelm, also known as aducanumab, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19323'">had demonstrated</a> it could reduce amyloid plaques in the brain (sticky compounds that disrupt communications between brain cells). However, there have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/after-contentious-debate-fda-approves-first-alzheimers-drug-since-2003/">lingering questions</a> about how much patients actually benefited from the drug. It was unclear whether lowering levels of amyloid plaques would actually slow rates of Alzheimer’s most pernicious symptom: cognitive decline.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In March 2019, two phase three trials of the drug were <a href="https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/aduhelm">shut down</a> after independent monitoring committees found that the drug wasn’t improving patients rates of cognitive decline. Another analysis conducted by Biogen in October, however, yielded different results. One phase three clinical trial of the drug did not show any improvements in cognitive decline, but the other trial did show some modest effects in patients who got the highest doses.</p>
<p>In November 2020 an independent FDA committee declined to endorse the drug for approval. Yet, by June 2021, the drug was approved anyway.</p>
<p>Within the pharmaceutical industry, the approval of Aduhelm initially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/alzheimers-is-open-for-business-controversial-fda-approval-could-pave-the-way-for-future-drugs/">sparked optimism</a> that the FDA might open its doors to more biomarker-based approvals. However, that optimism wasn’t shared by the wider scientific community.</p>
<p>Three members of the independent committee that had advised against the drug’s approval <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/10/health/aduhelm-fda-resign-alzheimers.html">resigned in protest</a>. Based on the inconsistent data, major hospital systems like Mt. Sinai and the Cleveland Clinic have indicated they <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/hospitals/nyt-cleveland-clinic-mount-sinai-won-t-prescribe-controversial-alzheimer-s-disease-drug">won’t prescribe the drug</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the controversy around Aduhelm’s approval has centered around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/health/alzheimers-drug-aduhelm-fda.html">allegations of an especially close working relationship</a> between the FDA and Biogen leading up to the drug’s approval. As <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/06/29/biogen-fda-alzheimers-drug-approval-aduhelm-project-onyx/">STAT first reported</a>, Biogen launched an internal effort called Project Onyx to try to convince regulators to approve the drug, and some FDA officials eventually played active roles in the drug’s approval, including joint presentations before external experts.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/DrWoodcockFDA/status/1413540804962947072">July 9 letter,</a> Janet Woodcock, acting FDA Commissioner, called for HHS-OIG to conduct an external review that would investigate this working relationship.</p>
<p>“We believe an independent assessment is the best manner in which to determine whether any interactions that occurred between the manufacturer and the agency’s review staff were inconsistent with FDA’s policies and procedures,” she wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>While the HHS-OIG investigation was spurred by the Aduhelm controversy, this review will not focus on reviewing the scientific evidence behind Aduhlem (or any other drug, for that matter). Rather it will peek under the hood of the <i>entire </i>accelerated approval pathway to assess how, and when, the FDA chooses to allow drugmakers to go down that road.</p>
<p>HHS-OIG will review interactions between the FDA and outside parties, policies and procedures, and interrogate the FDA’s compliance with those procedures. The review will cover the Aduhelm review process but will also interrogate how the pathway was used to approve other drugs as well.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/DrWoodcockFDA/status/1422957204802506755?s=20">statement on Twitter</a> Woodcock also said that the FDA will “fully cooperate” with the HHS-OIG review.</p>
<p>“Should the HHS OIG identify any actionable items and provide the agency with any recommendations, the FDA would review those expeditiously to determine the best course of action,” she said.</p>
<p>Should actions be required, they could have significant ramifications for drugs in the future, as this pathway is already an attractive option for other companies pursuing Alzheimer’s drugs.</p>
<p>Eli Lilly, for instance, is also working on an Alzheimer’s drug called donanemab, has released <a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-releases-donanemab-data-demonstrated-relationship-between">exploratory findings</a> from a Phase II trial showing that the drug lowered levels of amyloid and other biomarkers and was associated with patient improvements. However, the bulk of the results rest on the drug’s efficacy against biomarkers of Alzheimer’s, rather than individual patient outcomes.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/03/eli-lilly-and-company-lly-q2-2021-earnings-call-tr/">Q2 earnings call this week</a>, Eli Lilly’s senior vice president and chief scientific medical officer, Daniel M. Skovronsky, noted that the FDA’s approval of Aduhelm “reflects a shift in policy and sets a new path for Alzheimer&#8217;s drug approval in the U.S,” and Eli Lilly still intends to file for FDA approval for donanemab using the FDA accelerated approval pathway by the end of the year.</p>
<p>But, that’s the same pathway that will now be under investigation by HHS-OIG.</p>
<p>Still, we might not see results anytime soon, so it is unclear how this news will impact future Alzheimer’s drugmakers seeking to capitalize on a perceived “shift in policy.” The report is scheduled to be released in 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The $3.8 billion sale of Swedish automotive tech company Veoneer to Magna International hit a roadblock Thursday after chipmaker Qualcomm submitted a bid for the company for $800 million more.</p>
<p>Qualcomm’s $4.6 billion bid, which comes in at $37 per share, has already received approval from the company’s board and would not need a stockholder vote, the chipmaker said in a statement. Veoneer and Magna said in July that both companies’ boards had approved the acquisition.</p>
<p>Veoneer is a developer of advanced driver assistance systems, decision-making vehicle hardware and software that can perform a limited set of actions under certain conditions, like changing lanes on a highway or emergency braking. While ADAS is a far cry from “self-driving cars,” it has become a popular &#8212; and attainable &#8212; set of features that are appearing in a greater share of new vehicles on offer today.</p>
<p>The burgeoning bidding war between Magna and Qualcomm is bullish on the future of ADAS technology, as each company seeks to stay competitive with Tier-1 ADAS suppliers Continental and Bosch. Qualcomm’s market capitalization currently sits at $164.8 billion, while Magna’s is $25.3 billion. It&#8217;s unclear whether Magna will submit a counter-bid.</p>
<p>The market has responded to the new bid, with the stock price of Veoneer rising nearly $7 per share, from $31.22 to $38.20 between Wednesday and Thursday. Prior to the announcement of the sale to Magna on July 23, Veoneer stock sat at $19.93 per share.</p>
<p>Veoneer was spun off from automotive safety system maker Autoliv in 2018. The company formed a joint venture with Volvo Cars, dubbed Zenuity, that was focused on advanced driver assistance systems. That venture was later split last July.</p>
<p>The ADAS developer also has a pre-existing relationship with Qualcomm. The two companies signed an agreement in January to collaborate on an ADAS platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
