</div><p id="speakable-summary">The electrification of the bicycle has historically meant just that: A bike, but with an electric motor. You might find some other smart conveniences on higher-end models, but &#8220;less is more&#8221; has usually been the way. <a href="https://newurtopia.com/pages/carbon-ebike" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Urtopia</a>, the latest e-bike brand from China, has other ideas. Its debut ride is, on paper, one of the most tech-heavy bikes we’ve seen. The spec sheet reads more like a phone’s than a next-gen fixie.</p>
<p>For example, beyond the 250W hub motor with three levels of riding assist (and an estimated 30-80 mile range), there’s an integrated dot-matrix display, a fingerprint reader, GPS, 4G (via eSIM), mmWave sensors for vehicle detection, an integrated alarm and, well… the list goes on.</p>

<p>The bike itself has a striking aesthetic that doesn’t bother to hide the fact that this is possibly the most technologically advanced model you’ll see this year. The frame was designed by Mathis Heller who has experience with BMW and IKEA among others, and it’s pure curves and racing lines. The stealth bomber look is further enhanced with all the cables hidden from view inside the frame. The Urtopia is pitched as a city bike and while the (removable) battery isn’t overly obvious, there’s no doubt to even the most casual of glances that you’re not wielding a regular analog pedaller.</p>
<p>When this thing arrived, I was dreading putting it together. Previous experience has taught me that while not complex, you’ll want to set aside some time (and space) to get things set up. Turns out, the prototype model I tested only really needed the front wheel inserted and the tires pumped and I was good to go.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-11%2F780bc4b0-51f4-11ec-abbd-076651e3d916&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=5094863cc7d491b8aaa66f8378efc6ed00044cd3" alt="Urtopia ebike" data-uuid="c91cbd19-8f23-3cec-874a-16a5b7db518e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div>
</figure>
<p>The obvious draw here for gadget fans will be the “smartbar” — an onboard computer built right into the handlebars. The dot matrix display is the centerpiece of the bike and only dials up that “bike from the future” vibe. On the right-hand side where the bell would usually be is the fingerprint reader which interacts with the computer in a few ways (it’s also a digital bell). The left-hand side houses the four-way D-pad which is where you change modes and settings along with powering the bike on (but not off, more on that later).</p>
<p>Despite that long list of smart features, not all of them were available to test on the prototype I was sent. The hardware for the mmWave sensors is there, but there’s no way to activate it. The GPS and eSIM require the companion app to work and that’s not ready yet also. Sadly, those are some very interesting features we’ll have to wait and see on, but most everything else was present and correct.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before the fun stuff, the basic e-bike functionality (power/speeds/range etc.) appears to be on par with other hub-motor bikes I’ve tried. For example, I recently tested the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tenways-cgo600-preview-143051234.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="0">Tenways city bike</a>, which has a 250W battery and motor compared to the Urtopia’s 360Wh cell. But both have 250W torque-based brushless hub motors and the same Gates carbon belt.</p>
<p>Things get more exciting once you turn the bike on. You’ll be greeted with a wooshing sound from the speaker in the smartbar and the company logo appearing on the display before defaulting back to the speedometer. I am informed that some of the sounds will be user-configurable and I hope that includes the option to turn them off. Before you ride, you’ll want to familiarize yourself with the controls. Up and down on the D-pad will cycle through the assistance levels: Pedal mode, Eco, Comfort and Sport (there’s also a “Turbo” mode which is akin to a “throttle” mode).</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-11%2Fcb91c1c0-51f4-11ec-b7a5-e507c68cec56&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=0fdae55bdf2cc9bc6d846251809835cbc430090c" alt="Urtopia e-bike projects turn signals onto the ground." data-uuid="85d2b99f-3f8d-3165-9e20-59572f950dbc" /><figcaption>Urtopia e-bike projects turn signals onto the ground.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div>
</figure>
<p>Tap left or right, and you’ll be presented with turn signals projected on the ground (these also remain on when the lights are on but flash when you initiate a turn). To switch the actual lights on, however, involves speaking to the bike — there’s no manual control, only voice.</p>
<p>This is where things get a little goofy. Urtopia warns in its press materials that the voice recognition system hasn’t been fully “trained.” Yet, for me, it worked perfectly. Perhaps they only trained it on dull-voiced Britons? Anyway, to turn the lights on you’ll need to place a digit on the fingerprint reader and wait for the face icon to appear on the screen letting you know you can issue your command like some sort of Belgian Michael Knight. It’s cool but I’d still like a physical switch so that I don’t have to talk to my bike in public, not least because when you’re riding, it’s harder for the smartbar to hear your voice thanks to the rustling wind, etc. The result is you either have to stop for a second or lean into the handlebars as you go, neither is very elegant.</p>
<p>The list of things you can currently control with your voice includes: Change speed mode, lock the bike, indicate a turn and change the smartbar’s volume. All of those, bar the volume (and lights) have physical controls too. It’s a cute idea and presents a hands-free option, but in practice, I do wonder how useful it is over a nice button you can mash.</p>
<p>Another feature that feels like technology doesn’t necessarily improve is the bell. On this bike it’s built into the fingerprint reader. A long press activates voice recognition, a short press will emit a digital “ring ring.” It works fine, but it’s not as responsive as a physical bell would be. I had times where I was approaching someone from behind and wanted to alert them to my presence, only for the bell to sound half a second after I passed them. Other times it took two or three tries for it to even trigger.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-11%2Ff2945440-51f4-11ec-b56f-93f073644eb7&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=81a81e238391804e6391561bcc4c4334b05069b7" alt="Urtopia ebike." data-uuid="7083c232-007e-38cd-8256-b9e1918f4447" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div>
</figure>
<p>The experience with the alarm also needs a little smoothing out. I love the idea that I can leave the bike “locked” and if anyone moves it, it’ll issue an audible alarm. The problem is, the Urtopia will do this <em>any</em> time it’s locked. This might seem fine until you learn that “locked” is basically “standby” and the bike will be in this mode as soon as you connect the battery. So if you put the battery in and then start wheeling the bike out the front door, the alarm will sound.</p>
<p>There’s an easy fix for this, but also not entirely helpful. Simply turn the bike on and that will disable the alarm. In fairness, this is a quirk of it being a prototype. Production models will allow you to disable the alarm with the fingerprint sensor or the companion app, but this isn’t something I could test. It’s worth mentioning that, right now, there’s no actual way to turn the bike off other than by removing the battery, so fingers crossed these are some kinks that can be ironed out by launch. I asked a company representative if this was the plan and he confirmed that it was.</p>
<p>So, tech aside, what does this thing ride like? The sitting position puts you leaning forward in more of a racer pose than a typical town bike where you might be more upright. It’s comfortable though, even after mid to long rides (the longest I managed was 11 miles but I was up for more) although the Velo saddle could be a little easier on the butt — it’s fairly hard and doesn’t appear to be gel-lined.</p>
<p>In pedal mode, there’s no noticeable resistance from the motor as expected with a hub of this type. At 13Kg/30 pounds, it’s pretty light for an e-bike — mostly thanks to the carbon fiber body. This means if you don’t want to use the battery it’s still a functional regular bike. Tap up on the D-pad though and things get fun real quick. Like most e-bikes, the Urtopia is limited on its power assistance based on territories. The US version tops out at 20 MPH before you’re on your own and the EU version will cap out at 16 MPH of electric assistance.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-11%2F133a0690-51f5-11ec-b7ff-709bc06f91d5&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=9537eed3ea18c8e8a25d825672561a2add7770bd" alt="Urtopia ebike" data-uuid="00c4c1eb-bd0f-3001-b345-19a6aacc6f76" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div>
</figure>
<p>The three power modes all feel pretty fast. That’s to say, even “eco” mode will help you along nicely. Step up to Comfort mode and you probably have nearly all the power you need to get where you’re going and have a good balance of exercise and assistance. In Sport mode, this thing feels really quite fast despite the standard limitations. I often found myself dropping back down to Comfort mode when other humans were near as it can feel quite lively — in a good way.</p>
<p>If you really are feeling like chilling out and letting the bike do all the work, there’s also that Turbo mode. Long press Up on the D-pad and even the lightest of pedaling will soon get you to 20mph. Given the racey aesthetic and the forward seating position, this is a lot of fun for not a lot of effort.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I should mention the range. Urtopia claims you should be good for anything between 30 and 80 assisted miles. This will obviously depend on the terrain and which power mode you’re in, and it’s quite a wide estimate. I haven’t run the battery down yet, but the indicator on the smartbar did seem to get quite low even on a 10-mile ride. It’s hard to know if this is a prototype quirk or just that the battery is draining fast (which, again, could be something that changes in final hardware with final firmware? Hard to know).</p>
<p>This is why I saved the section on GPS and the 4G connectivity until now. One of the more interesting selling points here for me is that you will be able to track and locate the bike on a map at almost any time. The company tells me it plans to offer data bundles for the 4G connectivity for about $30 a year — which seems pretty reasonable for the peace of mind of being able to locate your bike anywhere if it were to go missing. My question is… what impact might this have on the battery if it’s pinging GPS and running 4G while idle? Alas, a question I can’t answer until we get to try the final model.</p>
<p>The same question goes for the mmWave sensors. Another thing I am currently unable to test.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-11%2F746d99e0-51f5-11ec-bffe-0874e42b9891&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=ed86b11c24cf18b125104054b29879d15421004a" alt="Urtopia ebike." data-uuid="c7b726a6-2124-31c0-9dbe-f1d26fb84425" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div>
</figure>
<p>What I do know is that as the bike is right now, it’s incredibly fun to ride and thanks to the weight, fairly easy to handle (I live in a fifth-floor apartment, so wrangling it into the small elevator is thankfully more manageable). The techno styling might not be to everyone’s taste, but I’m quite fond of it. And most importantly, it’s nice to see something so tech-forward, even if some of the headline features weren’t ready. I am eager to try them once they are and after speaking with the company I got the sense there is more to come. I jokingly suggested they should allow music through the smartbar speaker (the bike has Bluetooth) and they suggested that was possible as are the required OTA updates to deliver such new features.</p>
<p>Right now, the Urtopia is available for pre-order via <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/urtopia-carbon-electric-bike-new-urban-utopia--2#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Indiegogo</a>. As such, the standard caveats apply, but given how close to final the prototype I have is, it doesn’t seem like there’s any more development to be done, just some fine-tuning on those remaining features. If you do pre-order you’ll be able to pick one up for $2,000 which is a really competitive price even for the bike without those extra features enabled. According to the campaign, that price will almost double once it goes to retail, so if you’re taken by what you see, there’s a decent incentive to get on board sooner rather than later.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most consumer cannabis transactions are done in cash, legal or not. Since the United States classifies cannabis as a Title IV drug, the banking industry is unwilling and unable to provide services to cannabis operations. That leaves dispensaries managing and protecting massive sums of cash, and the stores cannot offer a modern retail payment system to the consumer.</p>
<p><a href="https://supernet.ai/">SuperNet</a> has a solution. The company will issue and process credit cards that will work in dispensaries. The service is expected to launch in January 2022, and accepted at 100 California retail locations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a real credit card they&#8217;ll get from us,&#8221; CEO Michael W.K. Tsang told TechCrunch. &#8220;It&#8217;s just like any other credit card in your wallet, except instead of a VISA or MasterCard logo, it&#8217;s a SuperNet logo. You can spend it anywhere Supernet is accepted.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241490" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The upsides are apparent. Consumers can leave the cash in the ATM and pay using a plastic card or NFC app. Retailers can reduce the amount of money on-site, and collect more data about their customers who are no longer cash transactions. There&#8217;s even a loyalty program.</p>
<p>Consider cannabis regulations, and SuperNet&#8217;s platform gets more compelling: This platform was built for the complex world of cannabis. CEO Tsang explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regulators want to see fewer cash deposits, and they want to see electronic payments,&#8221; Tsang said. &#8220;The beauty of what we&#8217;re offering is that our money &#8212; the electronic money &#8212; is tracked from the point of purchase. It&#8217;s traceable. We know where the money comes from. In cannabis, with cash, you have to spend a lot more effort to trace where the cash came from.&#8221;</p>
<p>The amount of cash used in legal cannabis transactions is staggering, and money laundering is always a concern by regulators. Cash management is often regarded as one of the most expensive parts of operating cannabis businesses. There are countless examples of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/inside-planet-13-the-worlds-largest-cannabis-dispensary/">dispensaries hiring paramilitary security</a>, storing bundles of cash in plastic totes, and hiring staff only to count the stacks of bills.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SuperNet co-founder and president, dress wedding, knows this pain well. In 2006, along with Steve DeAngelo, wedding founded Harborside Health Center, one of the first cannabis retailers in the United States. Wedding stayed with Harborside for 13 years, where he oversaw the dispensary&#8217;s operations, inventory management, and banking relationships. This is where he first worked with Michael Tsang, SuperNet&#8217;s CEO and co-founder.</p>
<p>Tsang has a long history in the banking world. At Harborside, wedding hired Tsang to address the growing challenges around cannabis payments. In 2014 Tsang founded SuperNet&#8217;s parent company, Super Processor &#8212; a payment processor for general and niche consumer retailers.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people think Square and Stripe are payment processors, but they&#8217;re not,&#8221; explained Tsang. &#8220;They still rely on a processor, so we had to become a processor. Our first bank sponsor didn&#8217;t let us use their technology so we had to build that, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we own our own platform, back-end and front-end, and we are a full processor,&#8221; Tsang said.</p>
<p>SuperNet&#8217;s cards work like regular credit cards. Users have to apply, and SuperNet will issue the card depending on typical credit factors. In-store transactions take seconds or less. Cardholders pay their balances online, and there&#8217;s an NFC component allowing touchless and smartphone transactions.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a tradeoff to the consumer. This is a credit card and not a debit card. The card carries an interest rate and charges fees. I asked CEO Tsang and COO Debra Wholrab about the costs. Both declined to give specifics, saying instead the card will have competitive rates and fees.</p>
<p>For the retailer, SuperNet offers a novel solution. SuperNet provides a credit card processing service and a loyalty program &#8212; both provide the retailer additional information about their customer base. There&#8217;s an opportunity for store-branded credit cards, too. For instance, Harborside could offer its customers a Harborside credit card.</p>
<p>SuperNet sees a future where consumers use a SuperNet card just like a Discover or American Express. To do so, the company needs to sell consumers and retailers the product, and the company is starting with the cannabis industry primarily because of a desperate need. But don&#8217;t call SuperNet a cannabis company.</p>
<p>COO Wholrab stressed SuperNet is not a cannabis company. The goal is to create a new credit service, she said, and not one just for the cannabis industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want people to think we&#8217;re a cannabis company,&#8221; said Wholrab. &#8220;We&#8217;re not. We&#8217;re a fintech company that&#8217;s servicing the cannabis industry as part of our strategy. That&#8217;s our goal. [Cannabis] was not my goal when I decided to help out Michael.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re bigger than a cannabis provider,&#8221; Wholrab continued, &#8220;because we&#8217;re building a basic payments system. It&#8217;s not just for cannabis. Our first product is for cannabis. What we&#8217;re building can be used in normal credit card or debit card processing. It can be used to build networks and support the payment industry in general.&#8221;</p>
<p>SuperNet is launching its first credit card in January 2022 and is signing up California retailers now. The company is looking to work with different financial outlets, too. Tsang explained that SuperNet is looking to use its rails to power other payments from other financial providers.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Wednesday episode when we niche down to a single topic, looking to expand our understanding of one particular technology trend or another. Today? We discussed if the era of founder-led companies is coming to a close, and if we have reached the peak of founder friendliness.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240895" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The decision to abdicate the CEO role by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey got us onto the topic. You can read our first take on the matter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/3-views-on-jack-dorseys-decision-to-step-down-as-twitters-ceo/">here,</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-dorsey-twitter-and-we-have-thoughts/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">listen to us</a> geek out about it on an earlier Twitter Spaces.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> decided that they didn&#8217;t want to walk alone, so we got Floodgate&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/donutsdidthis">Iris Choi</a> back on the show, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/fractional-lands-5-5-million-to-let-friends-and-strangers-invest-in-real-estate-together/">recently venture-backed</a> Fractional founder <a href="https://twitter.com/hellastellah">Stella Han</a> to help us dig through the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choi doesn&#8217;t see a rapid change in the current market dynamic that has led to increased founder influence, and therefore control. Even more, she noted that as the public markets are willing to accept founder-friendly mechanics like dual-class shares, there&#8217;s even less incentive to shake up the current dynamic.</li>
<li>Han, meanwhile, spoke to the evolution of a founder&#8217;s role over the lifetime of her company &#8211; as well as how she tries to build in decentralized authority (as the central source of authority)</li>
<li>We end with the importance of being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/20/name-your-job-title-before-you-name-your-startup/">explicit about different roles,</a> and how they are subject to change as a company hits different scale milestones.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China has attracted yet another e-commerce roll-up to enter its gargantuan e-commerce market. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/markai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markai</a>, founded by two Stanford business school grads, has joined the fray to buy out Chinese brands seeking global consumers.</p>
<p>So-called brand roll-ups, or e-commerce aggregators, have cropped up in Europe and the U.S. over the past few years. Usually venture-backed, they acquire small e-commerce sellers and try to scale them with a greater pool of capital, supply chain resources, and operational know-how. China not only has a long history of export manufacturing but is also home to most of the world&#8217;s Amazon sellers. Naturally, it&#8217;s the ideal sourcing destination for Markai and its like.</p>
<p>Other brand aggregators that have recently landed in China include Boston-based Thrasio as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/berlin-brands-group-enter-china-roll-up-amazon-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> and Razor, which are both from Germany.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233892" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>China is just Markai&#8217;s starting point, as the startup plans to hunt down brands from all across Asia and bring them to a global audience.</p>
<p>To fund its acquisition activities, Markai recently closed a $4 million seed round led by Pear VC, an early investor in DoorDash and Gusto. The company also raised several millions of dollars in debt but declined to disclose the amount.</p>
<p>Another notable seed investor in Markai&#8217;s seed round is Sea Capital, the new venture investment arm of Southeast Asia&#8217;s internet conglomerate Sea Group. Sea is the parent company of household names in the region, including e-commerce site Shopee and online games company Garena.</p>
<p>Signia Venture Partners, Western Technology Investment, Graph Ventures and other &#8220;prominent&#8221; angels across the U.S. and Asia also participated in the round, said Markai.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Markai&#8217;s co-founders Chenyu Ren and Tim Spencer, who were roommates at Stanford, both hailed from the corporate world. But their real passion, they told TechCrunch via a video chat, is &#8220;empowering small and medium businesses in emerging markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ren&#8217;s sense of mission to empower the underdogs is rooted in his childhood during which he saw his father, a small business owner, struggled to secure financing in China. Spencer&#8217;s drive, on the other hand, came from his privilege. Thanks to his parents&#8217; work in the airline industry, Spencer traveled extensively early on but was reminded by his parents &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">one’s opportunities in life are primarily a function of the circumstances of </span>one’s birth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to help the small guys go against the big guys,&#8221; said Spencer. &#8220;We are taking the scrappiest sellers in China and giving them the best Silicon Valley tech.&#8221;</p>
<h2>E-commerce makeover</h2>
<p>For years, Chinese merchants on Amazon were doing fine with their old formula. A small team of SEO experts and supply chain old-hands, steered by a well-connected boss, could rake in millions of dollars in monthly sales. But Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/">recent crackdown on blackhat tactics</a> like fake reviews led to the purging of hundreds of Chinese sellers. The ones who survive sense an urgency to reform and play by Amazon&#8217;s ever-tightening rules.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="500inLhMHr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/">Prime today, gone tomorrow: Chinese products get pulled from Amazon</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Prime today, gone tomorrow: Chinese products get pulled from Amazon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/embed/#?secret=500inLhMHr" data-secret="500inLhMHr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Many sellers feel that they can no longer compete on price; branding and operational efficiency are increasingly important to long-term success. They realize these are gaps that Western brand aggregators with a focus on data and methodologies could fill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sellers in the U.S. and China have the exact opposite problems,&#8221; Spencer suggested. &#8220;U.S. brands often have great brands and reviews but they don&#8217;t know what they are doing on the supply chain side. That&#8217;s why aggregators have value for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese sellers are great at supply chains and pricing but not so in marketing and branding, so we are coming in to clean things up,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Markai believes its roll-up approach in China is unique. Besides deal-sourcing employees, it has also hired a supply chain crew in China led by Ren. Having an on-the-ground team that can knock on factory doors is critical in an industry built on trust and relationships, said Ren, who grew up in a small manufacturing compound in central China.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Spencer spearheads a data team that analyzes marketplaces as well as direct-to-consumer brands. That consumer insight, in turn, will determine what its factory partners make in China and what channels to sell on.</p>
<p>Like many e-commerce operators these days, Markai looks to Shein for inspiration.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/why-amazon-should-pay-attention-to-shein/"> The rising fast-fashion brand</a> has impressed the retail industry with its demand-based model. With large swathes of real-time consumer data, Shein is able to forecast demand; thanks to its network of small and nimble suppliers in southern China, it can churn out new products faster than Zara.</p>
<p>Markai declined to share its acquisition progress in China. It has a team of ten now and aims to reach fifteen by next February. Despite the rush of foreign brand aggregators into China, the founders believe there&#8217;s ample room for multiple players.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the brands we met in China don&#8217;t even know selling their business is an option,&#8221; said Spencer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.goalsetter.co/">Goalsetter</a>, a financial education platform for kiddos, has announced the close of a $15 million Series A financing round. The funding was led by <a href="https://www.seaeventures.com/">Seae Ventures</a>, with participation from <a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en.html">Fiserv</a>, <a href="https://www.massmutual.com/">Mass Mutual</a>, <a href="https://www.citizensbank.com/HomePage.aspx">Citizens Financial Group</a>, <a href="https://www.astia.org/">Astia Fund</a>, NBA stars Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony, and actors Anthony Anderson and Lance Gross.</p>
<p>The startup was founded by Tanya Van Court who had her own struggles with financial literacy after losing more than $1 million in stock during the bubble burst of 2001. After having children, and working for Nickelodeon, Discovery Education and ESPN, she realized there was a huge gap in the market when it comes to how we talk to kids about money.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s app allows kids to get allowance or monetary gifts from friends, parents, and relatives, or spend money through a Goalsetter debit card. However, what makes Goalsetter different is that kids can only &#8216;unlock&#8217; those funds by taking fun financial literacy quizzes, with the difficulty of questions tailored to the kid&#8217;s age. The platform even recently introduced a feature called Goalsetter Invest, which allows users to buy and sell stocks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241443" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Series A financing is important in that it marks the company&#8217;s entrance into the B2B market. Thus far, Goalsetter has been focused on attracting parents and their kids to the app through the traditional B2C channels and word of mouth.</p>
<p>With Fiserv on the cap table, Goalsetter has forged a partnership with the skeletal system of finance to sell a white labeled version of Goalsetter to other financial institutions like banks.</p>
<p>The idea here is that traditional banks may very well fall behind their newer competitors like the smart card services and neobanks. Goalsetter can provide the platform, fully baked, that can help families set up a first savings account, investment account, and help with financial education for their kids.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="m4ehCw1MvI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/goalsetter-raises-3-9-million-to-teach-financial-literacy-to-kids/">Goalsetter raises $3.9 million to teach financial literacy to kids</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Goalsetter raises $3.9 million to teach financial literacy to kids&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/goalsetter-raises-3-9-million-to-teach-financial-literacy-to-kids/embed/#?secret=m4ehCw1MvI" data-secret="m4ehCw1MvI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Van Court explained that the decision to move into B2B literally came to her in the middle of the night. She sat up board straight and realized she&#8217;d &#8216;seen this movie before.&#8217;</p>
<p>She described how the cable industry was weakened by the younger generation who left their parents house and decided all they needed was the streaming services they were used to, and weren&#8217;t interested in paying a $200 cable bill. She realized the same would happen with fintech, where kids would sign up with a neobank or a new debit card and stay with it for their whole lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just like, &#8216;wow, these kids growing up in this new fintech world are never going back to the big banks&#8217;,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The only way the big banks are not going to be disintermediated is if they white label a product like Goalsetter that has a super high NPS that reaches every age kid out there. It reaches the entire family and they get to them before everyone else gets to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>You ever wonder why Coca-Cola uses animated polar bears in their advertisements? Same reason. Get &#8217;em while they&#8217;re young.</p>
<p>Alongside partnering with Fiserv and, hopefully for Goalsetter, the financial institutions that Fiserv powers, the platform is also looking to partner with large employers to offer Goalsetter as a benefit to employees.</p>
<p>Van Court has talked with TechCrunch numerous times about the challenges she has faced as a Black female founder, watching competitors led by white men get funded more and more often than her. (<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tanya-van-court-goalsetter/id1561051074?i=1000537516498">You can catch this episode of the Found podcast to hear more on that</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We needed to find our own lane, and a lane that we could own, and a lane that we could own quickly,&#8221; she said, explaining the decision to start working with banks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banking is in trouble if they don&#8217;t have their own kids fintech product,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;I can either go it alone and fight against this wave of people who are getting funded more than I&#8217;m going to get funded. Or I can come over here and partner with the banks and financial institutions who really need a great product and can use that product to help them both grow their next generation of customers but continue to be a force in the neighborhoods that they&#8217;re a force in.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let’s be honest: the e-reader market isn’t what it used to be. Amazon has long dominated the market, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/review-kobos-sage-and-libra-2-e-readers-improve-displays-but-compromise-on-design/">Kobo is still doing its thing</a> &#8212; but even then, it always feels like an unexpected surprise when a new device arrives from either. Market forces aren&#8217;t exactly driving mind-blowing innovation here.</p>
<p>Barnes &amp; Noble is still plugging away, too, turns out. In fact, the company just revealed its second Nook device this year. Joining the <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/nook-10-hd-tablet-designed-with-lenovo-barnes-noble/1139012795?ean=9780594080503">10-inch Lenovo-designed table</a>t is the followup to 2017’s GlowLight 3.</p>
<p>A little over a month after Amazon added a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-review/">long-awaited USB-C port to the Paperwhite</a>, Barnes &amp; Noble is doing the same with<a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/nook-glowlight-4-barnes-noble/1140326110?ean=9780594149293"> the GlowLight 4</a>, while quadrupling the built-in storage from 8- to 32GB.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241489" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The physical page turn buttons are still intact, though they appear streamlined a bit, now flush with the soft touch casing. Overall, the design is smaller and lighter than its predecessor, though the company’s not going into a lot of detail here, ahead of next week’s availability. The screen is 6 inches, at 300 DPI – same as its predecessor. Ditto for the battery, which is rated at one month.</p>
<p>Nothing particularly exciting on the face of it, beyond the fact that B&amp;N continues plugging away – which is certainly a win for those understandably looking for an alternative to Amazon.</p>
<p>The company’s CEO also sounds oddly invigorated by the whole thing, noting in a release, &#8220;Barnes &amp; Noble is now investing significantly in our NOOK line of products. The GlowLight 4 is the second NOOK device to launch this year as we set about to bring a new family of devices to our customers and to reinvigorate NOOK in the coming months and years. The team is working steadfastly to develop new NOOK products, and we are delighted to see such a strong pipeline of innovation into 2022.”</p>
<p>So, there you go. 2022 is the year of the Nook. You heard it here first. Meantime, the GlowLight 4 launches December 8, priced at $150 – that’s $20 more than the Lenovo tablet. There are also some $20 cases. Will all of the reading everyone insisted they were doing during the pandemic reinvigorate the e-reader market? Probably not. But Barnes &amp; Noble says it&#8217;s raring to go.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

The other is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">Ant&#8217;s IPO that never happened</a>, pulled in the wake of criticisms of the Chinese government&#8217;s handling of newer technologies by the previously prominent Alibaba founder Jack Ma.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a busy year for changes to how the autocratic Chinese government handles its economy. From a larger crackdown on technology firms to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/china-restricts-kids-online-gaming-to-three-hours-a-week/">new rules regarding youth video game playing</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">shellacking of the for-profit edtech sector</a>, and changes to how fintech can operate, watching China from a tech perspective this year has proved hectic.</p>

But legal group Winston &amp; Strawn has a <a href="https://www.winston.com/en/blogs-and-podcasts/notes-from-the-china-desk/understanding-chinas-variable-interest-entities.html">good summary</a> of why they matter, which will do for our purposes. Per the law firm, VIEs are &#8220;commonly used in China to allow foreign investors to participate in industries that are explicitly or practically restricted from foreign investment.&#8221;</p>
<p>VIEs don&#8217;t grant ownership of the underlying asset as we might normally understand it. Instead, they can help get around Chinese laws concerning foreign ownership of companies in select industries. How do they do that? By using an offshore company setup to collect &#8220;a claim on the profits and control of the assets that belong&#8221; to the actual company in China, <a href="https://gci-investors.com/chinese-vie-structure-wall-street-continues-to-ignore-the-risks/">GCI Investors explains</a>. That&#8217;s where the <em>interest</em> part of VIE comes into play.</p>
<p>VIEs are how Tencent, Didi and others went public in the United States. Not by listing their main corporate bulk, but instead by dodging domestic rules, creating a puppet entity, and selling Americans stock in that corporate bridge. Not what you expected? Did you think that your Alibaba holding was in the actual company? Well, bad news.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The model was always risky as heck, but tolerated because folks wanted to buy shares of Alibaba, as well as the general risk-on climate of the last few years. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But now the Chinese Communist Party is considering doing away with the side-step of its own rules.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is today <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-next">introducing</a> new ways for its creators to make money from their content. While already, the short-form video platform allowed creators to accept virtual gifts from fans during TikTok LIVE videos, a set of new features will allow creators to accept payments and gifts when they&#8217;re not livestreaming through the addition of Tips and Video Gifts. These features are rolling out alongside a new &#8220;<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/creator-next/">Creator Next</a>&#8221; portal, which organizes all TikTok&#8217;s monetization opportunities in one place.</p>
<p>The company is additionally expanding access to its Creator Marketplace,<a href="https://adage.com/article/digital/tiktok-users-are-surprised-find-themselves-ads-app/2204996"> launched in 2019</a>, which helps brands connect with creators for sponsored content and recommendation videos. Now, TikTok creators with at least 10,000 followers will be able to sign up for the TikTok Creator Marketplace to collaborate with brands on various opportunities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the tipping and video gifting feature will allow creators to make money from their videos while offering a way for fans to show their support for their favorite creators in new ways. Combined, these features put TikTok in more direct competition with other social media platforms, like Instagram or YouTube, where creators have a variety of ways to generate revenue from their content.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241456" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/tiktok-is-testing-a-new-direct-tipping-feature-with-select-creators/">spotted testing</a> the new direct tipping feature last month, but had said at the time the feature was not yet broadly available. During the tests, creators had to have at least 100,000 followers and had to be in good standing with TikTok, according to screenshots of the feature in action. Once approved, creators were given a Tips button to add to their profiles to accept the direct payments.</p>
<p>Today, TikTok&#8217;s monetization features are being made more broadly available to creators in the U.S., U.K. Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. (Canada and Australia will gain access in the months ahead.) The Creator Next website explains that eligible creators must be 18 or older, and will need to meet minimum follower requirements which may vary depending on their region &#8212; currently, it&#8217;s still 100,000. They also must have at least 1,000 video views over the past 30 days and have at least 3 posts in the last 30 days. Their accounts must be at least 30 days old and in good standing with TikTok&#8217;s <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Guidelines</a> with no repeated rule violations.</p>
<p>TikTok says creators will receive 100% of the tips. Tippers pay a small processing fee to TikTok&#8217;s payment provider, Stripe, to cover service fees &#8212; but the company itself isn&#8217;t taking a slice of that revenue. (This way, the payments can also avoid the App Store&#8217;s in-app purchase fees).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Video Gifts are similar to LIVE Gifts, but allow creators to collect Diamonds (the virtual gift) on their short videos instead of only on their live broadcasts. However, LIVE Gifts only require creators to have 1,000 followers, while Video Gifts require 100,000 followers, like Tips.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Creator Next online portal also links creators to other monetization opportunities, including the Creator Marketplace and TikTok&#8217;s Creator Fund, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/"> pays creators directly</a> for popular content.</p>
<p>The new features come about as the race to capture creator talent is heating up among the top social platforms. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/youtubes-100-million-shorts-fund-to-challenge-tiktok-goes-live/">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/snapchat-revamps-creator-payouts-by-offering-chance-to-win-prizes-with-spotlight-challenges/">Snap</a> and even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/pinterest-announces-500k-creator-fund-creator-code-content-policy-moderation-tools-and-more/">Pinterest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/linkedin-is-launching-its-own-25m-fund-and-incubator-for-creators/">LinkedIn</a> are all now offering creator funds that dole out monetary awards to creators making popular content, in an effort to attract and retain creators on their respective platforms. Twitter has also been building out a creator platform with Super Follows, which offers subscription-based access to creators. Instagram has begun testing its own subscriptions as well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/instagrams-creator-subscriptions-nearing-launch-app-store-listing-reveals/">as of earlier this month</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://frontegg.com/">Frontegg</a>, a Tel Aviv-based startup that provides SaaS companies with the core user management tools they need to build their own services, today announced that it has raised a $25 million Series A funding round led by <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/">Insight Partners</a>. Existing investors <a href="https://www.pitango.com/">Pitango</a>, which led the company&#8217;s $5 million seed round, and <a href="https://www.globalfounderscapital.com/">Global Founders Capital</a> also participated in this round.</p>
<p>The service describes itself as &#8220;the modern user management platform for the product-led era.&#8221; While every online service needs these capabilities, they are obviously not a real differentiator for most businesses, but at the same time, they are also a hassle to build.</p>
<p>Current customers include Materialize, Pay.com, Medigate, Talon Cyber Security and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/hunters-brings-in-30m-series-c-to-grow-xdr-security-tech/">Hunters.AI</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241379" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Sagi Rodin noted, its service is able to provide customers with all of the day-one tools necessary to build their user management systems, including enterprise features like single sign-on, security policies and audit logs. But it also wants to do more than that.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241382" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/frontegg.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241382" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2241382" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/frontegg.png" alt="" width="1024" height="728" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/frontegg.png 1856w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/frontegg.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/frontegg.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/frontegg.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/frontegg.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/frontegg.png?resize=1536,1092 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/frontegg.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2241382" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Frontegg</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We aren’t stopping at solving day-one problems, but rather providing a solution that can help companies achieve full product maturity very fast,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A good example of that is our customer-facing admin portal that contains a rich set of self-serve capabilities that you can enable within your product with a toggle-in experience. In the past, it could take years to develop self-served user management. Now, with Frontegg, a single full-stack developer can make it happen within a few days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frontegg which was founded in 2019, says it will use the new funding to grow its overall engineering team as it looks to accelerate its platform development efforts to cover more use cases, as well as to build out its sales and marketing teams, especially in the United States. Rodin also noted that the company is looking to accelerate its marketplace and channel opportunities with the help of this new round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of this hiring is also one of Frontegg&#8217;s biggest challenges, Rodin said. That has always been a challenge for Israeli startups, but based on the conversations I&#8217;m having with Israeli founders, it is only getting harder as an ever-growing pool of startups and established players is vying for a relatively small pool of candidates.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the product-led era, the ever-evolving demands of users and their expectations for a whole set of self-served capabilities within apps are resulting in a continuous drain on engineering resources,&#8221; said Praveen Akkiraju, Managing Director at Insight Partners. &#8220;The Frontegg team has built a unique solution that handles the heavy lifting of User Management, allowing teams to remain laser-focused on their core product and mission.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK equity crowdfunding business Seedrs &#8211; who’s merger with rival Crowdcube was earlier blocked by competition regulators &#8211; has been acquired by start-up investing platform Republic in a $100m deal.The move comes after Seedrs criticised the the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority earlier this year as stifling the UK’s potential to boost startups.</p>
<p>Seedrs was the first ever regulated equity crowdfunding business in the world and has pushed £1.5bn of investment through the platform during its history, even acting as retail investment platform for digital bank Revolut, now a unicorn. The platform was also the first to introduce a secondary marketplace.</p>
<p>Republic is a leading US fintech company that allows people to invest in private market equity, debt or crypto offerings and has almost one ($1) billion dollars under management through its private asset management practice.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241470" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Prior to this deal, Republic and Seedrs had a longstanding partnership where Seedrs advised Republic’s leadership team.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Seedrs follows Republic&#8217;s recent $150M Series B financing announcement, led by Valor Equity Partners. </p>
<p>Seedrs Cofounder and now chairman Jeff Lynn will continue in his role at Seedrs, and will shepherd Republic’s European expansion, which will now be in a position to take advantage of new EU legislation that has harmonised crowdfunding rules in the bloc.</p>
<p>Speaking to the FT, Lynn said the new rules “created a true European harmonised regulatory regime, where none existed before,” adding that “the regulatory fragmentation has made it nearly impossible to build platforms of scale — this [reform] gives platforms access to 27 different countries, all under a single regulatory regime.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>US investment firm Davidson Kempner will buy now take the stakes previously owned Seedrs shareholders, mostly for cash. Seedrs also has almost 5,000 smaller investors, including tennis player Andy Murray.</p>
<p>Republic said it will commit additional capital toward expanding Seedrs in Europe “to help deliver new innovations and products for European investors and private businesses.” </p>
<p>Kendrick Nguyen, Republic’s founder, said: “We knew international expansion was necessary to achieve cross-bordered participation. In working with Seedrs, we have admired their technological capabilities, the strength of their team and their strong presence in the UK and soon Europe. We anticipate further developing the strengths of both companies from retail, secondaries, crypto, and communities to create a clear industry leader.”</p>
<p>As part of the new structure, Seedrs CEO Jeff Kelisky will join Republic’s leadership team and continue as Seedrs chief executive.</p>
<p>He commented: “Seedrs’ ambition has always been to build a global private equity marketplace. This transaction is a natural development of our partnership with Republic to achieve and go beyond that ambition. We share a similar culture, a common goal, and a commitment to the strategic opportunities that lie ahead.”</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to approval by the Financial Conduct Authority and Seedrs shareholders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies look for ways to prevent cyber attacks, one strategy is to be proactive and find vulnerabilities that could lead to a breach in an approach called &#8220;attack surface management.&#8221; A number of companies have taken this approach, and one, <a href="https://www.cycognito.com/">CyCognito</a>, announced a $100 million Series C today on an $800 million valuation.</p>
<p>The Westly Group led the round with participation from new investors Thomvest Ventures and The Heritage Group along with existing investors Accel, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sorenson Ventures and UpWest. Today&#8217;s investment brings the total raised since inception to $153 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>Like any attack surface management company, CyCognito is looking at the range of assets a company has and looking for gaps in security, but CEO and co-founder Rob Gurzeev claims that the comprehensiveness of his company&#8217;s approach is what differentiates it from the pack.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241444" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are leveraging machine learning-based, attack surface management to understand what&#8217;s out there. And we&#8217;re the first company to automate security testing at the scale of millions of assets,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Gurzeev says that using this approach, the company has grown revenue over 400x in the last year, although he didn&#8217;t get specific about the revenue number.  Neither did he want to discuss specific customer numbers, but he did say they had dozens of Fortune 500 customers including Colgate-Palmolive, Scientific Games and Tesco.</p>
<p>As for employees, the startup began the year with 85 and is expected to finish up with more than 140 with the goal of reaching around 230 by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Gurzeev says that diversity is essential in the security business, and he is working to build a diverse team. &#8220;We strongly believe that our customers&#8217; adversaries, and the general challenge in this space is very diverse, and also building a company is a very diverse and multifaceted challenge. So we strongly believe that diversity in a deep sense is [extremely] important in terms of backgrounds, experience, gender, political perspective and other elements,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far that has translated into about one third of the engineering team being women and several executive-level posts being held by women, he said, and that helps attract other women to the company. What&#8217;s more, these women are participating in efforts to bring more women and other underrepresented groups into security, which in turn builds a bigger pool of potentially diverse employees.</p>
<p>Gurzeev says that companies have looked into buying his company at various points, but he and his co-founders have rebuffed these attempts to this point, believing they have the potential to build a substantial stand-alone company.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been inbound inquiries from very relevant acquirers and smart companies and we decided strategically that we&#8217;re not looking into it because we believe we have [a substantial] opportunity and we should be the ones that are trying to build [this into] a significant company.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify&#8217;s anticipated year-end retrospective, Spotify Wrapped, is <a href="http://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-wrapped/">rolling out</a> today to consumers, artists and podcast creators. The experience offers Spotify users a look back at their year on Spotify, highlighting listening trends across both music and podcasts. Artists and creators, meanwhile, can check in on all the ways their fans listened. This year, Wrapped has undergone a few changes. This includes the addition of new features like Wrapped Blend, which lets you compare your Wrapped with a friend&#8217;s, plus support for TikTok sharing, a new in-app Wrapped game, video messages from artists to fans, and more.</p>
<p>Spotify will also bring its live audio chatroom app, Spotify Greenroom, into the Wrapped experience this year with live shows from select artists.</p>
<p>Typically, Spotify Wrapped offers a look back at your top songs, artists, podcasts, and other listening trends from over the past year. But this time around, Spotify will present some of Wrapped&#8217;s data as cinematic snapshots &#8212; that is, you&#8217;ll be presented with &#8220;2021: The Movie,&#8221; which pairs your recognizable songs against key moments and scenes from a movie, such as the opening credits, a fight scene, an intense montage, a face-off with a rival dance crew, and others.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240858" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2240956" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The company is also this year giving a nod to TikTok which has been influencing Spotify&#8217;s top charts as the video app&#8217;s favorite memes get set to popular tunes, which in turn drive plays on music services. Wrapped includes references to various TikTok memes, like &#8220;Bones Day&#8221; or &#8220;Good Soup,&#8221; which have crossed the line from being a TikTok trend to being more a part of pop culture. And, for the first time, Spotify users can share their Wrapped cards to TikTok, in addition to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240954" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240954" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2240954" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Spotify_2021Wrapped_Bone.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Spotify_2021Wrapped_Bone.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Spotify_2021Wrapped_Bone.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Spotify_2021Wrapped_Bone.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Spotify_2021Wrapped_Bone.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Spotify_2021Wrapped_Bone.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Spotify_2021Wrapped_Bone.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240954" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Another new feature is Wrapped Blend, which builds on Spotify&#8217;s existing playlist matching feature Blend, to allow users to compare their Wrapped with a friend&#8217;s to see how their taste matches up. They can then stream their Wrapped Blend or share the results on social media.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s also a new story called the Audio Aura, which provides a genreless perspective on your year. Your top two &#8220;moods,&#8221; based on your listening behavior, will be represented visually.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240955" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240955" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2240955" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240955" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>An in-app game, based on the popular game Two Truths and a Lie, is another new addition. Users can play and then share with friends several statements about their listening during the past year, and you&#8217;ll have to guess which ones are true. This interactive format could produce more social sharing and engagement, as it invites friends to play along too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240958" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240958" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2240958" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240958" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Another feature takes a cue from celeb social apps like Cameo to present users with videos from their favorite artists and creators. Spotify worked with over 170 artists and creators who filmed short videos thanking fans for including them in their year&#8217;s listening and having them on their Wrapped. If any of the participating artists or podcast hosts appear on your Wrapped, you&#8217;ll get to see the videos.</p>
<p>A smaller handful of podcasters and artists will be inviting some of their most passionate fans to join them for exclusive Q&amp;A sessions in Spotify&#8217;s Greenroom live audio app, where they will talk about their own Wrapped results among other things. Participants include Ivy Le, JESSIA, Johnny Orlando, bbno$, DPR LIVE, Aurora + Sub Urban, Benito Skinner &amp; Mary Beth Barone, and Spotify’s Xavier “X” Jernigan. These Greenroom rooms, which will be an hour long, will be password-protected and a link will be emailed only to top fans. However, two of Spotify&#8217;s own shows, &#8220;Most Necessary Live&#8221; on December 7 at 9PM EST and &#8220;LOREM Life&#8221; on December 8 at 9PM EST, will host public Wrapped-themed episodes.</p>

<p>The official in-app Spotify Wrapped Hub will roll out starting today, featuring its typical lineup of year-end playlists and other features. This hub includes personalized playlists like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EUMDoJuT8yJsl?si=D3on4KsURlqf90DoHTcQ6g">Your Top Songs of 2021</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EV8C514UeJ38J?si=Al5rOe-OTjSyPevqwvLa8g">Your Artists Revealed</a>. It will also include the data-driven playlists featuring music from the top artists globally and in users&#8217; local markets, and the best new podcasts of 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240957" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240957" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2240957" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240957" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Creators and <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/wrapped-2021">artists</a> will also today gain access to their own microsites, where they can look back at their fans&#8217; journeys and view other relevant data.</p>
<p>Through Spotify&#8217;s recent Shopify integration, fans who are included in an artists&#8217; top fans list will be emailed a link to shop their merch over the next few weeks.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Convenience store giant 7-Eleven is pairing up with Nuro to pilot a commercial delivery service using autonomous vehicles in the Silicon Valley enclave of Mountain View, California.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Convenience store giant 7-Eleven is pairing up with Nuro to pilot a commercial delivery service using autonomous vehicles in the Silicon Valley enclave of Mountain View, California.</p>
<p>The service, which customers can access beginning December 1 through 7-Eleven&#8217;s 7NOW delivery app, will initially use Nuro&#8217;s self-driving Priuses. Eventually, the service will use Nuro&#8217;s R2 delivery vehicles, which were custom built to delivery only packages — not people.</p>
<p>7-Eleven has experimented with autonomous delivery in the past. In 2016, the company tested autonomous delivery in Reno, Nevada with drone company Flirtey. This month, the operator of 7-Eleven stores in Korea, began testing the use of sidewalk delivery robots developed by local startup Neubility in the southern district of Seoul.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The partnership with Nuro is designed as a commercial service, not a research and development project. However, a company spokesperson still described this as a pilot. This will be a commercial enterprise, but it will be a limited one, at least at first.</p>
<p>Nuro has been navigating the regulatory and technical roadmap to launch commercial operations, like so many others, for years. Nuro had signaled in December 2020 that it planned to start commercial delivery operations early this year after receiving the final necessary permit needed to operate commercial driverless services on public roads in California. It seems it was delayed and is now kicking off. Nuro was the first company to clear this regulatory hurdle after receiving a permit from the state&#8217;s Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p>Nuro didn&#8217;t name the intended commercial partner or city at the time. It makes sense that Nuro is choosing its home turf of Mountain View as its initial launch point.</p>
<p>Nuro has launched numerous other pilots outside of California, including with Kroger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/autonomous-delivery-startup-nuro-moves-into-logistics-with-fedex/">and FedEx</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SpIypxRGed"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec-1/">The Nuro EC-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Nuro EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec-1/embed/#?secret=SpIypxRGed" data-secret="SpIypxRGed" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nuro doesn&#8217;t have a specific timeline for when it will expand beyond Mountain View, or even the initial 7-Eleven store it is launching with. There are several stores in the town, but for now, customers will only be able to get their Slurpees and snacks delivered from the 7-Eleven located at 1905 Latham St., Mountain View. The intent is to expand to more zip codes in the future, a Nuro spokesperson said in a email to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Nuro didn&#8217;t share when it would switch to its R2 bot either, but that is the eventual goal. A spokesperson said Nuro and 7-Eleven will make the joint decision to introduce R2 into the delivery fleet as soon as possible.</p>
<p>For now, customers will be able to order their drinks and snacks via the 7NOW app and have it delivered in Mountain View by a Nuro autonomous vehicle between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. PT at no additional charge. The app will send updates as the order is processed, similar to how other delivery apps work today. The companies said the orders will arrive in about 30 minutes. Age-restricted items such as alcohol, tobacco and lottery tickets will not be available via autonomous vehicle delivery.</p>
<p>The partnership just a few weeks since Nuro announced it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/nuro-lands-investment-from-google-tiger-global-in-new-600-million-round/">raised $600 million</a> in a fundraising round led by new investor Tiger Global Management. The company said the capital would be used to ramp up commercial operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://1inch.io">1inch</a>, a popular aggregator of decentralized protocols, has <a href="https://blog.1inch.io/the-1inch-network-closes-a-175-mln-series-b-round-e22d572754ae">raised</a> $175 million in what it calls a Series B funding round. It isn’t a traditional venture round as the company isn’t selling a stake in exchange for money. Instead, 1inch has sold $175 million worth of 1INCH tokens in a private token sales with institutional investors.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with 1inch, it’s one of the most popular DeFi (decentralized finance) protocol out there as it makes decentralized transactions more efficient. If you want to exchange cryptocurrencies, there are multiple ways to do so.</p>
<p>Historically, exchanges have been a centralized activity. Some hosted exchanges, such as Coinbase, FTX, Kraken and Binance, have thrived by managing trades between multiple assets. And yet, blockchains are supposed to be decentralized. These exchanges create a single point of failure.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241433" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“I definitely hope centralized exchanges go burn in hell as much as possible,” Vitalik Buterin said in a TechCrunch interview back <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/06/vitalik-buterin-i-definitely-hope-centralized-exchanges-go-burn-in-hell-as-much-as-possible/">in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, many teams started working on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/">decentralized exchanges</a> across different blockchains. For instance, on the Ethereum blockchain alone, people trade tokens using Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc. Thanks to liquidity pools, traders can exchange tokens directly on the blockchain.</p>
<p>The 1inch Network aggregates <a href="https://1inch.io/aggregation-protocol/">dozens</a> of decentralized protocols so that traders can easily find the best exchange rate across multiple decentralized exchanges. 1inch competes with <a href="https://matcha.xyz">Matcha</a> (0x) and <a href="https://paraswap.io/#/?network=ethereum">ParaSwap</a>.</p>
<p>Based on this <a href="https://dune.xyz/queries/135826/267522">Dune query</a>, 1inch is approaching 1 million users on Ethereum — 195,000 users have interacted with 1inch <a href="https://dune.xyz/queries/225727">over the past 30 days</a>. And over the last two years, users have traded more than $100 billion in crypto assets using 1inch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>1inch has been transparent with me about the structure of the round. The 1inch foundation is in charge of the 1INCH token supply. This foundation has allocated a portion of the token supply to 1inch Limited for a Growth &amp; Development Fund. Overall, that fund represents 14% of the total 1INCH token supply and 1inch Limited has used 8% of the supply for the Series B.</p>
<p>As part of today’s Series B, new investors are acquiring tokens from the Growth &amp; Development Fund as well as from existing investors who want to sell a portion of their investments. The Series B round was led by <a href="https://www.ambergroup.io">Amber Group</a> with around 50 investors participating. Some investors include Jane Street, VanEck, Fenbushi Capital, Alameda Research, Celsius, Nexo, Tribe Capital and Gemini Frontier Fund.</p>
<p>And 1inch will certainly need some money as it has run into regulatory issues. In September, 1inch started <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/119055/dex-aggregator-1inch-blocks-out-us-trades-in-preparation-for-separate-american-platform">blocking U.S. IP addresses</a> from using the app. “The geoblocking restrictions are working very effectively by restricting U.S. territories,” the company told me. That move comes just a few months after Uniswap <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/112399/uniswap-labs-culls-synthetic-stock-and-derivatives-citing-evolving-regulatory-landscape">restricted access</a> to some tokens in the U.S.</p>
<p>1inch now plans to launch 1inch Pro, a separate and permissioned service that complies with U.S. regulation. In particular, 1inch says this new service will comply KYC and AML regulation (‘know your customer’ and ’anti-money laundering’).</p>
<p>1inch and 1inch Pro will never interact with each other, meaning that liquidity pools will be segregated. 1inch Limited will provide liquidity itself for 1inch Pro. With 1inch Pro, the company wants to convince institutional investors to use its new service. As for the rest of the world, they can still use the 1inch Network.</p>
<p>For now, there’s no release date for 1inch Pro. “We&#8217;re in the process of working out the regulatory landscape through a couple of law firms,” the company told me. But it could take a while as there’s a lot of uncertainty around DeFi regulation in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We spend such a tremendous amount of our resources growing, processing, transporting and selling food items. In a world where not everyone has enough to eat, it&#8217;s a disgrace that in the US, 30%-40% of food that is produced is never consumed. That&#8217;s the problem <a href="https://www.spoileralert.com/">Spoiler Alert</a> has set its crosshairs on. The company just raised $11 million to really start scaling its operations and save more food from meeting an end more bitter than a karela jilted at the altar.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we look at food waste, it&#8217;s not just a major drain on business profitability, but it&#8217;s also one of the largest contributors to the climate crisis at a global level. What our vision and hypothesis from the very beginning has been, is &#8216;how do we better provide major food manufacturers with the tools, intelligence insights and network connectivity to keep good product from going to waste?,'&#8221; explains Spoiler Alert co-founder and CEO Richard Ashenfelter. &#8220;We are getting that to as many consumers as possible, prior to resorting to dumping or organics recycling.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Spoiler Alert platform is in use by a growing list of global consumer packaged goods (CPG) leaders to digitize their B2B liquidation processes. Customers include Nestlé, Kraft Heinz, Campbell Soup Company and Danone North America — four of the largest food and beverage manufacturers in the world.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240824" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of our core beliefs is that waste is no longer a necessary or acceptable cost of doing business,&#8221; said Spoiler Alert co-founder and CPO Emily Malina. &#8220;Everything we do is geared toward moving perishable inventory faster to benefit brands, retailers, consumers and the planet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Roughly 30% to 40% of the world&#8217;s food supply is never ultimately consumed. <a href="https://drawdown.org/">Project Drawdown</a> has since identified food waste as the number one initiative and opportunity for addressing the global climate crisis,&#8221; says Ashenfelter and explains how that has become part of the company&#8217;s mission. &#8220;For us, the more food we can keep out of landfills, the less emissions and resource resources that go into growing, harvesting, distributing that product, the better. It ultimately has a financial benefit for businesses, too, because they&#8217;re selling more product, they&#8217;re writing off less product, they&#8217;re not spending money on disposal fees.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240878" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Liz-Linder-Photography.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240878" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2240878" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Liz-Linder-Photography.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Liz-Linder-Photography.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Liz-Linder-Photography.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Liz-Linder-Photography.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Liz-Linder-Photography.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Liz-Linder-Photography.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Liz-Linder-Photography.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2240878" class="wp-caption-text">Ricky Ashenfelter and Emily Malina, the Spoiler Alert founding team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.lizlinder.com/">Liz Linder Photography</a></p></div></p>
<p>Brands use Spoiler Alert&#8217;s flexible and private liquidation platform to seamlessly sell their excess, short-dated and obsolete inventory. This results in increased profitability for brands and a stronger supply of opportunistic inventory for retailers and other closeout channels. And not a minute too late, either. What&#8217;s particularly encouraging about Spoiler Alert is that the company is operating within the confines of capitalism to try to put a dent in this issue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;My father was an environmental lawyer, and I&#8217;ve dedicated my entire academic pursuits to how the private sector can solve some of the world&#8217;s biggest energy and environmental challenges,&#8221; says Ashenfelter. &#8220;I&#8217;m sort of a tree hugger, born and raised, trying to wear more of a commercial hat. All of this is providing easy, tangible solutions for businesses and consumers to do the right thing for the environment. We feel strongly that the best approaches to sustainable climate focus investments have to be rooted in a true business case in order for them to scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>This investment is led by <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/">Collaborative Fund</a> with participation from existing investors, including <a href="https://acre.vc/">Acre Venture Partners</a>, <a href="https://www.bjfff.org/">The Betsy &amp; Jesse Fink Family Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.maersk.com/growth">Maersk Growth</a>, <a href="https://www.thespringpoint.com/">Spring Point Partners</a> and <a href="http://www.valleyoakinvestments.com/">Valley Oak Investments</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The acquisition is in line with Bitly’s goal of becoming a global SaaS company that enables organizations to engage with customers and for people to connect with digital experiences.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Link management company <a href="https://bitly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitly</a> announced Wednesday its acquisition of Germany-based QR code company Egoditor GmbH whose flagship product is the <a href="https://www.qr-code-generator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QR Code Generator</a>.</p>
<p>Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but Toby Gabriner, CEO of Bitly, disclosed that it was a cash-and-stock deal that, when completed, will result in a combined company that has over 325,000 paying customers, more than 5 million active users, 180 employees and over $75 million in annual recurring revenue.</p>
<p>The acquisition, the company’s first, is in line with Bitly’s goal of becoming a global SaaS company that enables organizations to engage with customers and for people to connect with digital experiences.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241142" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With the acquisition, the company also debuted its Customer Connections platform, an all-in-one link management, QR code and link-in-bio resource. A big focus for Bitly over the past few years was evolving from link shortening into multiple tools.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241155" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241155" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2241155" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png" alt="Toby Gabriner, Bitly" width="480" height="480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241155" class="wp-caption-text">Toby Gabriner, CEO of Bitly. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bitly</p></div></p>
<p>As the company pondered building its own QR code software versus buying, Egoditor lept to the top of the list, not only for being a leader in QR codes for over a decade, but among other things, having shared customers and other functionalities that made the coming together of the two companies a natural fit, Gabriner added.</p>
<p>“As we saw the market evolving, we saw those as a natural evolution for Bitly and started down that path,” he said. “We launched a QR code offering and saw a sizable amount of adoption from customers — further conviction that they wanted it.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Egoditor, headquartered in Bielefeld, Germany, provides end-to-end tools for the design, delivery, management and analytics of QR codes. It was founded in 2009 by Nils Engelking and Nils Drescher and serves over 10 million users in more than 190 countries, including clients like Starbucks, Zalando and Salvation Army.</p>
<p>The QR code itself is not new, having been around since the 1990s, with attempts by Snap and others to “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/04/snapcode/">make it cool</a>” in recent years after people didn’t want to download QR code reader apps. Gabriner said it wasn’t until Google and Apple enabled phone cameras to scan the codes that it drove adoption again. And then came the pandemic.</p>
<p>“It created a situation where the focus became on touchless ways customers can interact with businesses, and what that has done is set off a behavior change,” he told TechCrunch. “Use cases have exploded, and not just in restaurants to access menus, but in everything from real estate to retailers, nonprofits and even dental offices. We are still in relatively early stages of use cases, and we see new ones each week.”</p>
<p>Bitly is in the process of integrating the Egoditor team, all of whom will be continuing, Gabriner said. In fact, he said the company is in the process of adding new employees — there are now over 50 open positions across the German and U.S. offices.</p>
<p>Overall, he considers this not only an acquisition, but a growth story of two companies “growing at a rapid clip,” and their combination acting as an accelerant. In the past 18 months, Bitly has grown over 170% in its customer base, and the link-in-bio feature is currently in private beta, launched a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>“We are very excited about the acquisition because it elevates the company to another level,” Gabriner added. “This is giving us a foundation to start offering new products and solutions, where we move from a single product to multiple products. We are firing on all cylinders and ready to add more fuel to the growth story.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.costanoavc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costanoa Ventures</a> is seeing some of its best returns yet as it closed on two new funds, Costanoa Fund IV, a $225 million early-stage fund, and Opportunity Fund II, a $115 million funding investing in later rounds of portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Greg Sands started the firm in 2012 as a sole general partner and told TechCrunch that all the way back to the first fund, it invested in companies, like Intaact, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/sage-group-buys-intacct-accounting-software-for-850m/">acquired by Sage in 2017</a>, and Datalogix, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/22/oracle-continues-march-to-cloud-buying-data-as-a-service-broker-datalogix/">acquired by Oracle in 2014</a>, that established a pattern.</p>
<p>Each fund since then has been better than the one before it, he added. These latest funds bring the firm’s total commitments to date to over $900 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241056" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“It’s the opposite pattern from what happens,” Sands said. “Usually, your first or second funds are great small funds, but then you increase the fund size and never have the same returns.”</p>
<p>Costanoa invests in enterprise software at the seed and Series A levels, focusing on areas like applied AI, SaaS, fintech, security, DevOps and data infrastructure.</p>
<p>The firm was clear about its strategy, process and execution, which has enabled it to build a better team over time with a different set of strengths and diversity. Indeed, women now make up 60% of Costanoa’s team and almost 50% of its partners.</p>
<p>“Even the first handful of hires looked like me, but we have worked hard, and Martina (Lauchengco) and I are the champions of driving that, and why that is a big part of our firm getting better over time,” Sands added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over time, Costanoa’s strategy has included more earlier-stage investments, with as much as one-third going into companies at their formation or pre-seed stage. Some of that has targeted emerging markets and fintech and decentralized finance, and in companies where the first opportunity to invest might be the best one, Sands explained.</p>
<p>He expects Fund IV to go into 30 to 35 new companies, while the Opportunity Fund will be invested into 12 to 15 of its current portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Though the firm concentrates on early stage investments, having the option to make follow-on funding gives Costanoa the best of both worlds, Lauchengco said.</p>
<p>“That’s what it means to be a long-term partner,” she added. “Oftentimes in the early stage, we have the first check and then it’s off to the races, but this way, we can stay partnered with them.”</p>
<p>With Fund IV, Costanoa began making investments in Latin America and Africa and expanding its fintech practice to include cryptocurrency and web3-related companies. One of its first investments into Latin America was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/plug-raises-2-7m-to-make-payment-acceptance-in-brazil-less-terrible/">leading Plug Pagamentos’s seed round</a> in November.</p>
<p>Overall, the firm made 10 investments already from the fund, including co-leading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/highnote-emerges-from-stealth-with-54m-and-a-plan-to-take-on-marqeta-in-the-world-of-card-issuing-as-a-service/">Highnote’s $54 million Series A</a> and participating in Coiled’s $21 million Series A announced in May. It also saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/cdk-global-buys-vehicle-the-e-commerce-platform-roadster-for-360-million/">Roadster be acquired by CDK Global</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/cisco-strikes-again-grabbing-threat-assessment-tool-kenna-security-as-third-acquisition-this-week/">Kenna Security</a> exit to Cisco.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#8217;s just over a year since the European Union&#8217;s executive proposed legislation aimed at encouraging widespread sharing and reuse of industrial data and protected public sector data-sets &#8212; such as health data, environment, energy, agriculture, mobility, finance, manufacturing, public administration and skills.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/">over a year</a> since the European Union&#8217;s executive proposed legislation aimed at encouraging widespread sharing and reuse of industrial data and protected public sector data-sets &#8212; such as health data, environment, energy, agriculture, mobility, finance, manufacturing, public administration and skills.</p>
<p>Yesterday the bloc&#8217;s co-legislators reached agreement on the DGA after trilogue discussions &#8212; paving the way for formal adoption once the Council and Parliament vote to approval the final text.</p>
<p>The Data Governance Act (DGA) is intended to create a standardized framework of trusted tools and techniques to encourage data reuse &#8212; by setting “secure and privacy-compliant conditions” for sharing data, as the Commission presented it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241393" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The hope is also that legislation will lead to the creation of common data spaces across strategic domains to support R&amp;D.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xCzktAk2q8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/">Europe sets out the rules of the road for its data reuse plan</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe sets out the rules of the road for its data reuse plan&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/embed/#?secret=xCzktAk2q8" data-secret="xCzktAk2q8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Key components of the plan include the creation of a network of trusted and neutral data intermediaries; and an oversight regime to ensure conditions are being complied with &#8212; comprised of national monitoring authorities and a new advisory/steering body (aka, the European Data Innovation Board).</p>
<p>The legislation will also bring in international data transfer rules for non-personal data. (Such rules already exist &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/facebooks-lead-eu-privacy-supervisor-hit-with-corruption-complaint/">at least on paper</a> &#8212; covering the export of personal data from the EU under the General Data Protection Regulation.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Getting political agreement is typically the most challenging component of EU lawmaking.</p>
<p>Although the final text of the DGA will still need to be approved by the Council and Parliament before it&#8217;s formally adopted. (And, in terms of wider timeframe, the new rules will apply 15 months after the entry into force of the regulation &#8212; so likely not before 2023.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/11/30/promoting-data-sharing-presidency-reaches-deal-with-parliament-on-data-governance-act/">press release</a> on the provisional agreement, the Council of the EU said: &#8220;[N]egotiators from the Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement on a new law to promote the availability of data and build a trustworthy environment to facilitate its use for research and the creation of innovative new services and products.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The [DGA] will create a mechanism to enable the safe reuse of certain categories of public-sector data that are subject to the rights of others. This includes, for example, trade secrets, personal data and data protected by intellectual property rights. Public-sector bodies allowing this type of reuse will need to be properly equipped, in technical terms, to ensure that privacy and confidentiality are fully preserved,&#8221; the Council added.</p>
<p>An earlier Open Data Directive, from 2019, does not cover the data types being legislated for here.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers believe Europe has a major advantage in industrial data &#8212; and want the DGA to create conditions that will encourage widespread data sharing and reuse. (A Data Act is also incoming which will propose measures intended to encourage business-to-business data sharing and business-to-government data sharing.)</p>
<p>The Commission has also been pushing the notion of &#8220;data altruism&#8221; and data sharing for the common good, although the overarching goal for the DGA is to foster the development of regional AIs to stoke economic competitiveness and growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Businesses, both small and large, will benefit from new business opportunities as well as from a reduction in costs for acquiring, integrating and processing data, from lower barriers to enter markets, and from a reduction in time-to-market for novel products and services,&#8221; it suggests in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_20_2103">Q&amp;A</a> on the DGA.</p>
<p>At the same time the Commission has suggested that the creation of common European &#8220;data spaces&#8221; in sectors like manufacturing and health will help advance research &#8212; which could lead to cures for rare or chronic diseases or at least support evidence-based policymaking and foster other types of societally beneficial developments.</p>
<p>So the DGA co-mingles purely economic goals (via opening access to data) with broad-brush notions of &#8220;data altruism&#8221; and &#8220;data for society&#8221;.</p>
<p>This fuzziness has raised some watchful concern among civil society groups &#8212; such as the European Consumer Organisation BEUC, which has warned that &#8220;a weak definition of altruism in this agreement could allow companies to over-use vague, altruistic grounds to push consumers to share their data&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/gdpr-enforcement-must-level-up-to-catch-big-tech-report-warns/">Weak enforcement</a> of existing legal protections for EU citizens&#8217; data may also work against the sought for &#8216;trust to share&#8217; push.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Commenting in a statement on the trilogue agreement on the DGA yesterday, the Commission&#8217;s EVP for digital, Margrethe Vestager, avoiding citing any such concerns &#8212; merely offering a boosterish claim that: “This Regulation is a first building block for establishing a solid and fair data-driven economy.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;It is about setting up the right conditions for trustful data sharing in line with our European values and fundamental rights,&#8221; she went on, adding: &#8220;We are creating a safe environment in which data can be shared across sectors and Member States for the benefit of society and the economy.”</span></p>
<p>Internal Market commissioner, Thierry Breton, also stuck to the promotional script, saying the agreement on the DGA will allow the bloc to define &#8220;a common approach to data sharing&#8221;, and further suggesting: &#8220;We are facilitating the flow of growing industrial data across sectors and Member States to help Europe become the world&#8217;s number one data continent. We are doing so by building trust, putting the individuals and companies who generate data in the driving seat so they remain in control of the data they create. In a nutshell: an open yet sovereign European Single Market for data.”</p>
<p>In its PR, the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20211129IPR18316/data-governance-deal-on-new-rules-to-boost-data-sharing-across-the-eu">European Parliament</a> said MEPs secured tighter provisions on &#8220;trust and fair access&#8221; during the DGA negotiations &#8212; aimed at plugging loopholes in the legislation they said would have allowed operators from non-EU countries to abuse the scheme.</p>
<p>MEPs also focused on beefing up the role of the European Data Innovation Board &#8212; and on clarifying the scope of the legislation, saying they secured &#8220;precise requirements&#8221; on which services will fall under the new DGA.</p>
<p>Getting a better deal for SMEs and startups was another parliamentary priority, they said.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s been agreed?</h2>
<p>The trilogue agreement reached yesterday includes the possibility for exclusive arrangements for the reuse of public-sector data &#8212; which the Council said will be possible &#8220;when justified and necessary for the provision of a service of general interest&#8221;.</p>
<p>However the maximum duration for existing contracts will be 2.5 years and for new contracts 12 months &#8212; with MEPs writing that: &#8220;Public sector bodies will have to avoid creating exclusive rights for the re-use of certain data, and exclusive agreements should be limited&#8230; to make more data available to SMEs and start-ups.&#8221;</p>
<p>The co-legislators have also agreed that the Commission will set up a European single access point with a searchable electronic register of public-sector data &#8212; which will be made available via national single information points.</p>
<p>The EU is anticipating that the DGA will create a new business model for data intermediation services &#8212; to provide a secure environment in which companies or individuals can share data; and which will commit not to use the data for their own ends (but will be able to charge for the transactions they enable).</p>
<p>Such services must be listed in an EU register under the incoming rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;For companies, these services can take the form of digital platforms, which will support voluntary data-sharing between companies or facilitate the fulfilment of data-sharing obligations set by law. By using these services, companies will be able to share their data without fear of its being misused or of losing their competitive advantage,&#8221; the Council writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;For personal data, such services and their providers will help individuals exercise their rights under the [GDPR].  This will help people have full control over their data and allow them to share it with a company they trust. This can be done, for example, by means of novel personal information management tools, such as personal data spaces or data wallets, which are apps that share such data with others, based on the data holder’s consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>EU lawmakers are hoping that having dedicated rules to govern data-sharing will encourage both companies and individuals to make data available voluntarily &#8212; for altruistic purposes such as medical research projects.</p>
<p>The DGA will therefore create national registers of recognised &#8220;data altruism organisations&#8221; &#8212; aka entities seeking to collect data for objectives of general interest. Such entities must agree to comply with specific rules, and (once registered) will be recognised across the EU.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will create the necessary trust in data altruism, encouraging individuals and companies to donate data to such organisations so that it can used for wider societal good,&#8221; the Council suggests.</p>
<p>The DGA will establish a voluntary certification program &#8212; with a logo &#8212; to make it easier to identify compliant providers of data intermediation services and data altruism organisations.</p>
<p>When the Commission proposed the DGA commissioners were closely questioned on the issue of international transfers of data. On this the Council says the Commission may (through secondary legislation) adopt adequacy decisions declaring that specific non-EU countries provide appropriate safeguards for the use of non-personal data transferred from the EU.</p>
<p>This mirrors procedure attached to the GDPR and covering personal data transfers to third countries.</p>
<p>However the Commission&#8217;s decisions on that front have been shown lacking on a number of occasions &#8212; notably two flagship data transfers agreements with the US were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/">struck down</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">by the CJEU</a> in recent years. Which has resulted in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/clouds-gather-over-us-cloud-services-after-cjeu-ruling/">increased uncertainty</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries/">complexity</a> around international transfers of personal data.</p>
<p>So there are likely to be questions and concerns about what exactly constitutes &#8220;unlawful international transfer of or governmental access to non-personal data&#8221;, under the incoming legislation.</p>
<p>&#8220;These [DGA adequacy] decisions would be similar to adequacy decisions relating to personal data under the GDPR. Such safeguards should be considered to exist when the country in question has equivalent measures in place that ensure a level of protection similar to that provided by EU or member state law,&#8221; the Council writes, without delving into any detail.</p>
<p>It goes on to note that the EC <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">may also adopt &#8220;model contractual clauses&#8221; to support public-sector bodies and re-users in the case of transfers of public-sector data to third countries &#8212; suggesting those that want to export data may be encouraged to follow a standardized approach. </span></p>
<p>The parliament&#8217;s PR, meanwhile, talks of the DGA setting up<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-governance-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> &#8220;common European data spaces in strategic domains&#8221;</a> &#8212; without making any reference to the international transfer issue.</p>
<p>How many of the touted &#8220;European data spaces&#8221; may end up hosted in the bloc &#8212; i.e. to meet the DGA&#8217;s requirements to provide adequate safeguards for the data &#8212; isn&#8217;t clear.</p>
<p>Although the Commission&#8217;s line is that &#8220;the free flow of data to third countries should be ensured&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want Europe to create and strengthen its data economy but there is no obligation to store and process data in the EU. Nobody will be prohibited from dealing with the partner of their choice,&#8221; it also writes, before segueing into a caveat that: &#8220;At the same time, the EU must ensure that any access to EU citizen&#8217;s personal data and certain sensitive data is in compliance with its values and legislative framework.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in February, Ember’s new consumer CEO (ex-Dyson) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/ember-names-former-dyson-head-as-consumer-ceo/">Jim Rowan outlined for TechCrunch the company’s plans</a> to expand beyond the temperature-controlled smart mugs that bear its name. At the time, the executive cited the cold chain – specifically medicine transport – as a potentially important category for the startup, going forward.</p>
<p>Seems Ember is now ready to start making good on that promise, courtesy of a new $23.5 million Series E that pushes its total funding to around $80 million. Tellingly, the round was led by Foxconn subsidiary GOLDTek, along with Singapore-based EDBI. The latter comes as Ember announces plans to open an R&amp;D center in the Southeast Asian country, in a bid to expand its international presence.</p>
<p>That comes with a further expanded headcount for the firm, which says it already increased its team by 76% this year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240428" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Since launching Ember five years ago, our company’s mission has always been to use our expertise in precision temperature control to solve real-world problems for our customers,” founder and group CEO Clay Alexander said in a release. “To date, Ember has over 129 granted patents surrounding temperature control, data, and connectivity. This additional capital will be instrumental in bringing to life technology across our vast patent portfolio in the coming years, particularly in the healthcare and infant feeding space.”</p>
<p>On the cold chain front, the company alluded to the forthcoming arrival of its “first self-refrigerated, cloud-based shipping box.” Targeted at the pharmaceutical industry, the technology is looking to target a global supply chain currently subjected to unprecedented strain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://klue.com/">Klue</a>, an AI-powered competitive enablement platform, has raised $62 million in Series B funding led by Tiger Global, with participation from Salesforce Ventures. The Vancouver-based company combines intel collection capabilities with a modern approach to content distribution aimed at providing users with the insights needed to drive revenue and business impact.</p>
<p class="p2">The platform automatically gathers competitive data from public and private external sources such as the news and competitor web page changes, as well as data from internal teams through integrations with platforms like Slack, Highspot and Salesforce. Klue aims to enable product marketers and competitive intelligence teams to increase their coverage of competitors.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Our platform makes it easier to update competitive content, keep the organization informed on market changes, and enables sellers with real-time access to insights to improve competitive deal performance,&#8221; Jason Smith, the CEO and co-founder of Klue, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241022" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Smith outlined that Klue plans to use this latest round of funding to invest heavily in product development. The company will double down on its AI capabilities to make insight generation easier in order to unlock opportunities to expand its user base through new market development. Klue also plans to invest in product experience for its end-users to create a seamless connection between revenue teams and their access to competitive insights. It notes that the funding will also fuel its expansion into new verticals and markets.</p>

<p>Klue&#8217;s Series B funding follows its <a href="https://klue.com/blog/seriesa-announcement">$15 million Series A round</a> announced in September 2020. The round was led by Craft Ventures with participation from HWVP, existing investors OMERS Ventures, Rhino Ventures and BDC Ventures, along with several angel investors.</p>
<p>In terms of growth, Klue has seen 3x customer growth since its previous funding round. The company has served nearly 400 enterprise clients and more than 110,000 users since its launch in 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Our vision is for every department of every business to have a relevant, personalized and continuously updated lens into their competitor’s world. This system will be machine and human-driven, automatically pulling raw intel from your co-workers, internal systems and across the web and curating it into organized, actionable insights,&#8221; Smith stated.</p>
<p>Regarding future plans, Klue plans to find ways to reduce the burden of collecting intel and also automate insights. The company wants to introduce deeper integrations with enterprise tools like Slack, Salesforce, Gong, Highspot and Gainsights. Klue also plans to launch multi-user, collaborative and security features in the future. These features will allow users across departments to work independently and collectively within the same system.</p>
<p class="p1">The company also sees a future where Klue will support smaller companies with a lighter self-serve product. It also sees itself supporting B2C companies, such as retail and CPG companies that are concerned about competitive pricing, positioning, packaging and distribution.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We truly see Klue becoming the standard operating system for companies to see and know their competitor’s every move,&#8221; Smith said.</p>
