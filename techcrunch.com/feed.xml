										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.trendyol.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trendyol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an e-commerce platform based in Turkey, has raised $1.5 billion in a massive funding round that values the company at $16.5 billion. General Atlantic, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Princeville Capital and sovereign wealth funds, ADQ (UAE) and Qatar Investment Authority co-led the round.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal marks SoftBank’s first in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new financing also makes Trendyol Turkey’s first decacorn, and among the highest-valued private tech companies in Europe. It comes just months after strategic &#8212; and majority &#8212; backer Alibaba </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/chinas-alibaba-invests-350-mln-capital-increase-turkeys-trendyol-trade-registry-2021-04-20/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invested $350 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the company at a $9.4 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2010, Trendyol ranks as Turkey’s largest e-commerce company, serving more than 30 million shoppers and delivering more than 1 million packages per day. It claims to have evolved from marketplace to “superapp” by combining its marketplace platform (which is powered by Trendyol Express, its own last-mile delivery solution) with instant grocery and food delivery through its own courier network (Trendyol Go), its digital wallet (Trendyol Pay), consumer-to-consumer channel (Dolap) and other services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trendyol founder Demet Suzan Mutlu said the new capital will go toward expansion within Turkey and globally. Specifically, the company plans to continue investing in nationwide infrastructure, technology and logistics and toward accelerating digitalization of Turkish SMEs. She said the company was founded to create positive impact and that it intends to continue on that mission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evren Ucok, Trendyol&#8217;s chairman,  added that part of the company’s goal is to create new export channels for Turkish merchants and manufacturers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melis Kahya Akar, managing director and head of consumer for EMEA at General Atlantic, said that Trendyol’s marketplace model &#8212; ranging from grocery delivery to mobile wallets &#8212; “brings convenience and ease to consumers” in Turkey and internationally.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 </span><a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/merchant-services/insights/reports/turkey-2020"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report by JPMorgan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e-commerce represented only 5.3% of the overall Turkish retail market at the time but that Turkish e-commerce had notched impressive leaps in revenues in recent years: 2018 alone saw the market jump by 42%, followed by 31% in 2019. As of 2020, 67% of the Turkish population were making purchases online.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all been there. (Or at least I have.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re getting ready to vacate a property you’ve rented, only to be told by the landlord that you won’t be getting your security deposit back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This happened to me the first time I ever rented a place in the late 90s. I was shocked, but more than anything, I was angry at the injustice because I knew that what the landlord claimed was not true. It was her word against mine and my roommate’s. Still, we took her to small claims court, not so much over the $800 she was trying to keep but more to prove her wrong. In the end, we won.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was a lot of work, and a lot of time spent. If only there was some kind of technology available to have helped us make our case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, today there is. <a href="https://www.getrentcheck.com/">RentCheck</a>, a startup that is out to help solve the &#8220;he said, she said&#8221; challenge in these situations with an automated property inspection platform, has recently raised $2.6 million in seed money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lydia Winkler and Marco Nelson started the company in mid-2019 after Winkler experienced a similar situation to mine and ended up suing her landlord in small claims court. She was working on getting her JD/MBA at Tulane University at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was an injustice for me not to pursue it,” she told TechCrunch. “I took meticulous photos of the move-out condition of my apartment. The process took 18 months. But not everyone has the time or knowledge to fight in court.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then met Nelson, who had bought several properties that he ended up renting out. He had issues with security deposits too, but the opposite ones. He had to settle disputes over deposits, and found himself documenting properties’ condition at the time of move-out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I met Lydia and we realized we were passionate about the same problem,” Nelson recalled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so New Orleans-based RentCheck was born.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187000" style="width: 253px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187000" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2187000 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="243" height="365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg 3813w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187000" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> RentCheck; Co-founders Marco Nelson and Lydia Winkler</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are an estimated 48 million rental units in the U.S., with an average deposit of $1,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A good chunk of that is being fought after on aggregate,” Winkler said. “And so many need that money to put down a deposit on another unit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address the problem, RentCheck built a web app for property managers that they believe also benefits tenants. The company’s digital platform works by providing a way for property managers to facilitate and conduct remote, guided property inspections. For obvious reasons, the company saw increased demand upon the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, considering that the platform was automated and contactless. It saw 1,000% &#8212; mostly organic &#8212; growth in terms of the number of properties on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we do is, using a guided inspection process, prompt users and guide them room by room, telling them exactly what to take photos of so that floors, ceilings, windows and walls are all accounted for,” Winkler said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything is done within the app so that users can&#8217;t upload photos that were previously on their camera roll “to ensure the integrity of the inspection” and that  everything is time stamped. Once the inspection is complete, whoever does it signs off on it that they completed it accurately and honestly. Then the property manager can also sign off on it so both parties can agree on the move-out condition.</span></p>
<p>The company operates as a SaaS business, and charges property management companies a subscription fee based on the number of properties that they have on the RentCheck platform. They can then conduct &#8220;as many inspections as they want,&#8221; Nelson says, &#8220;whether the residents are doing them, their internal teams are doing them, or a third-party vendor, or a hybrid of the three.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187001" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187001" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2187001 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187001" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> RentCheck/Bryce Ell Photography</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has attracted some large-name investors since its inception, first catching the attention of James &#8220;Jim&#8221; Coulter, the founder of TPG Capital, when the company won New Orleans Entrepreneurship Week. Coulter subsequently became one of the company’s first investors in its $1 million pre-seed round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s seed round included participation from Cox Enterprises, for its operations in the multifamily housing space, and angels such as Jim Payne, who previously sold MoPub to Twitter, and MAX to AppLovin; Ken Goldman, the former CFO of Yahoo, and who currently runs Hillspire, Eric and Wendy Schmidt’s family office; Mark Zaleski and John Kuolt of BCG Digital Ventures, and Brian Long, the founder of Attentive, who previously sold TapCommerce to Twitter. It also included institutional investors such as Irongrey, Context Ventures and Techstars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we love about RentCheck is that it’s using very clever technology to automate and solve arguably the industry’s biggest problem in terms of money and time for both property managers and tenants,” said Kuolt, former managing director at BCG Digital Ventures and an early RentCheck investor. “The deposit deduction issue needs a technology-based solution, and almost everyone, at some time, has felt like they’ve been screwed over on their deposit by a landlord. When you see and use RentCheck’s solution, it makes you think: ‘Why didn’t I think of this?’ ” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku this morning announced an expansion of its original content lineup, with the addition of 23 new Roku Original programs that will debut on August 13 on The Roku Channel free streaming hub. The new programing &#8212; which also hails from Roku&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/roku-acquires-quibis-content/">acquisition</a> of failed streamer Quibi&#8217;s catalog &#8212; will supplement the initial slate of 30 originals which were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/roku-launches-an-original-programming-lineup-fueled-by-quibis-content/">first released in May</a>. Among the new programs are four shows that had not yet gone live on Quibi&#8217;s service before Roku purchased the content catalog for its own originals business.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vhv6DAdEJJ4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>These unreleased programs include &#8220;<a href="https://blog.roku.com/new-roku-original-eye-candy-josh-groban">Eye Candy,</a>&#8221; a &#8220;Nailed It!&#8221;-like competition series hosted by Josh Groban and inspired by Japan&#8217;s &#8220;Sokkuri Sweets;&#8221; &#8220;<a href="https://blog.roku.com/squeaky-clean-the-roku-channel">Squeaky Clean</a>,&#8221; a cleaning competition series hosted by Leslie Jordan; Season 2 of pay-it-forward reality show &#8220;Thanks a Million,&#8221; executive produced by Jennifer Lopez; and a ten-part docuseries &#8220;<a href="https://blog.roku.com/new-what-happens-in-hollywood">What Happens in Hollywood</a>,&#8221; directed by Marina Zenovich, which details some of the industry&#8217;s most controversial secrets.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8A-koKq7mX0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Other programs now arriving include: &#8220;&amp;Music,&#8221; &#8220;The Andy Cohen Diaries,&#8221; &#8220;Benedict Men,&#8221; &#8220;Elba vs Block,&#8221; &#8220;Fierce Queens,&#8221; &#8220;Floored,&#8221; &#8220;Gone Mental with Lior,&#8221; &#8220;Mapleworth Murders,&#8221; &#8220;Memory Hole,&#8221; &#8220;Nice One!,&#8221; &#8220;Nikki Fre$h,&#8221; &#8220;Run this City,&#8221; &#8220;The Sauce,&#8221; &#8220;Sex Next Door,&#8221; &#8220;Singled Out,&#8221; &#8220;Skrrt with Offset,&#8221; &#8220;The Stranger,&#8221; &#8220;Survive,&#8221; and &#8220;Wireless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roku had praised the performance of its original lineup during its second quarter earnings last week, saying the new catalog had demonstrated &#8220;good performance,&#8221; without sharing specific metrics.</p>
<p>The company also said it would continue to invest in originals, but downplayed the size of their role in its larger strategy for The Roku Channel, where original programming is a smaller fraction of the content Roku offers to its customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Noted Roku CEO Anthony Wood, The Roku Channel&#8217;s catalog consists mainly of content that comes from the licensing deals Roku strikes with various partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a portfolio approach and the originals are part of that portfolio,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The primary source of content is still licensing, but originals have benefits, as well. And as part of the portfolio, they&#8217;re a great addition,&#8221; Wood added. He also was careful to explain that the addition of originals wouldn&#8217;t have any impact on the gross margins related to The Roku Channel&#8217;s ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) business model. Instead, the expansion into originals, which has also included Roku&#8217;s purchase of &#8220;This Old House,&#8221; is more about user acquisition and its ad business.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other advantage of the originals is, of course, there&#8217;s a halo effect. So it&#8217;s helpful with the Upfronts, it&#8217;s helpful with our advertising business, and it&#8217;s helpful for bringing in new customers into The Roku Channel,&#8221; Wood said.</p>
<p>The company explained that originals drove more engagement among users, which then drove more advertisers &#8212; including new advertisers &#8212; and that gives Roku more money to invest in more content and further scale its business. Roku said that over 42% of its advertisers were first-time upfront advertisers with the company, which had a lot do with its ability to offer original programming on The Roku Channel.</p>
<p>Overall, however, Roku saw a mixed Q2. The company <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/roku-q2-2021-earnings.html">beat Wall St. expectations</a> with earnings per share of $0.52 versus estimates of $0.13, and revenue of $645 million versus estimates of $618 million, but reported a decline in streaming hours. Roku said streaming hours decreased by 1 billion from the first quarter of 2021, but attributed this to the pandemic, as more people were leaving their homes for activities like dining, entertainment, and travel. Shares fell by over 8% after the earnings report, despite Roku reporting that streaming hours had grown year-over-year by 19% worldwide.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/xayn-is-privacy-safe-personalized-mobile-web-search-powered-by-on-device-ais/">December 2020 we covered</a> the launch of a new kind of smartphone app-based search engine, <a href="https://www.xayn.com/">Xayn</a>.</p>
<p>“A search engine?!” I hear you say? Well, yes, because despite the convenience of modern search engines’ ability to tailor their search results to the individual, this user-tracking comes at the expense of privacy. This mass surveillance might be what improves Google’s search engine and Facebook’s ad targeting, to name just two examples, but it’s not very good for our privacy.</p>
<p>Internet users are admittedly able to switch to the US-based <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, or perhaps France’s <a href="https://www.qwant.com/">Qwant</a>, but what they gain in privacy, they often lose in user experience and the relevance of search results, through this lack of tailoring.</p>
<p>What Berlin-based Xayn has come up with is personalized, but a privacy-safe web search on smartphones, which replaces the cloud-based AI employed by Google et al with the innate AI in-built into modern smartphones. The result is that no data about you is uploaded to Xayn’s servers.</p>
<p>And this approach is not just for ‘privacy freaks’. Businesses that need search but don’t need Google’s dominant market position are increasingly attracted by this model.</p>
<p>And the evidence comes today with the new that Xayn has now raised almost $12 million in Series A funding led by the Japanese investors Global Brain and KDDI (a Japanese telecommunications operator), with participation from previous backers, including the Earlybird VC in Berlin. Xayn’s total financing now comes to more than $23 million to date.</p>
<p>It would appear that Xayn’s fusion of a search engine, a discovery feed, and a mobile browser has appealed to these Asian market players, particularly because Xayn can be built into OEM devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The result of the investment is that Xayn will now also focus on the Asian market, starting with Japan, as well as Europe.</p>
<p>Leif-Nissen Lundbæk, Co-Founder and CEO of Xayn said: “We proved with Xayn that you can have it all: great results through personalization, privacy by design through advanced technology, and a convenient user experience through clean design.”</p>
<p>He added: “In an industry in which selling data and delivering ads en masse are the norm, we choose to lead with privacy instead and put user satisfaction front and center.”</p>
<p>The funding comes as legislation such as the EU’s GDPR or California’s CCPA have both raised public awareness about personal data online.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Xayn says its app has been downloaded around 215,000 times worldwide, and a web version of its app is expected soon.</p>
<p>Over a call, Lundbæk expanded on the KDDI aspect of the fund-raising: “The partnership with KDDI means we will give users access to Xayn for free, while the corporate &#8211; such as KDDI  &#8211; is the actual customer but gives our search engine away for free.”</p>
<p>The core features of Xayn include personalized search results; a personalized feed of the entire Internet which learns from their Tinder-like swipes, without collecting or sharing personal data;<br />
an ad-free experience.  </p>
<p>Naoki Kamimeada, Partner at Global Brain Corporation said: “The market for private online search is growing, but Xayn is head and shoulders above everyone else because of the way they’re re-thinking how finding information online should be.”</p>
<p>Kazuhiko Chuman, Head of KDDI Open Innovation Fund, said: “This European discovery engine uniquely combines efficient AI with a privacy-protecting focus and a smooth user experience. At KDDI, we’re constantly on the lookout for companies that can shape the future with their expertise and technology. That’s why it was a perfect match for us.”</p>
<p>In addition to the three co-founders Leif-Nissen Lundbæk (Chief Executive Officer), Professor Michael Huth (Chief Research Officer), and Felix Hahmann (Chief Operations Officer), Dr Daniel von Heyl will come on board as Chief Financial Officer, Frank Pepermans will take on the role of Chief Technology Officer, and Michael Briggs will join as Chief Growth Officer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We should expect more of the same from the Chinese government: More complaints about the impact of "excessive" capital in its industries, more tumbling share prices and more held IPOs.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Chinese government&#8217;s crackdown on its domestic technology industry continues, with Tencent under fresh pressure despite the company&#8217;s efforts to follow changing regulatory expectations.</p>
<p>News broke over the weekend that Beijing filed a civil suit against Tencent &#8220;over claims its messaging-app WeChat&#8217;s Youth Mode does not comply with laws protecting minors,&#8221; <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/china-sues-tencent-over-wechat-105442861.html">per the BBC</a>. And NetEase, a major Chinese technology company, will delay the IPO of its music arm in Hong Kong. Why? Uncertain regulations, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/cloud-village-ipo-idUSL4N2PG0LK">per Reuters</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p>The latest spate of bad news for China&#8217;s technology industry follows a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/chinas-regulatory-crackdown-is-good-news-for-startups-aligned-with-ccp-goals/">raft of regulatory changes</a> and actions by the nation&#8217;s government that have deleted an enormous quantity of equity value. After a period of relatively light-touch regulatory oversight, domestic Chinese technology companies have found themselves on defense after the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) came after their market power in antitrust terms &#8212; and some of their business operations from other perspectives. Sectors hit the hardest include fintech and edtech.</p>
<p>Gaming is also in the CCP crosshairs.</p>

Tencent owns Riot Games, makers of the popular &#8220;League of Legends&#8221; title. And NetEase generated $2.3 billion in gaming revenue out of total revenues of $3.1 billion <a href="https://netease.gcs-web.com/system/files-encrypted/nasdaq_kms/assets/2021/05/18/0-05-18/Q1%202021%20Earnings%20Release.pdf">in its most recent quarter</a>.</p>
<p>NetEase stock traded around $110 per share in late July. It&#8217;s now worth around $90 per share after expectations shifted in light of the gaming news, indicating that investors are concerned about its future performance. Tencent&#8217;s Hong Kong-listed stock has also fallen, from HK$775.50 to HK$461.60 this morning.</p>
<p>Tencent tried to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/aug/03/chinas-tencent-tightens-controls-for-children-amid-games-addiction-fears?ref=biztoc.com&amp;curator=biztoc.com">head off regulatory pressure</a>, announcing changes to how it controls access to its games after the government&#8217;s shot across the bow. The effort doesn&#8217;t appear to have worked. That Tencent is being sued by the government despite its publicly announced changes implies that its proposed curbs to youth gaming were either insufficient or perhaps moot from the beginning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Our Extra Crunch Live series continues with some heavy hitters in August, including Jen Nwankwo, founder and CEO at 1910 Genetics, and Playground Global general partner Jory Bell. They&#8217;ll be with us live on <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-playground-global-and-1910-genetics">August 11 at 12 p.m. PT (3 p.m. ET)</a> to tell us all about how Nwankwo and her startup won over Bell and Playground as an investor, and as we do every week on Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;ll conduct a live pitch feedback session featuring you, the members of our audience.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live gives you the chance to hear live from entrepreneurs who have successfully raised significant rounds of venture capital &#8212; and from the investors who believed in them. We go into detail about how the deal got done, and you&#8217;ll hear from both about what it takes to pitch VCs and what industry-leading VCs look for in prospective portfolio companies.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to have Nwankwo and Bell joining us for this episode. Nwankwo founded and leads 1910 Genetics, which takes advantage of AI to accelerate the discovery and development of new drug therapies across a wide range of disease and condition categories. She has a Ph.D. in pharmacology and experimental therapeutics from Tufts University School of Medicine and participated in drug discovery development that led to the creation of Type 2 diabetes drug Trulicity prior to her graduate school work.</p>
<p>Bell&#8217;s career includes designing and building autonomous robots for deep-sea exploration, as well as a six-year stint at Apple designing notebooks for the consumer technology leader. Bell&#8217;s venture investment work began at Playground Global in 2015; he focuses on deep tech investments, including in aerospace, genomics, synthetic biology, and AI-assisted drug discovery, as in the case of 1910 Genetics.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live also features the ECL Pitch-off, where startups in the audience can virtually “raise their hand” to pitch their startup live on our stream. Our expert guests will give their feedback on each pitch. If you want to throw your hat in the ring, you have to show up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Oleg Stavitsky and his co-founders started Endel, they didn&#8217;t necessarily expect for it to become a venture-backed business with the likes of Amazon&#8217;s Alexa Fund as investors. Stavitsky and his founding team describe themselves as a &#8220;collective of imaginative creatives and artists,&#8221; and the group had previously developed a unique set of apps for children called Bubl that were designed to foster creative development and avoid the usual tropes of character-based kid-focused entertainment.</p>
<p>Endel is a wholly different project, delivering personalized soundscapes to its users that help them achieve states of focus, relaxation and sleep. These are tailored specifically to individual users, and have more in common with meditative exercises and other wellness techniques than with traditional music. And the company has attracted a lot of big-name attention, including a partnership with Grimes that originated when she reached out because she loved using the app and wanted to see if they could work together.</p>
<p>Oleg talks to us all about his experience building Endel, and what it&#8217;s like being part of a highly unconventional founder collective building a consumer tech startup outside of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>We loved our time chatting with Oleg, and we hope you love yours listening to the episode. And of course, we’d love if you can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon and parent of its top Indian seller Cloudtail have decided to not continue their joint venture after May 2022, the two firms said in a statement Monday, hours after India’s top court ruled that the American e-commerce firm and Walmart’s Flipkart must face antitrust investigations in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Billionaire N.R. Narayana Murthy’s Catamaran, the parent firm of Cloudtail, and Amazon launched the joint venture in the country in 2014. The joint venture restructured its ownership in 2019 following India’s regulatory changes &#8212; more on this shortly.</p>
<p>The development follows India’s Supreme Court ruling earlier in the day that Amazon and Flipkart must face antitrust investigations ordered against them in the country.</p>
<p>The Indian watchdog &#8212; the Competition Commission of India &#8212; ordered an investigation into the firms last year for<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/india-orders-investigation-into-alleged-anti-competitive-practices-by-amazon-and-walmarts-flipkart/"> allegedly promoting select sellers</a> (those in which they own a stake) on their e-commerce platforms and using business practices that stifle competition.</p>
<p>In a statement Monday, the two firms said Cloudtail &#8212; registered as Prione Business Services &#8212; enabled over 300,000 sellers and entrepreneurs to go online and provided 4 million merchants with digital payment capabilities. The joint venture, they said, helped merchants and small businesses access millions of customers in India.</p>
<p>Cloudtail is one of the largest sellers on Amazon in India. The e-commerce group has stakes in a few more third-party sellers including Appario Retail, which is its joint venture with Patni Group.</p>
<p>“As our JV with Amazon reaches the end of its tenure, I reflect on this successful partnership that introduced the power of digitization and empowered hundreds of thousands of SMBs across big and small towns,” said M.D. Ranganath, President of Catamaran, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two firms did not say why they decided to end their joint venture.</p>
<p>Long-standing laws in India have restricted Amazon and other e-commerce firms from holding inventory or selling items directly to consumers. To bypass this, firms have operated through a maze of joint ventures with local companies that operate as inventory-holding firms.</p>
<p>India got around to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/27/amazon-walmart-india-e-commerce-restrictions/">fixing this loophole in late 2018</a> in a move that was widely seen as the biggest blowback to the American firm in the country at the time. Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart scrambled to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/01/amazon-flipkart-india-law/">delist hundreds of thousands of items</a> from their stores and made their investments in affiliated firms way more indirect.</p>
<p>In June this year, India <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/india-proposes-tougher-e-commerce-rules-following-widespread-cheating-and-unfair-trade-by-amazon-and-flipkart/">proposed even tougher e-commerce rules</a> that, among other things, prohibits Amazon, Flipkart and other e-commerce players from running their in-house / private labels. The new proposal asks e-commerce firms to ensure that none of their related and associated parties are listed on their platforms as sellers for selling to customers directly.</p>
<p>“Amazon and Catamaran entered into a JV in the early days of e-commerce in India with a shared vision of transforming hundreds of thousands of small businesses in a fast-changing digital world, by providing online capabilities enabling them to access customers both in India and globally,” said Amit Agarwal, Global Senior VP and Country Head of Amazon India, in a statement.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Canopy's leaders expect focused fintech products to win out over large bundles of services.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://canopyservicing.com/">Canopy Servicing</a> announced this morning it recently closed a $15 million Series A. The startup sells software to fintechs and others, allowing customers to create loan programs and service the resulting products.</p>
<p>The company raised a $3.5 million seed round in 2020. Canaan led its Series A, with participation from Homebrew, Foundation and BoxGroup, among others. Per Canopy, its valuation grew by 5x from its seed round to its Series A.</p>
<p>The company has raised $18.5 million to date.</p>
<p>So far this reads much like any other post announcing a new startup funding round, kicking off with an array of information concerning the round and who chipped into the transaction. Next, we&#8217;d probably note the competitors, growth and what investors in the company in question have to say about their recent purchase. This morning, however, I want to riff a bit on the future of fintech and how the financial tech stack of the future may be built.</p>
<p>TechCrunch chatted with Canopy CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbivons">Matt Bivons</a> last week. He has an interesting take on where fintech is headed. Let&#8217;s discuss it and work through what Canopy does.</p>
<h2>Canopy</h2>
<p>As with many startups, Canopy was built to scratch an itch. Bivons had run into issues regarding loan servicing in prior jobs. He went on to found a startup that aimed to build a student credit card. But after working on that project, Bivons and co-founder Will Hanson pivoted the company to a B2B-focused concern building loan servicing technology.</p>
<p>Behind the decision was market research undertaken by the Canopy crew that uncovered that a great number of fintech startups wanted to get into the credit market. That makes sense; credit products can provide far more attractive economics to fintech startups than, say, checking and savings accounts. Knowing that loan servicing was a bear and a half to manage, Canopy decided to focus on it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bivons framed Canopy as a modern API for loan servicing that can be used to create and manage loans at any point in their lifecycle. He noted that what the startup is doing is akin to what several successful fintech companies have done, namely taking a piece of the fintech world and making it better for developers.</p>
<p>This is where Bivons&#8217; view of the future of fintech products comes into play. According to the CEO, in the future, companies will not buy a monolithic financial technology stack. Instead, he thinks, they will buy the best API for each slice of the fintech world that they need to implement. This matters because we could argue that Canopy is targeting too small a product space. Not that its market isn&#8217;t large &#8212; debt and its servicing are massive problem spaces &#8212; but seeing a company find a niche to focus on makes more sense when its leaders expect focused fintech products to win out over large bundles of services.</p>
<p>Bivons added that much of the fintech focus of the last five years has been on debit, citing Chime, Step and Greenlight as examples. The next decade, he said, is going to focus on credit products. That would be good news for Canopy.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187219" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187219" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2187219 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Canopy_cofounders_Matt_Bivons-Will_Hanson.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187219" class="wp-caption-text">Canopy co-founders via the company. CTO Will Hanson (left) and CEO Matt Bivons (right).</p></div></p>
<p>Critically, and for the finance nerds out there, Bivons told TechCrunch that its loan servicing technology does not require the company to take on any credit risk, and that it has gross margins of around 90%. I never trust a too-round number, but the figure indicates that what Canopy has built could grow into an attractive business.</p>
<p>Today, Canopy is a traditional SaaS, though Bivons said that it wants to move toward usage-based pricing in time. Its service costs around 50 cents per account per month, or around $6 per year in its current form. Today, around 40% of Canopy&#8217;s customers are seed and Series A-scale startups, though Bivons noted that it is moving up the customer size chart over time.</p>
<p>The resulting growth is impressive. Canopy&#8217;s customer count grew 4.5x from February to May of 2021. Of course, Canopy is a young company, so its overall customer base could not have been massive at the start of the year. Still, that&#8217;s the sort of growth that makes investors sit up and pay attention, making the Canopy Series A somewhat unsurprising.</p>
<p>Fintech growth doesn&#8217;t seem to be slackening much, meaning that the market for what Canopy is selling should expand. Provided that its view that best-of-breed, more particular fintech products will beat larger stacks in the market, it could have an interesting trajectory ahead of it. And now that it has raised its Series A, we can start to annoy it with more concrete questions about its growth from here on out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">James Evans and his co-founders at <a href="https://www.commandbar.com/">CommandBar</a> were working on a software product when they hit a wall while trying to access certain functionalities within the software.</p>
<p>That’s when the lightbulb moment happened and, in 2020, the team shifted to building a product search engine add-on to make software easier to use.</p>
<p>“We thought this paradigm feels like it could be useful, but it is hard to build well, so we built it,” Evans told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>On Monday, CommandBar emerged from beta and announced its $4.8 million seed round, led by Thrive Capital, with participation from Y Combinator, BoxGroup and a group of angel investors including, AngelList’s Naval Ravikant, Worklife Ventures’ Brianne Kimmel, StitchFix president Mike Smith and others.</p>
<p>CommandBar’s business-to-business tool, referred to as “command k,” was designed to make software simpler and faster to use. The technology is a search interface that sits on top of web-based apps so that users can access functionalities by searching simple keywords. It can also be used to boost new users with recommended prompts like referrals.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187043" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187043" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2187043" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CommandBar-in-Clubhouse.png" alt="" width="1024" height="660" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CommandBar-in-Clubhouse.png 1199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CommandBar-in-Clubhouse.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CommandBar-in-Clubhouse.png?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CommandBar-in-Clubhouse.png?resize=768,495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CommandBar-in-Clubhouse.png?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CommandBar-in-Clubhouse.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187043" class="wp-caption-text">CommandBar in Clubhouse. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> CommandBar</p></div></p>
<p>Companies integrate CommandBar by pasting in a line of code and using configuration tools to quickly add commands relevant to their apps. The product was purposefully designed as low-code so that product and customer success teams can add configurations without relying on engineering support, Evans said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Initially, it was a difficult sell: One of the more challenging parts in the early days of the company was helping customers and investors understand what CommandBar was doing.</p>
<p>“It was hard to describe over the phone, we had to try to get people on Zoom so they could see it,” he said. “It is easier now to sell the product because they can see it being used in an app. That is where many new users come from.”</p>
<p>CommandBar is already being used by companies like Clubhouse.io, Canix and Stacker that are serving hundreds of thousands of users. The most common use case for CommandBar so far is onboarding new software users.</p>
<p>He intends to use the new funding to grow the team, hiring across engineering, sales and marketing. The beta testing was successful in receiving good feedback from the early customers, and Evans wants to reflect that in new products and functionalities that will come out later this year.</p>
<p>Vince Hankes, an investor at Thrive Capital, was introduced to CommandBar through one of its pre-seed investors.</p>
<p>His interest is in B2B software companies and applications, and one of the things that became obvious to him while looking into the space was the natural tension between the simplicity and functionality of apps.</p>
<p>Apps are sometimes hard for even a power user to navigate, he said, but CommandBar makes something as simple as resetting a password easier by being able to search for that term and go right to that page if it is configured that way by the company.</p>
<p>“The types of companies interested in their product are impressive,” Hankes said. “We began to see demand from a broad range of companies that weren’t obvious. In fact, they are using CommandBar as a tool for deeper customer engagement.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Friends Alvaro Silberstein and Camilo Navarro came up with the idea for the <a href="https://gowheeltheworld.com/">Wheel the World</a> travel booking site following a 2016 trip to Torres del Paine National Park in Chile. Initially, they thought this type of trip would be near impossible with Silberstein in a wheelchair after a car accident as a teenager left him paralyzed.</p>
<p>Turns out it became the trip of a lifetime thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign to finance a scouting trip and the purchase of a state-of-the-art hiking wheelchair. Silberstein said with the help of Navarro and other friends, he became the first to complete the Patagonia trek by wheelchair.</p>
<p>Then in 2018 while in graduate school at UC Berkeley, they decided to launch Wheel the World so that others in similar situations as Silberstein could find accessible travel experiences.</p>
<p>Three years later, about 1,300 people have booked trips through the Berkeley, California-based company’s website, which offers over 400 listings to more than 50 destinations. On Monday, they announced $2 million in a seed round led by Chile Global Ventures and Dadneo, with the support of Plug N Play Tech Center and YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki.</p>
<p>“We have a clear belief and purpose to make the world accessible,” Silberstein said.</p>
<p><div style="width: 1920px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-2186933-1" width="1920" height="1080" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WTW-Anthem-30-seg.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WTW-Anthem-30-seg.mp4">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WTW-Anthem-30-seg.mp4</a></video></div></p>
<p>Wheel the World collects over 200 data points on hotels through its Accessibility Mapping System, like hotel room measurements, and digitizes them to build its marketplace so that travelers can determine if that particular room will meet their needs. Users go on the site and build a profile, outlining their accessibility needs, and Wheel the World will recommend the best listings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company will also work with hotels and tours to attract this new segment of travelers and how to work with people who have disabilities, which Navarro said was 1 billion people globally, along with another large population of family and friends that would be involved in trips.</p>
<p>“Tapping into this market of disability travel will be tapping into more than $100 billion globally,” Silberstein added. Indeed, in 2018 and 2019, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/economic-impact-of-disability-travel-reaches-58-7-billion-301162417.html">travelers with disabilities took a total of 81 million trips</a>, spending $58.7 billion on their own travel alone, according to a 2020 report by Open Doors Organization, a nonprofit organization teaching businesses how to make their goods and services accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Silberstein and Navarro plan to use the new funding to build out Wheel the World’s software, make additional hires and add travel listings to the platform. Navarro expects to have over 3,000 listings by the end of 2022. The company has 23 employees today, and Silberstein is planning to double that over the next year.</p>
<p>Though the global pandemic was tough on the company, the founders said they used the time to design their system and think about their value proposition. It seems like the results paid off: The company recorded its best months ever for each of the last three months, Silberstein said.</p>
<p>“This year we are seeing travel inventory coming back, more people are vaccinated and we are pushing our inventory to grow more near where our users live so they can travel closer to home as well as far away,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Launched in February 2019, Kroo, the London-based consumer-facing fintech raised some seed funding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/b-social-seed-2/">last year</a> for its prepaid card service which claims to offer more ‘social features’ in its drive towards offering full-blown banking services. Kroo’s pitch is that it removes friction from financial interactions with friends and family, and throws in some environmental initiatives as well, such as tree planting.</p>
<p>It’s now raised $24.5 million (£17.7 million) in a Series A funding round led by Rudy Karsan, a high-net-worth tech entrepreneur and founder of Karlani Capital. Kroo will use the funding in its drive towards a full banking license in early 2022.</p>
<p>The fund-raising is fairly unusual for a fintech startup that aspires to become a bank, given the lack of an institutional investor. However, this will give it a lot more freedom as it heads towards bank status next year.</p>
<p>Kroo currently offers a prepaid debit card plus an app to track personal and social finances, such as the ability to create payment groups with friends, track spending, and split and pay bills, removing the usual awkwardness around such things.</p>
<p>The company has also pledged to donate a percentage of profits to social causes, and launched a tree-planting referral scheme, so that every time a customer refers a friend, Kroo plants 20 trees.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187235" style="width: 826px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187235" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Andrea-De-Gottardo.png" alt="Kroo CEO Andrea de Gottardo" width="816" height="586" class="size-full wp-image-2187235" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Andrea-De-Gottardo.png 816w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Andrea-De-Gottardo.png?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Andrea-De-Gottardo.png?resize=300,215 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Andrea-De-Gottardo.png?resize=768,552 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Andrea-De-Gottardo.png?resize=680,488 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Andrea-De-Gottardo.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187235" class="wp-caption-text">Kroo CEO Andrea de Gottardo</p></div><br />
CEO Andrea de Gottardo (pictured), who joined Kroo as Chief Risk Officer in 2018, said: “We want to build the world’s greatest social bank: a bank dedicated to its customers and to the world we live in. We’re going to do more than just work with Kroo customers to improve their relationship with money and provide them with access to fair loans. We’re going to offer them ways to actively take part in making our world a better place, like carbon offsetting and a tree-planting referral program.”</p>
<p>Karsan said: “The reason I’m excited about Kroo is that it has a concrete opportunity to dramatically change the way people feel about their bank, for good. Kroo has an exceptionally talented management team and a nimble tech stack that will enable the continuous delivery of banking features customers really care about.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to me over a call, de Gottardo added: “We have raised, including the series A, over £30 million through high net worth individuals and syndicated investors. So we still haven&#8217;t done an institutional round. That was a choice.”</p>
<p>He elaborated: “We’re lucky enough to have Rudy Karsan, a high net worth, and an extremely supportive pool of investors that keep following on in the rounds. It was our intention get up to a Series A without any institutions, and to be free of the pressure from VC. It’s now highly likely we will go institutional for a Series B round.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In-house legal teams play a critical role in companies, but a lot of them don’t have the same kind of technology as their counterparts in sales or finance. Instead, they often rely on email, shared inboxes and spreadsheets. <a href="https://lawvu.com/">LawVu</a> gives them a cloud-based platform to share legal advice, documents, communicate with each other or external counsel and create reports for the rest of the company, including the C-suite. “LawVu is to legal what Salesforce is to sales teams,” co-founder and chief strategy officer Tim Boyne told TechCrunch in an email.</p>
<p>The Tauranga, New Zealand-based company announced today that it has raised $17 million NZD (about $11.9 million USD) in Series A funding led by Insight Partners, the venture firm known for <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/categories/scale-up/">its ScaleUp program for growth-stage startups</a>, with participation from returning investor AirTree Ventures. Its previous funding was a seed round of about $1.8 million USD led by Shasta Ventures and AirTree, <a href="https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/2021/05/04/299583/legal-tech-startup-lawvu-closes-seed-round-led-shasta-and-airtree-ventures">announced in May</a>.</p>
<p>LawVu was founded in 2015 by Boyne, who spent over a decade working in IT and operations at law firms, and Sam Kidd, a SaaS project management expert. Since LawVu was designed for distributed teams and remote workers, adoption increased dramatically in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. LawVu’s annual recurring revenue tripled in 2020 and is continuing to grow. While it has users in 30 countries, about two-thirds of its recurring revenue now comes from the United States and Australia, with clients like Telstra, AMP, Linktree, Expedia, PwC and Instacart.</p>
<p>The company plans to hire key leadership roles in the U.S. for its global go-to-market strategy and open U.S. offices as it continues developing LawVu’s technology.</p>
<p>LawVu is used by in-house legal teams ranging from one person to more than 300. Its fastest adoption is coming from teams of five to 500 legal professionals.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Canada&#8217;s newest unicorn: Clio raises $110M at a $1.6B valuation for legal tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/canadas-newest-unicorn-clio-raises-110m-at-a-1-6b-valuation-for-legal-tech/embed/#?secret=2hx25LkLXE" data-secret="2hx25LkLXE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup serves in-house legal teams, instead of law firms, because “in-house lawyers have very different incentives and objectives to their private practice peers. This creates a vastly different set of needs for in-house lawyers to be effective at their jobs, particularly on the technology front,” Boyne said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, private practice lawyers focus on specific projects, charging clients on time spent. In contrast, in-house lawyers have to balance “reactive work,” or what their company asks for, and “proactive work,” or anticipating the business’ needs and reducing risks.</p>
<p>LawVu’s cloud platform serves as a “legal workspace” that combines all the tech tools in-house legal teams need. For example, it lets them manage matter (or legal issues that can include advice requests, contract executions, M&amp;A transactions or litigation), contracts, documents, e-billing and outsourced work.</p>

<p>For in-house legal teams, LawVu&#8217;s analytics helps the rest of their company understand exactly what they do by providing metrics using data that is usually tucked away in email inboxes or a salesperson’s files, Boyne said.</p>
<p>“Legal work is largely invisible. Unlike other industries, legal is at the very beginning of its data journey,” Boyne said. He added, “as lawyers migrate their work into our workspace, everything is able to be captured as data. For the first time, the legal function now has the ability to see demand, types of work, team capacity, future hiring needs, what law firms are performing well, even process areas to automate with other tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to helping in-house legal teams become more productive, LawVu also helps them prove their value to decision makers. Boyne explained that legal teams are often overlooked because they are viewed as cost centers which do not directly add to a company’s profit, and who come in at the end of a project or decision.</p>
<p>“Typically as a business scales really fast, the legal team can be left behind with the capacity to only fight fires and no time to engage and add much needed strategic value. If you don’t have the data to back up the value and work you are doing, it becomes very hard to get more resources when needed, be this tech or people,” Boyne said.</p>
<p>“LawVu workspace allows them to streamline their service, have information at their fingertips, deliver outcomes quickly, measure and demonstrate value, all freeing them up to truly become a valued member of the business leadership team.”</p>
<p>Insight Partners managing director Rachel Geller will join LawVu’s board. In a statement, she said, “LawVu’s global growth speaks volumes to its future as a business and ability to provide high-value outcomes to legal teams. Its combination of intuitive user experience and excellent customer feedback make LawVu stand out in the legal tech industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Siga OT Solutions, an Israeli <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> startup that helps organizations secure their operations by monitoring the raw electric signals of critical industrial assets, has raised $8.1 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>Siga’s SigaGuard says its technology, used by Israel’s critical water facilities and the New York Power Authority, is unique in that rather than monitoring the operational network, it uses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/machine-learning/">machine learning</a> and predictive analysis to &#8220;listen&#8221; to Level 0 signals. These are typically made up of components and sensors that receive electrical signals, rather than protocols or data packets that can be manipulated by hackers.</p>
<p>By monitoring Level 0, which Siga describes as the &#8220;richest and most reliable level of process data within any operational environment,&#8221; the company can detect cyberattacks on the most critical and vulnerable physical assets of national infrastructures. This, it claims, ensures operational resiliency even when hackers are successful in manipulating the logic of industrial control system (ICS) controllers.</p>
<p>Amir Samoiloff, co-founder and CEO of Siga, says: “Level 0 is becoming the major axis in the resilience and integrity of critical national infrastructures worldwide and securing this level will become a major element in control systems in the coming years.”</p>
<p>The company’s latest round of funding — led by PureTerra Ventures, with investment from Israeli venture fund SIBF, Moore Capital, and Phoenix Contact — comes amid an escalation in attacks against operational infrastructure. Israel’s water infrastructure was hit by three known cyberattacks in 2020 and these were followed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/decrypted-hackers-attempt-to-poison-florida-towns-water-supply/">an attack on the water system of a city in Florida</a> that saw hackers briefly increase the amount of sodium hydroxide in Oldsmar&#8217;s water treatment system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The $8.1 million investment lands three years after the startup secured $3.5 million in Series A funding. The company said it will use the funding to accelerate its sales and strategic collaborations internationally, with a focus on North America, Europe, Asia, and the United Arab Emirates.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa is home to more than a billion people where a majority have limited or no access to vehicle financing. In fact, the continent has the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world. In 2019, Africa had fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales. The U.S. sold more than 17 million new cars that same year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, owning a car is a luxury very few people can afford. It is a similar case across Africa where car owners often recycle used cars between themselves because of the difficulty of accessing new ones. <a href="https://moove.africa/">Moove</a>, an African mobility company with a fintech play, wants to change that and is raising $23 million in Series A to scale </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moove </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ladidelano?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAADcQ8FABjW5jO79MRu88xUjUK_mFd4LYxFc&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3Bkt9csYDZRM2gEus%2BEO0Mow%3D%3D"> Ladi Delano</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jideodunsi">Jide Odunsi</a> in 2019. In an interview with TechCrunch, Delano said he and Odunsi, whilst trying to figure out the problems to solve in Nigeria after years of running successful businesses, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> startled by the figures highlighted above: Less than a million new cars sold in an entire continent and over 17 million in the U.S. alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It became clear to us that people aren&#8217;t buying cars in Africa because there&#8217;s no access to finance. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you look anywhere else in the world, you have financing in most parts of the developed world when you try to buy a car</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s that way in the UK, or Europe and the US. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s driving mobility drive and vehicle sales,&#8221; Delano said during the interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders saw it as a huge task to address this deficit and figured that deploying an asset financing model was the go-to approach. Moove says it is democratizing vehicle ownership by employing a revenue-based vehicle financing model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this applies to only a subset of the driving population across the continent Moove calls mobility entrepreneurs.<br />
</span></p>
<p>These include drivers who work in the mobility space (car-hailing, ride-hailing, bus-hailing, among others). Although they make up a small part of Africans who need Moove&#8217;s services, Delano says the market for ‘mobility entrepreneurs’ is enormous.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the rational behind backing ride-hailing drivers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instead of the overall populace? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delano tells TechCrunch that inasmuch as Moove is changing how people have access to new cars in Africa, he wants the company to solve some of the unemployment problems facing the continent, even more so in Nigeria. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So instead of providing the service for individuals from all spheres of life who cannot guarantee a payback, why not target drivers who would use the opportunity to work and, in turn, generate income to pay back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moove is Uber’s exclusive car financing and vehicle supply partner in sub-Saharan Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company embeds its alternative credit-scoring technology, allowing access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite loans. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It provides loans to these drivers by selling them new vehicles and financing up to 95% of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within five days of sign up</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can choose to pay back their loans over 24, 36, or 48 months, using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Uber</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moove&#8217;s loan repayment process is more suitable to drivers than what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">traditionally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exists in the market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nigerian banks, for instance, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to collect a 10-50% deposit from drivers; Moove says it charges 5%. The net effective annual interest rate also differs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nigerian banks charge between 20 to 25%; however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Moove runs on an 8-13% rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, when you consider the tenure of a vehicle financing loan, Nigerian banks rarely give a repayment duration of more than two years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moove&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">maximum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> duration is four years. In the long run, Delano says the company wants to extend the repayment duration to five years, a span with more parity to the West</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Moove is looking to add financing to other vehicle classes and types in the coming months, including buses and trucks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Moove </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019, it didn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launch until June 2020. In a full year of operation, Moove has scaled </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggressively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With headquarters in the Netherlands, the company counts Lagos, Accra, Johannesburg as cities where it operates. Moove has 12,900 pre-approved sign-ups and its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">financed cars have also completed over 850,000 Uber trips. Delano says the company has grown 60% month-on-month since last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moove raised a $5.5 million seed round last year. The majority of the funding came from the founders and Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, co-founder of Andela and Flutterwave, and a key partner at the company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to its $23 million Series A, Moove also revealed that it raised $40 million in debt financing, bringing its total funding to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $68.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speedinvest and Left Lane Capital led the Series A round. Other investors like DCM, Clocktower Technology Ventures, thelatest.ventures, LocalGlobe, Tekton, FJ Labs, Palm Drive Capital, Roka Works, KAAF Investments, Class 5 Global, Victoria van Lennep, co-founder of Lendable, Verod, Kepple Africa Ventures, and one of Moove’s existing lenders, Emso Asset Management, also joined the round. Moove&#8217;s investment is the first for many of its U.S. backers in this round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With Ladi and Jide at the helm of a world-class team, and their unique approach to vehicle financing, Moove has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> established itself as one of the most exciting tech companies in Africa,” said the general partner at Speedinvest, Stefan Klestil. “The company’s expansion to three cities in under 12 months demonstrates the huge demand for vehicle financing in Africa, where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> five percent of new cars </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are purchased</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with financing, compared to 92 percent in Europe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delano and Odunsi are British-born Nigerians educated at the London School of Economics, Oxford University, and MIT. Delano has always been an entrepreneur. Odunsi, on the other hand, was an investment banker at Goldman Sachs and a management consultant at McKinsey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both reconnected years after (since parting ways in their teens) to run a venture studio called Grace Lake Partners and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have subsequently built three non-tech successful businesses in Africa in the past decade</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Moove is their first tech business, and Delano calls it the fastest-growing he has ever run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Series A funding will allow Moove to grow and expand into new markets. It gives the company ammunition to develop and launch new products and services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> geared</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> towards gaining more share in a competitive market where Nigeria&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/nigerias-autochek-raises-3-4m-for-car-sales-and-service-platform/">Autochek</a> and South Africa&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/south-africas-flexclub-adds-5m-to-seed-round-to-scale-its-car-subscription-marketplace/">FlexClub</a> are making significant strides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delano believes what gives Moove an edge over other companies is its trademark of getting drivers to access new cars instead of used ones. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also adds that the company is moving towards creating electric and hybrid vehicle fleets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He cites helping mobility entrepreneurs who need to have fuel-efficient cars and climate change as reasons for creating this new product line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how will EVs be affordable for the average Uber driver in Africa? Delano argues that with Moove&#8217;s strong bargaining power with its OEM partners and the debt financing raised, Moove can buy new EV cars and resell them at a lower price to thousands of drivers. The aim is to ensure that at least 60% of the vehicles it finances are electric or hybrid in the coming years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is also trying to drive gender inclusion by increasing the number of female drivers using its platform to 50%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One interesting bit in Moove&#8217;s imminent plans is creating wallets for drivers who do not have bank accounts to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">make and accept payments. The feature is live only in Ghana but will be coming to other markets in no distant time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Moove’s technology is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fundamentally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> changing access to mobility and empowering thousands to earn a new source of income,” said managing partner at Left Lane Capital, Dan Ahrens. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we look ahead, the potential for that technology and the Moove team to expand even further is very exciting</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They have the opportunity to become a full-service mobility fintech and expand their offerings to insurance and other financial services.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UpGrad, a Bangalore-based startup that specializes in higher education and upskilling courses, hit a valuation of $1.2 billion with a $185 million funding round Monday as global investors plow record capital into firms in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Singapore&#8217;s Temasek led the financing round while the World Bank&#8217;s International Finance Corporation and IIFL participated. The first tranche of this unnamed round &#8212; about $120 million &#8212; was completed in April this year at a valuation of over $600 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are pleased with the investor interest ever since we opened up for fundraise, and had our maiden raise from Temasek, followed by IFC and IIFL in the last 60 days,” said Ronnie Screwvala (pictured above), co-founder and chairperson of upGrad, in a statement.</p>
<p>Six-year-old UpGrad, which in recent months has pushed for expansion in international markets, offers students over 100 courses in data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain, finance, programming, and law in collaboration with universities such as Michigan State University, the IIT Madras and IIT Delhi, and Swiss School of Business Management, Geneva.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187198" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187198" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2187198 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/upgrad-india.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="541" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/upgrad-india.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/upgrad-india.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/upgrad-india.jpg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/upgrad-india.jpg?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/upgrad-india.jpg?resize=680,359 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/upgrad-india.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187198" class="wp-caption-text">UpGrad website</p></div></p>
<p>More than a million users from over four dozen nations have accessed the platform&#8217;s courses, the startup said. On its website, UpGrad says it has over 62,000 paid students. These courses cost between $3,300 to $6,750 and run for six months to two years.</p>
<p>UpGrad is among the scores of Indian edtech startups that has reported skyrocketing growth in recent quarters as students move online following the shutting of schools due to the pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SoftBank and Tiger Global-backed Unacademy was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/indian-edtech-unacademy-valued-at-3-44-billion-in-440-million-fundraise/">valued at $3.44 billion</a> in a $440 million fundraise it unveiled last Monday. GGV Capital-backed Vedantu is in advanced stages of talks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/india-edtech-firms-byjus-and-vedantu-not-holding-acquisition-talks/">finalize a new round</a> that is poised to crown it the unicorn title, TechCrunch reported last week. Byju&#8217;s, which has raised over $1.5 billion in the past one year or so, is India&#8217;s most valuable startup.</p>
<p>Screwvala said UpGrad will deploy the fresh funds to explore merger and acquisition opportunities. Screwvala, who pioneered the cable television business in the South Asian market and also produced several Bollywood blockbusters, sold his entertainment conglomerate UTV to Disney at an enterprise valuation of $1.4 billion in 2013.</p>
<p>UpGrad is the 21st Indian startup to become a unicorn this year, up from 11 last year. In recent quarters, high-profile investors such as Tiger Global, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Falcon Edge, and Temasek have doubled down on their bets on India.</p>

<p>Pintu’s previous funding, a $6 million Series A led by Pantera, Intudo and Coinbase Ventures, was announced in late May. Pintu is the latest investment app in Southeast Asia to quickly raise a much larger follow-on round as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a869e9c8-a48b-45d2-9fde-3c57b4214c0e">interest in retail investing grows</a>. Other examples include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/02/bibit-raises-another-growth-round-led-by-sequoia-capital-india-this-time-for-65m/">Bibit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/ajaib-raises-65m-series-a-extension-led-by-ribbit-capital-increasing-the-rounds-total-to-90m/">Ajaib</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investment-app-syfe-raises-29-6m-series-b-led-by-returning-investor-valar-ventures/">Syfe</a>.</p>
<p>Andrew Adjiputro, Pintu’s chief operating officer, told TechCrunch that Pintu raised a Series A+, instead of a Series A extension or Series B, because its focus on product development and execution is still the same. “With the Coinbase IPO and a lot of new users onboarding, we think it’s the right time for us to raise a larger round to finance faster growth,” he said. “It’s good momentum for us to launch new products and grab the market.”</p>

<p>Pintu plans to use its Series A+ on “aggressive” hiring for all its teams and rolling out new features and products. During the first half of 2021, Pintu says app downloads grew by 3.5x through organic growth, while active traders on the platform increased by 4x.</p>
<p>The platform currently offers trades on 16 cryptocurrencies, with plans to add more coins, including NFT tokens.</p>
<p>Adjiputro said Coinbase’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/coinbase-opens-at-381-per-share-valuing-the-crypto-exchange-at-nearly-100b/">successful initial public offering in April</a> helped fuel interest in crypto trading, especially among first-time investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“They became curious and the bread and butter of our business is essentially education,” said Adjiputro. “We have a lot of education on our platform and it attracts this new breed of investors who want to learn more.”</p>
<p>While the rate of retail investment in Indonesia is still low, it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/08/27/the-rise-of-the-retail-investor-a-new-force-in-indonesias-pandemic-hit-stock-market.html">growing quickly because of a confluence of factors</a>, including people’s desire to diversify and increase their assets during the pandemic.</p>
<p>For many of Pintu’s users, the app was their first introduction to investing instead of stocks, Adjiputro said. The company recently surveyed current users, asking about the top five asset classes they invest in. Crypto came in third after mutual funds and digital gold, and before stocks at number four.</p>
<p>The preference for crypto over stocks is echoed in figures <a href="https://kr-asia.com/over-6-5-million-indonesians-bought-or-sold-crypto-in-first-5-months-of-2021-ministry-of-trade-says">released by the Indonesian Ministry of Trade</a>, which showed that as of June 2021, there were over 6.5 million crypto investors in Indonesia, or about triple the 2.2 million public equity investors in the country.</p>
<p>Pintu is a licensed crypto broker under the Indonesian Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (BAPPEBTI). It has a low minimum investment rate of 11,000 IDR, or about 75 cents USD, making it more attractive to new investors.</p>
<p>Timothius Martin, the company’s chief marketing officer, was a first-time investor when he started using Pintu. He told TechCrunch that the number one draw was accessibility. “It’s easy to start investing and also withdraw assets. In Indonesia, we are now at a stage where people have heard about crypto, about Bitcoin, are very interested and may already want to invest, but there are not many options that are easy enough for them to understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of encouraging users to make an investment when they open the app for the first time, Pintu presents them with educational materials. For example, one of its features is Pintu Academy, a collection of articles and videos. While Pintu’s target demographic is millennials, it’s also attracting older demographics, including people who have traded other assets, like stocks, but want to learn more about the fundamentals of crypto trading.</p>

<p>Adjiputro said Pintu’s focus on education is what differentiates it from other Indonesian crypto platforms like Indodax and Tokocrypto.</p>
<p>The company is getting ready to launch new features, like Pintu Earn, a crypto asset account that lets users earn interest on a variety of crypto assets, and e-wallet integration for easier deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>It’s also deciding what coins to add next. “We’re very selective in terms of the coins we introduce, because this is a platform for first-time investors and beginners, so we want to protect them, not only in terms of our UI, but also the selection of coins we have,” Martin said.</p>
<p>Pintu’s criteria for new coins include ones that have a high market cap, meaning adoption is already relatively mainstream. It also looks at how long a coin has been around and its liquidity.</p>
<p>Pintu plans to focus on expanding in Indonesia before entering other Southeast Asian markets.</p>
<p>In a statement, Lightspeed partner Hemant Mohapatra said, “Lightspeed has invested in over 17 crypto and blockchain companies globally including FTX, Blockchain.com, Offchain Labs and more. We believe crypto is at an inflection point to become an important asset class globally, and will give rise to massive companies that will become regional leaders. Pintu has created the strongest market brand, best user experience and hands down one of the strongest teams we’ve ever come across in this market.”</p>
