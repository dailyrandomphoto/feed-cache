										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/adtech-not-checking-user-tcf-consent">research</a> examining what happens after Internet users in Europe land on an ad-supported website and express their &#8220;privacy choices&#8221; &#8212; using a flagship ad industry consent management platform which is supposed to allow them to control the types of ads they receive (i.e. non-tracking vs &#8220;personalized&#8221;) &#8212; has raised fresh questions over the IAB Europe&#8217;s self-styled Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF).</p>
<p>The TCF is already in hot water with privacy regulators.</p>
<p>Last month the IAB Europe announced that it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; and that the framework will also be found in breach. Although the IAB sought to suggest that a few tweaks will suffice to fix problems identified by the Belgian data protection authority (DPA).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248716" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re still waiting for publication of the final decision of the Belgian authority. But its preliminary findings &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">last year</a> &#8212; highlighted a litany of GDPR failures.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="454JUNMxH5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">IAB Europe says it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of GDPR</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IAB Europe says it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of GDPR&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/embed/#?secret=454JUNMxH5" data-secret="454JUNMxH5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Despite all that, the IAB has continued to argue the TCF is working as intending for the close to 800 adtech vendors who are thought to participate in the system, loudly rejecting criticism of it. Its CEO, Townsend Feehan, for example, pooh-poohed criticism earlier this month &#8212; telling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/europe-tracking-consent-iccl-iab-eu-gdpr-153055765.html">Engadget</a> that &#8220;none of this [tracking] happens if the user says no&#8221;.</p>
<p>However the new study throws doubt on the claim that if a user says &#8216;no&#8217; to tracking/behavioral ads via the IAB&#8217;s TCF, the adtech industry respectfully falls into line.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A key piece of this research examined how the adtech ecosystem responds to user signals that request only <em>basic</em>, i.e. non-tracking-based ads, to examine how ad vendors respond when users say no to &#8220;personalized&#8221; ads.</p>
<p>Here the researchers found evidence to suggest that many adtech vendors continue to track and profile Internet users when they have explicitly said they don&#8217;t want tracking-based ads.</p>
<p>While a number of earlier studies have found problems with how publishers in the EU have implemented cookie consents, such as tracking cookies being dropped prior to asking a site visitor for their permission, this new research, carried out by adtech researcher, <a href="https://adalytics.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adalytics</a>, aims to zero in on the TCF framework itself &#8212; by examining instances where ad-supported websites have faithfully reported users&#8217; ad choices.</p>
<p>Problematic data flows after that implicate the adtech industry itself &#8212; and the claims it makes for the TCF as a flagship compliance tool &#8212; because it suggests the framework fails to accurately reflect and <em>actually respect</em> users&#8217; &#8220;privacy choices&#8221; once they are passed to ad &#8220;partners&#8221;.</p>
<p>Listing a series of takeaways, Adalytics writes that the findings suggest:</p>
<ol>
<li>Many major ad tech vendors continue to track and profile EU users, even when an EU user has explicitly objected</li>
<li>The TCF strings that were designed by IAB Europe do not appear to be honored or parsed correctly by many ad tech vendors</li>
<li>Some ad tech vendors may not be able demonstrate they obtained user data with user consent, which may expose them to contractual compliance, investor/shareholder disclosure, and regulatory risks</li>
<li>In many instances, it is impossible for users to support media creators by allowing “basic ads” whilst disallowing tracking and behavioral profiling to protect their own privacy</li>
</ol>
<p>Although it&#8217;s important to note there are limits to what the researchers were able to observe via Chrome Developer Tools &#8212; given that any processing being done on adtech companies&#8217; own servers isn&#8217;t verifiable by such external research.</p>
<p>Understanding the full picture of what&#8217;s done with people&#8217;s data once the adtech ecosystem gets its hands on it is difficult. But that also cuts to the heart of surveillance-based advertising&#8217;s problem with complying with the GDPR &#8212; which also requires, accountability, transparency and security when processing people&#8217;s data, as well as a valid legal basis to do so.</p>
<p>Even setting those major overarching problems aside, just the fact of tracking cookies being dropped and user data being passed around when a person has explicitly said it should not be looks, well, awkward for the IAB&#8217;s TCF.</p>
<p>To study data activity at the adtech end of the framework, the researchers ran tests in a number of countries in the EU &#8212; visiting websites they manually verified had correctly configured the framework to send the user&#8217;s consent string, and selecting only basic ads; refusing personalized/tracking-based ads/profiling etc and also limited the choice of adtech processor to a single vendor.</p>
<p>The testers also made sure to object to &#8220;legitimate interests&#8221; so that their consent preferences could not be bypassed in that way.</p>
<p>If the TCF was functioning as Feehan&#8217;s remarks to Engadget earlier this month suggest &#8212; i.e. if users can just deny tracking simply by saying &#8216;no&#8217; via the TCF &#8212; the researchers would have expected to observe data flowing <em>only</em> as the individual had specified it should.</p>
<p>Instead, they found &#8212; in most cases &#8212; data flows that looked very different vs the choices that had been expressed.</p>
<p>The paper also details numerous instances of tracking cookies being set <em>prior</em> to the user&#8217;s consent choices even being signalled. (Although they say they excluded such examples from their analysis as they were specifically aiming to study what happens <em>after</em> a user has submitted their choices via the TCF.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK privacy watchdog warns adtech the end of tracking is nigh&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/ico-adtech-reform-opinion/embed/#?secret=BZ1QUlaUEV" data-secret="BZ1QUlaUEV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Examples cited in the study of adtech vendors appearing to override/ignore TCF signals denying tracking include a visitor with a Belgian IP address to a popular local news website,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nieuwsblad.be &#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who provides consent to basic ads only, and only consents to ads from Google (so they&#8217;re explicitly rejecting &#8220;personalized&#8221; ads and profiling) &#8212; yet who, on checking </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chrome Developer Tools for network HTTP requests, observes HTTPS requests sent to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ib.adnxs.com</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> domain owned by AppNexus (aka Xandr), which responds by dropping a cookie</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> called “uuid2” set for three months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Given that [this user] objected to personalised ads and creating a personalised profile, only provided consent to Google, and the fact that these consent choices were directly included in the HTTP request to adnxs.com, it is not clear why the AppNexus server responded by setting a persistent, advertising related cookie in [the user&#8217;s] browser</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; the researchers observe.</span></p>
<p>In another example, a user with a French IP address visits the news website lemonde.fr and once again &#8212; despite not consenting to any cookies or purposes offered in the consent banner &#8212; <span style="font-weight: 400;">they see HTTPS request being sent to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">id5-sync.com</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which responds by setting a cookie called “id5” for three months, and triggering a 302 HTTP redirect to sync data with rtb-csync.smartadserver.com. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This specific HTTPS request that was sent to id5-sync.com contains the previously mentioned TCF string in a query string parameter called &#8220;gdpr_consent&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; the researchers report, adding that: &#8220;The domain <em>id5-sync.com</em> belongs to ID5, a London-based “<a href="https://id5.io/platform-privacy-policy/">identity platform</a> for the digital advertising industry”.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They further note that the ID5 Universal ID is described in a github overview as a &#8220;shared, neutral identifier that publishers, advertisers, and ad tech platforms can use to recognise users&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>So, again, if the user is saying they don&#8217;t want to be identified and tracked for ads, why is the id5 cookie being dropped at all?</p>
<p>In another example detailed in the study, also involving a French IP address &#8212; this time the user visits the newspaper<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">latribune.fr &#8212; the user&#8217;s consent choices are again apparently tossed in the virtual trash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this instance the user had specified they wanted basic ads served by US supply side platform OpenX. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Openx.net</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was observed triggering user ID syncs with &#8220;numerous other parties&#8221;, including Amazon, Google, DataXu, AppNexus, Beeswax (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bidr.io</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Adelphic Predictive Data platform (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ipredictive.com</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), AdPilot (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">erne.co</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Simplifi Holdings (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">simpli.fi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and others, per the study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another example &#8212; involving a French IP user visiting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">atlantico.fr; and consenting to basic ads from Google only &#8212; the user sees a &#8220;lot of HTTPS requests being made with this TCF consent string, some of which appear to be user data syncing or setting tracking cookies&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers go on to note that: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A request sent to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s.cpx.to</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> responses by setting a cookie for 1-year called “cpSess”. This domain is owned by London-based Captify, and the “cpSess” cookie </span><a href="https://www.captifytechnologies.com/data-subject-rights-request/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appears to be used</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to store and link personal information about the user&#8221; &#8212; before citing another source that suggests this cookie is &#8220;used as a tracking mechanism for [&#8230;] advertising companies&#8221; and &#8220;helps with the delivery of targeted marketing adverts whilst users browse&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>The study details numerous other examples of unexpected data flows and syncing being observed after the user has asked not to be tracked.</p>
<p>The researchers also detail results of large-scale automated tests, as well as the manual examples cited above &#8212; based on crawler data from 48,698 different publisher domains &#8212; and here they found evidence of &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of ad requests erroneously claiming the GDPR does not apply to web users who were actually in the EU&#8230;</p>
<p>Out of 35,389 publishers found to have an HTTPS request that was sent to an ad tech vendor and contained either the ‘gdpr=0’ query string parameter, or the ‘gdpr=1’ query string parameter, 28,941 (81.8%) contained at least one HTTPS request sent to an ad tech vendor, wherein the query string macro parameter “gdpr=” was set to “0” &#8212; meaning they were signalling the GDPR does not apply.</p>
<p>More from Adalytics&#8217; write up:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;According to the IAB <a href="https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md#full-tc-string-passing">TCF documentation</a> and to <a href="https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/9805023?hl=en">Google’s documentation</a>, “1 indicates that GDPR applies and 0 indicates that it does not.” Many ad tech vendors were observed processing the German and Finnish user data when “gdpr=0”, despite the crawler not having clicked on the CMP consent banner. In each of these cases, the ad tech vendor could have validated that the user was in fact in the EU by performing a simple<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_geolocation"> IP address geolocation lookup</a>. However, it appears that many take this “gdpr=0” parameter at face value, without performing any additional server-side checks, prior to sending tracking cookies or performing user data syncs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>To try to verify this finding, Adalytics says it reached out to a programmatic media buyer who <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">was targeting</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> ads to users across the EU, UK, and Switzerland. This buyer had their ads served a total of 111 million times &#8212; while the “gdpr_applies” macro was set to “0” 42.3% of the time &#8212; &#8220;indicating that the ad tech company involved was claiming that the GDPR does not apply to these users&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Yet on checking where those 47M ads were served, by using</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> an IP address geo-location lookup service, Adalytics reports that the advertiser found the majority were served to users based in Spain, Croatia, Italy, France, and other EU countries, meaning the GDPR does actually apply&#8230;  </span></p>
<p>&#8220;If ad tech companies are not checking the integrity of the “gdpr_applies” strings by performing IP address geolocation checks, they may end up misleading their advertiser clients about the relevant regulations that apply to their advertising campaigns,&#8221; Adalytics goes on to warn.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">findings further highlight the scale of the problem of ad fraud &#8212; and, where the IAB Europe’s TCF framework is concerned, suggest it offers merely a veneer of legal compliance because it isn&#8217;t actually capable of doing what&#8217;s claimed on the tin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All-too-often adtech vendors have not properly implemented and deployed it, per the research findings &#8212; making the &#8220;Transparency and Consent Framework&#8221; at best, a sham; or, well, compliance theatre. </span></p>
<p>Little wonder this whole system is in regulatory hot water &#8212; although the length of time it&#8217;s taken EU watchdogs to interrogate the reality underlying the adtech industry&#8217;s claims continues to be extremely troubling for anyone who cares about democratic oversight and fundamental rights.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Privacy experts slam UK&#8217;s &#8216;disastrous&#8217; failure to tackle unlawful adtech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/embed/#?secret=TAyraDwWQG" data-secret="TAyraDwWQG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The conclusion that we make in our study is that the adtech vendors have not taken the time, money and engineering labor hours to properly configure their servers and APIs,&#8221; Adalytics&#8217; founder Krzysztof Franaszek told TechCrunch, discussing the research. &#8220;In theory, all TCF participants&#8230; should have set up their servers and APIs in a way that checks and validates the TCF strings.</p>
<p>&#8220;If an API receives some user data, to which the TCF string shows the user has not consented, the vendor should immediately discard and avoid doing anything with that data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Franaszek noted that the researchers did observe at least one example of correct behavior &#8212; an instance where AppNexus received a TCF string that did not allow personalization, or for a vendor called Index Exchange to get the data, and &#8220;properly/rightfully configured their server to respond with an HTTP 400 error code, that says &#8216;Request failed due to privacy signals'&#8221;.</p>
<p>However he pointed out that that&#8217;s what &#8220;ALL 795 TCF companies <em>should be</em> doing&#8221;, and the study shows &#8212; on the contrary &#8212; many companies are simply not checking the strings.</p>
<p>Also commenting on the findings, Johnny Ryan, a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties &#8212; and a long time adtech whistleblower who has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/irelands-data-watchdog-slammed-for-letting-adtech-carry-on-biggest-breach-of-all-time/">filed numerous complaints</a> over real-time-bidding&#8217;s (RTB) abuse of personal data &#8212; said the study is just the latest illustration that &#8220;the TCF was just a bad idea&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no control. No technical measure to actually control what happens to the data,&#8221; Ryan told TechCrunch. &#8220;This means the TCF can never fulfil its purported objectives of providing control and transparency.</p>
<p>&#8220;The central argument we made to the Belgian APD [DPA] is that the TCF&#8217;s inevitable failure, due to the inherent and known insecurity of RTB, means that in addition to being an unnecessary nuisance in the lives of all Europeans, the TCF also infringes the data minimization principle [of GDPR] because it processes TCF string personal data for a purpose that is impossible to achieve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ryan also pointed back to some 2017 IAB correspondence &#8212; which came to light back in <a href="https://fixad.tech/february2019/">2019</a> via FOI &#8212; in which Feehan, who was at the time seeking to lobby the European Commission on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy/">ePrivacy rules</a>, implies consent is incompatible with RTB &#8212; attaching a paper to her email to EU lawmakers with the observation that “it is technically impossible for the user to have prior information about every data controller involved in a real-time bidding (RTB) scenario”.</p>
<p>And for consent to be valid under GDPR it must be specific, <em>informed</em>, and &#8212; indeed &#8212; freely given.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to the Adalytics study &#8212; such as the manual component being limited to a small number of publishers that &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">appear to correctly encode user consent input, in order to rule out the possibility that a publisher’s or CMP’s errors were resulting in user profiling occurring without a user’s consent&#8221;, as Franaszek puts it.</span></p>
<p>It is also not clear how many/what proportion of the 795 adtech companies using the TCF system aren&#8217;t properly respecting user choices. The instance cited above where a user denial of consent was correctly responded to shows it can happen. How often it does is a whole other matter, though.</p>
<p>In any case, those vendors observed by the researchers apparently not respecting users&#8217; denial of tracking included &#8220;several multi-billion dollar multinationals like Rubicon, Pubmatic, Amazon, Google and Trade Desk&#8221;, per Franaszek.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think if you look at the stock market capitalization of the vendors that we examined, it&#8217;s far greater than 50% of the total digital advertising industry,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>A more general caveat is that, <span style="font-weight: 400;">given the adtech industry&#8217;s highly opaque character, it&#8217;s always difficult to understand how data is or isn&#8217;t being processed &#8212; and the researchers acknowledge that a lot of &#8220;nuance&#8221; is required to interpret the data in a section of the paper discussing limitations.  </span></p>
<p>The study has also not gone through formal peer review so has not been subject to the rigorous academic process required if it had been published in a peer reviewed journal.</p>
<p>But, well, the findings sure don&#8217;t look good for adtech.</p>
<p>Per public documentation on a <a href="https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/pubvendors.json%20v1.0%20Draft%20for%20Public%20Comment.md">github repository</a> for v1.0 of the IAB&#8217;s TCF framework, the ad industry body suggested that their &#8212; at that time &#8212; incoming &#8220;technical industry solution&#8221; would allow website operators to:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Control the vendors they wish to allow to access their users&#8217; browsers (for setting and reading cookies) and process their personal data and disclose these choices to other parties in the online advertising ecosystem</li>
<li>Seek user consent under the ePrivacy Directive (for setting cookies or similar technical applications that access information on a device) and/or the GDPR in line with applicable legal requirements and signal the consent status through the online advertising ecosystem</li>
</ol>
<p>The question that naturally follows from those stated capabilities is well, what then? What happens after users&#8217; &#8216;privacy choices&#8217; are signalled to the data-gobbling adtech ecosystem? How does the TCF actually <em>ensure</em> ad vendors respect people&#8217;s choices?</p>
<p>Adalytics&#8217; research is just the latest study to suggest that industry standard pop-up &#8220;privacy choices&#8221; are a mirage; a suggestive illusion of choice wrapped in a pantomime of consent in a bid to square the impossible circle for surveillance ads: GDPR compliance.</p>
<p>Because it seems the only way to be sure the &#8220;choice&#8221; that you ask the TCF to pass on to adtech vendors will get respected is if you ask for the tracking to continue&#8230;</p>
<p>The IAB has been contacted for comment on Adalytics&#8217; research, and also with questions regarding whether it takes any steps to verify that participating ad vendors are complying with TCF strings expressing user choices.</p>
<p>We have also asked the IAB how it expects to adapt the framework &#8212; and its own activities &#8212; in order to come into compliance with GDPR, in light of the Belgian finding of a breach.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll update this report with any response.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hevo Data, a SaaS startup that is helping firms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/hevo-draws-in-8-million-series-a-for-its-no-code-data-pipeline-service/">collate troves of data they generate and accumulate</a> to make better use of them, has raised $30 million in a new financing round following a strong year of growth.</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital India led the San Francisco and Bangalore-headquartered startup’s $30 million Series B round. A number of investors including Qualgro, Lachy Groom, and Chiratae Ventures also participated in the round, which pushes the five-year-old startup all-time funding to $43 million.</p>
<p>Firms, with so many divisions such as marketing, engineering, and design, engage with numerous services and platforms for their business. But the data they generate and rely on sits in silos within those divisions, making it difficult for the firm as a whole to gain real-time visibility into it and take actionable decisions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249176" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://hevodata.com">Hevo Data</a> has built a data pipeline platform to make it exceedingly easy for firms to integrate and fetch data from different sources to one dashboard as well as to supply it to popular cloud data-warehouses such as Snowflake, Google BigQuery, and Amazon Redshift, explained Manish Jethani, co-founder and chief executive of the startup, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Different parts of the company use different types of software for their work. But if the data doesn’t flow across different departments, nobody will have full visibility into what all that is happening,” he said, drawing parallels with the flow of blood in a human body.</p>
<p>“So as a business, if I have invested thousands of dollars in marketing, I would want to know how many users came and bought – or not purchase – from the platform and how many times they made the purchase. How much money did I end up making per order? This would help me inform how I should be tweaking my marketing spends,” he said. “For this, I have to combine my marketing, orders data, finance data, and customer support data,” he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a challenge that Jethani grappled with in his previous startup, called SpoonJoy, which he sold to Grofers. After moving to Grofers, a much bigger startup, Jethani said he realized that even larger firms face this challenge. (He said that companies as large as Amazon and Flipkart tend to build their own workflows and have large workforces to tackle this.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup’s offering combines data from multiple disparate sources and applications including sales CRM, advertising channels, marketing tech, financial system software, and customer support products to build a 360-degree view of their business and customers, said Jethani.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249182" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249182" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2249182 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hevo-data-integrations.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="303" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hevo-data-integrations.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hevo-data-integrations.jpg?resize=150,45 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hevo-data-integrations.jpg?resize=300,91 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hevo-data-integrations.jpg?resize=768,233 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hevo-data-integrations.jpg?resize=680,206 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hevo-data-integrations.jpg?resize=50,15 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249182" class="wp-caption-text">Some popular integrations offered by Hevo.</p></div></p>
<p>One of the additional value prepositions of Hevo is that it’s a no-code platform. Individuals are not spending much time – or require any technical understanding in – establishing the integrations to get the data to flow to a central hub, he said. (The accessibility is as simple as setting up an action on IFTTT, for instance.) Hevo features <a href="https://hevodata.com/integrations/">over 100 pre-built integrations</a> across databases, SaaS applications, cloud storage, SDKs, and streaming services.</p>
<p>The startup said it has amassed over 1,000 customers across multiple categories in more than 40 countries and will deploy the fresh funds to develop new products as it moves to tap a bigger slice of the market. The startup said it grew by a whopping 500% in the past year. One of the new offerings it is working on is an insight platform that will enable users to do analysis with the data they are collating.</p>
<p>Another product in the works is called &#8220;Reverse ETL,&#8221; which will aim to help customers use their data beyond just the analytics use case, he said.</p>
<p>“Data has become one of the most important business inputs in the last decade. Hevo Data is building foundational infrastructure to enable bi-directional mobility of data,” said Tejeshwi Sharma, MD at Sequoia India, in a statement.</p>
<p>“The more mobile data becomes within organizations, the more useful it shall be. We are impressed by the product DNA of the company &#8211; the secret behind the widely loved product combines the duality of technical sophistication and consumer grade experience. Sequoia Capital India is delighted to double down on the partnership with Hevo and lead the Series B round.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A digital mobile overdraft facility christened <a href="https://www.safaricom.co.ke/personal/m-pesa/credit-and-savings/fuliza">Fuliza</a>, by Kenya’s biggest telco Safaricom Plc, is giving the country’s popular loan apps a run for their money barely three years after its launch.</p>
<p>Fuliza allows Safaricom customers to access unsecured credit by overdrawing on M-Pesa – the telecommunication company mobile money wallet that allows its users to pay bills, send, receive and withdraw money through their phones.</p>
<p>The uptake of Fuliza is currently at 18.3% across the country while that of loan apps decreased by 6.2 percentage points to 2.1% in the last two years, a <a href="https://www.knbs.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-Finaccess-Household-Survey-Report.pdf">study</a> by the country’s monetary authority, Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) in collaboration with Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) and Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSD) Kenya shows.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249002" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The latest bi-annual FinAccess Household Survey report said digital loan apps experienced the largest decline in usage when compared to other financial products and services by credit-unions, banks and microfinance institutions.</p>
<p>“This may be explained by competition from formal digital credit products like Fuliza, (and) unfair debt collection practices by the digital loan apps,” said the report.</p>
<p>The report also said that a directive by the CBK, barring unlicensed digital lenders from sharing the personal details of loan defaulters with credit reference bureaus (CRBs), may have deterred the apps from lending to customers viewed as risky.</p>
<p>Additionally, the uncertainty around the regulation of the apps by the CBK during the Covid-19 peak may have prevented them from extending credit to new borrowers. A bill on the regulation of digital lenders was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/kenyas-president-signs-new-law-to-police-digital-lenders-apps-have-six-months-to-apply-for-licenses/">tabled before Kenya’s legislative assembly and was just this month signed into a law</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Digital Lenders Association of Kenya, which represents about 25 digital lenders out of the over 100 operating in Kenya, told TechCrunch in a past interview that its members generally give out loans worth $40 million every month, an amount that was, however, halved during Covid.</p>
<p>Fuliza, which is formally registered and licensed, operates in partnership with two local banks – KCB and NCBA. The product seems to have filled the mobile lending void obstructed by regulation, and has has now stepped-up competition for mobile loan apps like the Silicon-valley backed Branch, which launched in Kenya in 2015, and the pay-pal supported Tala, which set-up operations in the country in 2014 – one of the first digital lenders to enter the East African country.</p>
<p>According to a Safaricom <a href="https://www.safaricom.co.ke/images/Downloads/Safaricom_2021_Sustainable_Business_Report.pdf">report</a>, the telco extended $3.1 billion in Fuliza credit during the 2020/21 financial year, a 43 percent increase from the previous year. This translates to an estimated $12 million credit that Fuliza extends to Kenyans every day. Safaricom has 23.8 million M-Pesa customers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout"><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="Fuliza amount disbursed over the years" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/waTe4/6/#?secret=q45ZiNBiK9" data-secret="q45ZiNBiK9" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="267"></iframe></div>
<p>The genesis of mobile lending in Kenya can be traced back to 2012, when Safaricom launched M-Shwari, a mobile-based savings and loans product, that is still running in partnership with NCBA Bank. Since then, Kenya has experienced a flurry of digital and micro-lending apps, amounting to hundreds.</p>
<p>Loan apps and facilities such as Fuliza offer instant collateral-free credit, overshadowing loans by conventional banking facilities, which go through lengthy approval processes, while mostly requiring extensive collateral. These fintech innovations may also be one of the reasons why Kenya’s formal financial inclusion is at 83.7% in 2021 from 26.7% in 2006.</p>
<p>However, while the lending apps have provided credit relief to people left out by the formal banking sector, they have operated in an unregulated environment for years until a fortnight ago when the president signed a new law giving CBK the authority to license and oversee their operations.</p>
<p>The lack of regulation has left gaps for predatory pricing, with some of the apps charging annualized interest rates exceeding 800%, leaving many borrowers impoverished.</p>
<p><strong>Debt crisis</strong></p>
<p>The FinAccess report states that half (50.9%) of the surveyed respondents had failed to repay loans sourced from the lending apps.</p>
<p>“The top three credit providers where a majority of respondents reported to have defaulted on a credit facility are; mobile banking loan (including Fuliza), digital apps loan and loan from family/friend/neighbor,” said the report.</p>
<p>Among the leading concerns for borrowers was the high cost of accessing and maintaining the loans due to the exorbitant interest rates by the mobile lenders. Unexpected charges, mostly imposed after repayment default, and a lack of transparency in pricing and other charges beforehand were also cited as worrisome issues.</p>
<p>To fix the problem of hidden charges,the country’s competition authority communicated that it will from June next year require all digital lenders to disclose their full fees and penalties every four months.</p>
<p>Besides, with the newly-passed law, lenders are compelled to apply for licenses from the CBK, as compared to previously, when they only had to register to set up operations.</p>
<p>They are also instructed to observe customer confidentiality and not share data with third parties– usually debt collectors. The latter requirement, especially, shields borrowers from rogue digital lenders that use debt shaming tactics when collecting monies owed to them by borrowers. Non-compliance will lead to the revocation of licenses.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company's tools digitize for small businesses what was traditionally done manually and on paper, like invoices.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getfuzey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fuzey</a>, a London-based company providing what it calls a “digital one-stop shop” for small businesses and independent contractors, raised $4.5 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The round was led by byFounders with participation from Flash Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Ascension and a group of angel investors, including Index Ventures’ venture partner Stephane Kurgan and Amplo VC founder and CEO Sheel Tyle.</p>
<p>The latest round gives the company $5.2 million in total funding since the company was founded in 2020 by Henrik Lysgaard Jensen and Alex Boyce. As part of the investment, byFounders investor Sara Rywe and Flash Ventures partner Lorenzo Franzi have joined the company’s board.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248896" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>CEO Lysgaard Jensen and COO Boyce met each other about two years ago and bonded over helping small businesses digitize. Targeting small business owners, like plumbers, electricians and mechanics, Lysgaard Jensen believes local businesses “are the backbone of every community,” but many of the tools developed for business management are either out of reach to businesses like this nor designed with them in mind.</p>
<p>Other startups are also calling attention to these types of businesses. In November, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/puls-technologies-on-demand-home-repair-service/">Puls Technologies raised $15 million</a> for its mobile app connecting tradespeople with on-demand home repair services. There are also larger companies in the space, like Jobber, which announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/jobber-raises-60m-as-its-platform-for-home-service-professionals-hits-100k-users/">$60 million in funding</a> at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>This area is also particularly personal for Boyce, who explained that his mother is a small business owner who ran much of her business out of a leather-bound notebook, always fearing that it might get lost.</p>
<p>“These are topics we are working through,” he told TechCrunch. “We thought about how we could become agents of change during the pandemic, which was a wake-up call as we saw shifting consumer demands, people wanting to get more technology-centric and engage with local merchants in different ways.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As such, the company&#8217;s tools digitize for small businesses what was traditionally done manually and on paper, like invoices. It brings together communications, payments, marketing and calendars into one dashboard to manage their businesses and amp up their online profiles.</p>
<p>Users are able to communicate with their customers through a variety of methods, from messaging to social media, while also generating invoices for instant payment and insights into lead generation. Fuzey also offers document templates and one-click customer reviews to make the process of leaving a review easier.</p>
<p>“Response time is important, and we even have response templates with predefined questions or comments so you can get back to customers quickly,” Lysgaard Jensen said. “We are big believers in the 20, 30, 40-time impact of this.”</p>
<p>The company, which went live with its product in June, will utilize the new funding on product development and geographical expansion. It is already operating in select markets in Europe, the U.S. and Canada. Fuzey has 10 employees right now and is seeing double-digit growth month over month in both customers and revenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alibaba has always aspired to bring its e-commerce service to customers outside China. Its strategy is multi-thronged. The giant&#8217;s house-developed AliExpress has found success <a href="https://www.alizila.com/aliexpress-russia-social-commerce-joint-venture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Russia</a> in recent years. In 2016, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/18/alibaba-doubles-down-on-lazada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought Lazada</a>, which came out of the Rocket Internet empire, and has helped the Southeast Asia-focused marketplace compete.</p>
<p>Lazada grew 80% to hit 130 million annual active consumers in the 18 months ended September, according to a <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/ir/presentations/Investor_Day_2021_Lazada.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation</a> at Alibaba&#8217;s investor day on Thursday. Its monthly active <em>users</em> as of September were 159 million &#8212; larger than its AAC likely because not every user on Lazada ends up purchasing things.</p>
<p>Like its Chinese sister app Taobao, Lazada has introduced entertainment features like livestreaming and games that try to lock users in, making it more than a pure shopping app.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249143" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lazada wrapped up 2021 with $21 billion in gross merchandise value, the amount of sales before expenses are deducted. 922,000 sellers, many of whom are from China, were active monthly on the marketplace as of September, more than doubling the pool size from a year ago.</p>
<p>Alibaba is hardly the only Chinese tech titan wrestling for a slice of Southeast Asia&#8217;s flourishing digital economy. Its nemesis Tencent is one of the main investors in Sea Group, which operates Lazada&#8217;s rival platform Shopee. In 2020, Sea logged<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210302005582/en/Sea-Limited-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $35.4 billion in GMV</a>.</p>
<p>Alibaba&#8217;s other Chinese competitor, JD.com, saw its Indonesia e-commerce unit JD.ID rise up to unicorn valuation in early 2020, TechCrunch learned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two years ago, a group of entrepreneurs in Pakistan began surveying the market to understand why financial services weren’t reaching the majority of merchants in the world’s fifth most populous nation.</p>
<p>On Friday, Tiger Global said it is backing their startup, <a href="http://creditbook.pk/">CreditBook</a>, to help address those challenges. This is the New York-headquartered firm’s first investment in Pakistan.</p>
<p>A number of other investors, including Better Tomorrow Ventures, Firstminute Capital, Banana Capital, VentureSouq, Ratio Ventures and i2i Ventures, as well as angel investors Sriram Krishnan and Julian Shapiro also participated in the $11 million pre-Series A round. This is also Firstminute Capital’s first investment in the South Asian market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249105" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We started the research and began experimentation in late 2019,” said Iman Jamall, co-founder of CreditBook, in an interview with TechCrunch. “I was working as a service designer on a project for one of the largest Pakistani banks at the time and was observing different persona types to understand why financial services hadn&#8217;t made inroads in the country.”</p>
<p>The challenges that Jamall, one of the few female founders in the country, identified were cash flow, the role of credit and the social relationships around it, and the over reliance on “paper for everything essentially,” she said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249107" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249107" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2249107 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="800" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249107" class="wp-caption-text">Images credit: CreditBook</p></div></p>
<p>The over reliance on paper to maintain ledger and the always-running low cash flow is a challenge that merchants in many markets in South Asia and Southeast Asia share. As we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/from-indias-richest-man-to-amazon-and-100s-of-startups-the-great-rush-to-win-neighborhood-stores/">previously covered</a>, often these small businesses run on informal credit and rely on money they secure from selling their existing inventory to buy their next batch. The customers buy things for weeks and sometimes months before they clear the tab.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These shortcomings are hurting these small businesses and mom and pop stores and impeding their growth at a time when large e-commerce giants are attempting to court customers.</p>
<p>CreditBook today offers a bookkeeping app to merchants, enabling them to digitize the handwritten ledger that they have traditionally used to keep track of daily accounts.</p>
<p>The eponymous mobile app has amassed merchants in over 400 towns and cities, the startup said. CreditBook declined to reveal the number of merchants who are using the service, but said that the number of transacting users has increased by 10 times since last year.</p>
<p>Digital bookkeeping is the startup’s marquee offering today, but Jamall said CreditBook is working on building and testing financial products on top of it. It’s too early to unveil precisely what those financial products would look like, she said. (But it’s definitely not e-commerce, she said.)</p>
<p>Jamall offered some context around the areas CreditBook is exploring. “In Pakistan, there is a huge whitespace in payments. But mobile money has started to gain traction, especially amid the pandemic,” she said, adding that the local regulator has also made a push in recent years to accelerate the adoption of mobile payments and is focusing on building an instant payments infrastructure. (Similar to India’s UPI, which in recent years has become the most popular way users transact online.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a massive opportunity. CreditBook estimates that there&#8217;s a $45 billion unmet financing gap for small businesses. Pakistan, home of over 220 million people, 60% of whom is under the age of 30.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with CreditBook and make Tiger Global’s first investment into Pakistan,” said John Curtius, a Partner at Tiger Global, in a statement. “The investment is a testament to the incredible traction and vision demonstrated by the team.”</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s announcement builds on what has been a watershed year for Pakistan&#8217;s fast-growing startup ecosystem as several global investors, including Kleiner Perkins, Addition, 20VC and Buckley Ventures make their first bets in the country. Startups in Pakistan have raised over $300 million this year, more than previous six years combined. Grocery delivery startup Krave Mart announced earlier this week it had raised $6 million in its pre-seed funding round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Journalists, activists, and human rights defenders face a constant battle to keep files safe from a growing set of digital threats and surveillance. But physical attacks can be challenging to defend against, whether an opportunist snatch-and-grab thief or an oppressive government kicking down someone&#8217;s door.</p>
<p>This week, a <a href="https://www.buskill.in/">project called BusKill</a> launched a custom USB magnetic breakaway cable that acts as a &#8220;dead man&#8217;s switch,&#8221; locking a computer if someone physically snatches it and severs the magnetic connectors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249111" style="width: 545px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249111" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2249111 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/buskill.gif" alt="" width="535" height="301" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249111" class="wp-caption-text">The BusKill cable locking a computer when the severed. (Image: BusKill)</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249109" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>BusKill has been in the works for more than two years as a <a href="https://docs.buskill.in/buskill-app/en/stable/">do-it-yourself project</a>. Anyone with the hardware could compile the source code, but it only worked on Linux and components quickly sold out.</p>
<p>After a <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/alt-shift/buskill">crowdsourcing effort</a>, the cable is now available to buy starting at $59 and has an accompanying app that works on macOS, Windows, and Linux, allowing the person using the cable to easily arm and disarm the cable with a touch of a button.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most people aren&#8217;t handling top-secret documents from whistleblowers and worried about the secret police knocking down their doors, but that&#8217;s the level of risk that I designed BusKill for,&#8221; the project&#8217;s creator Michael Altfield told TechCrunch. &#8220;And I wanted it to be accessible to journalists who don&#8217;t necessarily use Linux and don&#8217;t know how to use the CLI [command line interface].&#8221;</p>
<p>BusKill is designed to lock your computer when it’s physically separated from you, but Linux users can further configure the app to trigger a self-destruct command, which scrambles the device&#8217;s cryptographic keys, rendering the computer&#8217;s data inaccessible in just a few seconds.</p>
<p>The project also plans to release triggers that shuts down a computer when the magnetic cable is severed.</p>
<p>Although Altfield said BusKill was designed with journalists and activists in mind, the cable can also protect the computers of travelers on vacation and other high-risk users, like crypto traders.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/byjus-spac-public-listing/">Byju’s could go public via SPAC:</a> </strong>In the wake of Grab’s mega-SPAC deal, Indian edtech giant Byju’s could be prepping to take a similar path to the U.S. public markets, TechCrunch reports. Our own Manish Singh notes that Byju’s is “seeking a valuation of over $45 billion and looking to raise as much as $4 billion” in the transaction.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/reddit-ipo/"><strong>Reddit files to go public:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Speaking of mega-public offerings for early 2022, Reddit announced today that it filed to go public. The social company’s filing is still private, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/a-few-questions-about-the-impending-reddit-ipo/">but TechCrunch has <em>questions</em>, y’all</a>. It’s a tossup regarding which dataset we’re more excited about between Byju’s and Reddit, but the start of next year is looking busy. Already.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/internet-association-shuts-down/">Tech’s collective lobbying group falls apart:</a> </strong>The Internet Association is winding down, TechCrunch reports. The lobbying group once represented a diverse set of tech companies, which was perhaps its downfall. Given that its members don’t agree on all matters, the shattering is not a surprise in retrospect. And considering how much tech regulation could land in the next few years, what rises in the void left by the Internet Association will be fascinating.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>As we did yesterday, we’re taking a deeper look at a few key startup stories today, and then running through a host of smaller items so that we can get as much of our reporting into the newsletter as possible!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/cockroach-rolls-on-with-278m-series-f-on-5b-valuation/">You can’t kill Cockroach Labs:</a></strong> Not that anyone was trying &#8212; that’s just the wittiest riff we could come up with to introduce our reporting that the database company just raised a bunch of new capital at a $5 billion valuation. That’s up from $2 billion earlier this year. Our own Ron Miller writes that Cockroach “has 200 paying customers, with the cloud side of the business growing at 500% over the last year and ARR tripling YoY from Q3 to Q3.” We want hard numbers, but those are at least directionally interesting.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/gopuff-the-instant-grocery-startup-is-raising-up-to-1-5b-at-up-to-a-40b-valuation-ahead-of-going-public-as-soon-as-mid-2022/"><strong>Gopuff is raising $1.5B, could go public next year:</strong></a> Circling back to 2022 IPOs, quick delivery company Gopuff is working to raise around $1.5 billion in convertible debt at a roughly $40 billion valuation. And, our own Ingrid Lunden reports, the SoftBank-backed company could go public next year. If it does, the debut could lead to even more investment into related companies around the world — consumers wanting stuff, fast, is popular the world ‘round.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/vertical-farming-startup-infarm-raises-200m-for-international-expansion/"><strong>Vertical farming grows vertical valuation:</strong></a> Europe-based vertical farming firm Infarm raised $200 million this week, pushing its valuation north of the $1 billion mark. Vertical farming brings food creation nearer to urban hubs, potentially limiting carbon output. The concept appears to be <em>growing</em> and could prove <em>nutritious </em>for both consumers and investors alike.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/voodoo-bets-on-play-to-earn-crypto-mobile-games/">Why do play-to-earn games sound like a job?</a></strong> Voodoo, a French company, is going to put hundreds of millions of dollars into so-called “play-to-earn” games. Today, Voodoo is known for its casual games that have racked up billions of downloads. In the future it will also have blockchain games in the market, where players can earn digital currency or NFTs for their playing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And then, a host of other happenings for your further research:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/tiger-global-leads-cash-infusion-into-elementary-for-automated-manufacturing-inspection/">Machine vision AI company Elementary has raised a $30 million Series B</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/cytrox-predator-phone-hacking-meta/">There are more companies out there than just NSO Group hacking folks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/how-to-build-a-better-rocket-company/">Our own Darrell Etherington has notes on how to build a rocket company</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/weight-care-management-startup-found-lands-100m-at-a-600m-valuation/">Found raises $100M at a $600M valuation for its weight-management service</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/silverflow-nabs-17m-for-its-updated-cloud-based-take-on-payments-processing-technology/">Silverflow raises $17M for cloud payments</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/carbonchain-helps-automate-carbon-accounting-across-supply-chains/">And CarbonChain is working to automate carbon accounting in the supply chain</a></li>

<p>Dear Sophie,</p>
<p>The 2021 H-1B lottery process has been quite a rollercoaster!</p>
<p>We sponsored several people in this year’s lottery. One of our registrants was selected in the first round in March, but none were selected in the second round in July.</p>
<p>We just found out another of our registrants was selected in November, however, he’s from South Africa and restricted from traveling to the U.S. due to omicron.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/dear-sophie-how-to-maneuver-the-latest-travel-bans-h-1b-alternatives/">What should we do?</a> Any suggestions for what to do about our other prospective hires who didn’t get selected?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many brands are using the messaging app Discord to forge a sense of community among their fans. If the fast-food chain <a href="https://discord.com/invite/wendys">Wendy&#8217;s</a> can have a Discord with over 60,000 members, why not a viral platform like TikTok?</p>
<p>TikTok <a href="https://twitter.com/tiktok_us/status/1471208467251834880">teased on Twitter</a> that it was making a Discord server, but then confirmed the news on its own app today. Now, on TikTok&#8217;s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tiktok">brand new Discord</a>, you can chat with strangers about&#8230; whatever you&#8217;d want to talk to a bunch of TikTokers about. Maybe the best way to make Emily Mariko&#8217;s <a href="https://www.insider.com/emily-mariko-salmon-rice-recipe-tiktok-ice-cube-2021-9#emily-marikos-content-has-exploded-on-tiktok-over-the-past-two-weeks-1">viral salmon recipe</a>?</p>

<p>&#8220;This server’s just like your for you feed: it’s made for you, some of its comments are spicy, and your parents have no idea what it is,&#8221; TikTok wrote in the Discord&#8217;s welcome channel. Some of the rules on the Discord include no NSFW content and no buying crypto. Before chatting, you have to indicate by selecting a check-mark reaction that you read the rules &#8212; this is common in popular Discords to discourage spam. There&#8217;s even an option to indicate your gender pronouns on your server profile.</p>
<p>As of publication, there are only 400 people in the Discord, which TikTok told TechCrunch is a &#8220;soft launch.&#8221; There are 5 moderators from TikTok, which could pose a problem if the server continues to grow. As one user said, &#8220;let&#8217;s take the advantage [to talk to each other] when there are not 300,000 people trying to chat at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>To prevent spam (which is also against the rules), TikTok is using &#8220;slowmode,&#8221; a Discord feature that only lets people send a message every 30 seconds. But users quickly got around the slowmode by making <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/discord-threads/">threads</a>, where the time limit between messages doesn&#8217;t apply. Soon after, moderators removed the ability to make threads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Right now, the conversation channels on the TikTok Discord are relatively ordinary, expect for some light trolling. There are chats for introducing yourself, sharing your TikToks, TikTok support, server feedback, TikTok sounds, and more.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise CEO Dan Ammann is leaving the company, its parent company General Motors said in late afternoon statement.</p>
<p>Kyle Vogt, who co-founded the autonomous vehicle company, and was the company&#8217;s first CEO will take over the role on an interim basis. Vogt has been serving as Cruise&#8217;s president and CTO. Wesley Bush, the former Chairman and CEO of Northrop Grumman and a GM board member, will join the Cruise board, GM said.</p>
<p>GM and Cruise did not provide additional details about why Ammann was leaving. The departure of the longtime GM executive is unexpected and came as a surprise to Cruise employees who asked not to be identified. The news was shared with Cruise employees Thursday as it was shared with the public with one person noting it seemed unplanned and chaotic. One anecdote that illustrates the lack of planning around Ammann&#8217;s departure was staff waited for more than 10 minutes to hear from GM chairman and CEO Mary Barra who was unable to join a virtual town hall meeting meant to explain the change. Vogt ended up having to put her on his personal speakerphone so she could communicate with Cruise staff.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249059" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ammann was at the center of GM&#8217;s initial investment and acquisition of Cruise. He oversaw GM&#8217;s relationship with Cruise. And he was the person with whom Vogt had regular contact. Vogt even mentioned his connection to Ammann while onstage at SF Disrupt in September 2018. Ammann also came to the job with a specific skill set. When Ammann first joined GM in 2010 as vice president of finance and treasurer, his first task was to manage GM&#8217;s initial public offering. At the time, Ammann&#8217;s appointment as Cruise CEO seemed to signal that an IPO could be a goal.</p>
<p>Ammann was tapped to be CEO of Cruise in late 2018. He took over officially in January 2019. At the time, the move seemed to make sense. Cruise had grown from a small startup with 40 employees to more than 1,000 by the time Ammann took over.</p>
<p>And while Ammann continued to push the company to expand, there were missed targets, notably the plan to launch a commercial robotaxi business in 2019. The company has spent the past two years inching towards that commercialization goal, along with the rest of the industry, which has gone through a spate of consolidation.</p>
<p>GM outlined a bullish autonomous vehicle plan at its October investor day and its branded &#8220;Under the Hood&#8221; event the following month. Those ambitions included comments from Ammann who laid out the company&#8217;s plan to launch a commercial robotaxi and delivery service starting with retrofitted Chevy Bolts and eventually scaling to an army of tens of thousands of purpose-built Origin AVs on the road over the next few years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Separately, Cruise&#8217;s go-to-market VP Lucas Watson left the company last week, according to several sources with direct knowledge. While one his departure is apparently unrelated it does raise questions about the business side of Cruise, aspects of which Ammann and Watson would have been focused on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hulu is the latest company to <a href="https://press.hulu.com/news/2021/12/16/year-with-hulu-2021-its-in-your-dna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduce</a> a Spotify Wrapped-like personalized end-of-year recap feature. The streaming service is giving subscribers the option to learn more about their viewing habits through a new <a href="https://yourtvdna.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Your TV DNA&#8221; tool</a>. The tool is accessible on a newly launched website where users can access a profile of their personalized viewing habits throughout the year. The tool analyzes users&#8217; streaming habits and shares information about things like their most-watched genres and how many films and TV show episodes they watched.</p>
<p>To get started, subscribers need to log into their Hulu accounts on the website in order to receive their recap. From there, the tool will analyze the user&#8217;s data and then display their most-watched genres, which can include categories like edgy comedies, high-stakes dramas, crime dramas and more. The recap will also include a &#8220;streaming persona&#8221; that&#8217;s meant to represent the user&#8217;s viewing habits of the year.</p>
<p>The tool also aims to help users discover recommendations about what they should watch next on the streaming service. The recommendations include upcoming or current content that is similar to what the user has already watched. Users also have the option to share their recap with others on social media.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249020" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;This year, for the first time, Hulu is giving subscribers the opportunity to request to see their own viewing DNA and the tools to proudly share, should they so choose, their streaming persona,&#8221; the company said in a <a href="https://press.hulu.com/news/2021/12/16/year-with-hulu-2021-its-in-your-dna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> regarding the announcement. &#8220;Starting today, subscribers can visit <a href="https://yourtvdna.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="2">YourTVDNA.com</a> and request to see their personalized Hulu viewing habits throughout 2021.&#8221;</p>

<div class="article-content">
<p>The launch of the new feature comes as shareable end-of-year recaps have become increasingly popular thanks to Spotify’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/spotifys-wrapped-2021-arrives-with-artist-video-messages-blend-and-even-a-game/"> annual Wrapped</a> experience that is widely shared across social media each year. Given its success, it’s no surprise that other companies are mimicking the popular features. Hulu joins many other digital giants that have released their own Wrapped-like features. Last week, Facebook and Instagram<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/facebook-and-instagram-roll-out-personalized-year-in-review-features/"> introduced</a> personalized &#8220;Year in Review&#8221; features to give users a way to reflect on the past year. Reddit also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/reddit-rolls-out-personalized-end-of-year-recaps-with-stats-about-users-habits/">rolled out</a> personalized recaps with stats about users’ habits last week; meanwhile, Snapchat launched its “Year End Story” this week.</p>
<p>In addition to the personalized recaps, Hulu also released information about overall trends on its platform. The company revealed that &#8220;Only Murders in the Building&#8221; was its most-watched comedy series and that &#8220;Nine Perfect Strangers&#8221; set a new record as its most-watched series ever. Hulu also notes that adult animation was the No. 1 genre on the streaming service based on hours watched.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also outlined that the most streamed day of 2021 was Sunday, January 31, largely because subscribers tuned into the previous evening’s &#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221; episode hosted by John Krasinski. In terms of non-original series, the most-watched medical drama was &#8220;The Good Doctor,&#8221; which also topped this category in 2020. Other popular non-Original series included &#8220;Law &amp; Order: SVU&#8221; and &#8220;Modern Family.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian will use some of the $13.7 billion it raised when it publicly listed its shares to build a second factory in Georgia that has double the capacity of its plant in Illinois.</p>
<p>The company, which made the announced Thursday as part of its first earnings report, said the funds will be used to expand production capacity of its Normal, Illinois factory from 150,000 to 200,000 electric vehicles a year. Its second factory will be built east of Atlanta in Morgan and Walton counties and will have a targeted annual production capacity of 400,000 vehicles a year.</p>
<p>This Georgia factory will include a co-located battery cell production. Construction will begin in summer 2022 with production beginning in 2024. The company <a href="https://assets.rivian.com/2md5qhoeajym/3BYl8sLO3rzD9lluEwvXGE/754d4115dc0715d7e95e848556fc93cb/Rivian-Q3-2021-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">said in its shareholder letter</a> that it picked the site due to the combination of sustainable business operations, talent pool, and proximity to supply chain and logistics.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249025" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;As we look ahead, our Georgia facility will be critically important to our objective to accelerate the large-scale adoption of sustainable transportation,&#8221; the letter said, adding that the facility will be used for our next generation of vehicles.</p>
<p>In the near-term, that capital will also be used to design and develop its next generation of vehicles. To date, Rivian has three vehicles: the R1T pickup and R1S SUV, which are aimed at consumers, and its commercial van. Amazon, which holds more than 20% of Rivian stock, is the company&#8217;s first commercial van customer with an initial 100,000 vehicle order.</p>
<p>Rivian will also invest heavily in vertical integration, which follows the company and its founder and CEO RJ Scaringe&#8217;s strategy over the past several years. Specifically, Rivian intends to invest in battery technology across the value chain, including battery cell chemistry development, raw material sourcing, and in-house cell manufacturing, the company said in its shareholder letter. A look at one graphic in its shareholder letter illustrates those vertical integration ambitions.</p>

<p>The electric drive system will be another investment priority, according to the shareholder letter. The aim, the company said, is to advance its &#8220;in-house family of future drive units offering higher performance, improved packaging, and lower cost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Generating sales is of course at the top of the to-do list, which Rivian plans to increase by continuing to invest in customer engagement and experiences, including its &#8220;experience spaces,&#8221; the Rivian membership program for consumers and its digital fleet management software that is branded FleetOS for its commercial customers.</p>
<p>Rivian outlined plans to build out its vehicle service and charging infrastructure. By the end of the year, Rivian said it will have more than 60 mobile service vans in service and eight service centers located in California, Colorado, Illinois, New York, Utah, and Washington.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The trade group representing Silicon Valley&#8217;s biggest companies will disband, even as tech enters a new era of intense regulatory scrutiny in the nation&#8217;s capital.</p>
<p>The Internet Association has fought for tech&#8217;s interests in Washington for the last nine years, lobbying lawmakers to advance the combined interests of Facebook, Amazon, Google, Airbnb, Uber, Twitter, eBay, Spotify, Zillow and many more of the most recognizable names in tech, from the largest companies on down. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/14/silicon-valleys-voice-in-washington-to-dissolve-524486" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico first reported</a> that the group would close up shop.</p>
<p>“Our industry has undergone tremendous growth and change since the Internet Association was formed almost 10 years ago, and in line with this evolution, the Board has made the difficult decision to close the organization at the end of this year,&#8221; the group wrote in a published statement. &#8220;&#8230; IA has made great progress on its mission to foster innovation, promote economic growth, and empower people through a free and open internet.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248955" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In recent years, some of the Internet Association&#8217;s members have come into direct conflict on policy issues. That rift appears to be widening on defining topics, even among the group&#8217;s biggest members. While the IA&#8217;s stated position defends keeping Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act intact as it stands now, IA member Meta (now parent company of Facebook) recently told lawmakers that it&#8217;s open to changing the law in order to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/instagrams-adam-mosseri-senate-hearing-teen-safety/">&#8220;earn some of our Section 230 protections.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>The group represents its members on issues like AI, broadband, content moderation and privacy, but conspicuously stayed out of the antitrust debate — the most relevant, consequential policy conversation in the industry&#8217;s recent history. With lawmakers gearing up to impose new regulations on tech companies, antitrust will continue to eclipse most other policy concerns that affect both major players in tech and the smaller companies that point to concerns around their market dominance.</p>
<p>Yelp, which joined the Internet Association in 2014, left previously due to differences with the group. &#8220;This org could’ve saved itself years ago by kicking out everyone with a market cap greater than $500b (ie GAFA),: Yelp Senior Public Policy VP<a href="https://twitter.com/lutherlowe/status/1470941101821472772?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Luther Lowe tweeted</a>. &#8220;I made this suggestion to the leadership a few years ago, but it was shot down, so we quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yelp has testified before Congress on antitrust issues, arguing that Google, previously a fellow IA member, is a monopoly that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/16/742386857/yelp-ceo-discusses-his-efforts-to-convince-congress-that-google-is-a-monopoly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unfairly gives search preference to its own products</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last year, longtime IA president Michael Beckerman left<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-dodges-questions-about-biometric-data-collection-in-senate-hearing/"> to join TikTok</a> as the company&#8217;s head of public policy in the Americas. <a href="https://www.axios.com/microsoft-uber-leaving-internet-association-eed2477d-dc04-47c7-8d90-760d32d7b3f3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft and Uber</a> both left the group last month, signaling IA&#8217;s waning usefulness in the current tech policy landscape.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While NSO Group was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/apple-nso-group-lawsuit/">taking flak</a> for hacking into the phones of journalists, activists and human rights defenders, an entire class of spyware makers and surveillance-for-hire outfits were operating as normal, largely unnoticed.</p>
<p>These private surveillance groups develop and deploy never-before-seen exploits that quietly hack into and steal the contents of a victim&#8217;s phone — call logs, text messages, emails, location data and more — often on behalf of authoritarian governments targeting their most vocal critics.</p>
<p>Now, following an investigation by researchers at Citizen Lab and Facebook&#8217;s new parent company, Meta, seven surveillance-for-hire groups have been banned from using the social media giant&#8217;s platforms to target other users.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248733" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/taking-action-against-surveillance-for-hire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said Thursday</a> that it has removed more than 1,500 Facebook and Instagram accounts associated with the seven outfits, which the company said were used for reconnaissance, social engineering and sending malicious links to thousands of victims in over 100 countries. Meta said it&#8217;s notified around 50,000 people it believes were targeted by the seven groups.</p>
<p>Although much of the recent focus of the surveillance industry has been on companies like NSO Group, both Citizen Lab and Meta warned that the wider surveillance-for-hire industry will continue to balloon if left unregulated. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to realize that NSO is only one piece of a much broader global cyber mercenary ecosystem,&#8221; according to a report of Meta&#8217;s investigation seen by TechCrunch before its publication.</p>
<p>One of the banned companies is Cytrox, a North Macedonia-based spyware maker. Meta said it found the company using a &#8220;vast&#8221; infrastructure of web domains mimicking legitimate news sites to target the iPhone and Android devices of its victims. Meta said it sent legal notices to Cytrox and blocked hundreds of domains associated with its infrastructure.</p>
<p>Meta was acting on findings by Citizen Lab, which also on Thursday released a <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forensic report</a> into the hacking of phones belonging to two Egyptians living in exile — a former politician and the host of a popular news show who asked not to be named. Citizen Lab said the spyware that infected their phones in July 2021, dubbed Predator, was developed by Cytrox.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab first discovered the spyware on the iPhone belonging to Ayman Nour, an Egyptian politician and outspoken critic of the incumbent president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who took over the country following a military coup in 2013. Nour, who lives in exile in Turkey, became suspicious when his phone was &#8220;running hot.&#8221; Citizen Lab found that Nour&#8217;s phone had been infected with Pegasus, the now-infamous spyware created by NSO Group. That led to the discovery that his phone had been concurrently hit by the newly discovered Predator spyware.</p>
<p>Both Nour&#8217;s phone and the phone belonging to the host of the news show were running iOS 14.6, the latest version of iOS at the time of the hacks, suggesting the spyware made use of a never-before-seen exploit in the iPhone&#8217;s software to infect the phones. Apple spokesperson Scott Radcliffe declined to say whether the company had fixed the vulnerability.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Predator shares a similar set of features to NSO&#8217;s Pegasus. Citizen Lab said Nour was sent a malicious link over WhatsApp. When opened, the spyware can access a phone&#8217;s cameras and microphone and can exfiltrate the phone&#8217;s data. Predator — unlike Pegasus — lacks the ability to silently infect a phone without any user interaction, but it makes up for that with persistence. Citizen Lab said the spyware can survive a reboot of an iPhone — typically clearing any spyware lurking in its memory — by creating an automation using the Shortcuts feature built into iOS.</p>
<p>The researchers said that, &#8220;remarkably,&#8221; Nour&#8217;s phone was compromised at the same time with both Pegasus and Predator, but that the infections were likely unrelated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on the slapdash nature of Predator&#8217;s code, it&#8217;s clear we&#8217;re looking at the B Team here,&#8221; said Bill Marczak, one of the Citizen Lab researchers who discovered and analyzed the Predator malware. &#8220;Even so, Predator was still able to break into the latest, fully up-to-date phones, so it&#8217;s no surprise that we found repressive governments, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, as Predator operators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Citizen Lab said it was likely that Predator is being used by government customers in Armenia, Greece, Serbia, Indonesia, Madagascar and Oman — plus Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which are known to target their critics with mobile spyware. Meta, meanwhile, said its investigation found Predator customers in Vietnam, the Philippines and Germany.</p>
<p>Cytrox CEO Ivo Malinkovski could not be reached for comment; an email sent prior to publication bounced as undelivered.</p>
<p>Meta said that it also banned four other Israeli companies involved in the surveillance-for-hire business: Cobwebs, Cognyte, Black Cube and Bluehawk. In addition, it banned BellTrox, an Indian hacking outfit <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-cyber-mercenaries-exclusive/exclusive-obscure-indian-cyber-firm-spied-on-politicians-investors-worldwide-idUSKBN23G1GQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused of hacking</a> into thousands of email accounts belonging to politicians and government officials, and a China-based spyware maker believed to be used by China&#8217;s law enforcement.</p>
<p>Although NSO has faced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/apple-nso-group-lawsuit/">legal challenges</a> and restrictions on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/">its business dealings</a> in large part because of accusations of abuse and spying on members of civil society — claims that the company has repeatedly denied — the social media giant warned that the growing surveillance industry continues to proliferate regardless.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to investigate and enforce against anyone abusing our apps,&#8221; Meta&#8217;s report said. &#8220;However, these cyber mercenaries work across many platforms and national boundaries. Their capabilities are used by both nation-states and private enterprises, and effectively lower the barrier to entry for anyone willing to pay. For their targets, it is often impossible to know they are being surveilled across the internet.&#8221;</p>

The new feature will allow users to further integrate their Instagram profiles into websites such as blogs and portfolios. The social media giant says the feature is currently only available in the U.S. Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced the launch of the new feature in <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1471552033912098818?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a video</a> posted to Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been able to embed an Instagram photo or Instagram video into a website for many years now,&#8221; Mosseri explained in the video. &#8220;This extends on that idea and allows you to embed a miniature version of your Instagram profile on a website. Maybe you want to showcase your Instagram content on a website somewhere or link to someone else&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>We’ve rolled out some pretty fun new features this week that I wanted to share with you: <br />&#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IGPlayback?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IGPlayback</a> <br />&#8211; Reels Visual Replies <br />&#8211; Profile Embed (US only for now) </p>

<p>&mdash; Adam Mosseri (@mosseri) <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1471552033912098818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In the video, Mosseri also outlined two more features that were announced earlier this week. The company launched a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/instagram-now-lets-users-reply-to-comments-with-reels/">“Reels Visual Replies” feature</a> that lets users reply to comments on posts with Reels. Now, when users choose to reply to a comment, they’ll see a new option that allows them to select the Reels button to create a video reply. The video reply will appear as a sticker. The new feature is similar to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/product-tutorial-reply-to-comments-with-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok’s video replies</a>, which allow users to reply to comments on their content with video responses. TikTok rolled out the feature last year to give users a way to offer more context about their videos and answer questions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Considering the popularity of TikTok&#8217;s feature, it’s no surprise that Instagram launched a similar feature for its own TikTok-clone. Instagram also wasn&#8217;t the only one in doing so, as Pinterest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/pinterest-rolls-out-the-option-to-reply-to-comments-with-videos/">rolled out</a> the option to allow users to reply to comments with videos a few days after Instagram announced its feature.</p>
<p>The third new feature mentioned in Mosseri&#8217;s video is a new end-of-year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/facebook-and-instagram-roll-out-personalized-year-in-review-features/">“Playback” IG Stories</a> time capsule feature. The feature leverages the platform&#8217;s Stories Archive, so users can customize and select up to 10 stories to share with their followers. To be eligible for this feature, users need to have posted more than three stories this year or have Stories Archive turned on. Instagram suggests Playback posts for you, but you also have the option to pick what you want to share. The new feature is currently available to users for “several weeks.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify is continuing its investments in podcasts with today&#8217;s news that it has <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-16/spotify-is-building-on-megaphones-capabilities-with-the-acquisition-of-whooshkaa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> another podcast technology company, <a href="https://www.whooshkaa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whooshkaa</a>, an Australia-based all-in-one platform for hosting, managing, distributing, promoting, monetizing and measuring podcasts. The deal follows Spotify&#8217;s earlier acquisitions in the podcast technology market, including last year&#8217;s deal for hosting and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">ad company Megaphone</a>, and, more recently, podcast discovery platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/spotify-acquires-podz-a-podcast-discovery-app/">Podz</a>.</p>
<p>The company has also acquired creator-facing tools like Anchor and the live talk show platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spotify-is-getting-into-live-audio-because-of-course-it-is/">from Betty Labs,</a> now Spotify Greenroom, among other podcast studios like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/spotify-doubles-down-on-podcasts/">Gimlet</a>, Parcast and The Ringer.</p>
<p>With Whooshkaa, Spotify is gaining a new tool: specialized technology that allows radio broadcasters to easily turn their existing audio content into on-demand podcast programming. This is the part that most interested Spotify, which says it will integrate this &#8220;broadcast-to-podcast&#8221; tech directly into Megaphone &#8212; the latter which already offers a suite of hosting, distribution, reporting and monetization tools for podcasters.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248892" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Spotify believes Whooshkaa&#8217;s porting capability will bring more third-party content to its Spotify Audience Network, which would increase the reach and impact for its advertising partners. This part of Spotify&#8217;s business has been scaling upwards. The company passed the €1 billion in advertising revenue milestone in 2021 and Spotify reported its highest ad revenue quarter ever in Q3.</p>
<p>Today, 1 in 5 Spotify advertisers are using the Spotify Audience Network and opted-in Megaphone podcast publishers have seen a double-digit increase in fill rates, Spotify says.</p>
<p>Launched in 2016, Whooshkaa has also innovated in areas like text-to-speech, speech-to-text, connected home integration, ad technology with dynamic insertion, enterprise-grade private podcasting tools and more, the Australian firm&#8217;s CEO Rob Loewenthal noted in its own <a href="https://www.whooshkaa.com/blog/the-next-step-for-whooshkaa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> on the company blog. However, Spotify &#8212; with its over 381 million monthly listeners &#8212; allows Whooshkaa to bring its technology to a larger audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe the worldwide growth potential for digital audio is still largely untapped. Through the addition of these new tools as well as the innovative team behind them, we are reinforcing our commitment to helping creators, publishers, and advertisers realize the value of this opportunity,&#8221; said Spotify&#8217;s Chief Content &amp; Advertising Business Officer, Dawn Ostroff, in a statement about the deal. &#8220;With Whooshkaa, we will strengthen our efforts to help audio publishers of all kinds grow their podcast business and scale our ability to help advertisers reach their audiences.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Spotify declined to share the deal terms, and couldn&#8217;t yet comment on the transition plan for Whooshkaa&#8217;s existing customers. A total of 12 people will be joining Spotify as a part of this deal, and they will remain based in Australia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Oh, hey, before we get started this week, I’m excited to finally be able to tell you that TC Sessions: Robotics has been announced for next year, and we’re returning to the East Coast! I’ve been pushing for this for a while now &#8212; and not just because it’s a shorter flight for me. Berkeley has been great to us &#8212; and hey, it’s more or less home for me (one of these days I’ll find an excuse to talk about all of the shows I saw at Gilman St. in this newsletter).</p>
<p>But there’s just so much great stuff happening in my current time zone, that I’m extremely happy we’re doing it out east this year &#8212; and specifically Boston, where we held the first one, way back in 2017.</p>
<p>Like all the ones before it, the 2020 event in Berkeley was fantastic, back in early March 2020, before, you know, everything changed. There was no in-person Robotics Session this year, as the event planning gods probably correctly surmised that this is an event best held in person &#8212; because, well, robots.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248379" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/techcrunch-2022-events/">event is set for the Hynes Convention Center on July 22, 2022</a>. That’s all of the information I have for you at the moment, but you best believe I’m going to be shilling it in here as we get closer.</p>

<div class="cx-rec-module__header"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">All right, enough about 2022. We only have a few more weeks to continue dwelling on what’s left of 2021. As with last week, I plan to wrap up the year with some reflections on what this extraordinarily strange year has meant to the world of robotics. Before we get to more of my thoughts, here are some from Open Robotics co-founder and CEO, Brian Gerkey. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He has also worked at Willow Garage, the SRI Artificial Intelligence Center, the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab and the USC Interaction Lab.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>What was the defining robotics/AI/automation trend of 2021? </strong>The top three trends in robotics for 2021 are deployments, deployments and deployments. Whether its for safety reasons, labor shortages, increasing automation or all of the above, there have been a ton of robots and robot fleets deployed in the past year.</p>
<p><strong>What will 2022 bring for these categories? </strong>More deployments means more integration challenges. In 2022, companies will want their fleets working together. That means robots from different vendors are going to need to start communicating with each other because customers will demand it. Believe it or not, there was a time when a Mac computer couldn’t communicate with a PC. We’re at a similar stage in robotics, but the tools are in place to make integration possible.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246537" style="width: 4066px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246537" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2246537 size-full" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg" alt="" width="4056" height="2280" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg 4056w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DJI_0062.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4056px) 100vw, 4056px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246537" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Symbotic</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">If you’ve been following this column over the past year, you know I’ve been extremely bullish on warehouse and fulfillment robotics. And the investment trends have really borne much of that out. I can’t take too much credit, of course. The writing has been on the wall for a while now for one giant reason&#8230;</span></p>
<p>Amazon.</p>
<p>It’s the big question on the minds of every company in the online retail space &#8212; and, to an increasing degree, the world of parcel delivery. Amazon continues to be a Katamari Damacy ball of capitalism, hoovering up any companies and industries in its way, and leaving even its biggest competitors looking for some kind of edge. Robotics and automation offer some hope &#8212; though they represent another space where Amazon has developed its own edge.</p>
<p>The last number I saw &#8212; published over the summer &#8212; was 350,000 Amazon robots. It’s a number that continues growing. The promise of offering a way to maintain a competitive edge against Amazon’s army has led to some of the year’s biggest robotics investments. This week, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/walmart-supported-symbotic-set-to-go-public-via-softbank-spac/">Symbotic enlisted the support of Softbank in a bid to go public via SPAC</a>. In addition to raising $725 million for the firm, the deal will give Symbotic a pro forma equity value of around $5.5 billion.</p>
<p>A lot of that excitement is built around Walmart’s vote of confidence. In July, the mega-retailer announced an expansion of a pilot program that would bring Symbotic’s automation to 25 of its distribution centers over the next several years. Walmart is also an investor in the company, and if the deal closes in the first-half of next year as planned, it will own 9% of Symbotic. That’s strong support from a company like Walmart, which has been dipping its toes in various robotics verticals &#8212; just as Bossa Nova, which suffered serious consequences from an ended contract.</p>
<p>It’s hard to blame them for putting so many eggs in that basket. Walmart is the sort of behemoth that can make or break a startup with a well-timed partnership. And as for Walmart, few companies have more to lose from potentially having their respective lunches eaten by Amazon. The company missed a huge opportunity to own online retail early on, and ought to be seeking any advantage possible to make sure it’s got a future, as fewer and fewer people seek out in-store experiences.</p>
<p>That last bit is, no doubt, only being exacerbated by the pandemic. These past couple of years have been the final nail in the coffin for countless brick and mortars. Add to that workforce shortages, shutdowns and health concerns, and you’ve got a rapidly escalating list of reasons why so many companies are taking a much more sober look at automating their workforces, for better and worse.</p>
<p>And that doesn’t even touch on the whole supply chain thing. When Jack White is launching a tour called “Supply Chain Issues,” you know this thing isn’t going to loosen its grip any time soon. That’s going to mean increased investment in parcel automation and, perhaps, a more serious re-examination of localized manufacturing.</p>
<p>The beginning of this year also saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/robotics-company-berkshire-grey-to-go-public-via-spac/">Berkshire Grey announce a SPAC</a>, hot on the heels of a $263 million raise. Locus Robotics (which has insisted on a commitment to remaining independent) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/locus-robotics-just-raised-another-50m/">has raised a whole bunch of money</a>, while Fetch Robotics went ahead and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/fetch-robotics-ceo-on-the-companys-acquisition-and-the-future-of-warehouse-robots/">got acquired by Zebra Technologies</a>. As founder Melonee Wise told me in July:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think it’s complicated. When I started the company, I never really planned on anything. I just wanted to go build something. I mean that in the most sincere way. I wanted to go build something and not fail. And the question is, what does not failing look like? I think the facts are that in the last 20-something years, almost no robotics company has IPO’ed. Now we’re starting to see SPACS, but there hasn’t been a robotics company that’s IPO’ed through the traditional route.</p>
<p>I would say that if you were to ask me on any given day, what I thought the probability of IPO versus acquisition, I probably would have said acquisition, because there’s just not a history of robotics companies IPO’ing. That’s for lots of reasons. It’s a hardware intensive business. It takes a lot of technology and investment. Typically, they’re held privately. It’s hard for large corporate entities to have the P&amp;L to invest in this deep technology. I think that’s starting to change. And I think now that there’s SPACs, you’ll see a lot changing in that regard. But I would say you’re still going to see more acquisitions than you’re going to see IPOs for the next 10 years.</p></blockquote>

<p>While we’re primarily focused on U.S. transactions, this is certainly not a U.S.-only phenomenon. We’ve seen similarly large rounds in Europe and Asia, as well. Just this week. Beijing-based warehouse robotics firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/forwardx-warehoue-robot-series-c1/">ForwardX raised a $31 million Series C</a>, bringing its total funding to around $100 million. With a massive population and the aforementioned global supply chain issues, I’d say it’s a pretty safe bet that we’re only seeing the beginning of some massive rounds in China.</p>
<p>An under-discussed element in all of this are things like exoskeletons. They’re not specifically fulfillment tools, but wearable robotics like the newly announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/german-bionic-debuts-a-new-exoskeleton-with-upper-and-lower-body-assistance/">fifth-generation Cray X</a> from German Bionic are going to play a big role in the field. Thankfully, not every industry sees a near-term solution in full automation, so human workers are going to continue to play an important role.</p>
<p>That means both the introduction of more cobots and augmentation tools like exoskeletons, which have had a big year, including the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/ottobock-set-to-acquire-fellow-robotic-exoskeleton-maker-suitx/">acquisition of SuitX by Ottobock</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/robotic-exoskeleton-maker-sarcos-announces-spac-plans/">Sarcos’ announced SPAC plans</a> and several big raises from companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/verve-motion-raises-15m-following-exosuit-pilot-with-grocery-workers/">like Verve Motion</a>.</p>

<p>One more quick one this week comes from Stanford University. After sending its gecko-inspired robotic gripper to the International Space Station, the team continues to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/stanfords-gecko-inspired-robot-hand-sets-its-sights-on-fruit-picking/">find novel uses for the technology</a>. Highlighting an application called FarmHand, the team notes how the technology can be used to pick up fragile objects like eggs and fruit.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Alphabet&#8217;s smart city project is winding down and Google will take over its products. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sidewalk%20labs/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Sidewalk Labs</a> CEO Dan Doctoroff <a href="https://medium.com/sidewalk-talk/my-next-chapter-fighting-als-207ce7ca69c8" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">announced the news</a> in a letter, in which he noted he is stepping down for health-related reasons. A spokesperson confirmed to Engadget that Sidewalk Labs products will be folded into Google, though Alphabet plans to spin out Canopy Buildings as a separate company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Starting next year, Sidewalk products Pebble, Mesa, Delve, and Affordable Electrification will join Google, becoming core to Google’s urban sustainability product efforts,&#8221; Doctoroff wrote. &#8220;These products will continue to be led by Sidewalk Labs President of Urban Products Prem Ramaswami and Chief Technology Officer Craig Nevill-Manning, both Google alumni, and the teams will continue to execute on their vision and serve customers.&#8221;</p>
<div id="outstreamPlayer-inArticle" class="basePlayer expandedPlayer vp-docked-mode">
<div id="outstream-adText"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Pebble is a vehicle sensor system designed to manage curb and parking space, and Delve is centered around bolstering real estate development with the help of AI. Mesa sensors are designed to help save energy, while Affordable Electrification is about managing home energy use. Canopy Buildings, meanwhile, focuses on &#8220;factory-automated mass timber construction.&#8221;</span></div>
<p>Doctoroff started Sidewalk Labs within Google six years ago and it later became its own company under the wing of Alphabet. In October 2017, Sidewalk Labs announced plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-16-alphabet-google-sidewalk-labs-toronto-quayside.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">build a smart neighborhood on Toronto&#8217;s waterfront</a>. Quayside would have featured, among other things, delivery robots and an array of sensors to manage things like noise, traffic and pollution.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248867" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>However, Sidewalk Labs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alphabets-sidewalk-labs-abandons-smart-neighborhood-project-in-toronto-201246140.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">shut down</a> the project in May last year. Doctoroff said at the time that “unprecedented economic uncertainty” as a result of COVID-19 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-sidewalk-quayside-waterfront-toronto-technical-evaluation.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">other compromises</a> it would have to make meant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-29-sidewalk-labs-site-plan-smart-neighborhood-quayside-toronto.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">its vision</a> for Quayside was no longer viable. The company also advised on development projects across North America.</p>
<p>Several companies were spun out of Sidewalk Labs, including Cityblock Health, which aims to reinvent health care for underserved communities; Replica, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-12-sidewalk-labs-replica-series-a-funding.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">a controversial data collection project</a> which aims to revamp transportation planning; and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cavnue-michigan-corridor-221520625.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners</a>, which Doctoroff says &#8220;pioneered new forms of tech-enabled infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctoroff said he&#8217;s stepping aside after doctors determined it was likely that he has ALS or Lou Gherig&#8217;s Disease. He&#8217;s focusing on spending more time with his family and fighting the condition. In 2010, Doctoroff started an organization focused on building a new, collaborative approach to ALS research after the deaths of his father and uncle, who had both been diagnosed with the disease.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A Waymo self-driving Jaguar I-Pace that struck a pedestrian in San Francisco on Wednesday evening was in manual mode, the company told TechCrunch in response to an initial report posted on Reddit. Waymo says the vehicle was in manual mode at the time, meaning the human safety driver who was behind wheel was actually driving.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/rhlcg8/our_neighbor_was_hit_by_a_selfdriving_car/">Reddit post from KWillets</a> that described the event included a photo that showed a Waymo test vehicle parked in the Lower Haight neighborhood in San Francisco. A fire truck and several first responders are also shown at the scene. The post from KWillets, who describes witnessing the aftermath of the crash, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Just when we thought 2021 couldn&#8217;t get worse, we heard a thump. I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248820" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Our neighbors had gotten out of a ride share on the far side and one crossed while the other stayed behind apparently taking a picture. An SFPD patrol stopped to say something to her about being careful crossing the street(?), when a Waymo passed in the near lane and hit the one who had already crossed, as I think he returned. The victim was conscious and standing afterwards, but went to SFGH for a more accurate diagnosis. Hope he&#8217;s OK.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">You can say there&#8217;s no such thing as Waymo, but as for me and Grandpa, we believe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The incident was then picked up on Twitter, where it received more attention. In one exchange with <a href="https://twitter.com/kathbarna/status/1471449449146822657">well-known Tesla fan Omar Qazi</a>, who tweets under WholeMars Catalog, a Waymo spokesperson responded and said the vehicle was in manual mode.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to Waymo, which also provided this statement:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday evening [12/15], one of our vehicles was involved in a manual collision in San Francisco on Haight St. midblock between Webster and Buchanan.The vehicle was being driven in manual mode when it made contact with a pedestrian in the road. The pedestrian was treated for injuries at the scene and was transported to the hospital in an ambulance. The trust and safety of the communities in which we drive are paramount to us, and we will continue investigating this incident in partnership with local authorities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles regulates autonomous vehicles in the state. The collision occurred when the Waymo vehicle was on a &#8220;manual-only mission,&#8221; which means it does not meet the criteria for a reportable collision under the DMV&#8217;s AV testing regulations, a spokesperson said. However, Waymo will adhere to another DMV state regulation that requires all traffic crashes on roads that involve injuries or significant property damage to be reported.</p>
<p>Waymo has been testing its autonomous vehicles in California for years, particularly in and around Mountain View and San Francisco. Waymo has been ramping up its testing activity in San Francisco, which has brought more attention to autonomous vehicles in general, and more specifically to the company. For example, Waymo found itself on the local news after a steady stream of the company&#8217;s self-driving cars kept going down the same dead end street, forcing them to make u-turns.</p>
<p>While Waymo doesn&#8217;t provide exact numbers on its autonomous vehicle fleet size, the company told TechCrunch it has &#8220;hundreds of vehicles in San Francisco. Its activity in San Francisco has increased in 2021, particularly since August when the company launched its <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/08/welcoming-our-first-riders-in-san.html">Trusted Tester program</a>, which opened up its research program beyond employees and to some members of the public. Under the program, San Franciscans are able to hail an autonomous ride in one of Waymo&#8217;s all-electric Jaguar I-PACE vehicles. A safety driver is still behind the wheel.</p>

Now, that script might flip to &#8220;leave a review on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotify announced today that it&#8217;s implementing a <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-16/show-your-favorite-podcasters-you-love-them-with-spotifys-new-star-ratings-for-podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five-star rating system</a>, similar to Apple&#8217;s, in an attempt to improve podcast discovery. The company said this feature will roll out in the coming days in nearly all markets where podcasts are on Spotify.</p>
<p>Spotify told TechCrunch that unlike Apple, this feature will only support star ratings at this time &#8212; you cannot yet write a written review of a show.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248735" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-16/show-your-favorite-podcasters-you-love-them-with-spotifys-new-star-ratings-for-podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in a blog post</a> that its intention is to &#8220;give listeners an opportunity to support their favorite podcast shows and enable a two-way feedback loop between creator and listener.&#8221; But, after seeking out five-star Apple reviews since the advent of the podcasting medium, podcasters are wary about how much star ratings actually help them promote their shows.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a <a href="https://eventualmillionaire.com/how-to-get-your-podcast-into-new-and-noteworthy-in-itunes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well</a>&#8211;<a href="https://www.weeditpodcasts.com/get-your-podcast-into-the-new-and-noteworthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented</a> <a href="https://rachelcorbett.com.au/blog/new-and-noteworthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myth</a> in podcasting that getting lots of <a href="https://gaffincreative.com/how-to-get-featured-on-apple-podcasts-new-noteworthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ratings</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/how-to-get-your-podcast-featured-in-itunes-new-and-noteworthy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviews</a> in your first few weeks after launch can improve your chances of getting listed on Apple Podcasts&#8217; coveted &#8220;New and Noteworthy&#8221; chart, which could jump-start your show&#8217;s growth. Besides, professional podcasters have pointed out that <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/852-ratings-and-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple itself says</a> that ratings and reviews don&#8217;t influence charting.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>A representative from Spotify told TechCrunch, &#8220;Ratings are a great way for prospective listeners to quickly gauge a show’s quality, but at this point (as we&#8217;re in early days for this feature), a show&#8217;s rating is not factored into podcast charts or personalized recommendations.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, this is a tool to show what fans think of a podcast, but as of now, not something that can help shows get on Spotify&#8217;s charts or curated lists.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Anchor, the podcast creation platform that </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/">Spotify bought</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in 2019, offered suggestions in a blog post about how podcasters can encourage listeners to </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://blog.anchor.fm/updates/spotify-podcast-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leave a rating</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“Do you like this show? Let us know by leaving us a rating on our Spotify show page,&#8221; one example says. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;As a creator, I can see this feels like a marketing move,&#8221; said Eric Silver, head of Creative at <a href="https://multitude.productions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multitude Productions</a>, an independent podcasting collective. &#8220;I don&#8217;t tell people to rate and review on Apple Podcasts at all because I know it doesn&#8217;t do anything other than make me feel good.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a similar marketing tactic to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/spotifys-wrapped-2021-arrives-with-artist-video-messages-blend-and-even-a-game/">Spotify Wrapped</a>, which trended across social media earlier this month &#8212; it&#8217;s fun to share your music and podcast listening habits with your friends, but at the same time, it&#8217;s a big PR success for Spotify.</p>
<p>Even though Spotify&#8217;s new rating system won&#8217;t impact distribution, Silver says that he will probably encourage listeners to rate Multitude shows on Spotify, at least for a few weeks. Spotify recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/spotify-says-u-s-podcast-listeners-now-use-its-service-more-than-apple-podcasts/">surpassed</a> Apple Podcasts in U.S. podcast listenership &#8212; so if a large portion of potential audience members are going to see that rating right when they navigate to your show&#8217;s page, it makes sense to ask fans to rate your show.</p>
<p>YouTube, TikTok and other creative platforms show potential audience members, right off the bat, how many followers you have. But you don&#8217;t know how many downloads and subscribers a podcast has unless the podcaster tells you. Even though ratings and reviews are an indication of popularity, this differentiates the podcasting industry from other more algorithmically driven media, like video.</p>
<p>&#8220;Theoretically, the algorithm is supposed to help you. But isn&#8217;t this the tech conversation of our age?&#8221; said Silver. &#8220;It&#8217;s so complicated. It&#8217;s not just like, &#8216;Well, I wish there was an algorithm so there&#8217;s more discovery,&#8217; but then the opposite is when you have an issue like YouTube and TikTok.&#8221;</p>
<p>Creators on platforms like YouTube and TikTok are incentivized to make content that they think the algorithm likes, perhaps more so than what they think their audience will like. But even in media, that&#8217;s less algorithm-dependent; like podcasting and even Twitch streaming, there are still inherent biases. Earlier this year, when Twitch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/spotify-says-u-s-podcast-listeners-now-use-its-service-more-than-apple-podcasts/">payout data</a> was leaked, it was revealed that the highest-paid woman streamer, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pokimane" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokimane</a>, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-10-06-twitch-leak-reveals-streamer-earnings-and-lack-of-diversity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only the 39th</a> highest paid on Twitch. Podcasting <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_feature/podcasts-diversity.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn&#8217;t known for its diversity</a> either.</p>
<p>Even though Spotify isn&#8217;t using podcast ratings for algorithmic recommendations yet, it could be part of a larger plan to make it easier to find podcasts. Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/spotify-acquires-podz-a-podcast-discovery-app/">acquired Podz</a> earlier this year to try to promote podcast discoverability.</p>
<p>In the short term, this is a clever move from Spotify to get podcasters to tell their audiences to go on Spotify, since they will need to make their show look good through ratings. This isn&#8217;t inherently a bad thing, but as Spotify and Apple compete for the greater share of the podcasting ecosystem, creators can feel like their livelihoods are caught in the middle of a larger tech race.</p>
