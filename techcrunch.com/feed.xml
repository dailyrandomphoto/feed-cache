										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage startup marketers must walk a fine line: Everyone is free to chime in on their work, and campaign budgets for pre-revenue companies are notoriously thin.</p>
<p>The CTO can always boast how many tickets their team has closed and the release dates they&#8217;ve met, but a growth manager&#8217;s key performance metrics may not manifest for weeks — or months.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we reached out to several marketing experts and asked each of them the same question:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234996" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/growth-marketing-experts-survey-how-would-you-spend-a-25000-budget-in-q1-2022/">&#8220;If you only had a $25,000 marketing budget for Q1 2022, how would you spend it?&#8221;</a></strong></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s who we talked to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cam Sinclair, director/marketeer, Ammo</li>
<li>Jonathan Metrick, chief growth officer, Portage Ventures</li>
<li>Tracey Wallace, director of marketing, MarketerHire</li>
<li>Jonathan Martinez, founder, JMStrategy</li>
<li>Maya Moufarek, founder, Marketing Cube</li>
<li>Peep Laja, CEO, Wynter and founder of CXL</li>
<li>Lindsay Goldman, strategic advisor, MO Pros</li>
</ul>
<p>The detailed suggestions we received included budget breakdowns, tips for developing minimum viable brand designs and advice on how to measure success.</p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t have a marketing person on your team, there&#8217;s still enough time on the calendar to hire a part-timer by January 1 who can execute several of these strategies and tactics.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading,</p>

<p>Most new startups operate with a hybrid workforce, but that doesn&#8217;t guarantee that hiring processes have kept pace.</p>
<p>In a panel discussion at TechCrunch Disrupt, Managing Editor Eric Eldon interviewed Jaime Bott, talent partner at Sequoia, Tawni Nazario-Cranz, operating partner at Signalfire, and Doris Tong, founder and CEO of EQ Talent Group, to learn more about recent shifts in recruiting.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just engineering talent that&#8217;s in high demand — with so many startups staffing up, &#8220;there aren&#8217;t enough senior people to hire overall in the world,&#8221; Eric writes.</p>

<p>Like many of you, my first exposure to Casper was via the company&#8217;s ubiquitous podcast ads promoting its mattresses a few years ago.</p>
<p>The company has had an interesting trajectory: venture-backed, it &#8220;has struggled as a public concern&#8221; since its 2020 IPO, reports Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the company announced it would go private again, &#8220;and given that we&#8217;re seeing cash-hungry operations like Sweetgreen and Rent the Runway list, it&#8217;s worth digging into what happened at Casper.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a week of dynamic news, Ryan Lawler and Alex Wilhelm filed a Friday afternoon collab that looked back at &#8220;a series of winning fintech results from BNPL, consumer finance, proptech and corporate finance players.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their recap covered Affirm&#8217;s earnings, Zillow&#8217;s iBuying abandonment and lackluster earnings results from Robinhood and Square driven by a decline in crypto trading.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s shaping up to be fintech&#8217;s year, both in the public and private markets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Podium, which provides software services to SMBs, landed a $201 million round at a $3 billion valuation, with an investor telling Bloomberg the Utah-based company will &#8220;definitely&#8221; go public.</p>
<p>Podium declined to share much beyond that.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lack of hard financial results makes Podium&#8217;s upcoming IPO … all the more curious,&#8221; Alex Wilhelm writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given that we are going to see results for Podium&#8217;s current performance inside of its eventual S-1 filing, why not tell us now?&#8221;</p>

<p>To better serve consumers who use at least 14 different currencies, Latin America&#8217;s online merchants are building innovative, robust fintech infrastructure that&#8217;s benefiting global brands and SMEs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The key to growing market share and loyalty for global merchants and service providers is knocking out the friction tied to payments and the online buying experience,&#8221; writes EBANX CEO João Del Valle.</p>
<p>&#8220;In practice, consumers want this process to be &#8216;thoughtless&#8217; so that there are no barriers to paying using the methods they prefer and ensuring that digital transactions are fast, easy, painless and secure.&#8221;</p>

<p>African startups have already outraised all prior years, meaning that 2021 is certain to be one for the books, Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim report for The Exchange.</p>
<p>They found that the situation in Africa looks a lot like it does elsewhere: Investors are making deals at a rapid pace, and diligence is often getting back-burnered.</p>
<p>To help make sense of the numbers, they spoke to Novastar Ventures&#8217; West Africa director Brian Odhiambo and Lexi Novitske, managing partner at Acuity Venture Partners.</p>

<p>Edtech startup Woolf landed a $7.5 million seed round not to offer an alternative to education, but to legitimize those alternatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Woolf University isn&#8217;t competing with the cadre of startups offering non-accredited alternatives to education,&#8221; Natasha Mascarenhas writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead, Woolf wants to make them future customers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim unboxed new data from CB Insights on venture capital investment in AI, noting that rising dollar amounts and deal volumes mean more AI-focused startups are headed toward public markets.</p>
<p>They leaned on Sapphire Ventures partner Jai Das and Glasswing Venture partner Rudina Seseri to help make sense of the numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you raise $100 million total, let alone in a single shot, investors are betting on an exit north of $1 billion, and hopefully much larger,&#8221; Anna and Alex wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of those companies will need to power their own exit, instead of looking for a soft corporate landing.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no exaggeration to say that Microsoft&#8217;s transition to cloud computing fundamentally changed how the tech giant does business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Microsoft wasn&#8217;t just asking customers to make this change,&#8221; Ron Miller writes. &#8220;It also involved massive internal change for everything from how you build and deliver software — moving from a waterfall schedule of months and years to an agile one, where you could potentially be updating on a daily basis.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Space may be the final frontier, but there’s nothing “final” about developing new and more cost-efficient ways to get there. Whether you have your sights set on Mars, delivering payloads to the International Space Station (ISS) or blasting satellites into geosynchronous orbit, it all starts with launch systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll learn plenty about these critical systems — including the latest developments and opportunities in the evolving launch market — at</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=111621post&amp;display="> <span style="font-weight: 400;">TC Sessions: Space 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  on December 14-15.</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=111621post&amp;display=TRUE"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy your pass now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and save $100.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All payloads, such as satellites, spacecraft, astronauts or supplies destined for the ISS, require rockets with enough propellant to launch and get them safely to their intended destinations. But it’s not that simple: the scale and type of the launch system varies depending on the destination (thank you, Captain Obvious).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234029" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve orbit, a launch vehicle must hit a minimum velocity of 17,500 mph. Flying to the moon or to Mars requires a minimum velocity of 25,000 mph. The massive amount — and weight — of propellant required to meet those speeds means the launch vehicle’s structural weight must be kept to the bare minimum. And that’s without getting into reusable launch stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without launch systems there are no payloads — no Earth observation satellites measuring environmental and atmospheric patterns, informing air traffic control and autonomous ground transportation or search and rescue capabilities. No telecommunication or radio navigation systems to provide accurate positioning for satellite constellations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s safe to say that designing more fuel- and weight-efficient launch systems to deliver payloads more cost-effectively is essential to a sustainable space economy and an area of opportunity for early-stage space startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most space folks are well aware of the incredible achievements of both SpaceX (it just successfully launched its</span><a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-3-dragon-astronauts-launch"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">fourth crewed mission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for NASA) and Rocket Lab (</span><a href="https://www.space.com/rocket-lab-love-at-first-insight-launch-booster-recovery-webcast"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which plans to launch </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">two commercial Earth-observation satellites on a two-stage Electron rocket). But it also pays to keep an eye on the up-and comers — and you’ll meet them at TC Sessions: Space 2021.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a prime example. Don’t miss “New Kids on the Launch Block,” a panel discussion with</span><a href="https://launcherspace.com/team"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Max Hoat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Launcher),</span><a href="https://astra.com/news/meet-the-team-benjamin-lyon/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Benjamin Lyon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Astra) and</span><a href="https://firefly.com/firefly-names-former-spacex-and-blue-origin-veteran-as-chief-operating-officer/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren Lyons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Firefly Aerospace).

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Two of the country&#8217;s biggest retailers, Walmart and Walgreens, recently announced they are <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90658779/how-walgreens-and-walmarts-new-banking-ventures-will-shake-up-finance">launching their own financial services</a>. This makes sense. The pandemic has resulted in a shift in consumer behavior that now favors contactless and digital banking options, and with <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cfsi-innovation-files-2018/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/31170215/2019-Market-Size-Report.pdf">one in four U.S. adults</a> considered unbanked or underbanked, this presents an opportunity to offer services to a deep and loyal customer base.</p>
<p>But as the pandemic has forced even traditional retail banks to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/banking-capital-markets/library/coronavirus-impacts-retail-banking.html">rethink their business model</a>, launching a financial service isn’t as simple as taking a successful retail model and applying it to banking. It needs to be both effective and secure. This is where fintech can step in.</p>
<p>As more and more retailers make this move, partnering and collaborating with fintechs can help them build, scale and secure their financial offerings. Building infrastructure and providing top-notch cybersecurity is at the <em>core </em>of what we do, not the sideshow. And the best way for retailers to attract, gain and retain customers — and do so in a meaningful way that adapts to the current environment — is to start focused, scale quickly and keep secure.</p>
<h2>Helping retailers get up to speed</h2>
<p>At Prime Trust, we have seen more and more retailers asking for guidance or specific widgets. They want to know how we can help them create more interesting product offerings for their customers as well as ensure the products are secure.</p>
<p>They turn to us because they don&#8217;t know where to start. We get it. From NFTs to Ethereum, the buzzwords are always changing. But the core problems remain the same. Every conversation about a new currency offers an opportunity to educate a potential customer on the fintech ecosystem, to explain how the blockchain works and how fintech companies can help.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			As retailers expand banking opportunities, they will need help positioning their products, keeping them safe and selling them to end users.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Retailers looking to enter the financial services industry need to get to market quickly, especially if they have no previous experience in any type of financial or credit offering for their customers. The strategy behind speed is a hyperfocused offering.</p>
<p>Start with smaller services with much more focus, developing a deep understanding of what the customer wants and delivering a great experience from that. The sooner a retailer can gain a toehold in the market and start to gain mindshare the better positioned they will be when they start to scale.</p>
<p>For example, if a retailer wanted to start with a payment platform, it’ll need to open user accounts, fund those accounts and allow users to send or spend that money (maybe even buy some crypto). Work with them to create custodial accounts, adhere to a KYC/AMC compliance process, tie a debit card to those accounts and process the sending and receiving of funds. And if they want some crypto, fintech startups can source liquidity and convert fiat to crypto. These steps would help to establish a ground level for the retailer and a base to scale.</p>
<p>Whenever you have an education session with a retailer, you should help them understand the space and figure out how to position their entry. In return, retailers will help you sharpen your user profiles and sense of the marketplace, as well as push you to create plug and play widgets and APIs that you can offer your clients as your business expands.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The past two years have been challenging on many fronts for people and businesses alike. As a global community, we have been unable to travel long distances due to various restrictions, but that doesn’t mean we stop reaching for the stars.</p>
<p>During this same time frame, monumental advancements and achievements in space exploration were made &#8212; from the successful launch of the <a href="https://inspiration4.com/">Inspiration 4 SpaceX</a>, which transported four civilian astronauts to space, to <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-ula-launch-lucy-mission-to-fossils-of-planet-formation">NASA’s Lucy mission</a>, launched to study Jupiter&#8217;s trojan asteroids in a quest for deeper knowledge of planetary origins and the formation of our solar system.</p>
<p>We also saw space exploration commandeered by many private companies with the successful launches of <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2021/10/21/rocket-labs-next-launch-will-include-booster-recovery-experiment/">Rocket Labs</a> and <a href="https://earthsky.org/space/virgin-orbit-launches-satellites-june30-21/#:~:text=Virgin%20Orbit%20celebrated%20the%20success,satellites%20to%20their%20target%20orbits.">Virgin Orbit</a>, while Space Perspective has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/space-perspective-raises-40m-series-a-for-stratospheric-balloon-rides/">started raising money</a> for a balloon-based venture that will take paying customers to the stratosphere.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230471" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These advancements have astonished young and old alike and have given a new meaning to the space race. Actor William Shatner, best known for his role as Captain Kirk from &#8220;Star Trek,” recently made history as the oldest person to fly into space. The 90-year-old was one of four passengers aboard Blue Origin&#8217;s second human spaceflight.</p>
<p>With the “final frontier” now open to private companies, how do we transform the way we continually update the software that runs in space? The term “digital transformation” is nearly ubiquitous here on Earth, but it’s becoming increasingly clear that its concepts will also play a key support role in the next wave of space exploration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best software consultants for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
</blockquote>
<h2>Why DevOps in space?</h2>
<p>One of the great revelations of the new space industry is that it&#8217;s being eaten alive by software. The ability for software to manage communication satellites and do what<a href="https://www.starlink.com/"> Starlink</a> is doing &#8212; developing a low-latency internet system for consumers &#8212; is vital.</p>
<p>When you look at everything going on in the “new space” — watching Earth, traveling into deep space, the moon, Mars, etc. — all of these achievements wouldn’t be possible without software. Software is getting smarter, better and easier to update; however, the amount of compute power needed to execute software commands in space is growing exponentially.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the cost of launching payloads into space is decreasing rapidly, particularly when compared to just five years ago. Currently, there are more than 2,000 functioning satellites in orbit, but planned constellations will add more than 40,000 satellites in the coming years. We&#8217;re going to see growing numbers of companies creating more evolved infrastructure faster in order to keep upgrading their satellites and constellations with more efficient and powerful software.</p>
<p>Like we see in other environments where edge computing is critical &#8212; automotive, energy/utilities, warehouses and last-mile retail delivery, to name just a few &#8212; companies that reliably, securely and continuously update their satellite software will have a huge advantage over the competition.</p>
<h2>Release fast or risk crashing your satellites</h2>
<p>One of the biggest technological pain points in space travel is power consumption. On Earth, we’re beginning to see more efficient CPU and memory, but in space, throwing away the heat of your CPU is quite hard, making power consumption the critical component. From hardware to software to the way you do processing, everything needs to account for power consumption.</p>
<p>On the flip side, in space, there is one thing that you have plenty of (obviously): space. This means that the size of physical hardware is less of a concern. Weight and power consumption are larger issues, because those factors also impact the way microchips and microprocessors are designed.</p>
<p>A great example of this can be found in the <a href="https://www.ramon.space/">Ramon Space</a> design. The company uses AI- and machine learning-powered processors to build space-resilient supercomputing systems with Earth-like computing capabilities, with the hardware components ultimately controlled by the software they have riding on top of them. The idea is to optimize the way software and hardware are utilized so applications can be developed and adapted in real time, just as they would be here on Earth.</p>
<p>Under this backdrop, the DevOps practices of coding, testing, validating, analyzing and distributing are roughly the same as they are on Earth, but the types of hardware, emulation, feedback loops and reliable testing of software are very different.</p>
<p>My personal view is that we need to create a new way of performing continuous delivery and continuous updates in space. On Earth, many organizations use an orchestrator to handle the continuous update processes — automated configuration, management and coordination of systems, apps and services to help IT teams manage complex tasks and workflows efficiently. As of now, there is no equivalent to this for use with satellites in space, and those that exist are extremely limiting.</p>
<p>For example, an orchestrator needs to send and control satellite updates from the ground, which create a high amount of risk when it comes to concerns such as data security.</p>
<p>Today’s space innovators need to think about a way to give satellites the ability to receive all of the information and data required to run updates correctly, as well as quickly and correctly recover from bad updates to ensure a valid set of binaries on the satellite. That said, I am optimistic that we’re at the onset of a revolution that will soon make the ability to efficiently deliver binaries to next-generation satellites a reality.</p>
<h2>Boldly going where no person (or computing system) has gone before</h2>
<p>When reflecting on the current space race, it’s hard not to think about “Star Trek” and how we as an industry and global community are boldly going where no one has gone before.</p>
<p>We’re continuing to adapt and change to the environment and challenges we face on Earth, and that is now extending to outer space. Shatner’s trip into space was emotional for the legendary actor; upon his return, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/william-shatner-returns-to-space-blue-origin-jeff-bezos-11634162038?mod=article_inline">he told</a> Blue Origin and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, “I’m so filled with emotion about what just happened. I just, it’s extraordinary, extraordinary. I hope I never recover from this.”</p>
<p>That raw human emotion is a product of the innovative technology that made the trip possible, as well as a curiosity and playful desire to push the boundaries.</p>
<p>Under this new paradigm, space has transformed from the “final frontier” to the next opportunity with nearly endless possibilities. In this sense, it’s a unique time to be alive, and I encourage my fellow DevOps peers across all industries to continue reaching for the stars — literally.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cognixion, a startup designing an intuitive brain-monitoring headset and interface for people with physical disabilities, has <a href="https://www.cognixion.com/blog/2021/11/16/cognixion-raises-12-million-to-advance-assisted-reality-tech-for-millions-affected-by-communication-disabilities">raised a $12M A round</a> to pursue its accessibility ambitions. Armed with this funding, it should be able to complete the long list of requirements necessary for any medical or assistive device to be made widely available.</p>
<p>The company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/cognixions-brain-monitoring-headset-enables-fluid-communication-for-people-with-severe-disabilities/">which I covered in detail in May,</a> makes a headset that uses electroencephalography to detect certain patterns of brain activity, which are then used to guide a cursor and navigate a full-featured interface. It uses an iPhone as its own &#8220;brain&#8221; and for a display, and connects to accessories like speakers and accessibility devices so that the user can do everything they need to in a single UI.</p>
<p>The advance it&#8217;s all built on is a new type of (non-invasive) electrode and a machine learning system that quickly interprets the signals produced by the ones embedded in the headset. While EEGs are useful, they are generally slow and noisy, but Cognixion&#8217;s approach makes them quick and relatively precise — enough that a person can reliably navigate a modern UI using their brain.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235114" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s meant for people with physical disabilities serious enough that a joystick, gaze-tracking device or other common accessibility options aren&#8217;t possible. Options for people in that condition are few and far between and those that are available are slow and tedious to use.</p>
<p>Since coming out of stealth mode Cognixion has been hard at work on the various tasks associated with putting an assistive device on the market. While the company has done some pilot tests with early adopters, it needs more to justify the kind of clearance it needs to be covered by insurance, Medicaid and so on, not to mention getting to the level where caregivers are comfortable recommending the device.</p>

<p>&#8220;The two big themes recently have been in the areas of clinical and regulatory work as well as optimization and efficiency,&#8221; said CEO and co-founder Andreas Forsland. &#8220;We have a group of almost 150 users, clinicians and caregivers involved as an advisory council in all of our development processes so we&#8217;re constantly getting very rich feedback from that group. We&#8217;ve already iterated many times on the hardware but are quickly approaching a final design; moving beyond that, a lot of the rapid improvements we’re seeing right now focus on the user interface and language system design.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two new features in particular are underway. First, a predictive speech algorithm that will help users piece together full sentences quickly and adapt to their particular needs. Second is direct Alexa integration. Cognixion has been working with Amazon to empower and integrate into the headset as a true smart device hub not merely a tunnel for common voice commands or queries.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re incredibly grateful to Amazon’s Alexa team for their support through this process, and to Amazon generally for granting the exceptions needed for us to get this done,&#8221; Forsland said. &#8220;The context on it is important; right now there aren&#8217;t any augmentative communication tools or even anything in assistive technology generally that interface directly with home automation tools. So it&#8217;s a huge first for the accessibility industry, but also a first in terms of universal design in general.&#8221;</p>
<p>The $12 million round was led by Prime Movers Lab, with participation by Northwell Health, Amazon Alexa Fund and Volta Circle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would think that Cognixion ONE is something out of science fiction if it didn’t already exist,&#8221; said Primer Movers Lab GP Amy Kruse in the company&#8217;s press release. &#8220;We believe that it will be a fundamentally life-changing and integral blend of an AI software platform with hardware to assist people of all ages who live with speech and motor disabilities, including cerebral palsy, brainstem stroke, ALS and many other conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>While it&#8217;ll still be a bit before the ONE headset is available for purchase, Forsland said they&#8217;ve lined up a reseller and distributor already that works with practically every research university out there. Things are looking good for this innovative approach to accessibility and hopefully soon it will be on the heads of anyone who needs it.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the first half of 2021, global venture funding <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-h1-2021-monthly-recap/">shattered</a> the previous six-month record — set in the second half of 2020 — by more than $100 billion. The market was <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/startups-boom-united-states-during-covid-19#_ftn1">flooded with new startups</a>, and one after another made headlines for deals that were previously unheard of: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/former-zillow-execs-raise-70m-seed-round-with-new-startup-tomo/?tpcc=ECTW2020">a $70 million seed round</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/after-bootstrapping-since-2002-articulate-raises-1-5b-on-3-75b-valuation/">$1.5 billion Series A</a>, <a href="https://remote.com/blog/remote-raises-series-b-unicorn-valuation">a unicorn valuation after just two years.</a></p>
<p>If you are thinking that there has never been an easier or better time to raise money, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">you are right</a>. First, the pandemic generated huge demand for new products and services as we all adjusted to new ways of working and living. And second, the pandemic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/superhumans-rahul-vohra-asks-6-vcs-how-to-raise-funding-when-the-sky-is-falling/">made funding more accessible</a> as deal-making shifted almost entirely to Zoom.</p>
<p>There are therefore a huge number of founders trying to raise — I myself just raised <a href="https://blog.superhuman.com/superhuman-raises-75m-series-c/">Superhuman’s Series C</a> — and many of them are doing it for the first time. In my role as an <a href="https://www.toddandrahulangelfund.com/">angel investor</a> in startups like <a href="https://www.onlyalt.com/">Alt</a>, <a href="https://circle.so/">Circle</a> and <a href="https://destiny.xyz/">Destiny</a>, I am often asked for fundraising advice, and these are the five tips I give out over and over again.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233473" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Always be raising, but never <em>actively</em> raising</h2>
<p>Most founders are familiar with the maxim that they should always be raising. And while this is true, I would add the caveat that you should never be <em>actively</em> raising.</p>
<p>Why? Because the best companies are never actively looking for funding; rather, they have investors chasing them all the time. In venture capital, perception is important — and seeming desperate is not a good look!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So while you should always be having conversations and building relationships, you should avoid saying you are raising until you have your first inbound offer. At that point, you&#8217;re not raising because you have to; you&#8217;re raising because you already have an offer.</p>
<h2>Understand the code</h2>
<p>“Let’s run a &#8216;no-process&#8217; process.”</p>
<p>“We want to invest at least $10 million.”</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re basically there. I&#8217;d just like you to meet a few more people.”</p>
<p>Statements like this seem straightforward, but, in reality, are part of the coded language that VCs use. In this sense, raising a round is a lot like dating. Neither side wants to put all of their cards on the table, and you can’t always take what’s said at face value.</p>
<p>Find somebody who has been through this process before — ideally on both sides of the table — who can help you decipher what these phrases mean. This is especially true when investors start floating numbers, such as &#8220;we want to invest at least $10 million.” Is this an offer to invest or simply an investing strategy?</p>
<p>You need good intuition — and access to wisdom — to know how close you really are. Many early-stage startups stumble by reading too much into statements like these.</p>
<h2>Always make a deck</h2>
<p>While we’re on the topic of things not to take at face value, I’ll share one that I’ve heard many times: “You don’t need to make a deck, we’ll just walk through your data together.”</p>
<p>While it may seem tempting — making a great pitch deck is massively time-consuming — do not do this! If a potential investor is telling you not to make a deck, it is genuinely to save you time … but it is also because they do not want you to show that deck to any other investor. So next time, do the exact opposite: Make the deck. In fact, make the most compelling and highly polished deck that you can imagine.</p>
<p>This approach has several advantages. First, having this deck will actually make it more likely that you get an offer from this initial investor. Second, you now have an incredible asset to share with other potential investors. And third, even if you do not end up with an offer, you now have a fantastic tool you can use to close candidates, boost morale and inspire your team.</p>
<h2>Be prepared to go from zero to 100 very quickly</h2>
<p>Having your deck ready is key for this next step. After months of Zoom calls, coffees and relationship building as part of your always-raising-but-never-actively-raising strategy, you’re going to get a term sheet from an investor you’re excited about.</p>
<p>At this point, you need to drop everything to talk to other investors and quickly get a deal over the line. Today, timelines are extremely compressed: Many investors are moving from verbal offer to term sheet in just a few days. This means that you have a very short window to make a market, avoid looking like you are &#8220;shopping&#8221; and avoid becoming a &#8220;stale deal.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Don’t talk to too many people</h2>
<p>This brings me to my final point: When engaging investors who could lead your next round, start with your top five, not your top 15. Word makes its way around investing circles very fast, and if you are talking to too many firms simultaneously, folks will wonder why. Is there something hidden in your data? Or trouble on your team? As I mentioned before, perception is important, and you want to be operating from a position of strength.</p>
<p>Raising money for your startup is almost always a wild ride; I’ve been through the process many times and I learn something new with each round. Happily, investor appetite is at an all-time high. If you arm yourself with just a bit of this insider know-how, you can grow your company faster than ever before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lambda School, a buzzy coding bootcamp that <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lambda-school">has landed over $122 million in known venture capital to date</a>, is rebranding to <a href="https://www.bloomtech.com/">Bloom Institute of Technology</a>, according to a blog post from <a href="https://www.bloomtech.com/article/embracing-a-new-identity-as-bloom-institute-of-technology">CEO Austen Allred. </a></p>
<p>The company is also updating its tuition payment options to introduce an outcomes-based loan. The financing instrument allows students to take a loan with zero dollars upfront, and then get 110% of their tuition refunded, including fees and interest from an approved lender, if they are unable to secure a job within the next year. A student is only eligible for the refund if they apply to 10 jobs, network with 10 professionals and post at least 5 GitHub contributions to their public GitHub profile per week, for 46 of the 52 weeks within a year.</p>
<p>In order to apply for an outcomes-based loan, a student must be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident or DACA recipient with an established credit history and no outstanding education loan defaults. Additionally, temporary residents can apply for a loan with a co-signer who fits that criteria. At this stage, the outcomes-based loan is not available if a student lives in California. The move means that Bloom will be going beyond the original vision of scaling income-sharing agreements, the controversial financing vehicle that it pioneered. ISAs will continue to be offered as an option, with some changes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235061" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Change at Lambda has felt inevitable for a long while. Nearly a year after its last layoff, Lambda School <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/lambda-school-lays-off-65-employees-amid-restructuring/">announced more cuts in April</a> amid a broader restructuring. Then, Allred admitted that it’s been difficult to make his company’s vision work.</p>
<p>“We have been working for years on making incentive-aligned education work,” Allred <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Austen/status/1387894975682301955">tweeted</a> in August. “It’s harder than we initially thought; we’ve had to invent a lot from scratch simultaneously and we have to get a lot of things exactly right.”</p>
<p>Lambda’s rebrand comes after years of scrutiny from former students and educators about the efficacy of its education. Most recently, independent journalist Vincent Woo published a piece alleging that Lambda is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-promised-lucrative-tech-coding-career-low-job-placement-2021-10">inflating its job-placement rates</a> and then marketing those to eager students. The company is also facing a lawsuit from three former students <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/lambda-school-lawsuits/">alleging misleading financial and educational practices</a>.</p>
<p>The name change could thus shake off some of the baggage the bootcamp has been holding onto (and help it attract more students).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“No matter which option you choose, you will be signing legally binding documents that will affect your finances,” BloomTech’s website states. “We&#8217;ll do everything we can to help you feel confident about your decision.” Moving to focus more explicitly on outcomes-based education places Bloom in the same bucket as other bootcamps eyeing accreditation as a future path (plus, the institutional-sounding name doesn&#8217;t hurt, either).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="90GhxFzEXQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/13/woolf-accrediting-as-a-service-and-the-future-of-alternative-degrees/">Accrediting as a service and the future of alternative degrees</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, Lambda School was one of the most well-known coding bootcamps out there, with a solid flurry of “Lambda for X” competitors such as Henry and Microverse. Other companies also offer ISAs, such as Pursuit, V School, Launch School and the Grace Hopper Program. Lambda&#8217;s name recognition helped it become somewhat synonymous with the startup-powered bootcamp market. With today&#8217;s news, it will need to rebuild customer awareness alongside its pitch to get more customer loyalty.</p>
<p>BloomTech has not yet responded to requests for further comment from TechCrunch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the crypto world continues to heat up, developers are clinging to the Ethereum network despite its general struggle to meet the stresses of a global network&#8217;s transaction load. To speed and cheapen transactions on Ethereum, developers are looking toward so-called Layer-2 (L2) blockchains, which build on the Ethereum network, offloading the computational stresses while still writing transaction data to the main network.</p>
<p><a href="https://starkware.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StarkWare</a>, which builds an Ethereum scaling solution called StarkNet, has just closed a $50 million Series C led by Sequoia Capital. The raise comes several months after the firm raised a $75 million Series B led by Paradigm, a crypto VC firm co-led by former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang.</p>
<p>This latest raise values the Israeli startup at a whopping $2 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235012" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jmXZJD8KYo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/crypto-vc-firm-paradigm-debuts-monster-2-5-billion-fund/">Crypto VC firm Paradigm debuts monster $2.5 billion fund</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Crypto VC firm Paradigm debuts monster $2.5 billion fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/crypto-vc-firm-paradigm-debuts-monster-2-5-billion-fund/embed/#?secret=jmXZJD8KYo" data-secret="jmXZJD8KYo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As the Ethereum network continues to swell in popularity despite traction from competing blockchains with deeper efficiency, investors are starting to dump more money into the infrastructure startups aiming to help Ethereum scale to more users and more transaction volume. Earlier this month, TechCrunch covered the Series B raise of Matter Labs backed by Andreessen Horowitz. In August, Lightspeed backed startup Offchain Labs in a raise that valued the blockchain scaling company at $1.2 billion.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Despite being one of the more renowned investment firms in the tech sector, Sequoia has been slower to fully embrace crypto startups, leaving competitors like Andreessen Horowitz space to back more early players through dedicated funds. Sequoia first backed StarkWare back in 2018, though this is the first time leading a round for the startup. A recent report from <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/no-longer-just-crypto-curious-sand-hill-road-investors-get-blockchain-fever?rc=ajsw4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Information</a> detailed that a quarter of Sequoia&#8217;s new investments this year were made in blockchain startups.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The main thing that distinguishes us in the L2 ecosystem&#8230; is that we are basically servicing the largest throughput today in terms of both transactions and volume across all the [L2] solutions out there,&#8221; co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;ve settled over $200 billion and settled over 50 million transactions.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>StarkWare&#8217;s particular scaling solution is what&#8217;s called a zero-knowledge rollup; it processes a number of transactions on its platform and inscribes the bundled data to the Ethereum network. Unlike competing &#8220;optimistic rollups,&#8221; which rely on a network of validators to ensure that the bundled data is legitimate after it&#8217;s published, zero-knowledge proofs leverage cryptography to mathematically ensure that everything is up to snuff before publishing it. Those cryptographic proofs require more computational effort than other solutions, but their more secure architecture has led plenty of developers to believe they are the future of scalability for the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>Some of StarkWare&#8217;s customers include ConsenSys, Immutable, dYdX and Sorare. The startup is currently gearing up for the Ethereum mainnet deployment later this month of its StarkNet L2 after months in public testing.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Our valuation] indicates that the investment community expects great things from the permission-less blockchain space and understands that scaling it is really a necessary capability that must be put in place and deployed,&#8221; CEO Uri Kolodny tells TechCrunch. &#8220;And that&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;re doing two weeks from now.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remote and hybrid working are the order of the day, and now a startup called <a href="https://anydesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AnyDesk</a> that helps enable that to be pulled off smoothly &#8212; regardless of the architecture of a company&#8217;s network, or where a person happens to be working &#8212; is announcing a round of $70 million to fuel its growth. The Stuttgart-based company said that the Series C values it at over $600 million.</p>
<p>General Atlantic is leading the round, with existing investors Insight Partners, EQT Ventures and Possible Ventures also participating.</p>
<p>Knowledge workers have a lot of options these days when it comes to how they work: apps and documents often now live in the cloud and we often have fast connections to access them; and while virtualization was <a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/marketing/reports/state-of-virtualization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> to be used by only 30% of enterprises last year, it is projected to see a surge of adoption this year as COVID-19-led digital transformation continues to play out. Still, there is a lot left on the table when it comes to offering workers solutions that just work regardless of how organizations have built out, manage or invest in their IT architecture, or how well connectivity happens to be.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234732" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That is the big gap in the market where AnyDesk plays, and it has seen a lot of traction.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal was that we wanted to make the leanest and smallest software that was easiest for the most people to use,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Philipp Weiser said of AnyDesk&#8217;s original idea. AnyDesk can work on connections as low as 100 kbps and still run smooth graphics, the company says. &#8220;The tech community likes us because of those things.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is something a little anachronistic about what AnyDesk is doing: Not only is the software proprietary &#8212; that is, closed source &#8212; but it acknowledges all the actual shortcomings of the IT landscape today, and it is there to meet the needs of all of the many companies out there that either can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t buy into the concept of &#8220;digital transformation,&#8221; at least not enough to move their infrastructure to the cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;For every move there is a counter move,&#8221; Weiser said, highlighting that for every company that is investing in virtualization, there are examples where this can&#8217;t work. &#8220;Manufacturing pipelines cannot move to cloud. It poses certain risks.&#8221; He also noted that in cases where data has to, by law, reside in a single country, AnyDesk can be used as a way for people in remote locations to work with it, without having to resort to using VPNs (which have their own latency and other reliability issues). In short, &#8220;the reality is always much more complex,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And that has proven to be a big business for AnyDesk. Its software &#8212; which lets people essentially create a low-latency mirror of one connected device&#8217;s desktop on another machine (be it computer, phone or whatever) &#8212; has been downloaded 500 million times since it was founded in 2014, and on average it sees more than 900 million sessions each month &#8220;spanning&#8221; some 50 million miles. Its customer base totals some 80,000 organizations, including educational and government institutions, media companies, IT services and a variety of other large enterprises.</p>
<p>Part of AnyDesk&#8217;s attraction is the speed at which it works, but part of it is also how it is priced: individuals can use it for free, while business users can buy services in a variety of tiers starting at around $10/month.</p>
<p>As you might guess, the surge of remote and hybrid working that has swept the world in the last 20 months has led to a big boost in business for AnyDesk, which provided a quick solution for many people who unexpectedly found themselves needing to log into and use their systems remotely for the first time. Downloads actually doubled in the last year. But that was not completely in haste. Weiser said that the architecture of how AnyDesk works actually makes it very secure to use &#8212; connections are encrypted, and users (and enterprises, when the usage is through a business plan) can also customize security settings.</p>
<p>But even if it&#8217;s a bit of a renegade, the plan will be to incorporate VPN functionality for those who want it, and there may be plans down the line also to work within more established virtualization tech. The big providers of virtualization and remote services regularly reach out to AnyDesk, Weiser said, and you could see how it might make sense as a complement to what they are already providing customers, especially in more ad hoc situations where virtualized access is not possible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the flexibility, specifically the fact that it&#8217;s giving business users another choice for services, that is a particular attraction to investors, as well as the traction it has had in the market.</p>
<p>&#8220;AnyDesk is a strong example of the agile, forward-thinking companies that are shaping Germany on a broad scale. We believe in the company’s ability to create next-generation solutions that meet the needs of this new era of remote work and are thrilled to support Philipp Weiser and the AnyDesk team as they continue to set new standards for the industry,&#8221; said Achim Berg, operating partner at General Atlantic, in a statement. He is joining the board with this round.</p>
<p>“We were particularly impressed by the activity levels on a global scale based on a technology stack that is built for a connected multi-platform, hybrid working environment world,&#8221; said Christian Figge, managing director of General Atlantic. &#8220;We will support the company in further extending its offering for enterprise customers globally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facily, a São Paulo-based social commerce marketplace, has quietly raised over $366 million in funding across four different rounds over the last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most recently, <a href="https://web.faci.ly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facily</a> closed on a $250 million Series D that was led by DX Ventures and Berlin-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/delivery-hero-picks-up-glovos-latam-ops-for-272m-in-latest-food-delivery-consolidation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delivery Hero</a>, with Citius as co-anchor investor. That investment values the startup at $850 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glade Brook led its $63 million Series C financing, which included participation from Tiger Global Management and Hill House. Luxor Capital led its $41 million Series B round, which also counted Founders Fund and several other previous investors as backers. Quona Capital and Monashees co-led its $12 million Series A, which included participation from Canary and other partners. Tru Arrow participated in all rounds. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234964" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the financings had been previously announced and all were raised over the past 12 months. The company said its sales volumes grew 43x from January to September. In October alone, Facily delivered more than 7 million items.</span></p>
<p>And now, sources close to the company say Facily is raising even more money that would push its valuation to north of $1 billion.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego Dzodan, Luciano Freitas and Vitor Zaninotto</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">founded Facily in 2018 with a mission of “eliminating the barriers of traditional e-commerce to provide low-income populations in Brazil and throughout Latin America better access to affordable products.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235080" style="width: 341px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235080" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2235080 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-11-16-at-16.07.49-2.jpeg?w=331" alt="" width="331" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-11-16-at-16.07.49-2.jpeg 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-11-16-at-16.07.49-2.jpeg?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-11-16-at-16.07.49-2.jpeg?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-11-16-at-16.07.49-2.jpeg?resize=331,680 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-11-16-at-16.07.49-2.jpeg?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235080" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facily</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put more simply, Facily aims to provide a more inclusive e-commerce experience that pays producers more and “sells cheaper” to those who buy products via its gamified app, which connects consumers to the best prices through group purchases. It says it’s making it easier for lower-income populations to shop online by providing pickup points across the cities in which it operates and offering a variety of payment options &#8212; from bank transfer to cash, with no shipping charges. The model is interesting because like most of Latin America, Brazilians are largely unbanked or underbanked. So the ability to make online purchases without having to use a credit or debit card opens the door for many people who previously could not shop online and likely were paying higher costs for the same products in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facily co-founder and CEO Dzodan points out that about 85% of the Brazilian population are considered low income.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consumers in these sectors spend an average of 65% of their family income on food and so far have been practically excluded from traditional e-commerce,” he said. “Facily attends this need, with most of our users shopping online for the first time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, the company believes that it is at the beginning of its market opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facily claims that its app is now one of the top three most downloaded in Brazil, one of the fastest-growing apps in the country (according to App Annie) and the fastest-growing e-commerce food app globally ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup declined to reveal hard revenue figures, saying only that it has experienced “exponential monthly growth” over the last year. It credits an asset-light business model and logistics network as factors behind its success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to use its new capital on its national expansion, to attract new partners to sell on its site, increased technology investments, logistical intelligence and on “enhancing” its customer experience.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235084" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235084" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-medium wp-image-2235084" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg 2244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg?resize=1366,2048 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235084" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Diego Dzodan, Vitor Zaninotto, and Luciano Freitas (left to right) / Facily/Murillo Constantino</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From early visits with farmers who produce fresh goods for Facily, to more recent warehouse visits, I’ve been incredibly im</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pressed by Facily’s vision of a Brazil where it can be affordable to buy the things your family needs and profitable to produce them,” said Jonathan Whittle, co-founder and managing partner at Quona, which co-led the Series A, in a statement. “There is incredible potential here and we are delighted to support this extraordinary team.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luxor Capital’s Jon Green agrees, noting that his firm sees in Facily a complete service that still much potential to grow and expand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are a large number of Brazilians who are not involved in e-commerce and who will be able to save by migrating to this new group buying model brought by Facily,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech company <a href="https://www.upgrade.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upgrade</a> has raised a Series F round just four months after raising its previous round. Today, the company is <a href="https://www.upgrade.com/press/upgrade-raises-280-million-at-6-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> $280 million in new funding at a $6 billion pre-money valuation.</p>
<p>In August, the company announced its <a href="https://www.upgrade.com/press/upgrade-closes-105-million-series-e-round-at-3-325-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series E round</a> — $105 million at a $3.325 billion valuation. In other words, the company is both well capitalized and has increased its valuation by a few billion dollars in very little time.</p>
<p>Today’s Series F round was led by Coatue Management and DST Global. Dragoneer Investment Group also participated, as well as some existing investors, such as Gopher Asset Management, G Squared, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Old Well Partners, Ribbit Capital, Sands Capital, Ventura Capital and Vy Capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235101" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Upgrade is focusing on responsible credit for consumers in the U.S. It offers several <a href="https://www.upgrade.com/upgrade-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">credit cards</a> that encourage you to pay your balance on time. When you make your monthly balance payments, you receive rewards.</p>
<p>The company offers 1.5% cash back on all purchases with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/upgrade-adds-rewards-program-to-its-credit-card/">Cash Rewards card</a>. It also lets you receive 1.5% back in bitcoin with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/upgrade-launches-a-credit-card-with-bitcoin-rewards/">another credit card</a> focused on bitcoin rewards.</p>
<p>But what if you can’t pay your monthly balance? In order to help you get out of your credit card debt, Upgrade combines monthly charges into installment plans that you can pay back over 24 to 60 months. You pay down your balance at a fixed rate with equal monthly payments.</p>
<p>The company has also launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/upgrade-launches-checking-accounts-and-debit-cards/">checking accounts</a> and debit cards for people looking for an alternative to their existing bank account. In particular, there are no monthly fees and no minimum account balance. You also get rewards on debit card payments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And if you don’t want to get a new credit card or a new bank account, Upgrade also lets you apply to personal loans with APRs ranging from 5.94% to 35.97%.</p>
<p>Overall, the company has delivered $10 billion in credit to consumers through its credit cards and personal loans. But Upgrade’s growth has been accelerating as the company expects to deliver $8 billion in credit in 2021 alone.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caya/">Jose Cayasso</a> is the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://slidebean.com/">Slidebean</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">My team and I go through 250 to 300 investor decks every single month. Even though a small group of founders has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/notion-investment-memo-for-startup-replace-pitch-deck-2021-9">started exploring Notion memos</a> to replace pitch decks, the reality is that most investors will still expect a good old slide presentation.</p>
<p>The following are slides that we constantly see founders struggle to solve. The most common reasons why these slides don’t work?</p>
<ul>
<li>Founders haven’t really solved that aspect of their businesses.</li>
<li>The founder doesn’t understand what the slide means or what it needs to answer for the investor.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Go-to-market slide</h2>
<p>What it needs to answer: How will you triple your revenue year over year?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			A good go-to-market slide must show the company understands why it&#8217;s growing and what it needs to do to continue.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For most decks and most company stages, the go-to-market slide is the most critical in the presentation. Most companies are pitching investors when they have a bit of traction, so it&#8217;s safe to assume most of the capital will go toward accelerating growth.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the company stage, “go-to-market” ought to be considered a section rather than an individual slide. As a general rule, the later stage the company is, the longer and more detailed this section becomes. We worked on the pitch deck that raised<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/upkeep-raises-36-million-series-b-to-help-facilities-and-maintenance-teams-go-mobile"> UpKeep&#8217;s Series B round</a>, and the go-to-market section was about seven slides long.</p>
<p>If you are structuring your pitch deck cohesively, the go-to-market will probably be the first slide investors will encounter that details how the company intends to use its funding. We usually put go-to-market slides after the business model slide but before the market size slide; that way, you can dive into expansion after the investor already understands how you make money (and before touching on the market potential).</p>
<p>One of my favorite go-to-market slides comes from <a href="https://slidebean.com/blog/airbnb-pitch-deck">Airbnb’s 2009 pitch deck</a> (the one they used for YC Demo Day):</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2234831" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234831" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2234831" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Caya-TC-image1.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Caya-TC-image1.jpg 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Caya-TC-image1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Caya-TC-image1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Caya-TC-image1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Caya-TC-image1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Caya-TC-image1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234831" class="wp-caption-text">Airbnb’s go-to-market slide from its original 2009 deck as redesigned by Slidebean.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Slidebean</p></div></p>
<p>Notice how at this point (seed stage), Airbnb had identified three critical go-to-market tactics:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Targeting festivals and events” shows a good understanding of the audience willing to “experiment” with their offering.</li>
<li>“Partnerships with existing booking providers,” a source of growth that is still used today.</li>
<li>Its “dual posting feature” on Craigslist. At the time, Airbnb had developed a simple bot that automatically cross-posted all new Airbnb listings to Craigslist. All posts had a link back to their website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the most common mistakes I see on go-to-market slides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Being too generic about growth tactics:</strong> Founders just make a list of five to six growth channels they intend to experiment on without going into detail about what they are doing there and what they are doing differently from their competitors.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/candice-bristow-6923a75/">Candice Bristow</a> is director of EID and recruiting at <a href="http://www.expel.io">Expel Inc.</a> 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Businesses have struggled to establish diverse, equitable and inclusive (DEI) work environments for some time now, but the events of 2020 put a spotlight on just how bad most organizations are at building impactful DEI efforts.</p>
<p>After COVID-19 resulted in staggering unemployment trends across the U.S., the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/tracking-the-covid-19-economys-effects-on-food-housing-and">reported</a> in October that Black and Latinx workers have endured far slower employment recovery rates compared to white employees. In August 2021, the unemployment rate was 8.8% among Black workers and 6.4% for Latinx workers, compared to 4.5% for white workers.</p>
<p>The recovery rates are not isolated to ethnicity; women lost their jobs at a much higher rate than men during the past year. Oxfam International <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/women-globally-lost-800-billion-dollars-in-income-due-to-covid-19.html">reports</a> that the pandemic cost women around the world at least $800 billion in earnings. The numbers are devastating and point to the need for massive changes across the board in terms of providing more sustainable and inclusive working environments for underrepresented groups.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234350" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Successful DEI not only enables culturally diverse workforces &#8212; it&#8217;s imperative to business success. Last year, McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters">confirmed</a> the most diverse companies are now more likely than ever to outperform less diverse peers on profitability — proving DEI has a profound effect on corporate outcomes.</p>
<p>But progress is slow going. The reason? Businesses are prioritizing diversity without putting equitable and inclusive structures in place to support a diverse work culture. The reality is, before you can create a truly diverse workforce, you must commit to equitable and inclusive initiatives that support all employees. No matter how diverse your team is, your DEI efforts will fail if you don&#8217;t provide equitable programs and inclusive environments.</p>
<p>Companies need to rethink their approach and reprioritize their efforts to put equity and inclusion before diversity, building EID efforts rather than DEI.</p>
<h2>Why equity must come first</h2>
<p>As a Black woman who spent her career focused on the employee experience — recruiting candidates, building teams and now leading diversity efforts at a security technology company — I know firsthand what racism and discrimination looks and feels like in the workplace. Time and again, companies have brought me into their organization to increase diversity, without having basic policies and programs in place to support a diverse workforce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>No matter how much I did to find opportunities for people who looked like me, it was never enough without giving them the resources and environment they needed to succeed. Discrimination complaints were often dismissed, requests for support ignored. New employees who joined a company enthusiastic and excited about their future would quickly become disenchanted with their work environment. The missing common denominator in these failures wasn&#8217;t the lack of diversity but the lack of a focus on equity.</p>
<p>For both employee experience teams and diversity leads, it’s important to distinguish between equity and equality. To build equity into your DEI initiatives, you must realize that each person comes to their role with a different set of needs. While equality means giving everyone the same resources, equity means giving individual employees the resources and opportunities specific to their needs so that they can reach the same level of success as their colleagues.</p>
<p>If businesses want to reshape how they approach DEI, they must first ask: How do we create an equitable and inclusive foundation that will lead to building and retaining diverse talent?</p>
<h2>Closing the pay gap</h2>
<p>Conducting a pay analysis is the first step to embracing equity and making sure the same job opportunities and pay are accessible to all employees. Historically, equity in pay and opportunities has been unattainable for underrepresented groups, resulting in a major stumbling block for most DEI initiatives. Until recently, many companies didn&#8217;t even conduct pay analysis, let alone provide transparency for salary ranges and pay scales across the organization.</p>
<p>A comprehensive analysis should be conducted annually to track your organization’s progress, as well as locate your weaknesses. When implemented correctly, a pay analysis will reveal your organization&#8217;s pay equity across race, gender and age.</p>
<p>Truly equitable systems provide fair pay wages regardless of ethnicity or gender. This is an area where businesses still struggle. Two years ago, a survey conducted by <a href="https://www.payscale.com/data/racial-wage-gap-for-men">PayScale</a> found that Black men earned 87 cents for every dollar earned by a white man, and Latino men earned 91 cents. The gender pay gap is even wider, with women earning 84% of what men earned last year. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/25/gender-pay-gap-facts/">Pew Research</a>, “It would take an extra 42 days of work for women to earn what men did in 2020.”</p>
<p>The primary goal is to close the pay gap so that Black employees and people of color earn the same as their white counterparts, and women the same as men.</p>
<h2>It’s not a talent shortage; it’s a lack of vision</h2>
<p>The one constant pushback I hear about DEI is that businesses are striving to be more diverse but can’t find diverse talent. All too often, the claim is that there is a talent shortage, especially in the technology industry, where roles are defined by technical capabilities. But the talent shortage is a false premise, and what’s actually happening is a lack of vision on the hiring side.</p>
<p>Businesses are quick to focus their hiring efforts on the wrong criteria, putting too much emphasis on years of experience or specific skill sets. This approach works against recruiting diverse talent as many underrepresented groups are denied opportunities that would lead to longevity in a role or adequate training to acquire specific skills.</p>
<p>If a candidate has the right traits — like resilience, creativity and ambition — they’ll likely be quick to learn whatever technical capabilities are needed to do the job in a short period of time. Companies need to understand that a person’s unique experiences and innate strengths make them a worthwhile candidate and be intentional about their hiring practices so that they’re looking beyond years of experience.</p>
<p>Obviously, this may not work for all open roles, but if there is any runway for training and learning opportunities, teams can make serious progress on their diversity goals by expanding their ideas of the “perfect” candidate.</p>
<h2>Why ERGs are key</h2>
<p>Before you can begin to make impactful changes, you must have a clear understanding of your organization’s existing culture and the gaps that may exist. While pay analysis is an important step you can take, another key effort is building support systems for your people through employee resource groups (ERGs).</p>
<p>ERGs can take many shapes &#8212; groups for women, Black employees, Latinx employees and LGBTQ workers, to name a few &#8212; and offer a vast amount of support across the organization.</p>
<p>Successful ERGs serve as the backbone of your inclusion initiatives, creating camaraderie and offering employees safe, welcoming spaces where they can share their experiences. Not only do ERGs help better serve your organization’s underrepresented groups, they help leadership increase their awareness of other cultures and life experiences.</p>
<p>ERGs are essential if your goal is to create allyship and provide a platform for robust dialogue around personal and sensitive topics. They not only encourage inclusion, but can dramatically increase employee retention rates. Through effective ERGs, organizations become more clear on their employees’ needs and can act on initiatives that help boost employee morale, productivity and job satisfaction.</p>
<h2>Want to know how your employees feel about their work? Ask them</h2>
<p>Finding the gaps in your DEI efforts is a challenge regardless of your company’s size. As the saying goes, <em>you don’t know what you don’t know</em>. This is where employee surveys can make a huge difference, uncovering substantial data that can help build more effective DEI programs, as well as increase employee experience outcomes.</p>
<p>Sending out monthly, quarterly or even annual employee surveys opens the door to deep insights on employee satisfaction. It reveals gaps that may be unseen at certain levels of the organization, making it possible to address problematic issues and create new processes that better serve your DEI efforts.</p>
<p>Internal surveys are an invaluable tool, offering insightful data that can motivate employees. Tracking results, measuring progress and evaluating baselines is an integral component of any massive project but especially important when you’re aiming to shift work cultures and build lasting DEI structures.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this will work if you don’t have buy-in from leadership. Before you can implement comprehensive DEI solutions — or EID if you’re ready to wholeheartedly commit to positive change — your organization’s C-suite must be on board. To build truly equitable, inclusive and diverse organizations, business leaders must be able to articulate what these initiatives mean to them and how they want to see these initiatives show up in the organization.</p>
<p>Once you have leadership support, you can begin to activate sustainable DEI programs, starting with equitable pay and job opportunities. From there, you can start building safe, welcoming spaces where people are able to show up as they are. Inclusive work environments give employees the ability to bring their unique life experiences and diverse backgrounds into your organization, helping to expand your company’s outlook and ability to connect with wider audiences. After these efforts are firmly in place, you can then begin to develop a hiring strategy that not only attracts diverse employees but maintains high retention rates.</p>
<p>Creating successful EID programs is like building a home: You must first have a sturdy foundation and walls before you can add the decorations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If it seems like everyone is listening to the same podcasts, that’s probably not a coincidence. Audio-based entertainment and social media is more popular than ever right now, but the medium is still plagued by discovery issues. While hit podcasts soar in popularity, expand their media empires and secure major brand deals, it’s difficult for up-and-coming shows to find an audience.</p>
<p><a href="https://racket.com/">Racket</a> is interested in figuring that out. Out in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/racket-tell-it-like-it-is/id1577214628">the App Store now on iOS</a>, Racket provides a TikTok-esque endless vertical feed of audio snippets that are all 99 seconds or less. Anyone can easily edit audio in the app, pair a recording with relevant tags, add a cover image and publish it — a process that can take less than a minute.</p>
<p>The company is also announcing a $3 million round of pre-seed funding from investors including Greycroft, Foundation Capital and LightShed Ventures. Angel investors including YouTuber LaurDIY, Jason Calacanis and Steve Schlafman also contributed to the funding. Racket plans to put the funds to use to hire more engineers, fine-tune its design and expand its trust and safety resources.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235049" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Racket’s team has been together since 2019 after working previously on a software review company Capiche, which sold to SaaS-buying platform Vendr in April of this year. After that, the team stayed intact, started experimenting with audio and came up with Racket.</p>
<p>Racket CEO Austin Petersmith believes in the untapped potential of user-created audio. In a conversation with TechCrunch, Petersmith compared podcasting to other genres of content creation, arguing that if 100 million people make videos on TikTok and right now we’ve only got 1 million people podcasting then audio is nowhere near maturity.</p>
<p>The Racket team believes there are barriers to entry in audio that hold the medium back. &#8220;Having this really, really narrow set of people making this content is kind of strange,” Petersmith said. “It’s nearly impossible for new podcasts to break through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Racket aims to reduce that friction by shortening the format, making the editing process dead simple and building around discovery from the get go. By capping Racket’s audio snippets at 99 seconds, the app hopes to encourage more people to tell jokes and share their stories without worrying about crafting a lengthy, produced audio show.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We&#8217;ve tried to lower the stakes so people feel more okay with imperfections and not having fancy equipment,” Petersmith said, likening Racket’s format to a tweet-length podcast.</p>
<p>You can find and follow people you know, but Racket is mostly about stumbling onto stuff you didn’t know you were looking for. Users can search “Rackets” for relevant tags or just throw the dice and swipe through to see what turns up. &#8220;We believe we can increase the top of the funnel for people who have really interesting, insightful things to say … that otherwise might not have been shared,” Petersmith said.</p>
<p>Like any social platform, Racket’s success will live and die by the content people wind up making there. The app just went live, but during its testing period the team saw a small subcommunity of comedians taking interest in the format and inviting one another. Petersmith expects that other communities interested in the unique format will spread the word organically.</p>
<p>People often listen to podcasts while doing something rote like laundry or commuting, but depending on how you want to use it, Racket has a bit more of an active feel, again akin to TikTok, but for audio. You can actively swipe through to find stuff you’d like and hop into a comments section, but you can also just stick your phone in your pocket and let the feed play through whatever comes up. For now, that content will feel pretty random, but if podcasts are too long-winded for you that might be a good thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to provide a platform for people who aren’t just interested in staring at their screen all the time,” Petersmith said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fresh off of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/h1s-linkedin-for-the-healthcare-industry-raises-58-million/">$58 million</a> Series B round, and just one year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/y-combinator-graduate-h1-closes-on-12-9-million-for-its-professional-healthcare-database/">graduating</a> from Y combinator, H1, a “LinkedIn for the healthcare industry” has raised even more cash. On Tuesday, the company announced a $100 million Series C round.</p>
<p>The concept behind H1 is simple: It’s an increasingly rich database of medical expertise. The service hosts profiles for millions of physicians and can surface key figures in a given field by reviewing those profiles alongside scholarly publications or medical claims data. It can also provide insight into the patient groups each physician is likely to treat and an expert&#8217;s openness to participating in clinical trials.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Ariel Katz describes H1 in even simpler terms:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234163" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We’re providing a global platform for healthcare professional information, and everything you want to know about them. Everything you want to know about every doctor in the world,” he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The quest to compile “everything you want to know about every doctor in the world” has led H1 to attract an increasing amount of funding: about $71 million before this most recent round.</p>
<p>The $100 million series C round was led by new investor Altimeter Capital with participation from Goldman Sachs and Flex Capital. The round also includes participation from existing investors IVP, Menlo Ventures, Transformation Capital, Lux Capital and LeadEdge.</p>
<p>Katz chalks up the size of this round to growth in revenue over the past year — the company is reporting about a 250% increase in annual recurring revenue. The company has about 100 clients, says Katz, including top pharma companies like Novartis and AstraZeneca.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pauline Yang, a partner at Altimeter Capital, said that the company is also starting to unlock use cases for all that data, which is one reason Altimeter was attracted to H1.</p>
<p>“The company saw incredible traction and growth with its first use case of helping pharma and life sciences identify key opinion leaders,” she told TechCrunch. “The use cases are extensive. It is a massive opportunity &#8212; and I believe this is the right team with the vision and ambition to tackle it.”</p>
<p>What do pharma companies <i>do </i>with “everything you want to know about every doctor in the world?” This year, Katz says a H1’s value add for big pharma has been information on diversity in physician and patient populations that they’ve <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29099678/">lacked in the past.</a></p>
<p>In 2020, the FDA took another step forward toward encouraging more diverse clinical trials by releasing a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enhancing-diversity-clinical-trial-populations-eligibility-criteria-enrollment-practices-and-trial">non-binding guidance document</a> outlining ways to increase diversity in clinical trial participation.</p>
<p>“That made pharma companies go: What am I supposed to do?” Katz said. “They have no access to this information. So with our profiles of doctors all around the world, we let them know what patient population this person is seeing: You can understand if they’re actually going to recruit diverse patients to your clinical study.”</p>
<p>Becoming a hub for medical diversity data isn’t all that H1 has been up to. The nature of the data the company has collected has started to shift.</p>
<p>When Katz spoke to TechCrunch in 2020, the company <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29099678/">wasn’t especially interested</a> in user-generated data — rather they were focused on data that already existed. This year, however, the company has allowed physicians to start to “enhance” their own profiles.</p>
<p>About 10 million healthcare providers have profiles on H1, not all of them have actually <i>claimed </i>their profiles. In essence, their pages might come up in a search, but the people behind those pages haven’t contributed to the information on the page.</p>
<p>H1 doesn’t disclose data on how many of the 10 million healthcare practitioners have claimed their profiles, Katz said.</p>
<p>This year, though, physicians have been able to add to their own profiles. That might include indicating that they’re open for clinical trial work, for instance, or other details you might not otherwise find online. The shift, says Katz, is another way to address what he calls the “siloing” of medical information.</p>
<p>“You have information in your own head that’s not available publicly. And we believe for us to succeed you want the community to give us that information. It’s like Crunchbase,” he says.</p>
<p>And, in the long term, that user-generated data is one way the company might cement it&#8217;s place in the medical professional ecosystem.</p>
<p>“Life science companies are hungry for data,” said Yang. “The H1 platform combines data from public, proprietary and private sources — which enables H1 to uniquely unlock value.”</p>
<p>Over the course of this round, H1 has plans to sell to more pharma and life sciences companies by doubling down on go-to-market efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As funding pours into mental health tech, one thing remains relatively unchanged: complex insurance billing. Now, even that medieval process is starting to attract startup interest &#8212; from companies that </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/anomaly-announces-17m-in-funding-to-tackle-a-300b-healthcare-problem/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scan claims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for errors, to others looking to simplify filing itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.meetnirvana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nirvana Health</a> is one of the latter. It’s a software platform looking to smooth out the process of filing mental health insurance claims. The company announced a $7.5 million seed extension round on Tuesday &#8212; bringing the company’s total funding to about $12 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2020, Nirvana has built a personalized clearinghouse designed to file insurance claims for therapists, and chase payment. The company will also file claims on behalf of people receiving therapy, provided they have out-of-network insurance benefits with an insurer supported by Nirvana and a therapist who works with the company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the company works with major insurance providers like Cigna, Aetna, United and Anthem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232917" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this current round, co-founder and CEO Akshay Venkitasubramanian says the company plans to become more than a hub for insurance claims. Nirvana also sees itself as a decision-making partner for therapists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We go to therapists&#8217; office to basically help them streamline and centralize insurance operations,” Venkitasubramanian told TechCrunch. “We essentially play that role of being a financial partner to them. We help them think through questions like: What platforms are sending me more clients? How much is it? Is a membership fee for this website worth it?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seed extension round was led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired Capital. Existing investors Eniac Ventures, RTP Seed and Arc Ventures also participated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the healthcare industry as a whole</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">insurance complexity accounts for a large amount of wasteful medical spending in the U.S. &#8212; about</span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2752664" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $300 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is wasted on complex medical billing every year, per one estimate published in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">JAMA </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2019</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the mental health space, out-of-network coverage plays a large role in that complexity. Per a </span><a href="https://www.milliman.com/-/media/milliman/importedfiles/ektron/addictionandmentalhealthvsphysicalhealthwideningdisparitiesinnetworkuseandproviderreimbursement.ashx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commissioned by the nonprofit Mental Health Treatment and Research Institute, mental health visits are 5.4 times more likely to be out of network compared to primary care visits. But even if mental health coverage is in-network, mental health is generally a carve-out service, says Venkitasubramanian. Which means that even if a therapist does take one primary insurer, they might actually need to bill a different company.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For better or worse, Venkitasubramanian believes those problems have created a niche for this technology. In lieu of actually intuitive systems, technology can at least help people navigate the existing ones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s supposed to be technology&#8217;s job to look at an insurance card and tell you: hey, this is a mental health vendor for this insurance, and here&#8217;s how the claim should count,” he said. “So we wrote a lot of logic around it. We can automatically file claims and ensure that the claims get routed to the right place and get paid faster.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nirvana Health is also betting that things are likely going to get </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">complicated before they get better. The explosion in new forms of teletherapy leaves therapists, from Venkitasubramanian’s perspective, scrambling to decide which services make the most sense for them to join, and how to manage appointments and billing from each one of these new platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not one partner is talking about, hey, what does it mean for you as a therapist in this new world? What are your revenue goals? Let&#8217;s figure out whether this is the right opportunity for you to pursue or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we play that unique middle role of helping them understand this new landscape,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley Bank’s Q3 trends report suggests investment in mental health services will surpass $3 billion this year. And, as the report notes, funding is increasingly targeted toward enterprise-facing companies, including employers or payers and providers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nirvana has already started to work with some of these big telehealth players that provide therapy across state lines. The software can integrate with Headspace Health, the mental health coaching platform formed </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/headspace-and-ginger-are-merging-to-form-headspace-health/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">via an August merger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between Headspace and Ginger, for instance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Nirvana is positioning itself as a supply-side business, says Venkitasubramanian. But it&#8217;s not totally consumer-agnostic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, the company is launching a tool aimed at consumers as well. Therapists working with Nirvana have access to a <a href="https://calculator.meetnirvana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“calculator functionality,”</a> which allows them to compute the costs of each session, with insurance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nirvana is turning that tool into a consumer-facing service, allowing patients to compute the cost of each visit, and which therapists might be available to them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not an indicator of a consumer-facing product in the works. Rather, Venkitasubramanian sees it as a “PSA” that drills down on the company’s larger thesis: the insurance landscape is only slated to get more complicated, but tech can at least act as a canary in the coal mine. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been quite a week for data center industry consolidation in the U.S. Two companies, <a href="http://cyrusone.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CyrusOne</a> and <a href="http://coresite.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoreSite</a>, announced deals valued <a href="https://investor.cyrusone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cyrusone-be-acquired-kkr-and-global-infrastructure-partners-15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at $15 billion</a> and<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211115005478/en/American-Tower-to-Acquire-CoreSite" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $10 billion,</a> respectively. It is unusual to see two companies in the same industry announce such large acquisitions on the same day, but that&#8217;s what happened on Monday.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the bigger of the two deals. KKR, a well-known private equity firm, and Global Infrastructure Partners, a company that invests in infrastructure companies like data centers, both saw fit to pay CyrusOne a 25% premium on its closing stock price of $72.57 per share back on September 27 under the terms of the deal.</p>
<p>The deal has already been approved by the CyrusOne board and, pending approval of regulators, is expected to close sometime in the second quarter of next year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234917" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Synergy Research Group, which tracks cloud and data center data,<a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/as-two-of-the-top-four-us-data-center-operators-are-acquired-ma-pushes-towards-new-heights" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> reports</a> that this is the largest data center company deal to date, easily eclipsing <a href="https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/qts-realty-trust-to-be-acquired-by-blackstone-funds-in-10-billion-transaction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blackstone’s acquisition of QTS</a> for $10 billion earlier this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CoreSite matched the largest deal when it announced it was being purchased by American Tower, a real estate investment trust (REIT), for $10 billion. It boasts 25 data centers, 21 cloud on-ramps and over 32,000 interconnections in eight major U.S. markets, generating $655 million in annual revenue, according to the company.</p>
<p>These companies may not be household names, but Synergy reports that they are the third and fourth largest U.S. data center operations, measured by colocation (the number of firms using their services) and revenue. Both companies have a strong presence in the U.S. market. John Dinsdale, principal analyst at Synergy, says continued growth at these operations is driving the need for increased investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The level of data center investment required is too much for even the biggest data center operators, causing an influx of new money from external investors,&#8221; Dinsdale said in a statement. &#8220;In quick succession, ownership of four of the top six U.S. data center operators has changed hands, while the two biggest names in the industry – Equinix and Digital Realty – are increasingly turning to joint ventures to help fund their growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interestingly, investors do not seem enthralled by these deals in spite of the seemingly gaudy price tags, with both stocks down today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aerospace prime Northrop Grumman is leading a team that includes AVL, Intuitive Machines, Lunar Outpost and Michelin to design a vehicle to transport Artemis astronauts around the moon. The Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) will be key to exploration of the lunar south pole region, an area that no human has ever visited.</p>
<p>Northrop will lead systems integration and spacecraft design, and the rest of the team bring together a wide range of capabilities that point to the LTV design areas they’ll likely focus on: AVL develops and tests vehicle powertrains and advanced driver assistance and autonomous systems; Intuitive Machines has experience in payload delivery with its Nova-D spacecraft; Lunar Outpost is developing off-world unmanned rovers; and multinational French company Michelin has worked with NASA before on tires for previous lunar rovers.</p>
<p>The team will almost certainly submit the design as part of a forthcoming request for proposals from NASA, similar to the process the agency used to select the lunar lander under the Human Landing System contract. Although NASA has not yet released an RFP for the LTV, Northrop Grumman is anticipating it early next year, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234909" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But even though the contract solicitation doesn’t exist yet, the space agency has already started requesting information to inform the development of the vehicle. In documents related to the project, NASA provided some details as to what it might be looking for in a winning bid: a vehicle that can traverse up to 20 kilometers on the lunar surface without needing to recharge; that can potentially survive an extended lunar night; and that is capable of transporting a minimum of 800 kilograms.</p>
<p>NASA said it anticipates launching the vehicle around 2027, which suggests it would only be sent to the moon once the Artemis program is up and running. Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/crewed-artemis-moon-landing-pushed-back-to-2025-nasa-says/">NASA representatives confirmed</a> that the first crewed mission under the program &#8212; which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time in decades &#8212; would be pushed back to 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a nutshell, the company has created an AI-powered photo editing tool that can be accessed using APIs. This means that you can do extremely powerful batch photo editing that is kind of like a mash-up between Snapchat&#8217;s photo filters, Adobe Lightroom&#8217;s batch editing features, Photoshop&#8217;s flexibility and the collaborative powers of Figma and the like. And yet, the tool is able to do things that haven&#8217;t been seen in the photo editing space so far. <a href="https://facet.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facet</a> just raised $13 million from <a href="https://twosigmaventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Two Sigma Ventures</a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with participation from </span><a href="https://accel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.basisset.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basis Set Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://slow.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slow Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.southparkcommons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Park Commons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>To say that I&#8217;m more than averagely interested in photography is a bit of an understatement &#8212; I used to be a professional photographer, and have written 20-ish books about photography. So when Facet reached out to me to say they had something brand new in the photo editing space, I got pretty excited, followed by &#8220;extremely confused.&#8221; Even after talking to the company&#8217;s founders and investors for an hour, I still couldn&#8217;t wrap my head around exactly what the tool is, nor who it is for.</p>
<p>It all became a lot clearer when I got a chance to play with the tool for myself. I uploaded a gallery of dance photos I shot at a recent Lindy by the Lake dance event in Oakland, and let Facet do its thing. The web-based editor has a profoundly steep learning curve &#8212; a learning wall, if you will &#8212; but I was very quickly able to do some editing that would have been hard, if not impossible, in Photoshop.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232436" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>One filter I created was &#8220;Detect background, then blur and desaturate the background.&#8221; The foreground/background detection on the images wasn&#8217;t perfect, but for the photos where it worked, it was an extremely fast way to make the photos pop &#8212; without having to open and edit each individual image in a photo editing suite.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232471" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/preview-DSC03713-LBTL-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232471" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2232471" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/preview-DSC03713-LBTL-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/preview-DSC03713-LBTL-2.png 1378w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/preview-DSC03713-LBTL-2.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/preview-DSC03713-LBTL-2.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/preview-DSC03713-LBTL-2.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/preview-DSC03713-LBTL-2.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/preview-DSC03713-LBTL-2.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2232471" class="wp-caption-text">The image on the left had the background desaturated and blurred automatically by Facet. The original is on the right. The result isn&#8217;t perfect, but Facet was able to do this to 200 photos in a matter of minutes &#8212; an incredibly impressive feat of AI image editing.

<p>Facet is particularly aimed at commercial-grade image editing where you need to prepare and present huge quantities of photos, but &#8212; as with Photoshop &#8212; it can be used in dozens of different ways, limited only by the image-makers&#8217; creativity.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you edit an image and layer on those changes, we analyze every edit and we figure out how to transfer that across a much larger content library, building you your presets automatically. This is very powerful for maintaining brand consistency across a campaign for making sure that all your product, photographs, are consistent,&#8221; explains Joe Reisinger, CEO and co-founder at Facet. &#8220;One example is someone like Spotify. You&#8217;ll probably have seen the duotone effect they are so famous for when it comes to album covers. We can create that and give you a reusable image editing pipeline with an API endpoint, so you can process thousands of photos very quickly.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s selection and filtering tools are powerful and infinitely scalable. The company does have a consumer-grade platform that hobby photographers could use, but where the company really shines is when the tool is used by creative software developers to use the APIs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of trying to adapt old, print-centric software to the internet age, we’re building the tools creatives need from the ground up with a content-aware image editing platform,&#8221; Reisinger said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232456" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232456" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2232456" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png" alt="" width="1024" height="459" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png 1597w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png?resize=768,344 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png?resize=680,305 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png?resize=1536,689 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2232456" class="wp-caption-text">An example of the Facet interface. In this screen shot, I&#8217;ve asked the tool to desaturate and blur the backgrounds. When it works, it is incredible, and something I&#8217;ve wished Lightroom had been able to do for years. When it doesn&#8217;t work (see the middle two photos, where only the woman&#8217;s leg is in color, or where the tool failed to detect the dancer&#8217;s face as the foreground), it is a little disappointing. Having said that, it&#8217;s possible to download the images as layered Photoshop files, so it would be trivial to tidy that up &#8212; and the time saved in the batch editing process would be enormous.

<p>&#8220;One aspect I really like about Facet is that it enables asynchronous collaboration. You can define the style of a photo, and designers can use the same style on lots of different photos without having to manually edit each of the photos. You can encode the look and feel of a photo programmatically, and copy them across from one image to another,&#8221; said Dan Abelon, partner at Two Sigma Ventures, the lead investor in Facet&#8217;s round. &#8220;You start to get into the more community side &#8212; if you like someone&#8217;s style, you can apply it to your own images, which opens up a whole world of real-time collaboration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t just about making money. Facet is about to have a big impact on the creative community and the wider web. I can tell that they want to make a mark on the web as a whole, and that&#8217;s something we were really attracted to as well,&#8221; said Abelon.</p>
<p>The company will be using its recently expanded war chest to do the obvious next couple of steps after a Series A: expand the team, find more traction and build out a go-to-market strategy. You can <a href="https://facet.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up for a free trial at Facet to kick the tires,</a> and plans start at $24 per month for professional users, and $50 per month for high-end team users with API requirements.</p>
