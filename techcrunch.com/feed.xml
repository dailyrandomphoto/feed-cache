										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gembah’s mission statement is a deceptively simple one. The Austin-based company says it’s looking to “democratize product innovation by drastically lowering barriers to entry for creation of new products.” In that respect, at least, it’s not so dissimilar from various startup initiatives that have arrived over the past decade and change, from crowdfunding to additive manufacturing.</p>
<p>The company’s product is a platform/marketplace designed to guide users through the product-creation process, promising results in “as little as 90 days.” The forum connects smaller business connect to factories, supply chain experts, designers, engineers, etc. to help speed up the process. Just ask anyone who has attempted to launch a hardware startup &#8212; these things can be massive difficult to navigate.</p>
<p>To help accelerate its own vision, <a href="https://gembah.com/">Gembah</a> has raised an $11 million Series A, led by local firm ATX Venture Partners along with Silverton, Flexport, Brett Hurt, Jim Curry and Dan Graham.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2174867" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174867" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2174867" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gembah-Screenshot-Customer-Example-Trail-Buddy-2.0.png" alt="" width="1024" height="759" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gembah-Screenshot-Customer-Example-Trail-Buddy-2.0.png 1172w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gembah-Screenshot-Customer-Example-Trail-Buddy-2.0.png?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gembah-Screenshot-Customer-Example-Trail-Buddy-2.0.png?resize=300,222 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gembah-Screenshot-Customer-Example-Trail-Buddy-2.0.png?resize=768,569 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gembah-Screenshot-Customer-Example-Trail-Buddy-2.0.png?resize=680,504 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gembah-Screenshot-Customer-Example-Trail-Buddy-2.0.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174867" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gembah</p></div></p>
<p>It follows a <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/exclusive-gembah-secures-3-28m-seed-funding-round-for-product-development-platform/">$3.28 million seed</a> led by Silverton announced in April of last year, bringing its total funding up to $14.75 million.</p>
<p>The company says the pandemic has actually been something of a boon for its business model, as hardware startups are looking toward a more online model – and something a bit closer to home than the traditional sales channels. The company says its revenue grew 500% in 2020 and is on track to triple revenues this year. It&#8217;s impressive growth in the face of some major supply chain issues that have impacted the industry during the past year and a half.</p>
<p>It currently has 300 active customers, though it was yet to achieve profitability &#8212; hence the new round. “Since most of our customers are e-commerce companies we benefited from the accelerated growth of e-commerce,” CEO and co-founder Henrik Johansson tells TechCrunch. “Supply chains have been impacted to some degree, but as the global supply chain gets more complex and many companies want to diversify outside of China, they need help to navigate that change, and Gembah can help with that transition.”</p>
<p>The funding will go toward increasing the company’s engineering team. At present, Gembah has 55 employees in the U.S, and 19 in other locations, including Asia and Mexico. The new headcount will be focused on growing the marketplace, supply chain workflow and machine-learning capabilities. Gembah will also look to grow its global network and make additional hires in marketing and UI/UX.</p>
<p>“Gembah is a true innovator poised to help businesses capitalize on the growth of global eCommerce,” ATX Venture Partners&#8217; Chris Shonksaid in a statement. “The Gembah marketplace promises to unlock virtually unlimited entrepreneurial equity by enabling a whole new breed of creators to enter the market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gurgaon-based mobile wallet service firm MobiKwik plans to raise up to $255 million in an initial public offering, becoming the latest Indian startup to explore the public markets.</p>
<p>The 12-year-old firm, which counts Sequoia Capital India and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority among its investors and has raised about $250 million to date, plans to offer new shares of up to $201 million and sell up to $54 million worth of equity shares, according to papers submitted to the market regulator on Monday.</p>
<p>The firm, which allows users to pay digitally and also cross-sells small sachet of insurance and loans as well as provides them with American Express-powered credit cards, is targeting a valuation of about $1 billion in the IPO, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>MobiKwik, which has amassed over 101 million registered users and 3.44 million online, offline and billing merchant partners, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">said its total income for the financial year that ended in March 2021 was about $40.5 million, down 18%, while its loss also shrank 12% to $14.9 million during the period.</span></p>
<p>MobiKwik’s move comes as a handful of Indian startups including Zomato and Paytm are working to list on stock exchanges. Zomato, a food delivery startup in India, last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/zomato-ipo/">boosted its plan to raise $1.3 billion</a> in its initial public offering, which opens on July 14 and closes July 16.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>It was a busy weekend for everyone, regardless of whether you were watching the technology, what Branson was up to, or the footie. I won&#8217;t take sides on the match, but I will say that it was gripping unto the very end and a great example of sport. Now, the news:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft is said to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-11/microsoft-is-said-to-be-buying-cybersecurity-company-riskiq">hunting up the purchase of RiskIQ</a>, a cybersecurity firm. The deal is reported to be worth around $500 million.</li>
<li>And this weekend, Twitter began to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/10/twitter-appoints-resident-grievance-officer-in-india-to-comply-with-new-internet-rules/">conform with new regulations in India</a>, moves that come after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/twitter-has-lost-liability-protection-in-india-government-says/">lost some legal protections</a> during a scrap with the Indian government.</li>
<li>China&#8217;s tech market has been busy: News is out <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bytedance-shelvedipo-intentions-after-chinese-regulators-warned-about-data-security-11626078000?mod=djemalertNEWS">concerning ByteDance&#8217;s IPO delay</a>, Tencent is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-china-order-tencent-music-give-up-music-label-exclusivity-sources-2021-07-12/">being forced to drop some music label exclusivity</a>, and the Chinese government recently <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chinese-streaming-firm-douyu-terminates-%245.3-bln-merger-with-huya-2021-07-12">blocked a merger of streaming giants in the country</a>.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s big news out from Flipkart this morning, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/flipkart-valued-at-37-6-billion-in-new-3-6-billion-fundraise/">thanks to its recent and huge new funding round worth $3.6 billion</a>.</li>
<li>And returning to the cybersecurity theme from earlier, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/funding-pours-into-cybersecurity-as-first-half-numbers-eclipse-last-years-total/">startups in the sector are having a lovely time raising capital in recent months</a>, it turns out.</li>
</ul>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget that earnings season is just around the corner. It&#8217;s a pretty important cycle. Why? Because startup valuations are hot, and could take a hit if earnings come up short. And the IPO market is pretty freaking active; poor earnings from major tech companies could crimp exit-prices for mature startups.</p>
<p>Ok! Talk to you on Wednesday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pretty soon, people won’t have to provide a fingerprint or a driver’s license to prove their identity — if <a href="https://www.vusecurity.com/en">VU</a> has its way.</p>
<p>The Argentina-based fraud and identity protection company announced $12 million in Series B funding Monday from backers including software developer, Globant, as well as Agrega Partners, NXTP Ventures, Bridge One, the IDB Lab and Telefónica. The new funding gives the company total venture-backed investments of $20 million, CEO Sebastián Stranieri told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Stranieri, who has worked in the cybersecurity industry for the past 20 years, got the idea for VU in 2007 after spending hours helping his grandmother verify her identity with the Argentinian government in what turned out to be a two-minute process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It pushed me to create a company to help create digital experiences without the friction,” he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>VU’s technology takes a person’s “online persona” and uses geolocation, biometrics and user behavior analysis to provide identity verification for users and enable a continuous authentication process that sees and connects the users’ online and offline personas. Simply put, it works mainly with government entities in countries like Argentina and Ecuador, providing them a way to confirm if people are who they say they are.</p>
<p>VU is one of several startups applying technology to fraud and identity within a global digital identity market expected to reach over $33 billion by 2025, according to Adroit Market Research. Companies recently capturing investment dollars for similar technology include Sift, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/fraud-prevention-platform-sift-raises-50m-at-over-1b-valuation-eyes-acquisitions/">raised $50 million</a> in April for a valuation of over $1 billion, and <a href="https://www.socure.com/">Socure</a>, which announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/socure-raises-100m-at-1-3b-valuation-proving-identity-verification-is-hotter-than-ever/">$100 million in Series D funding</a> at a $1.3 billion valuation.</p>
<p>In the past three years, VU has grown to more than 150 employees and is operating across Latin America and Europe, catering to big name customers  like Santander, Prisma, and governments in Latin America. The company also opened its first office in New York, where Stranieri expects to grow headcount five-times in the next year.</p>
<p>The company is averaging 85 percent year over year of revenue growth, and he expects that to continue in 2021 with 100 percent growth forecasted for 2022. In addition to New York, VU opened an office in Madrid and will open offices in Italy and France, and in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>As such, he intends to use the new funding to hire developers across Europe and in the U.S.</p>
<p>Globant’s investment into VU also serves as a partnership. Globant provides software development to the likes of Google, Disney and Apple. Together, they will package VU’s digital experience so that companies can purchase the basic software and then customize it. Currently, VU’s technology is suited for banks and to provide a one-click e-commerce checkout where a retailer’s system will recognize and confirm the buyer.</p>
<p>“Globant is changing the digital experience, so having their backing is a great message to our customers and partners that we are performing well,” Stranieri said. “Their backup and those of all of our investors provides an opportunity to take a risk and help us grow faster.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m back from my road trip and swimming in emails. If you sent me a message on Twitter, email or pigeon post, please give me a few days to dig out of the pile that awaits me.</p>
<p>You might recall that I mentioned I was off to do some backpacking and climbing in Grand Teton National Park and then eventually would make it to Yellowstone National Park. Yes, the crowds were real, especially for those who stuck to the traditional schedule of sightseeing between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. I took the early morning and late evening approach and never encountered the infamous parking lot traffic jams.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s that tactic that allowed me to take a ride in an empty T.E.D.D.Y., the autonomous vehicle that is being piloted in Yellowstone this summer. Beep, in partnership with Local Motors, is operating the autonomous shuttle called T.E.D.D.Y., which stands for The Electric Driverless Demonstration in Yellowstone. The company plans to operate two routes, seven days a week. Information collected during the pilot will be used to inform future deployments in national parks across the country.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I discovered. The two shuttles, which always have a human operator who can take manual control if needed, are currently shuttling folks around the busy Canyons section of the park, specifically between the lodging area and main shopping area, where there is a general store, post office and eateries. The folks operating the shuttle told me about 1,240 people a week are riding the TEDDY vehicles and that riders were both curious and more knowledgeable about the tech than they expected.</p>
<p>My ride was on eventful, as it should have been. The vehicle did pause unnecessarily because the self-driving system thought it needed to. The human safety operator warned me that this pause would likely occur, as it had been happening regularly over the past few days.</p>
<p>One final item. <a href="https://twitter.com/theautonocast?lang=en">The Autonocast</a>, the podcast I co-host with Alex Roy and Ed Niedermeyer, is teaming up with SAE for a zoom call to have a wide-ranging discussion on the future of transportation and how the discourse about autonomous vehicle technology that occurs online — yes, Twitter I&#8217;m looking at you — impacts public perception. Specifically, we&#8217;re going to dig into a term coined by <a href="https://twitter.com/lizadixon?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Liza Dixon</a> called &#8220;autonowashing.</p>

<p>With many people blissfully still on holiday after the fourth of July weekend, it was a slow week in the micromobilty universe. One thing that did catch my eye though was an announcement from Stockholm-based e-scooter operator <strong>Voi</strong> that it launched the &#8220;world&#8217;s first large scale pilot of computer vision on e-scooters&#8221; using Irish computer vision startup Luna&#8217;s technology.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not quite sure what Voi means by &#8220;at scale&#8221; since the press release had no mention of how many of these scooters the company would be bringing to its pilot beginning this month in Northampton, U.K. However, the release did make reference to Luna&#8217;s AI models getting more accurate by using data captured from 100 cameras on e-scooters in the English city, so that&#8217;s at least 100 scooters. The problem is, Voi is by no means the first. Spin beat them to the punch.</p>
<p>Last month, Ford-owned <strong>Spin</strong> launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy/">Spin Insight Level 2</a> &#8212; its bundle of sensors, cameras and on-board computing power to detect sidewalk- and bike-lane riding and validate parking from its partner Drover AI &#8212; with 100 e-scooters in Milwaukee. Spin also has some computer vision-enabled scooters in Santa Monica, where it just launched, and will be bringing them to Seattle and Miami in the coming months.</p>
<h3>BMW is finally producing its electric scooter</h3>
<p><strong>BMW&#8217;s</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/bmw-is-finally-producing-its-retro-futuristic-ce-04-electric-scooter-but-at-12k-will-anyone-buy-it/">new electric scooter</a> is very cool-looking, with a retro-futuristic vibe and a low to the ground ride. But it ain&#8217;t cheap. At $12,000, is anyone gonna buy this thing? I guess we&#8217;ll find out. The first scooter actually produced from the Motorrad Concept Link series will be part of BMW&#8217;s 2022 lineup.</p>
<h3>More electric scooter news &#8230;</h3>
<p>Indian ride hailing company <strong>Ola</strong> has announced its giant e-scooter facility is ready and will soon begin production, with an expected launch this month. Late last year, the company invested $327 million to set it up, so we&#8217;ll potentially see the fruits of that investment. Apparently, Ola Electric has 3,000 robots building a scooter every two minutes, and the factory has 10 production lines, bringing total production capacity to about 10 million e-scooters.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.acutemarketreports.com/report/electric-kick-scooters-market">new report</a> by <strong>Acute Market Reports</strong>, electric kick scooters are expected to reach a market volume of 1.4 million units by 2028. The analysis found kick scooters are getting more popular as more people try to avoid public transportation, and that there&#8217;s a growing demand for longer range scooters for heavy usage. The report identified some of the key manufacturers of electric kick scooters to be Razor USA LLC, GOTRAX, Xiaomi, Segway, Inc., ZERO Electric Scooters, MINIMOTORS Co., Ltd., Kaabo Electric Scooter, Titan Group, Glion, and SWAGTRON.</p>
<p><strong>Helbiz</strong>, micromobility operator that recently went SPAC by merging with GreenVision Acquisition Corp, has <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helbiz-partners-irengo-telepass-launch-120000016.html">announced a partnership</a> with IrenGo and Telepass to deploy 50 MiMoto electric mopeds throughout the Italian cities of Portofino, Santa Margherita Ligure, Rapallo, Paraggi and Punta Pedale. Hellbiz is the first and only operator in this region.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s a newsletter without a hint of Lime</h3>
<p><strong>Lime&#8217;s</strong> e-bikes are officially in <a href="https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/cleveland/lime-e-bikes-now-available-downtown-cleveland/95-5ada4947-9822-4f42-94dc-1c7d516d7f17">downtown Cleveland</a> after the city issued permits allowing the bikes this year. The company started with 50 but will add more soon. Lime&#8217;s bikes will also be accompanied by more from Spin and Bird.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>The deal I&#8217;ve been waiting for is finally done. <strong>Rimac Automobili</strong>, the Porsche-backed Croatian company that makes electric hypercars and components for automakers, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/vw-offloads-bugatti-to-rimac-to-form-new-ev-company-bugatti-rimac/">taking over <strong>Bugatti</strong></a>. Rimac will own a controlling 55% share in the new company, Bugatti-Rimac, with VW&#8217;s Porsche owning the remaining 45%.</p>
<p>A few nuts and bolts on the deal: Rimac is going to separate the development, production and supply of battery systems, drivetrains and other EV components into a new entity owned by Rimac Group called Rimac Technology, which will work independently with other global car manufacturers.</p>
<p>Founder Mate Rimac will continue to hold his 37% share in Rimac Group, with Hyundai Motor Group holding the same 12% and other investors at 27%. Porsche recently upped its stake in Rimac from 15% to 24%, but its total ownership doesn&#8217;t give It a controlling interest in the new EV company. Mate Rimac will lead Bugatti-Rimac, which will be headquartered in Zagreb, Croatia. Bugatti&#8217;s manufacturing will remain in Molsheim, France.</p>
<p>Mate Rimac was on our virtual stage in June and talked about the company&#8217;s future plans, including confirming that they were in talks with Bugatti.

<p><strong>Other deals that caught my eye as I emerge from vacation mode &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kurly</strong>, a South Korea startup that provides next-day grocery delivery services across the country, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/kurly-the-korean-grocery-startup-raises-200m-on-a-2-2b-valuation-after-shifting-ipo-plans-away-from-the-nyse/">raised $200 million</a> in funding in a Series F valuing the company at $2.2 billion. The company&#8217;s valuation has more than doubled in the last year. Last April, Kurly closed a Series E of $150 million at a $780 million valuation.</p>

The round was led by Xplorer Capital Management, and includes Playground Global, the company&#8217;s founding investor. Participating investors include JetBlue Technology Ventures and Lauder Partners. Along with the funding news Lacuna is announcing the addition of Keith Nilsson, MP and co-founder of Xplorer, to the company&#8217;s board.</p>
<p><strong>MaxAB</strong>, an Egyptian startup based out of Cairo that serves a network of traditional food and grocery retailers across Egypt, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/maxab-the-egyptian-b2b-food-and-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-40m-for-expansion/">raised $40 million</a> in Series A financing.</p>
<p><strong>Ola</strong>, the Indian ride-hailing giant, is flush with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/temasek-and-warburg-pincus-invest-500-million-in-ola/">$500 million in new capital</a> thanks to investments from Temasek and an affiliate of Warburg Pincus .Ola co-founder and chief executive Bhavish Aggarwal is also participating in the new investment, the startup said. Ola said in a statement that the investment comes &#8220;ahead of IPO&#8221; &#8212; but didn&#8217;t elaborate.</p>
<p><strong>Stellantis</strong>, the global automaker born out of a merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and French automaker Groupe PSA, will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/auto-giant-stellantis-to-invest-e30b-in-electrification-through-2025/">invest €30 billion</a> ($35.5 billion) in electric vehicles and new software over the next four years as part of a major push to transition away from internal combustion engines. Stellantis shared a few of its plans, including manufacturing an electric Dodge muscle car and an electric Ram pickup truck by 2024.

<p><strong>Volvo Group</strong>, <strong>Daimler Truck</strong> and Volkswagen&#8217;s AG heavy-truck business the <strong>Traton Group </strong>plan to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/volvo-daimler-traton-invest-593-million-to-build-electric-truck-charging-network/"> invest €500 million</a> (~$593 million USD) to install and operate 1,700 charging points in strategic locations and close to highways for electric heavy-duty long-haul trucks and buses around Europe. The automakers intend to finalize the agreement by the end of this year and start operations next year, with the hopes of increasing the number of charge points significantly as the companies seek additional partners for the future joint venture.</p>
<p><strong>Zomato</strong>, a food delivery startup in India that competes with Swiggy, has boosted its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/zomato-ipo/">plan to raise $1.3 billion</a> in its initial public offering, which opens on July 14 and closes July 16. Zomato said it will price its shares in the range of 72 Indian rupees (96 cents) to 76 ($1) and is targeting an upper limit valuation of $8.56 billion. It plans to list on Indian stock exchanges.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Policy Corner! The big news this week comes from across the Atlantic, where European lawmakers are planning to introduce a ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035.</p>
<p>Yep &#8212; less than 15 years from now. The ban would be phased in; countries would first be required to drop emissions from new vehicles by 65% by 2030, according to a document from the European Commission that was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-09/europe-to-propose-end-of-combustion-engine-era-in-green-overhaul">viewed by Bloomberg</a>. The ruling would accompany a larger set of procedures for lowering greenhouse gas emissions across sectors, with the overall aim of reaching net-zero emissions on the continent by 2050.</p>
<p>News of a 2035 ban has been floating around for a while, but it seems that we&#8217;re now approaching the introduction of the proposal on July 14. Nor will it likely shock automakers, many of whom have been announcing their own ambitious zero-emissions targets. Fiat and Volvo have both set their own ICE phase outs in the continent by the end of the decade, for example. Volvo, along with Uber, also <a href="https://icephaseout.org/">signed a letter in support</a> of the ban in April.</p>
<p>If the ban is included in the final proposal, it would still need to be approved by European Commissioners before going into effect. We&#8217;ll be keeping our eyes out for that final proposal &#8212; I&#8217;m especially interested to see if it will include any mandates for installing EV chargers or other rulings to help spur the transition toward electric mobility. While many EU countries have already set electrification targets separate from the proposed mandate, auto-making remains a cornerstone of the economy in countries like France and Germany. Whatever ends up happening, it&#8217;ll likely be expensive.</p>

<p>A short week + vacation means this won&#8217;t be as long as usual. (At least for me.) Let&#8217;s dig in.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Yandex Self-Driving Group</strong>, a unit of the publicly-traded Russian tech giant, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/yandex-self-driving-group-partners-with-grubhub-to-bring-robotic-delivery-to-college-campuses/">partnering with food delivery service GrubHub</a> to be its multi-year robotic delivery provider across American college campuses. Yandex hopes to reach over 250 campuses over the course of this partnership, beginning with dozens of robots in the fall, according to Yandex Self-Driving CEO Dmitry Polishchuk.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Bentley Motors</strong> revealed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/bentley-reveals-flying-spur-hybrid-its-latest-in-the-push-towards-electric/">newest hybrid model</a> that is<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> part of the company&#8217;s Beyond100 plan to become a carbon-neutral organization with an entirely electrified range by 2023 and a totally electric lineup by 2030. As Rebecca Bellan noted, that&#8217;s a tall order given the fact that the British company&#8217;s first all-electric vehicle isn&#8217;t expected to come to market until 2025. So far, Bentley only has this hybrid and another, the Bentayga SUV.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> has started the long-promised updates for its &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; Beta v9 software. This is not full self-driving, which is why this item is housed under &#8220;electric vehicles.&#8221; Instead, this is an advanced driver assist system. But it&#8217;s important because this is the first &#8220;feature complete&#8221; version of the so-called FSD. This version also only relies on cameras and doesn&#8217;t include radar, a sensor that was previously used by Tesla&#8217;s advanced driver assistance system.</p>
<p>There are already a bunch of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NW6mICjUvM&amp;t=1128s">videos</a> popping up on the beta V9 FSD. And while many folks are excited to have early access, what struck me was the numerous disengagements I viewed during these videoed drives. Check out this one on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrHCz4wnW8g">unprotected left hand turns</a>.</p>
<h3>Other stuff</h3>
<p>The <strong>European Union </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/eu-fines-bmw-vw-1b-for-running-emissions-cartel-since-the-90s/">issued fines of $1 billion</a> (€875 million) to<strong> Volkswagen</strong> and <strong>BMW</strong>  for their involvement in an emissions cartel. According to the EU, Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, BMW and Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler have been illegally colluding to restrict competition in emission cleaning for new diesel passenger cars, essentially slowing the deployment of cleaner emissions tech.</p>
<p><strong>Halo</strong>, the Las Vegas-based startup, is launching a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/halo-will-launch-a-remotely-operated-car-service-powered-by-5g-in-las-vegas/">remotely operated electric car service</a> powered by 5G. This is starting as a pilot with just five vehicles. Halo users can order a vehicles via an app. Once a vehicle is ordered, a remote operator will drive it to the waiting customer. The user takes delivery and then manually operates the vehicle until they&#8217;re done. When the trip is complete, the remote operator takes back over and drives it to the next waiting customer. The pilot is being conducted in partnership with T-Mobile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has been accused of multiple breaches of European Union consumer protection law as a result of its attempts to force WhatsApp users to accept controversial changes to the messaging platforms&#8217; terms of use &#8212; such as threatening users that the app would stop working if they did not accept the updated policies by May 15.</p>
<p>The consumer protection association umbrella group, the Beuc, <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/publications/consumer-groups-file-complaint-against-whatsapp-unfairly-pressuring-users-accept-its/html">said today</a> that together with eight of its member organizations it&#8217;s filed a complaint with the European Commission and with the European network of consumer authorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The complaint is first due to the persistent, recurrent and intrusive notifications pushing users to accept WhatsApp’s policy updates,&#8221; it wrote in a press release.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The content of these notifications, their nature, timing and recurrence put an undue pressure on users and impair their freedom of choice. As such, they are a breach of the EU Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>After earlier telling users that notifications about the need to accept the new policy would become persistent, interfering with their ability to use the service, WhatsApp later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/whatsapp-is-doing-fine-despite-months-long-backlash-over-policy-update/">rowed back from its own draconian deadline</a>.</p>
<p>However the app continues to bug users to accept the update &#8212; with no option not to do so (users can close the policy prompt but are unable to decline the new terms or stop the app continuing to pop-up a screen asking them to accept the update).</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, the complaint highlights the opacity of the new terms and the fact that WhatsApp has failed to explain in plain and intelligible language the nature of the changes,&#8221; the Beuc went on. &#8220;It is basically impossible for consumers to get a clear understanding of what consequences WhatsApp’s changes entail for their privacy, particularly in relation to the transfer of their personal data to Facebook and other third parties. This ambiguity amounts to a breach of EU consumer law which obliges companies to use clear and transparent contract terms and commercial communications.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organization pointed out that WhatsApp&#8217;s policy updates remain under scrutiny by privacy regulations in Europe &#8212; which it argues is another factor that makes Facebook&#8217;s aggressive attempts to push the policy on users highly inappropriate.</p>
<p>And while this consumer-law focused complaint is separate to the privacy issues the Beuc also flags &#8212; which are being investigated by EU data protection authorities (DPAs) &#8212; it has called on those regulators to speed up their investigations, adding: &#8220;We urge the European network of consumer authorities and the network of data protection authorities to work in close cooperation on these issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Beuc has produced a <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/publications/beuc-x-2021-063_report_-_whats_up_with_whatsapp.pdf">report</a> setting out its concerns about the WhatsApp ToS change in more detail &#8212; where it hits out at the &#8220;opacity&#8221; of the new policies, further asserting:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;WhatsApp remains very vague about the sections it has removed and the ones it has added. It is up to users to seek out this information by themselves. Ultimately, it is almost impossible for users to clearly understand what is new and what has been amended. The opacity of the new policies is in breach of Article 5 of the UCTD [Unfair Contract Terms Directive] and is also a misleading and unfair practice prohibited under Article 5 and 6 of the UCPD [Unfair Commercial Practices Directive].&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Reached for comment on the consumer complaint, a WhatsApp spokesperson told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Beuc’s action is based on a misunderstanding of the purpose and effect of the update to our terms of service. Our recent update explains the options people have to message a business on WhatsApp and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data. The update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook, and does not impact the privacy of your messages with friends or family, wherever they are in the world. We would welcome an opportunity to explain the update to Beuc and to clarify what it means for people.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Commission was also contacted for comment on the Beuc&#8217;s complaint &#8212; we&#8217;ll update this report if we get a response.</p>
<p>The complaint is just the latest pushback in Europe over the controversial terms change by Facebook-owned WhatsApp &#8212; which triggered a privacy warning from Italy back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/confusion-over-whatsapps-new-tcs-triggers-privacy-warning-from-italy/">January</a>, followed by an urgency procedure in Germany in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/facebook-ordered-not-to-apply-controversial-whatsapp-tcs-in-germany/">May</a> when Hamburg&#8217;s DPA banned the company from processing additional WhatsApp user data.</p>
<p>Although, earlier this year, Facebook&#8217;s lead data regulator in the EU, Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission, appeared to accept Facebook&#8217;s reassurances that the ToS changes do not affect users in the region.</p>
<p>German DPAs were less happy, though. And Hamburg invoked emergency powers allowed for in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in a bid to circumvent a mechanism in the regulation that (otherwise) funnels cross-border complaints and concerns via a lead regulator &#8212; typically where a data controller has their regional base (in Facebook/WhatsApp&#8217;s case that&#8217;s Ireland).</p>
<p>Such emergency procedures are time-limited to three months. But the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) <a href="https://twitter.com/EU_EDPB/status/1414533127511420928">confirmed today</a> that its plenary meeting will discuss the Hamburg DPA&#8217;s request for it to make an urgent binding decision &#8212; which could see the Hamburg DPA&#8217;s intervention set on a more lasting footing, depending upon what the EDPB decides.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, calls for Europe&#8217;s regulators to work together to better tackle the challenges posed by platform power are growing, with a number of regional competition authorities and privacy regulators actively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power/">taking steps to dial up their joint working</a> &#8212; in a bid to ensure that expertise across distinct areas of law doesn&#8217;t stay siloed and, thereby, risk disjointed enforcement, with conflicting and contradictory outcomes for Internet users.</p>
<p>There seems to be a growing understanding on both sides of the Atlantic for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/biden-executive-order-tech-antitrust/">joined up approach to regulating platform power</a> and ensuring powerful platforms don&#8217;t simply get let off the hook.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 18, Babajide Duroshola, ex-Country Head, SafeBoda Nigeria, <a href="https://babajiide.medium.com/and-its-curtains-call-755735f71ca3">stepped down</a> from his role two years after taking the job post-Andela</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than a month later, the executive has found a new role as General Manager in Kenyan company, M-KOPA</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">His appointment coincides with M-KOPA&#8217;s broader expansion strategy, which includes a move to Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019 when SafeBoda hired Duroshola, the Ugandan ride-hailing company was in the news for its imminent expansion to Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To the company and most of the public, Lagos was the obvious option. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Duroshola and his on the ground team chose to stay away from one of Africa&#8217;s most viable tech ecosystems and launch in neighbouring city Ibadan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was considered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a huge risk, the gamble looks to have paid off. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While major ride-hailing platforms in Lagos like ORide, MAX.ng, and Gokada completely halted their operations in the state after a ride-hailing ban, SafeBoda thrived in Ibadan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time Duroshola left the company, it had onboarded 5,000 drivers and completed more than 1.5 million rides in a full year of operation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The motorcycle ride-hailing wars in Nigeria and Uganda are SafeBoda&#8217;s to lose&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/the-motorcycle-ride-hailing-wars-in-nigeria-and-uganda-is-safebodas-to-lose/embed/#?secret=cmn1mpyWzn" data-secret="cmn1mpyWzn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SafeBoda runs an asset-financing model when offering smartphones to its riders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. M-KOPA has used t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his concept since its inception and it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> played a major role in Duroshola&#8217;s decision to join the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Part of the things that excite me asides from ride-hailing is the credit space. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like asking questions on how to extend credits to people and help them build their digital footprints</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That was why M-KOPA seemed attractive,&#8221; Duroshola said to TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">M-KOPA launched in Kenya ten years ago. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have kickstarted the wider pay-as-you-go (PAYG) solar market in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, M-KOPA has expanded its offerings to include televisions, fridges, other electronic appliances, and financial services to customers in Kenya and Uganda</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through its pay-as-you-go financing model, customers can build ownership over time by paying an initial deposit followed by flexible and affordable micro-payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, M-KOPA has sold over 1 million PAYG solar systems and provided $400 million in financing to millions of customers while raising over $180 million in equity and debt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the company added <a href="https://technext.ng/2020/01/29/m-kopa-partners-safaricom-samsung-to-roll-out-a-pay-as-you-go-mobile-phone-plan-in-kenya/">smartphone financing to its offerings</a> in Kenya by partnering with Safaricom and Samsung</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per a <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/sub-saharan-africa/">GSMA report</a>, mobile technologies and services generated 9% of sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s GDP in 2019, representing about $155 billion in economic value</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when you think about it, smartphones </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in people&#8217;s everyday lives more than solar systems, so it isn&#8217;t surprising that M-KOPA has already sold 500,000 smartphones, half the units solar systems have managed in a ten-year period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early this year, M-KOPA ran a pilot test in the Nigerian market by providing customers with its solar systems and smartphone financing options</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Smartphone financing had a higher uptake as M-KOPA sold over 20,000 devices in Lagos, its first market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company considered this a success, and the appointment of Duroshola is seen as a prerequisite for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">scaling the offering rapidly in Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’ve been deliberate about finding the right person with a strong track record and in-depth knowledge of the Nigerian tech community to lead our team as we scale up our country operations. And the milestone coincided with Babajide’s appointment as we look to grow and expand into new regions,&#8221; Mayur Patel, M-KOPA&#8217;s CCO, said to TechCrunch in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">M-KOPA is now present in both Lagos and Oyo after expanding to the latter last month. Just as in Kenya, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">M-KOPA partnered with Samsung, but a different mobile network operator in Airtel, to make its smartphone financing accessible to Nigerian customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Patel, both Nokia and Samsung provide entry- and mid-tier handsets at different prices to their customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He argues that a top priority for MNOs on the continent is converting 2G/3G network users to 4G. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To him, M-KOPA has a shot at tackling the challenge of 4G device affordability in Nigeria because 75% of its total customers are first time 4G smartphone owners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our partnership with both these OEMs has allowed M-KOPA to offer affordable ownership of quality 4G smartphones for underbanked customers, who are otherwise excluded because they lack credit histories or salaried incomes,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>In Nigeria, M-KOPA deals with various products in the Samsung A series (A02, A12, A22, A32) ranging from $80-$250 (~₦40,000 to ₦125,000). <span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to include more devices and handset manufacturers, but the COO doesn&#8217;t say when</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Kenya and Uganda, however, M-KOPA sells Nokia phones in addition to the aforementioned Samsung products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although M-KOPA is focused on smartphone financing in the West African country, Duroshola wants to mirror what Kenyan M-KOPA&#8217;s customers enjoy (where other products asides from smartphones are sold) in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He reckons it will help build their credit history and worthiness over time.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kenyan company is currently recruiting for engineering roles in Nigeria and globally as part of its expansion plans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duroshola will lead the charge in Nigeria in what can be described as his</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> third stint of scaling African startups in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He seems to have a knack for it. Judging from our conversation, there&#8217;s an optimistic feel about the general manager in his ability to take on a market where PAYG models outside solar systems have had relatively low success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My vision as a person and what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> drives me on a normal day is to help African startups scale and being that person that would help build, set up, get to the point where they&#8217;re able to think about their business strategy and how they can plug into the Nigerian space. What I&#8217;m looking to build with M-KOPA is a full credit machine. I want it to become a household name within the Nigerian market space where when people are thinking about pay-as-you-go financing for everyday use cases, M-KOPA is what comes to their mind.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Flipkart said on Monday it has raised $3.6 billion at a post-money valuation of $37.6 billion in what is widely believed to be the pre-IPO round for the Indian e-commerce conglomerate as it works to list in the public markets as soon as early next year.</p>
<p>The new round of funding &#8212; by far the largest for any Indian startup &#8212; was led by GIC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Walmart, along with investments from sovereign funds DisruptAD, Qatar Investment Authority, Khazanah Nasional Berhad, Tencent, Willoughby Capital, Antara Capital, Franklin Templeton and Tiger Global.</p>
<p>The Monday investment marks the return of SoftBank as a shareholder of Flipkart. SoftBank, which had taken the exit from the startup when the Bangalore-based firm sold majority stakes to Walmart in 2018 at a valuation of $22 billion, has reinvested about $500 million in the new round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;At Flipkart, we are committed to transforming the consumer internet ecosystem in India and providing consumers access and value. This investment by leading global investors reflects the promise of digital commerce in India and their belief in Flipkart’s capabilities to maximise this potential for all stakeholders,&#8221; said Kalyan Krishnamurthy, Chief Executive Officer at Flipkart Group, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we serve our consumers, we will focus on accelerating growth for millions of small and medium Indian businesses, including kiranas. We will continue to invest in new categories and leverage made-in-India technology to transform consumer experiences and develop a world-class supply chain.”</p>
<p>Flipkart had originally hit the market to raise money early this year and was initially looking to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/flipkart-in-early-talks-to-raise-1-billion-ahead-of-ipo/">raise just about $1 billion</a>, TechCrunch first reported.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-headquartered firm competes neck to neck with Amazon in India. The American e-commerce group has invested over $6.5 billion in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Both the firms are struggling to aggressively expand their footprint in India, where physical stores continue to drive the vast majority of retail sales. Both the firms are also expected to be severely hit by India&#8217;s new e-commerce rules</p>

<p>E-commerce platform JioMart, a joint venture between Reliance Retail (India’s largest retail chain) and Google and Facebook-backed Jio Platforms (India’s largest telecom operator), launched last year in over 200 cities and towns across the nation.</p>
<p>At stake is one of the world’s fastest-growing e-commerce markets that is poised to grow even further as more first-time internet users begin to shop online. India’s e-commerce market is estimated to reach more than 300 million shoppers by 2025, according to estimates by Bain &amp; Company. These shoppers would have bought items worth more than $100 billion from online platforms, the firm projected.</p>
<p>In recent years, Flipkart and Amazon have made a number of bets to expand their reach in India. Both of them have rolled out support for Hindi language (Flipkart has added several additional Indian languages as well), and partnered with neighborhood stores.</p>
<p>“Flipkart is a great business whose growth and potential mirrors that of India as a whole — that’s why we invested in 2018 and why we continue to invest today,” said Judith McKenna, President and CEO of Walmart International, in a statement.</p>
<p>Flipkart says it has amassed over 350 million registered users across its services &#8212; including fashion e-commerce Myntra &#8212; in the country. &#8220;Flipkart’s logistics and supply chain arm, Ekart, employs more than 100,000 people and makes deliveries to more than 90% of the addressable pin-codes in India, which, coupled with strategic warehouse infrastructure investments, is one of the group’s core strengths. Venturing into the social commerce space, Flipkart recently announced the launch of Shopsy, which will encourage local entrepreneurship,&#8221; the firm said.</p>

<p>Based in Sydney and Auckland, <a href="https://dovetailstudios.com/">Dovetail</a> is a full-service venture studio that works closely with founders who have a great idea, but may lack technical backgrounds. Dovetail helps them build companies from the ground up, preparing them for growth and more funding. Founded in 2014, Dovetail’s success stories include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/afterpay/">Afterpay</a>, the Melbourne-headquartered unicorn that is one of the highest-profile players in the buy now, play later space, along with Klarna and Affirm.</p>
<p>“People can think of us as the technical co-founder, responsible for driving and executing product strategy, design and the development of scalable products,” Dovetail co-founder Nick Frandsen told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dovetail is currently raising a $10 million AUD (about $7.5 million USD) fund that will be used for seed, Series A and Series B rounds in 15 of the most promising companies that have gone through its venture studio program. As an investor, Dovetail has written check sizes ranging from $150,000 to $1 million AUD.</p>
<p>One of Dovetail’s goals is prepare startups to seek funding from other VCs; firms that have invested in Dovetail’s portfolio companies include Blackbird, Qantas and Wavemaker.</p>

<p>“By the time we need to make an investment decision, we would have worked collaboratively on a day-to-day basis with them for at least three months prior to a seed round and 12 months for a Series A. This means we’re essentially investing with the informational edge of a co-founder,” said Frandsen. “Another trait that makes Dovetail unique is that we share our ownership in our portfolio companies with the entire team. This further drives unity, dedication and a desire to succeed from our team.”</p>
<p>Dovetail began working with Afterpay in 2017, when the company had less than 40 employees. Frandsen said Afterpay’s founders, Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen, were looking for a digital product development partner to build and scale their mobile and web apps. While both had deep experience in financial services, they came from non-technical backgrounds. That’s where Dovetail came into play, building out Afterpay’s tech platforms and helping launch its consumer-facing products.</p>
<p>Some other notable startups that have gone through its venture studio program are resource planning SaaS platform <a href="https://www.runn.io/">Runn</a>; one-click invoicing tool <a href="https://www.withmarmalade.com.au/">Marmalade</a>; <a href="https://providerchoice.com.au/">Provider Choice</a>, a management platform for providers in Australia’s National Disability Insurance Scheme; <a href="https://www.landmarksid.com/">Landmarks ID</a>, a privacy-compliant mobile location intelligence platform for marketers; and <a href="https://www.fluenccy.com/">Fluenccy</a>, a service that helps importers and exporters save money on foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Before they started Dovetail, Frandsen and co-founder Ash Fogelberg’s startup, ticketing and payments platform 1-Night, was acquired by TicketDirect in 2013.</p>
<p>Dovetail’s venture studio is sector-agnostic (though it has strong experience in fintech, SaaS and marketplaces), and works with startups that may not have a product yet, but have founders who “are ambitious, commercially-savvy and bring industry expertise from the field in which they are trying to solve a problem,” said Frandsen.</p>
<p>When deciding what founders to work with, Dovetail considers at the viability and growth potential of their idea.This includes looking at how well-suited founders are to the issue, if there is enough market potential for the startup to grow into a large company and how much competition there is.</p>
<p>Dovetail has a product agency that serves mostly U.S. companies, but its venture studio is currently focused on Australasian startups, with plans to expand into North America in the future.</p>
<p>“We are actively seeking industries that are large yet underappreciated by the startup community,” Frandsen said. “We’re looking for ideas. that require hard-earned industry experience and can’t easily be replicated by teams of young aspiring entrepreneurs.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virgin Galactic has successfully taken its first passengers to space, including its billionaire founder Richard Branson. The event, at Spaceport America in New Mexico, was a field day for press and employees, complete with an early-morning Khalid set and hero walk by Branson and the crew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just imagine a world where people of all ages, all backgrounds, from anywhere, of any gender, of any ethnicity, have equal access to space,&#8221; Branson said on returning. &#8220;Welcome to the dawn of a new space age!&#8221;</p>
<p>The remark is a bit premature, of course — that world is still some distance off, but it&#8217;s true that this flight marks a historic moment in the nascent space tourism industry. At present, leisurenauts are still an elite class, but the events of the day suggest we&#8217;re closer than ever to seeing that change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After an incredibly early start to the day (shuttles to the Spaceport left at 2:45 AM from nearby Las Cruces), the festivities began in true space launch style with a delay. A thunderstorm overnight prevented the team from rolling out the spacecraft, which believe it or not can&#8217;t get wet. At the speeds and temperatures involved nothing can be left to chance — like ice forming from water in or on the chassis.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175898" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P1010053.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175898" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2175898" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P1010053.jpg" alt="Press set up before dawn at Spaceport America." width="1024" height="654" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P1010053.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P1010053.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P1010053.jpg?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P1010053.jpg?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P1010053.jpg?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P1010053.jpg?resize=1536,981 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P1010053.jpg?resize=2048,1307 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/P1010053.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2175898" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Soon the sun rose and crowds arrived: VIPs, employees, a bunch of local students, and Branson&#8217;s own guest list (reportedly numbering around 150). <a href="https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1414199651037716485">Elon Musk showed up as well</a>, presumably to congratulate his fellow spaceman personally, billionaire to billionaire.</p>
<p>At 8:30 local time the engines started on VMS Eve, the &#8220;mothership&#8221; carrying VSS Unity, the rocket-powered spaceplane that Branson, along with Virgin Galactic&#8217;s Beth Moses (her second flight), Sirisha Bandla, and Colin Bennett, would ride to the edge of space.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175906" style="width: 1415px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/eve-takeoff.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175906" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2175906 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/eve-takeoff.jpg" alt="" width="1405" height="787" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/eve-takeoff.jpg 1405w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/eve-takeoff.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/eve-takeoff.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/eve-takeoff.jpg?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/eve-takeoff.jpg?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/eve-takeoff.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1405px) 100vw, 1405px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2175906" class="wp-caption-text">VMS Eve takes off. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Virgin Galactic</p></div></p>
<p>Eve was wheels up at 8:40, commencing a wait on the ground while it climbed to about 36,000 feet. Unity detached and began its rocket-powered climb at about 9:24, reaching Mach 3 and after two minutes reached its peak altitude of about 282,000 feet — about 53 miles, as planned.</p>
<p>The crew and passengers enjoyed a minute or two of microgravity, which they seem to have employed gainfully:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175909" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unity-3_6.00_41_15_01.Still002.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175909" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2175909" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unity-3_6.00_41_15_01.Still002.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unity-3_6.00_41_15_01.Still002.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unity-3_6.00_41_15_01.Still002.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unity-3_6.00_41_15_01.Still002.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unity-3_6.00_41_15_01.Still002.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unity-3_6.00_41_15_01.Still002.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unity-3_6.00_41_15_01.Still002.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unity-3_6.00_41_15_01.Still002.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2175909" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Virgin Galactic</p></div></p>
<p>A planned mid-air speech by Branson proved impossible as the signal cut in and out, but the craft itself proved more reliable, touching down at 9:38.</p>
<p>In a celebratory stage appearance (following a brief Khalid concert) Branson expanded on the ideas cut short in transmission, beginning with: &#8220;It&#8217;s hot, I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; but quickly moving on to more inspiring words. &#8220;I have dreamt about this moment since I was a child, but nothing could have prepared me for the view of Earth from space. We are at the vanguard of a new space age.&#8221;</p>
<p>At a press conference following shortly after, Branson fielded questions from elementary schoolers, and the crew described the view from space and whether they saw any planets. (No, just an alien that the pilot shook off during descent, Branson said. At least one kid I saw believed him.)</p>
<h2>A long road to space</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s a triumph long in the making for Virgin Galactic and Branson. The company was ahead of the curve in its space tourism ambitions, but in 2014 a test flight <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/31/virgin-galactics-spaceshiptwo-has-crashed/">ended in a horrific crash</a> and the death of one of the pilots.</p>
<p>Virgin&#8217;s engineers and leaders worked through it, however, and built a stronger, better spacecraft which was christened Unity by Stephen Hawking, who was then still living — and, not surprisingly, hoping to hitch a ride someday.</p>
<p>Pilots flew test flight after test flight over the years, slowly ratcheting up the power and finally, in 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/virgin-galactic-touches-the-edge-of-space-with-mach-2-9-test-flight-of-spaceshiptwo/">touching the edge of space</a>. On that note there is some slight controversy in that the exact altitude where the atmosphere gives way to space isn&#8217;t completely agreed upon. Some authorities place the Kármán line, as the imaginary boundary is called, at 100 kilometers above sea level, others at 50 miles, or about 80 kilometers.</p>

<p>Virgin uses the lower estimate, while its arch rival, Jeff Bezos&#8217;s Blue Origin, uses the higher. This led Bezos to throw shade on Virgin&#8217;s flights, saying he didn&#8217;t want his customers to have an &#8220;asterisk&#8221; on their trip to space. When I asked about this before, a Virgin representative said they use the same standard that NASA and the U.S. Air Force does: pilots are given their &#8220;astronaut wings&#8221; if they pass the 50-mile mark.</p>
<p>Kármán quibbles aside, the race to send passengers to space has been heating up lately, and Bezos recently announced that he would be flying aboard the first crewed launch of Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard rocket on July 22 — with his brother, a mystery passenger who has paid $28M for the privilege, and Wally Funk, among the first women trained to be astronauts in 1961 but who never made it to space.</p>
<p>But Branson rained on his parade by announcing shortly afterward that he would fly aboard Virgin&#8217;s first passenger launch to space (crew and pilots have been up several times) about a week earlier.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Branson aims to beat Bezos to orbit in final stretch of billionaire space race&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/branson-aims-to-beat-bezos-to-orbit-in-final-stretch-of-billionaire-space-race/embed/#?secret=YOtB7mXPck" data-secret="YOtB7mXPck" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While Branson has good-naturedly denied any competition between himself and Bezos (&#8220;We wish Jeff the absolute best,&#8221; he said, adding that Bezos sent over a message of goodwill before the flight) it&#8217;s hard to believe that&#8217;s completely true. Though neither man has anything to prove at this point, there must surely be some satisfaction in Branson&#8217;s not merely going to space (a lifelong dream, as he tells it) but doing so before his upstart rival. However much he denies it, the narrative is too tempting to quash completely.</p>
<p>The direction forward for Virgin Galactic now is, clearly, towards paying customers, of which there are plenty lined up. Of course, they all have a quarter of a million dollars to spare, but you might not, and for you Branson has a special offer. <a href="https://www.omaze.com/products/virgin-galactic-2021">They&#8217;ve partnered with Omaze</a>, and donations to the chosen charity will enter you into a raffle of sorts, with the winner receiving two tickets on an upcoming Virgin Galactic flight. &#8220;And with my Willy Wonka hat on, a guided tour of Spaceport America, given by yours truly,&#8221; Branson added.</p>
<p>Branson expressed hope that this would become an ongoing thing as long as donations continue, so perhaps this is the answer to the question of how they hope to, as he so frequently promises, make space available to <em>everyone</em>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["She pointed to the screen projected behind her to help us stay on the most relevant piece of information. The way she did it really made us stay with her. Like, we couldn't break eye contact."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Melissa Wong spent more than a decade working for major retail brands before founding Retail Zipline. That kind of outrageous advantage &#8212; a complete understanding of the industry &#8212; is something that investors struggle to resist in a vertical SaaS company. At least, according to Emergence Capital investor Lotti Siniscalco.</p>
<p>Wong and Siniscalco joined us on a recent episode of Extra Crunch Live and went into detail on why Emergence was eager to finance Retail Zipline&#8217;s Series A round, walking us through Zipline&#8217;s Series A pitch deck and sharing which slides and bits clinched the deal.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is a weekly virtual event series meant to help founders build better venture-backed businesses. We sit down with investors and the founders they finance to hear what brought them together, what they saw in each other and how they work together moving forward. We also host the ECL pitch-off, where founders in the audience can pitch their startups to our outstanding speakers.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is accessible to everyone on a live basis, but the on-demand content is reserved exclusively for Extra Crunch members. You can check out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/check-out-the-expert-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-july/">July slate here</a> and see the full <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">ECL library here</a>.</p>
<h2>Stand up, stand out</h2>
<p>During Wong&#8217;s fundraising process, Zipline was also attending a big industry conference. Emergence suggested that they do a virtual pitch meeting while Wong was at the trade show, but Wong pushed back, insisting on an in-person pitch meeting. Not only did she know that she would deliver a better pitch in person, but she didn&#8217;t want to squander the limited amount of time she had at the trade show with potential clients and partners.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;She pointed to the screen projected behind her to help us stay on the most relevant piece of information. The way she did it really made us stay with her. Like, we couldn&#8217;t break eye contact.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Once the in-person meeting did take place, Wong surprised the Emergence team. For one, she stood up to pitch. Wong explained that her co-founder is a bigger guy, and she&#8217;s a smaller woman, and she feels more confident and comfortable presenting from a standing position.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was one of the few or maybe the only CEO who ever stood up to pitch the entire team,&#8221; said Siniscalco. &#8220;She pointed to the screen projected behind her to help us stay on the most relevant piece of information. The way she did it really made us stay with her. Like, we couldn&#8217;t break eye contact.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of delivery, Wong had already made an impact. But the content of the deck, and her experience in retail, clinched the deal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I look for an unfair reason for a founder to be the perfect person to build this product,&#8221; said Siniscalco. &#8220;Wong gave us her background in the first slide, and I knew quickly that she was a credible person in the retail industry. Then, what I look for in a pitch, is customer love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Siniscalco said the combination of that unfair advantage and intense customer love is highly correlated with a very positive outcome for a company.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we first started out, I was really insecure <em>because</em> I came from the industry versus coming from a lot of Silicon Valley knowledge,&#8221; said Wong. &#8220;In retrospect, I really underestimated the competitive advantage of coming from the industry. People said it to me, but I didn&#8217;t understand what that resulted in. But it resulted in the numbers in our deck, because I know what customers want, what they want to buy next, how to keep them happy and I was able to be way more capital-efficient.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Zipline deck</h2>
<p>Zipline&#8217;s entire deck (with some minor redactions) is embedded below. You can swipe on through at your leisure, but the real value here (in my humble opinion) is Siniscalco&#8217;s breakdown of how she reacted to the information in the deck. I&#8217;ll relay that here in text, but I also strongly suggest you watch (at least) the first half of the episode below to hear the founder/investor duo walk us through this deck.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has appointed a resident grievance officer in India days after the American social media firm said to have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/twitter-has-lost-liability-protection-in-india-government-says/">lost the liability protection</a> on user-generated content in the South Asian nation over non-compliance with local IT rules.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Twitter <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/report-twitter-abuse-india">identified</a> Vinay Prakash as its new resident grievance officer and shared a way to contact him as required by India’s new IT rules, which was unveiled in February this year and went into effect in late May. Twitter has also published a compliance report, another requirement listed in the new rules.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Indian government had told a local court that Twitter had lost the liability protection on user-generated content in the country, as it had failed to appoint compliance, grievance and a so-called nodal contact officials to address on-ground concerns.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other internet giants including Facebook, Google, and Telegram have already appointed these local compliance officers in India.</p>
<p>Internet services enjoy what is broadly referred to as “safe harbor” protection that say that tech platforms won’t be held liable for the things their users post or share online. If you insult someone on Twitter, for instance, the company may be asked to take down your post (if the person you have insulted has approached the court and a takedown order has been issued) but it likely won’t be held legally responsible for what you said or did.</p>

<p>Without the protection, Twitter — which according to mobile insight firm App Annie, has over 100 million users in India — is on paper responsible for everything those users say on its platform. Indian police have already filed at least five cases against the company or its officials in the country over a range of issues.</p>
<p>The new development should help assuage the tension between Twitter and the Indian government. A special squad of Delhi police <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">made a surprise visit to two of Twitter’s offices</a> in late May in what many perceived as an intimidation tactic. Twitter said at the time that it was “concerned by recent events regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve” and requested the Indian government to grant it three additional months to comply with the new IT rules.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Twitter told an Indian court that it was working to &#8220;fully comply&#8221; with the new rules.</p>
<p>More countries are formulating similar requirements for tech giants in their nations. Russia President Vladimir Putin signed a law that mandates foreign social media giants to open offices in Russia. Any social firm with a daily user base of 500,000 people or more is required to comply with the new law.</p>

The launch is scheduled for 7:30 AM Pacific, with streaming festivities (including commentary by Stephen Colbert) starting on the hour.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The launch has been delayed by 1.5 hours due to weather. New target time is 7:30 AM Pacific, 8:30 AM local.</p>
<p>This launch is the 22nd for VSS Unity, Virgin Galactic&#8217;s first spacecraft to leave the atmosphere. As before, Unity will leave the Spaceport attached to the belly of VMS Eve, which will take it up out of the thickest part of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Unity will drop off and ignite its rocket engine, reaching speeds approaching Mach 3 until it reaches the 80 kilometer mark, the lowest altitude considered to be in space. When the engines shut off, the pilots and passengers will enjoy a short period of weightlessness and of course stunning views.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>

<h3>Android ad prices jump in wake of privacy updates on iOS</h3>
<p>The Wall St. Journal reported this week how Apple&#8217;s privacy changes are changing the world of mobile advertising &#8212; in this case, ad pricing across platforms. The news outlet has been covering the broader impact of Apple&#8217;s decision to let users block apps from tracking them, noting how <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/publishers-brace-for-impact-from-apples-new-privacy-controls-11598565920">ad sales</a>, including <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-privacy-change-will-hit-facebooks-core-ad-business-heres-how-11611938750">Facebook&#8217;s ad business</a>, would be affected. (And how Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-privacy-changes-are-poised-to-boost-its-ad-products-11619485863">own ad business</a> would gain.)</p>
<p>This week, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-apple-tightens-tracking-rules-advertisers-shift-spending-toward-android-devices-11625477401?mod=djemalertNEWS">The WSJ says</a> most users are declining tracking on iOS (less than 33% opt in), and as a result, mobile ad prices on iOS have fallen. The outlet cites data from ad measurement firm Tenjin which notes that spending on iOS mobile ads has dropped around one-third between June 1 and July 1. Around the same time, Android spending rose 10% &#8212; an indication that, for the time being, some portion of the ad market has just shifted platforms. Facebook ad spend also shifted to Android, with year-over-year growth of 46% for Android users in May to 64% in June.</p>
<p>The news follows a story this week <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c79a5f6a-0827-47a4-9b3b-622a81fcc75a">from The FT</a>, which noted that Chinese tech giants&#8217; plan to route around the IDFA changes with CAID (the Chinese Advertising ID), had failed. Apple blocked updates to apps using CAID, which led to it losing support and the project&#8217;s failure.</p>
<p>For most app users, the ability to block tracking is a welcome change, as far too much user data had been shared behind-the-scenes without users&#8217; informed consent. But the full impacts of how the update will impact app monetization long-term &#8212; and ultimately which companies then choose to build on iOS &#8212; still remain to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>37 AGs target Google Play in an antitrust lawsuit</strong></p>
<p>A group of 37 attorneys general <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/google-state-lawsuit-android-attorneys-general/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">filed a second major antitrust lawsuit against Google</a>, accusing the company of using its market power to stifle competition. The suit takes aim at Google&#8217;s Play Store, which requires users to pay for apps and in-app purchases using Google&#8217;s own payments system &#8212; which gives Google a percentage of the revenue. In addition, the suit alleges that Google makes misleading security claims about the need for a walled garden app store like Google Play, in order to maintain its dominant position.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/lawsuit-ignores-choice-android-and-google-play/">responded by calling the lawsuit</a> &#8220;meritless&#8221; and noting that it ignores the openness of the Android platform, which permits other app stores and sideloading.</p>

<p>Recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/snowman-the-studio-behind-altos-adventure-and-others-launches-a-kids-app-company-pok-pok/">launched Pok Pok Playroom</a> from Pok Pok, a spinout from app maker Snowman (Alto&#8217;s Adventure, Alto&#8217;s Odyssey, Skate City), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/apple-announces-its-2021-apple-design-award-winners/">just took home an Apple Design Award</a> in the &#8220;Delight and Fun&#8221; category for its app launched just months ago. Unlike other kids&#8217; apps, Pok Pok promises an app that&#8217;s more of a digital &#8220;toy&#8221; that encourages real and imaginative play, not a mobile kids game. Now the company is sharing some of the techniques that helped it build this award-winning experience.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CDJoyaec63U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The company says it wanted to make sure there were no annoying sounds or repetitive music in the app that would bother parents or get stuck in kids&#8217; heads. So it worked with its sound designer, Matt Miller, to ensure all the sounds in Pok Pok Playroom were sensory accessible and not overstimulating.</p>
<p>Miller often uses what he calls &#8220;found sounds&#8221; &#8212; that is, sounds he created by finding things to record &#8212; like a soup can, a vintage toy sourced from a local thrift shop, birds chirping, a spoon knocking on a pinecone and more. These give Pok Pok Playroom a more natural feel than other toys, which can sometimes feature loud or electronic-sounding noises that are overstimulating for kids and disruptive to those around them.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22549338/apple-google-apps-comscore-study-facebook">new Comscore study offers</a> a look at how much people use their preinstalled apps from Apple and Google. Not surprisingly, these built-in utilities and services &#8212; like email, notes, messaging, maps, photos, clocks and more &#8212; dominate people&#8217;s app usage. 75% of the top 20 most-used apps on iPhone were made by Apple, and 60% of the top Android apps were made by Google, but here&#8217;s the funny thing: The study was paid for by Facebook, a company that&#8217;s looking for any angle to make it seem like it&#8217;s not a monopoly. So of course it had to find the only other bigger apps it could &#8212; the ones that ship with your smartphone.</p>

<p><strong>OnePlus <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-9-pro-performance-throttling-popular-apps/">confirmed</a> it&#8217;s throttling a number of popular apps on the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro</strong> in order to improve battery life. Apps such as Chrome, Twitter, Zoom, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, Discord, Microsoft’s Office apps, Firefox and Samsung Internet, were affected. The issue was discovered due to inconsistent benchmarks in testing.</p>
<h3>Fintech</h3>
<p><strong>PayPal was the most downloaded P2P payments app globally during the first half of 2021</strong>, according to <a href="https://blog.apptopia.com/-most-downloaded-p2p-payment-apps-in-the-world-h1-2021">Apptopia</a>. Rounding out the top 10 were Google Play, Alipay, PhonePe, Cash App, Paytm, Venmo, Zelle, Western Union and Remitly.</p>
<p><strong>Personal finance app Charlie launched a redesign and a new feature called Direct Pay, which allows users to add their credit cards to the app to make extra payments toward their debt at their own pace</strong>. Or they can let the app recommend when it&#8217;s best to make payments toward their credit card debt. The company notes its users are now saving $66 monthly, which has added up to $30K+ of interest saved over the lifetime of their loans.</p>

Trump&#8217;s lawsuit claims his First Amendment rights are being violated. The First Amendment applies to government censorship, not actions taken by businesses, however. Trump likely knows this but wanted to stir up some headlines.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">A new startup called <a href="https://www.swoonmedating.com/">SwoonMe</a> aims to fix the problem with superficial dating apps, where users primarily make decisions based on how someone looks in their photos. Instead, on SwoonMe, you take a selfie which the app converts into an avatar. This is what others will see when they come to your profile. You then record a voice clip to tell others about yourself and what you’re looking for in a partner. The result is that when people scroll through SwoonMe, they’re not making snap decisions based on what they’re seeing, but are rather making more thoughtful decisions based what they hear. When two people match, the app encourages them to continue to get to know each other using voice messages and soon, icebreaker games — not texting and photo-sharing. As they communicate, their avatar will slowly unveil their real photo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After months of beta testing, Y Combinator has <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/co-founder-matching/">launched a co-founder matching platform</a>. The platform invites entrepreneurs to create profiles, which include information about themselves and preferences for a co-founder, such as location and skill sets. It digests that information and offers a number of potential candidates that fit those needs — kind of like Tinder for co-founders. To date, the accelerator says it has made 9,000 matches across 4,500 founders.</p>
<p>Y Combinator is obviously well positioned to execute this tool. The accelerator offers the popular Startup School, a free online program with resources and lectures surrounding how to start a company, to anyone who wants to start a company. The school has cultivated a community of 230,000 founders in 190 countries. A matching tool is thus an easy jump to make, one that could help the partners there move even earlier in aggregating and eavesdropping on nascent talent. Notably, two companies who met through the matching platform are part of the YC Summer 2021 batch. Yay ecosystems!</p>
<p>Here’s my hot take, though: The tool may appear as a neat, in-demand and simplistic tool that connects people to each other, but this is far harder to execute in a meaningful way than one may think — even if you’re an accelerator as famed and well known as YC. What follows is a list of suggestions, or rather wishes, for the tool, put together after I spoke to January Ventures co-founder Jennifer Neundorfer for her thoughts as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>Co-founder matching tools are best for founders who don’t have built-in networks and need ways to find collaborators in their earliest days. Startup School is indeed a wide net, but because Y Combinator struggles with diversity and representation of minorities in its batches, it will need to find ways to make sure that doesn’t get compounded when matching founders with each other. Can there be a filter for gender or ethnic background? Should there be? It’s a slippery slope.</li>
<li>YC told me here that “we don&#8217;t ask for demographic information from Startup School participants with the exception of a recent open text box for gender; and a large percentage have yet to fill this out. Right now, we&#8217;re using this info within co-founder matching — if you&#8217;re a woman, we let you mark that you&#8217;re seeking a woman co-founder and we increase the chances the co-founder candidates you see are women.&#8221;</li>
<li>Adverse selection is a real thing. Neundorfer told me that in the past, co-founder matching tools<em> only</em> attracted founders without networks, which didn’t do much good once they combined their backgrounds and still couldn’t get meetings with VCs. How does a co-founder matching tool find its Goldilocks situation — attracting the star PM at a hot startup thinking about entrepreneurship <em>and</em> the ambitious post-graduate with a love for code but absolutely no connections to people in the Valley.</li>
<li>It’s never as easy as swiping right. Can YC figure out a way to help co-founders within the matching service learn easy ways to vet compatibility? A riff on <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/style/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html">36 questions that lead to love</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, as popularized by the</span> NY Times, but with your co-founder would be perfect.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a blog post announcing the tool, YC addressed this last point. “You probably shouldn’t marry someone after just one date, and similarly, it’ll take more than one video call to decide whether to co-found a company with someone,” it reads. “We encourage matched co-founders to meet and, when appropriate, work together on a time-boxed trial project with clear expectations and goals in order to vet co-founder compatibility.”</p>
<p>All in all, I’m rooting for this because, well, who wouldn’t? As Neundorfer puts it, “founder matching tools are an interesting way to expand the supply of founders and diversify the base of founders.” It just matters that the tools are built with diversity and accessibility in mind.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll get into a rare executive shuffle at a pre-IPO company, an EC-1 that digs into the modern web delivery tech stack and Didi. You can find me at Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a> and DM me for my Signal for tips (no pitches, please).</p>
<h2>The Instacart shuffle</h2>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/instacart-hires-facebook-executive-as-new-ceo-ahead-of-expected-ipo/">Instacart has hired Facebook executive</a> Fidji Simo as its new CEO ahead of an expected IPO. The grocery delivery company, last valued at $39 billion, will transition current CEO and founder Apoorva Mehta to executive chairman.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>A major executive shuffle ahead of a public debut is as rare as it is questionable. Instacart’s Mehta is leaving his original role before taking the company he founded nearly 10 years ago public. But, per The Information, Simo’s new job is yet another example of <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instacart-ceo-hire-is-part-of-monthslong-raid-of-facebook-staff?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=page">Instacart’s long-going “talent raid” of Facebook.</a> The publication estimates that in 2021, Instacart has hired at least 55 engineers, product managers, recruiters, designers and data scientists from Facebook. Of course, Simo’s new job means that Facebook has lost one of its highest-ranking female executives, which is not a good look for a company that already struggles with diversity.</p>

<p>Say that subhead five times fast. The latest EC-1, our deep dive into a company from origin to execution to challenges ahead, is all about NS1, which launched with a plan to disrupt the core of the modern web delivery tech stack.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know</strong>: It’s a key read even for those of us who aren’t the biggest nerds on IT and enterprise infrastructure. Why? Because the story talks about how a startup competes in a matured space full of well-funded Big Tech companies and VC-backed heavyweights — and why the need for a reengineering of internet traffic isn’t a niche one.</p>
<p><em>The breakdown:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Origin story “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/">1 napkin and 22 lines of code, or how NS1 rewrote the rules of internet infrastructure</a>” (2,700 words/11 minutes)</li>
<li>Product development and roadmap “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-product/">WTF is NS1? It’s DNS, DDI, and maybe other TLAs</a>” (2,700 words/11 minutes)</li>
<li>Competitive landscape “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-competition/">The fight for the future of DNS is white hot</a>” (2,300 words/9 minutes)</li>
<li>Customer development “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-customers/">Outages, pandemics and the reengineering of traffic on the internet</a>” (2,600 words/10 minutes)</li>
</ul>
<h2>And finally, Didi</h2>
<p>The Equity team <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/mmhmm-its-the-most-ridiculous-story-weve-ever-heard/">had an especially amazing episode this week</a> — and I wasn’t even in it, so you can take my semi-less-biased word.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>The most interesting part of the episode was the conversation around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/will-didis-regulatory-problems-make-it-harder-for-chinese-startups-to-go-public-in-the-us/">Didi, and its impact on Chinese companies listing in the United States.</a> Regulatory problems have a way of lessening investor interest, and Didi isn’t the only example that we’ve had to point to in recent weeks.</p>
<p><em>Other things in the show via Alex’s notes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What’s going on with facial recognition tech? With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/anyvision-the-controversial-facial-recognition-startup-has-raised-235m-led-by-softbank-and-eldridge/">AnyVision raising a $235 million round</a>, Danny and Alex tangled over the future of privacy, and what counts as good enough when it comes to keeping ourselves to ourselves.</li>

<p>It’s the end of a short week, but instead of not having much to chat about we have a lot. But it’s all very good fun, so let’s enjoy ourselves!</p>
<p>First, let’s talk about expensive four-legged beasts.</p>
<h2>Trillion-dollar horse?</h2>
<p>The Exchange started digging into the Q2 2021 venture capital market this week. Thanks to Anna’s help <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">our first piece</a> came out pretty well, I think. We have a lot more coming soon. But the unicorn stats really grabbed me by the nape. Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>136 unicorns were minted in Q2 2021, an all-time record.</li>
<li>As <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/reports/CB-Insights_Venture-Report-Q2-2021.pdf">CB Insights notes</a>, that’s <em>“nearly 6x the 23 unicorns born a year ago in Q2&#8217;20, and already higher than the 128 unicorns born in all of 2020.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The result of this boom in the horned equestrian population is that there are now 750 unicorns in the world. When former TechCruncher and excellent human Katie Roof <a href="https://twitter.com/Katie_Roof/status/1413543145883721738">tweeted</a> that stat, my first thought was <em>shit, that means unicorns are worth more than $1 trillion</em>.</p>
<p>I was <em>way</em> off. The real number is nearly $2.4 trillion (CB Insights data). Which is a shatteringly high figure. In comparative terms, the un-exited unicorn population of the world is worth nearly precisely what Apple is worth today &#8212; $2.42 trillion, per Yahoo Finance.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am overreacting to the amount of unicorn equity that is currently sitting, largely frozen, in the private markets. Especially when unicorn exits are up. But are even today’s elevated exit levels enough to clear this particular ledger over time? No, I don’t think so. Not when we are minting 1.5 unicorns per day in Q2, counting weekends and the like and the unicorn count is ever-increasing.</p>
<h2>Funding rounds</h2>
<p>I only wrote about one funding round this week &#8212; this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/r2c-raises-27m-to-scale-its-security-focused-code-analysis-service/">r2c round</a> that was pretty interesting &#8212; mostly because I had a bunch of other things to chew through. But I’ve also seen my inbound venture capital round pitches slow <a href="https://alexwrites.substack.com/p/a-few-thoughts-on-funding-rounds">since declaring</a> that I’d not cover rounds that didn’t include more detailed financial information.</p>
<p>It is not clear yet if pitch volume is down due to the holiday week, or if I have scared everyone off. But I do use my inbound volume of funding round pitches both in aggregate, and in <em>sector</em>&#8211;<em>directional </em>terms to help gauge what’s going on. So, here’s hoping that (1) people will send me stuff and (2) they will do so and also share a lot more information at the same time.</p>
<h2>SPACs in space</h2>
<p>Y Combinator is a neat entity. One of its recent companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/satellite-imagery-startup-albedo-closes-10m-seed-round/">was Albedo</a>, a startup that is hoping to build a network of low-orbit satellites that will take super high-res photos of the planet. To do so is hard <em>af</em>, as <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> would say, but perhaps possible thanks to off-the-shelf (kinda) satellite parts, in-orbit refueling and a bunch of other new stuff.</p>
<p>Albedo and its ilk are why I still trot out every year to watch Demo Day. I get to see what could be coming, and that’s very good, illustrative fun.</p>
<p>All that’s to say that when two satellite imaging companies announced that they were going public via SPACs this week I was intrigued. Turns out they are not really in competition with what Albedo wants to do, as they offer lower-resolution images. But they are … notable for other reasons.</p>
<p>Satellogic for having this <a href="https://satellogic.com/wp-content/themes/satellogic-theme/Satellogic_InvestorPresentation_July6-2021__(full).pdf">simply artful series of charts</a> (be sure to observe the dates in each chart):</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175755" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175755" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175755" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_satellogic_7_10.png" alt="" width="1024" height="511" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_satellogic_7_10.png 1057w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_satellogic_7_10.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_satellogic_7_10.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_satellogic_7_10.png?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_satellogic_7_10.png?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_satellogic_7_10.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175755" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Satellogic</p></div></p>
<p>And Planet <a href="https://www.planet.com/investors/presentations/2021/investor-presentation-20210707.pdf">for the following</a>, namely a look into how the economics of satellite tech are pretty heavily weighted toward the future:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175757" style="width: 617px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175757" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175757" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_planet_7_10.png" alt="" width="607" height="413" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_planet_7_10.png 607w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_planet_7_10.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_planet_7_10.png?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exchange_planet_7_10.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175757" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Planet</p></div></p>
<p>The company’s long-term gross margin target is 80% to 85% (COGS of 15%-20%, per the deck), but you can see how long it takes to get there. This poses an interesting issue for the venture capital world.</p>
<p>Namely that companies like Albedo are going to need a lot of time and money to build out their constellations and get to scale. And, I presume, to scale to the sort of gross margins that software companies can generate from their first day selling product.</p>
<p>This is one reason why there is so much money chasing software products with even a hint of durable growth; high-margin recurring revenue is the business equivalent of a cheat code when it comes to value creation. Thus every investor wants to shovel money into it. Satellite tech, while <em>super fucking critical in general</em>, simply is more expensive and slower-burn.</p>
<p>My question: Is software so good at generating venture capital returns that other forms of startup work will struggle to compete for attention and capital? Are they already?</p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://future.com">Future</a>. Or more precisely, Future’s future. I am curious about the a16z publication.</p>
<p>Since it launched I’ve checked in a few times each week, hoping to see what was coming out of the venture capital firm’s collective mind. I do so not only because I am a huge dweeb &#8212; I am! &#8212; but also because after all the hand-wringing that I’ve had to read about how the media hates tech &#8212; <a href="https://alexwrites.substack.com/p/tech-media-and-what-journalism-is">nope!</a> &#8212; I was curious what a cosmically well-funded venture group would build. It has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andreessen-horowitz-expands-its-in-houses-media-operations-2021-1">hired some great people</a>, after all.</p>
<p>It appears that we are in between publishing cycles at the Future blog. The last pieces of Main Content came out nearly a month ago, and its most recent entry is <a href="https://future.a16z.com/future-com-welcome-what-now-next/">dated June 25th</a>. And that piece is just a note promising more content in July.</p>
<p>It all feels a bit flat? Given the budget, promise, fancy domain and number of people in the a16z world who should have things to say? Why not make more words appear? Let’s see what July brings.</p>
<p>Ok that’s enough from me for the week. Hugs, and talk to you Monday morning on the pod.</p>
<p>Your friend,</p>
<p>&#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Digital technologies have disrupted the structure of markets with unprecedented breadth and scale. Today, there is yet another wave of innovation emerging, and that is the decarbonization of the global economy.</p>
<p>While governments still lack the conviction necessary to truly fight the climate crisis, the overall direction is clear. The carbon price in Europe rose from below $10 to over $50 per ton. Shell was handed a resounding defeat by a Dutch court. The major blackout in Texas at the beginning of the year revealed the fragility of the existing energy supply even in a highly industrialized country. We must urgently invest more into developing and deploying reliable, clean electricity generation technologies to make decarbonization a reality.</p>
<p>Forward-thinking investors understand this. Global investment in low-carbon technologies climbed to $500 billion in 2020, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-19/spending-on-global-energy-transition-hits-record-500-billion">according to Bloomberg</a>. Renewable energy accounted for around $300 billion of that, followed by electrification of transport ($140 billion) and heating ($50 billion).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, we remain far from the finish line. <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2021">According to the International Energy Agency</a>, global emissions of CO2 this year are set to jump 1.5 billion tons over 2020 levels. And more than 80% of global energy consumption is <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-balances-overview">still made up of coal, oil and gas</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Fusion, the process that powers the stars, could be the cleanest energy source for humanity.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That’s why we need to continue backing new technologies with breakthrough potential. Of particular promise is nuclear fusion. Fusion, the process that powers the stars, could be the cleanest energy source for humanity. We are already indirectly harvesting the power of fusion through solar energy. Being able to build fusion reactors would give us an “always on” version, independent of weather conditions.</p>
<p>But why fund fusion at all, given that we don’t yet know how to do it? First, this isn’t an either-or proposition. We can afford to build out renewable energy and investigate new forms of energy production at the same time because the latter — at least at this early stage of development — will require a comparatively trivial amount of money. The U.S. government&#8217;s latest <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/">plan</a> is to spend $174 billion over 10 years on the electrification of car transport alone, so to invest $2 billion to create a fusion power plant seems doable.</p>
<p>Second, we are about to need a lot more electricity than we ever have. The global demand for carbon-free energy sources is set to triple by 2050, driven by increasing urbanization, the electrification of industrial processes, the loss of biodiversity and the increase in energy consumption in emerging markets.</p>
<p>Third, there’s been tremendous progress in the necessary supporting technologies. Superconducting magnets for the magnetic-confinement approach to fusion have become much cheaper, lasers for inertial confinement fusion have become much more powerful, and breakthroughs in material science have made nanostructured targets available, which enable the use of completely new approaches to fusion, such as the low-neutronic fuel pB11.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a growing number of entrepreneurial efforts from world-class teams to try and build fusion. At least 25 startups around the world are targeting fusion right now, approaching the problem with a wide range of technologies. The amount invested in private fusion companies across the world increased tenfold to almost $1 billion in 2020, according to Crunchbase.</p>
<p>The upside of successful fusion is nearly unlimited. The clean energy generation market represents a trillion-dollar opportunity. An estimated 26 TW of primary energy capacity needs to be built globally from 2030 to 2050 to serve the rising global energy needs, according to Materials Research Society. Just 1 TW of capacity will generate $300 billion in revenue, and a 15% market share from 2030 to 2050 would yield more than $1 trillion in annual revenue.</p>
<p>We need many shots on goal here, which is why Susan Danziger and I have personally invested in three different fusion startups already (Zap Energy and Avalanche in the United States and Marvel Fusion in Germany).</p>
<p>But it is not primarily the potential for financial upside that motivates us: There is an opportunity to make an indelible difference in the trajectory of human history. If even a small fraction of the large wealth accumulated by entrepreneurs and investors in the last couple of decades is invested here, the likelihood of successful fusion rises dramatically. That, in turn, will unlock much more investment from both venture funds and governments.</p>
<p>Now is the time to go all-in on decarbonization. Funding fusion with its breakthrough potential must be part of that effort.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, during the pandemic, a free browser extension called Netflix Party gained traction because it enabled people trapped in their homes to connect with far-flung friends and family by watching the same Netflix TV shows and movies simultaneously. It also enabled them to dish about the action in a side bar chat.</p>
<p>Yet that company &#8212; later renamed <a href="https://www.netflixparty.com/">Teleparty </a>&#8212; was just the beginning, argue two young companies that have raised seed funding. One, a year-old upstart in London that launched in December, just closed its round this week led by Craft Ventures. The other, a four-year-old, Bay Area-based startup, has raised $3 million in previously undisclosed seed funding, including from 500 Startups.</p>
<p>Both believe that while investors have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/hopin-confirms-400m-raise-at-5-65b-valuation/">thrown money</a> at virtual events and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/us-edtech-investments-surpass-2020-total-32b-first-half-tony-wan/">edtech</a> companies, there is an even bigger opportunity in developing a kind of multiplayer browsing experience that enables people to do much more together online. From watching sports to watching movies to perhaps even reviewing X-rays with one&#8217;s doctor some day, both say more web surfing together is inevitable, particularly for younger users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IRKA3W3cBa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/hopin-confirms-400m-raise-at-5-65b-valuation/">Hopin confirms $400M raise at $5.65B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hopin confirms $400M raise at $5.65B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/hopin-confirms-400m-raise-at-5-65b-valuation/embed/#?secret=IRKA3W3cBa" data-secret="IRKA3W3cBa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The companies are taking somewhat different approaches. The startup on which Craft just made a bet, leading its $2.2 million seed round, is <a href="https://giggl.app/">Giggl</a>, a year-old, London-based startup that invites users of its web app to tap into virtual sessions. It calls these &#8220;portals&#8221; to which they can invite friends to browse content together, as well as text chat and call in. The portals can be private rooms or switched to &#8220;public&#8221; so that anyone can join.</p>
<p>Giggl was founded by four teenagers who grew up together, including its 19-year-old chief product officer, Tony Zog. It only recently graduated from the LAUNCH accelerator program. Still, it already has enough users &#8212; roughly 20,000 of whom use the service on an active monthly basis &#8212; that it&#8217;s beginning to build its own custom server infrastructure to minimize downtime and reduce its costs.</p>
<p>The bigger idea is to build a platform for all kinds of scenarios and to charge for these accordingly. For example, while people can chat for free while web surfing or watching events together like Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, Giggl plans to charge for more premium features, as well as to sell subscriptions to enterprises that are looking for more ways to collaborate. (You can check out a demo of Giggl&#8217;s current service below.)</p>

<p><a href="https://hearo.live/">Hearo.live</a> is the other &#8220;multiplayer&#8221; startup &#8212; the one backed by 500 Startups, along with numerous angel investors. The company is the brainchild of Ned Lerner, who previously spent 13 years as a director of engineering with Sony Worldwide Studios and a short time before that as the CTO of an Electronic Arts division.</p>
<p>Hearo has a more narrow strategy in that users can&#8217;t browse absolutely anything together as with Giggl. Instead, Hearo enables users to access upwards of 35 broadcast services in the U.S. (from NBC Sports to YouTube to Disney+), and it relies on data synchronization to ensure that every user sees the same original video quality.</p>
<p>Hearo has also focused a lot of its efforts on sound, aiming to ensure that when multiple streams of audio are being created at the same time &#8212; say users are watching the basketball playoffs together and also commenting &#8212; not everyone involved is confronted with a noisy feedback loop.</p>
<p>Indeed, Lerner says, through echo cancellation and other &#8220;special audio tricks&#8221; that Hearo&#8217;s small team has developed, users can enjoy the experience without &#8220;noise and other stuff messing up the experience.&#8221; (&#8220;Pretty much we can do everything Clubhouse can do,&#8221; says Lerner. &#8220;We&#8217;re just doing it as you&#8217;re watching something else because I honestly didn&#8217;t think people just sitting around talking would be a big thing.&#8221;)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qPJafI3G6G"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/">Clubhouse closes an undisclosed $4B valuation Series C round, as tech giants&#8217; clones circle</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clubhouse closes an undisclosed $4B valuation Series C round, as tech giants&#8217; clones circle&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/embed/#?secret=qPJafI3G6G" data-secret="qPJafI3G6G" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Like Giggl, Hearo Lerner envisions a subscription model; it also anticipates an eventual ad revenue split with sports broadcasters and says it&#8217;s already working with the European Broadcasting Union on that front. Like Giggl, Hearo&#8217;s users numbers are conservative by most standards, with 300,000 downloads to date of its app for iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS, and 60,000 actively monthly users.</p>
<p>It begs the question of whether &#8220;watching together online&#8221; is a huge opportunity, and the answer doesn&#8217;t yet seem clear, even if Hearo and Giggl have compelling tech and paths to generating revenue.</p>
<p>The startups aren&#8217;t the first to focus on watch-together type experiences. <a href="https://www.scener.com/">Scener</a>, an app founded by serial entrepreneur Richard Wolpert, says it has 2 million active registered users and &#8220;the best, most active relationship with all the studios.&#8221; But it markets itself a virtual movie theater, which is a slightly different use case.</p>
<p>Rabbit, a company founded in 2013, enabled people to more widely browse and watch the same content simultaneously, as well as to text and video chat. It&#8217;s closer to what Giggl is building. But Rabbit eventually ran aground.</p>
<p>Lerner says that&#8217;s because the company was screen-sharing other people&#8217;s copyrighted material and so couldn&#8217;t charge for its service. (&#8220;Essentially,&#8221; he notes, &#8220;you can get away with some amount of piracy if it&#8217;s not for your personal financial benefit.&#8221;) But it&#8217;s probably fair to wonder if there will ever be massive demand for services like his, particularly as the coronavirus fades into the distance and people reengage more actively in the physical world.</p>
<p>For his part, Lerner isn&#8217;t worried. He points to a generation that is far more comfortable watching video on a phone than elsewhere. He also notes that screen time has become &#8220;an isolating thing,&#8221; and predicts it will eventually become &#8220;an ideal time to hang out with your buddies,&#8221; akin to watching a game on the couch together.</p>
<p>There is a precedent, in his mind. &#8220;Over the last 20 years, games went from single player to multiplayer to voice chats showing up in games so people can actually hang out,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Because mobile is everywhere and social is fun, we think the same is going to happen to the rest of the media business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zog thinks the trends play in Giggl&#8217;s favor, too. &#8220;It&#8217;s obvious that people are going to meet up more often&#8221; as the pandemic winds down, he says. But all that real-world socializing &#8220;isn&#8217;t really going to be a substitute&#8221; for the kind of online socializing that&#8217;s already happening in so many corners of the internet.</p>
<p>Besides, he adds Giggl wants to &#8220;make it so that being together online is just as good as being together in real life. That&#8217;s the end goal here.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 9, 2021. We’ve made it to Friday, y’all, be proud. But we can’t relax just yet &#8212; there’s quite a lot to get through today. From deceitful auto companies now posing as tech companies to the current venture capital frenzy, we have it all. Let’s go! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/"><strong>Startups have never had it so good:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s our read of the Q2 2021 venture capital market. Records were smashed around the world, a record number of unicorns were born and valuations ticked up. If you are a founder considering raising capital, now is probably a good time to do so.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/biden-executive-order-tech-antitrust/"><strong>Biden takes on megacorps:</strong></a><strong> </strong>We jokingly call the public-company section of this newsletter Big Tech because, well, the most famous technology companies are freakin’ massive. And that has a lot of folks worried that some firms have become so large that they should be broken up to engender more competition. Tech companies disagree, naturally. Regardless, the noise from the U.S. government regarding goliath companies is starting to result in action.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/germanys-vc-industry-is-ready-to-take-off-but-bureaucrats-need-to-release-the-handbrake/">What’s ahead for European startups?</a></strong> We usually reserve these three slots for the biggest news of the day, but I wanted to share an essay written by a German venture capitalist about his country. The investor is bullish, but has two ideas regarding where the country could do better: employee stock options and regulations regarding spinoffs. It’s worth reading if you want to consider why some countries wind up with more active startup communities than others.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p><strong>First, key startup news:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/kurly-the-korean-grocery-startup-raises-200m-on-a-2-2b-valuation-after-shifting-ipo-plans-away-from-the-nyse/"><strong>Korean grocery startup Kurly raises $200M:</strong></a> The online grocer is now worth more than $2 billion. Even more, its plans for an IPO in the United States are kaput. Instead, the company will look to list locally in the future. Chop from the Didi mess or something else? Whatever the case, the company is one to keep an eye on.</li>
<li><strong>Today’s Tiger round? </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/brazilian-hr-startup-flash-raises-22m-in-a-tiger-global-led-series-b-round-of-funding/"><strong>Brazilian HR startup Flash:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The company just put together a $22 million Series B that the hyper-caffeinated venture capital group led. The São Paulo-based startup provides a new way to offer benefits in the country.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/temasek-and-warburg-pincus-invest-500-million-in-ola/"><strong>$500M more for Ola:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The ride-hailing market’s insatiable appetite for capital was fed another half-billion today with news that India’s Ola has raised new funds from “Temasek and an affiliate of Warburg Pincus,” per TechCrunch. Maybe the Didi fiasco is being viewed by investors as a one-off, at least when it comes to the world of on-demand rides.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second, from the venture capital side of the market:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/the-artemis-fund-focuses-on-women-founders-in-underserved-communities/">TechCrunch’s Ron Miller wrote a profile of The Artemis Fund</a></strong>, which is worth reading. The investing group, which was founded by women and often invests in women, has “ invested in 11 companies with plans to invest in 4-5 more [before raising its] the next fund.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/europes-dn-capital-launches-its-new-350m-fund-after-a-knock-out-year-for-its-portfolio/"><strong>DN Capital has raised a $350 million fund</strong></a> after several of the startups that it backed went public. The firm invests mostly in Europe as opposed to the U.K., a market where its partners say more U.S.-based venture capitalists show up.</li>
<li>Three venture capitalists banded together to write up some tips for robotics-focused startups. So, if you are building hardware that moves, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/5-fundraising-imperatives-for-robotics-startups/">this is for you.</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>3 analysts weigh in: What are Andy Jassy’s top priorities as Amazon’s new CEO?</h2>
<p>Now that he&#8217;s stepping away from AWS and taking over for Jeff Bezos, what are the biggest challenges facing incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy?</p>
<p>Enterprise reporter Ron Miller reached out to three analysts to get their take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robin Ody, Canalys</li>
<li>Sucharita Kodali, Forrester</li>
<li>Ed Anderson, Gartner</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon is listed second in the Fortune 500, but it&#8217;s not all sunshine and roses — maintaining growth, unionization, and the potential for antitrust regulation at home and abroad are just a few of his responsibilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the biggest to-do is to just continue that momentum that the company has had for the last several years.,&#8221; said Kodali. &#8220;He has to make sure that they don’t lose that. If he does that, I mean, he will win.”</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Wrapping up the newsy portion of today’s missive, two final entries. First, a dig into why the EU just fined a number of automakers. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/eu-fines-bmw-vw-1b-for-running-emissions-cartel-since-the-90s/">Rebecca reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As environmental issues really came of age in the 1990s, certain German automakers were meeting in secret groups to make sure their cars would continue to industriously contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. According to the European Union, Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, BMW and Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler have been illegally colluding to restrict competition in emission cleaning for new diesel passenger cars, essentially slowing the deployment of cleaner emissions tech.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, you can be very mad about that.</p>
<p>Finally, from the world of Facebook, good news for all you WhatsApp users out there. You will be able to select an option to send higher-quality images and videos, getting around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/whatsapp-is-adding-a-best-quality-setting-for-sending-photos-and-videos/">what TechCrunch called</a> the service’s “iffy image compression.” See, not all news is bad news!</p>

<p>Read one of the recommendations we’ve received below!</p>
<p><strong>Name of marketer: </strong>Nikita Vorobyev</p>
<p><strong>Name of recommender: </strong>Ruby Club</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation: </strong>“Nikita and his company, <a href="https://buildrbrand.com/">Buildrbrand</a>, have worked tirelessly to bring my idea to life and did everything in his power to get it to the level it is today. He and his team created a world-class conditional quiz visual experience that I think would be really cool for him to share with the industry. He doesn&#8217;t know I nominated him, but I definitely wanted to give back to him in any way I can since I believe his agency creates some of the best brands going viral online right now.”</p>
