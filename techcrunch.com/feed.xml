										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">African e-commerce giant Jumia today <a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/836376591/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Jumia-Q1.21-11.05.21.pdf">shared its earnings</a> for the first quarter of 2021 that ended in March</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While its customer count grew, a drop in the company&#8217;s revenues spoke to the fact that it is still reeling from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most areas in Africa where Jumia operates have lifted their lockdown restrictions, but some countries like Morocco and Kenya still have curfews</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia said while these measures didn&#8217;t lead to meaningful changes in consumer behavior, its supply and logistics chain &#8212; especially for its food delivery business JumiaFood &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was disrupted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia, which raised more than $570 million over the past six months to strengthen its balance sheet, posted first-quarter revenues of €27.4 million. This is a 6% drop from the €29.3 million that it reported in Q1 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its operating loss for Q1 2021 came to €33.7 million, while its more forgiving adjusted EBITDA loss stood at €27.0 million. The two numbers fell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 23% and 24%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the company continues its slow march toward profitability</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia has never turned a profit, but its co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec have made it clear in the past that the company wants that to change</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was also a point of reference in their investor comments today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our first-quarter results reflect solid progress towards profitability. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drivers remain consistent: selective and disciplined usage growth, gradual monetization, and continued cost discipline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first quarter of 2021 was the sixth consecutive quarter of positive gross profit after fulfillment expense, which reached €6.2 million, more than doubling year-over-year, while Adjusted EBITDA loss contracted by 24% year-over-year, reaching €27.0 million,” they said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to falling losses, Jumia had other positive metrics to share. The giant e-tailer saw its active customer base grow 7% year-over-year to 6.9 million. And orders also increased by 3% to 6.6 million, a reversal of the declining trend observed over the preceding two quarters. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the total worth of goods sold via Jumia this quarter (GMV) was just €165.0 million, a 13% decrease from the €189.6 million it recorded in Q1 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s gross profit also reached €20.4 million in 2020, representing a year-over-year gain of 11% from €18.4 million in Q1 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jumia narrows losses, as its payment service grows in financial results&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/jumia-narrows-losses-as-its-payment-service-grows-financial-results/embed/#?secret=gQ5ymEERA3" data-secret="gQ5ymEERA3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia cited two reasons for this drop. One was currency</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> devaluation of Nigeria&#8217;s naira, Egypt&#8217;s pound and Kenya&#8217;s shilling against the euro, the currency in which it reports</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the company, the trio dropped 15%, 9% and 19%, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the euro in Q1 2021. And second, the company&#8217;s best-performing product category (phones and electronics) did </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">poorly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Q1 2020, those items accounted for 45% of its GMV volume, which fell to 37% this quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JumiaPay, the payments arm of the company, continued to post modest growth. This time last year the product processed 2.3 million transactions worth €35.5 million. In Q1 2021, JumiaPay transactions rose 6.7%, to 2.4 million transactions on a year-on-year basis. The recent quarter&#8217;s total payment volume also grew 21% to €42.9 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the report, Jumia has broadened the capabilities of its payment product. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It now offers SMEs on the continent access to short-term credit by leveraging business and transactional data of its sellers to pre-score credit on an anonymized basis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company said it disbursed 380 loans in Q1 2021, up 90% from Q1 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These loans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were given</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to 291 sellers across its platform, representing a 62% increase from the number of sellers that accessed last year&#8217;s loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia reported €485.6 million of unrestricted cash at the end of the first quarter of 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes gross proceeds of about €205 million it secured from the offering completed on March 30, 2021, and €88 million cash booked in April 2021</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The tabletop gaming industry has exploded over the last few years as millions discovered or rediscovered its joys, but it too is evolving — and <a href="https://lastgameboard.com/">The Last Gameboard</a> hopes to be the venue for that evolution. The digital tabletop platform has progressed from crowdfunding to $4M seed round, and having partnered with some of the biggest names in the industry, plans to ship by the end of the year.</p>
<p>As the company&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Shail Mehta explained <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/tc-early-stage-pitch-off-the-last-gameboard/">in a TC Early Stage pitch-off earlier</a> this year, The Last Gameboard is a 16-inch square touchscreen device with a custom OS and a sophisticated method of tracking game pieces and hand movements. The idea is to provide a digital alternative to physical games where that&#8217;s practical, and do so with the maximum benefit and minimum compromise.</p>
<p>If the pitch sounds familiar&#8230; it&#8217;s been attempted once or twice before. I distinctly remember being impressed by the possibilities of D&amp;D on an original Microsoft Surface&#8230; <a href="https://vimeo.com/7132858">back in 2009</a>. And I played with another at PAX many years ago. Mehta said that until very recently there simply wasn&#8217;t the technology and market weren&#8217;t ready.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;People tried this before, but it was either way too expensive or they didn&#8217;t have the audience. And the tech just wasn&#8217;t there; they were missing that interaction piece,&#8221; she explained, and certainly any player will recognize that the, say, iPad version of a game definitely lacks physicality. The advance her company has achieved is in making the touchscreen able to detect not just taps and drags, but game pieces, gestures and movements above the screen, and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;What Gameboard does, no other existing touchscreen or tablet on the market can do — it&#8217;s not even close,&#8221; Mehta said. &#8220;We have unlimited touch, game pieces, passive and active&#8230; you can use your chess set at home, lift up and put down the pieces, we track it the whole time. We can do unique identifiers with tags and custom shapes. It&#8217;s the next step in how interactive surfaces can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s accomplished via a not particularly exotic method, which saves the Gameboard from the fate of the Surface and its successors, which cost several thousand dollars due to their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/05/microsofts-surface-garage-a-cross-department-development-team-with-pizza-and-beer/">unique and expensive makeups</a>. Mehta explained that they work strictly with ordinary capacitive touch data, albeit at a higher framerate than is commonly used, and then use machine learning to characterize and track object outlines. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t created a completely new mechanism, we&#8217;re just optimizing what&#8217;s available today,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150079" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameboard-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150079" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2150079" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameboard-2.jpg" alt="The Last Gameboard's interface, showing games available to play on the tablet's surface." width="1024" height="577" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameboard-2.jpg 1504w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameboard-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameboard-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameboard-2.jpg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameboard-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameboard-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2150079" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Last Gameboard</p></div></p>
<p>At $699 for the Gameboard it&#8217;s not exactly an impulse buy, either, but the fact of the matter is people spend a lot of money on gaming, with some titles running into multiple hundreds of dollars for all the expansions and pieces. Tabletop is now a more than $20 billion industry. If the experience is as good as they hope to make it, this is an investment many a player will not hesitate (much, anyway) to make.</p>
<p>Of course, the most robust set of gestures and features won&#8217;t matter if all they had on the platform were bargain-bin titles and grandpa&#8217;s-parlor favorites like <em>Parcheesi</em>. Fortunately The Last Gameboard has managed to stack up some of the most popular tabletop companies out there, and aims to have the definitive digital edition for their games.</p>
<p>Asmodee Digital is probably the biggest catch, having adapted many of today&#8217;s biggest hits, from modern classics <em>Catan</em> and <em>Carcassone</em> to crowdfunded breakout hit <em>Scythe</em> and immense dungeon-crawler <em>Gloomhaven</em>. The full list of partners right now includes Dire Wolf Digital, Nomad Games, Auroch Digital, Restoration Games, Steve Jackson Games, Knights of Unity, Skyship Studios, EncounterPlus, PlannarAlly, and Sugar Gamers, as well as individual creators and developers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150078" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/grab-board.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150078" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2150078" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/grab-board.gif" alt="Animation of two players grabbing dots on a screen and moving them around." width="800" height="588" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2150078" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Last Gameboard</p></div></p>
<p>These games may be best played in person, but have successfully transitioned to digital versions, and one imagines that a larger screen and inclusion of real pieces could make for an improved hybrid experience. There will be options both to purchase games individually, like you might on mobile or Steam, or to subscribe to an unlimited access model (pricing to be determined on both).</p>
<p>It would also be something that the many gaming shops and playing venues might want to have a couple of on hand. Testing out a game in-store and then buying a few to stock, or convincing consumers to do the same, could be a great sales tactic for all involved.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a unique and superior digital version of a game, the device can connect with others to trade moves, send game invites, and all that sort of thing. The whole OS, Mehta said, &#8220;is alive and real. If we didn&#8217;t own it and create it, this wouldn&#8217;t work.&#8221; This is more than a skin on top of Android with a built-in store, but there&#8217;s enough shared that Android-based ports will be able to be brought over with little fuss.</p>
<p>Head of content Lee Allentuck suggested that the last couple years (including the pandemic) have started to change game developers&#8217; and publishers&#8217; minds about the readiness of the industry for what&#8217;s next. &#8220;They see the digital crossover is going to happen — people are playing online board games now. If you can be part of that new trend at the very beginning, it gives you a big opportunity,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Allentuck, who previously worked at Hasbro, said there&#8217;s widespread interest in the toy and tabletop industry to be more tech-forward, but there&#8217;s been a &#8220;chicken and egg scenario,&#8221; where there&#8217;s no market because no one innovates, and no one innovates because there&#8217;s no market. Fortunately things have progressed to the point where a company like The Last Gameboard can raise $4M series A to help cover the cost of creating that market.</p>
<p>The round was led by TheVentureCity, with participation from SOSV, Riot Games, Conscience VC, Corner3 VC, and others. While the company didn&#8217;t go through HAX, SOSV&#8217;s involvement has that HAX-y air, and partner Garrett Winther gives a glowing recommendation of its approach: &#8220;They are the first to effectively tie collaborative physical and digital gameplay together while not losing the community, storytelling or competitive foundations that we all look for in gaming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mehta noted that the pandemic nearly cooked the company by derailing their funding, which was originally supposed to come through around this time last year when everything went pear-shaped. &#8220;We had our functioning prototype, we had filed for a patent, we got the traction, we were gonna raise, everything was great&#8230; and then COVID hit,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;But we got a lot of time to do R&amp;D, which was actually kind of a blessing. Our team was super small so we didn&#8217;t have to lay anyone off — we just went into survival mode for like six months and optimized, developed the platform. 2020 was rough for everyone, but we were able to focus on the core product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the company is poised to start its beta program over the summer and (following feedback from that) ship its first production units before the holiday season when purchases like this one seem to make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>(This article originally referred to this raise as The Last Gameboard&#8217;s round A — it&#8217;s actually the seed. This has been updated.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[SPACs are desperate and asset prices are high as media recovers some and digital ad sales spike. SPAC now or forever hold your peace. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sorry for all the SPAC coverage today, but a host of richly valued private companies that have an ocean of venture capital funds under their belt are going public. We have to pay attention.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/digging-into-digital-mortgage-lender-better-coms-huge-spac/">TechCrunch covered</a> the brand-new Better.com SPAC deal that will take the digital mortgage provider public. But it was hardly the only company working to combine with a blank-check company that demanded our attention today. There are a few media companies looking to do the same: Vice and the previously named Bustle.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that we&#8217;re discussing SPAC deals for media companies at all because a few days ago, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/08/digital-media-companies-slow-public-rush-as-spac-market-cools.html">CNBC reported</a> that such efforts had come into doubt, noting that the recent SPAC slowdown had led to &#8220;digital media companies [reassessing] their timeline on going public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Writing this to you as someone currently being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">spat out from a phone company</a> into the hands of private equity, I was not terribly surprised that companies in my business were not enjoying the warmest of public receptions. After all, we&#8217;d seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/kaltura-puts-debut-on-hold-is-the-tech-ipo-window-closing/">some software companies delay their IPOs</a> in recent weeks &#8212; though those efforts are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/as-q2s-lull-fades-unicorn-ipos-are-revving-up/">now back on, largely</a> &#8212; so to see the ever-less-attractive media concerns of the unicorn realm hold off on their offerings simply didn&#8217;t shock. Especially as <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/spac-ipos-fall-out-of-favor-after-hot-streak-nikola-lordstown-51619198468">SPAC stocks have taken a hammering</a>.</p>
<p>And then, today.</p>
<p>Earlier this morning, <a href="https://www.axios.com/bustle-rebrand-bdg-ipo-c9fcf2f2-47e9-4375-830a-1af142b40045.html">Axios reported</a> that Bustle, now BDG, still intends to pursue a SPAC-led public debut later this year. Per our friends over at Big Bullet Point, Bustle is not disputing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bustle-m-a/bustle-digital-hires-bank-to-explore-deal-to-go-public-source-idUSKBN29C33T">reports</a> that it is targeting a valuation of around $600 million. Sure, that&#8217;s the value of a single, late-stage fintech investing round, but for the media world, it&#8217;s not an exit to mock.</p>
<p>And yesterday, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/vice-media-targets-valuation-of-nearly-3-billion-in-proposed-spac-deal-11620644403">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> that Vice Media Group is also moving ahead with a SPAC-led combination with 7GC &amp; Co Holdings, a blank-check company that <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/74375/7GC-and-Co.-Holdings-a-SPAC-formed-by-7GC-and-Hennessy-Capital-prices-upsiz">priced</a> back in December 2020.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on? A few things, we reckon: The market is more risk-on than you&#8217;ve been led to believe; SPACs are still hunting for deals as their countdown timers tick; record asset prices more generally; and, finally, a booming advertising market coupled with rising belief in consumer-media subscriptions. For an industry that has been a reported venture-backed letdown in recent years &#8212; see this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/with-cuts-at-vice-quartz-buzzfeed-even-medias-savviest-digital-players-are-hurting/2020/05/19/f15d3dde-96e9-11ea-91d7-cf4423d47683_story.html">from 2020</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/business/media/buzzfeed-layoffs.html">this from 2019</a>, <a href="https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/vox-media-layoffs-50-employees-1202706362/">2018</a>, and so on &#8212; it could be just about as good a moment as any to get out the door.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Taking media public</h2>
<p>There are actually three media companies that could be going public via a SPAC, with Buzzfeed part of the crew alongside BDG and Vice, again <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/08/digital-media-companies-slow-public-rush-as-spac-market-cools.html">per CNBC</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll dig into each company&#8217;s known venture capital and revenue results shortly. But first, the market. <em>Why</em> are we still seeing media companies pursue SPAC-led debuts now? Here&#8217;s a breakdown of our market view:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber and Lyft will provide free rides to any user traveling to get the COVID-19 vaccine through an agreement reached with the White House.</p>
<p>The free rides will last through July 4, the date when President Joe Biden wants 70% of U.S. adults to be vaccinated,<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-lyft-to-provide-free-rides-to-covid-19-vaccine-sites-until-july-4-11620745200?mod=e2tw"> according to the WSJ</a>, which was the first to report on the partnership between the ride-hailing companies and the White House.</p>
<p>Lyft and Uber separately told TechCrunch the companies will cover the costs of the free rides. The White House will help advise on the product and how it is rolled out as well as share data on the more than 80,000 vaccination sites in the country, an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Uber didn&#8217;t provide a specific launch date for the program, only noting that it is expected to become available in the coming weeks. Lyft riders will be able to get a free ride code beginning May 24 via the app or website.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vaccines are our best hope to beat this pandemic and soon everyone in America will be able to take a free Uber to get their shot,&#8221; Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement. &#8220;We are honored to deepen our previous global commitments, and partner with the White House and Lyft to provide free rides to vaccination sites across the US. This is a proud moment for me, for Uber, and for our country. More and more Americans continue to get vaccinated every day &#8212; let&#8217;s keep moving forward, together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uber hasn&#8217;t released further details about how its program will work. Lyft said its ride codes will cover $15 each way and noted that based on previous rides given to vaccination sites, the company expects that figure will cover most, if not all, fares. Ride codes can be used for Lyft ride-hailing, bike or scooter rides during standard pharmacy operating hours of 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vaccine is the key to getting us all moving again, and we&#8217;re proud to do our part to move the country forward,&#8221; John Zimmer, co-founder and president of Lyft, said in a statement. &#8220;We&#8217;ve always believed transportation has the power to improve people&#8217;s lives, and this initiative makes that truer than ever. Helping more Americans get vaccinated helps the Lyft community of drivers and riders, and we&#8217;re grateful to the Biden Administration for prioritizing access.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement builds off of efforts by Lyft and Uber to provide free and discounted rides to underserved communities as well as roll out features to make it easier to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/uber-and-moderna-partner-on-covid-19-vaccine-access-and-information/">access vaccine information</a> and point-of-distribution sites. Uber first rolled out a COVID-relief program in March to offer free rides and deliveries. In December, the company said it would give an additional 10 million free or discounted rides.</p>
<p>Last month, Uber said it was launching more than a half-dozen new features, including one that will let users book vaccine appointments at Walgreens and reserve a ride to get their jab.</p>
<p>Lyft kicked off in December a <a href="https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/lyft-launches-vaccine-access-campaign">universal vaccine access campaign</a>, a coalition of partners that includes JPMorgan Chase, Anthem and United Way, to provide 60 million rides to and from vaccination sites for low-income, uninsured, and at-risk communities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer credit reporting agency TransUnion recently announced it had invested an undisclosed sum in Spring Labs, which is building out a blockchain-based data-sharing platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, TechCrunch has exclusive details on the size of that round and the nature of the relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First off, the fact that <a href="https://www.transunion.com/">TransUnion</a>, a public company with a $20 billion market cap, chose to back and partner with four-year-old <a href="https://www.springlabs.com/">Spring Labs</a> is significant in and of itself. A number of fintechs have popped up as of late aiming to disrupt the traditional model of evaluating an individual’s creditworthiness.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring Labs is one of them. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he startup uses blockchain with the aim of creating a richer network effect of data that allows credit bureaus and others to predict the creditworthiness of people who are not in the traditional credit bureau system. It’s raising a $30 million Series B, led by TransUnion &#8212; one of the largest incumbents in an industry that Spring Labs is looking to shake up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring Labs founder and CEO Adam Jiwan told TechCrunch that the two companies’ recent partnership evolved out of a series of discussions that began a couple of years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We knew a relationship with TransUnion in particular had the capacity to significantly accelerate our business,” he said. “And they said ‘if we’re going to help develop your business into something very significant, we’d like to have skin in the game.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Jiwan would not reveal the valuation at which this Series B is being raised (it actually hasn’t officially closed yet, although the majority of the round has been funded), he did say it’s a “meaningful step up” from the </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spring-labs-closes-23-million-series-a-investment-round-to-transform-how-financial-institutions-share-information-300865496.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$23 million Series A </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">it raised in June 2019. GreatPoint Ventures and August Capital, among other existing investors, are participating in the Series B round as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe we&#8217;ve built a fundamentally better mousetrap for the exchange of sensitive information, as well as a series of products and services that allow lenders and others to ideally make better identity verification, fraud prevention and underwriting decisions,” Jiwan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring Labs is hoping to “revolutionize” the way consumer financial data is stored and shared among financial services institutions with a network foundation known as the Spring Protocol. The information exchange promises to preserve privacy, giving competitive parties the ability to “collaborate for the common good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnering with TransUnion will give Spring Labs the ability to leverage the company’s sales force (four versus 100) and access over 10,000 of its financial institution customers contractually, according to Jiwan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They see a lot of opportunities to leverage our technology,” he said. “They view it as something that can really unlock siloed data and bring new information that moves the needle on things like financial inclusion. We’re exploring standing up unique information sharing networks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said there is also interest in how Spring Labs’ technology can be used to bridge the digital asset world and the regulated financial ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the funding, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve Chaouki, president of U.S. Markets at TransUnion, is taking a seat on Spring Labs’ board. Brian Brooks, former head of the OCC and ex-Coinbase counsel, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/blockchain-and-taking-the-politics-out-of-tech/">recently joined the company</a> as its first independent director.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Blockchain and taking the politics out of tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/blockchain-and-taking-the-politics-out-of-tech/embed/#?secret=qtLdSWRdb8" data-secret="qtLdSWRdb8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaouki told TechCrunch that there were “many” reasons for working strategically with, and investing in, Spring Labs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The financial aspect is important but strategically, the amount of time we intend to spend working with them is even more of a valuable asset,” he said. “This is a pretty big move for us. We’re not a PE firm. If we’re making an investment, it’s to build something collaboratively with the partners who we’re investing in.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marko Ivanov, a TransUnion vice president, said the credit reporting giant was impressed with the “real-life applications” that Spring Labs has demonstrated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to collaborate to scale up their existing networks, and sign up more clients in the network, which is important to resolve those issues related to fraud,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re also really excited about collaborating with them to build new networks, and taking the protocol they’ve built so companies can share information anonymously or protect consumer privacy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TransUnion sees a number of use cases beyond fraud, namely “any kind of risk-related use case,” according to Ivanov.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than attempt to build out the technology itself, TransUnion recognizes the value of investing in a company that’s already built out technology capabilities in spaces in which it has not yet invested as much, according to Chaouki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have way more ideas than we have capacity to serve the market,” he said. “It’s not easy to just ramp up capacity. Investing in companies like Spring Labs helps us move into adjacent spaces we want to play.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube is giving <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">its TikTok competitor, YouTube Shorts</a>, an injection of cash to help it better compete with rivals. The company today introduced the YouTube Shorts Fund, a $100 million fund that will pay YouTube Shorts creators for their most viewed and most engaging content over the course of 2021 and 2022. Creators can&#8217;t apply for the fund to help with content production, however. Instead, YouTube will reach out to creators each month whose videos exceeded certain milestones to reward them for their contributions.</p>
<p>The company expects to dole out money to &#8220;thousands&#8221; of creators every month, it says. And these creators don&#8217;t need to be in the YouTube Partner Program to qualify &#8212; anyone is eligible to receive rewards by creating original content for YouTube Shorts.</p>
<p>YouTube declined to share more specific details about the fund&#8217;s operations at this time, including how creators will be vetted or what specific thresholds for receiving payments YouTube has in mind. It also wouldn&#8217;t offer details as to whether YouTube creators could receive multiple payments in the same pay period if they had several videos that would qualify, or any other details.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And while the company stressed that only &#8220;original&#8221; content would gain rewards, it didn&#8217;t clarify how it will go about checking to ensure the content isn&#8217;t already uploaded on another platform, like Reels, Snapchat, or TikTok.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126699" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126699" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126699" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png 2166w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png?resize=1535,2048 1535w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Player-3_4.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126699" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>Instead, YouTube said that more details about the payments and qualifications would be available closer to the fund&#8217;s launch, which is expected sometime in the next few months. It pointed out also that it has paid out over $30 billion to creators, artists and media companies over the last three years, and it expects the new fund will help it to build a long-term monetization model for Shorts on YouTube going forward.</p>
<p>YouTube isn&#8217;t the only platform to take on the threat of TikTok by throwing cash at the problem.</p>
<p>Snapchat has been paying <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/20/snapchat-paying-1-million-a-day-to-video-creators.html">$1 million per day to creators</a> for their top-performing videos on Spotlight, its own TikTok clone, minting several millionaires in the process. Facebook-owned Instagram, meanwhile, made lucrative offers to top TikTok stars to use its new service, Reels, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-to-reel-in-tiktok-creators-raising-stakes-in-social-media-rivalry-11595928600">The WSJ reported</a> last year.</p>
<p>Despite the size of these efforts, TikTok&#8217;s own Creator Fund remains a competitive force. It <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-the-200-million-tiktok-creator-fund/">announced</a> its fund would grow to over $1 billion in the U.S. in the next three years and would be more than double that on a global basis. This March, it also <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-the-200-million-tiktok-creator-fund/">added</a> another requirement to receiving the fund&#8217;s payments, including having at least 100K authentic views in the last 30 days &#8212; a signal that it&#8217;s setting the bar even higher, given its current success.</p>
<p>Alongside the debut of YouTube&#8217;s Shorts Fund, the company also noted it&#8217;s expanding its Shorts player feature across more place on YouTube to help viewers discover this short-form video content, will begin testing ads for Shorts, and will be rolling out the new &#8220;remix audio&#8221; feature to all Shorts creators.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126698" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126698" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126698" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png 2166w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=1535,2048 1535w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126698" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>This somewhat controversial feature allows Shorts creators to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10343433?hl=en#yt_desktop_shorts_rmx">sample sounds</a> from other YouTube videos for use in their Shorts, instead of only using song clips or original audio. Some YouTube creators were <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/youtube-allows-videos-to-be-sampled/405710/">surprised</a> to find the feature was opt-out by default &#8212; meaning their content could be used on YouTube Shorts unless they took the time to turn this setting off or removed their video from YouTube.</p>
<p>Since its launch, YouTube has also rolled out other features to Shorts, including support for captions, the ability to record up to 60 seconds with the Shorts camera, the ability to add clips from your phone&#8217;s gallery to your recordings made with the Shorts camera, and the ability use basic filters to color correct videos. YouTube says more effects will arrive in the future.</p>
<p>But even as YouTube tries to catch up with TikTok on feature sets, TikTok has been expanding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/as-competition-heats-up-tiktok-announces-six-new-interactive-music-effects-for-creators/">its own effects lineup</a> and becoming more YouTube-like by supporting longer videos. Some TikTok creators, for example, <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1334125358103277575">have recently been given the ability</a> to record videos 3 minutes in lengths, instead of just 60 seconds.</p>
<p>YouTube says the new fund will roll out in the coming months and it will listen to the feedback from the creator community to develop a long-term program designed for YouTube Shorts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Long before Covid-19 precipitated &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; across the world of work, customer services and support was built to run online and virtually. Yet it too is undergoing an evolution supercharged by technology.</p>
<p>Today, a startup called <a href="https://sightcall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SightCall</a>, which has built an augmented reality platform to help field service teams, the companies they work for, and their customers carry out technical and mechanical maintenance or repairs more effectively, is announcing $42 million in funding, money that it plans to use to invest in its tech stack with more artificial intelligence tools and expanding its client base.</p>
<p>The core of its service, explained CEO and co-founder Thomas Cottereau, is AR technology (which comes embedded in their apps or the service apps its customers use, with integrations into other standard software used in customer service environments including Microsoft, SAP, Salesforce and ServiceNow). The augmented reality experience overlays additional information, pointers and other tools over the video stream.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is used by, say, field service engineers coordinating with central offices when servicing equipment; or by manufacturers to provide better assistance to customers in emergencies or situations where something is not working but might be repaired quicker by the customers themselves rather than engineers that have to be called out; or indeed by call centers, aided by AI, to diagnose whatever the problem might be. It&#8217;s a big leap ahead for scenarios that previously relied on work orders, hastily drawn diagrams, instruction manuals, and voice-based descriptions to progress the work in question.</p>
<p>&#8220;We like to say that we break the barriers that exist between a field service organization and its customer,&#8221; Cottereau said.</p>
<p>The tech, meanwhile, is unique to SightCall, built over years and designed to be used by way of a basic smartphone, and over even a basic mobile network &#8212; essential in cases where reception is bad or the locations are remote. (More on how it works below.)</p>
<p>Originally founded in Paris, France before relocating to San Francisco, SightCall has already built up a sizable business across a pretty wide range of verticals, including insurance, telecoms, transportation, telehealth, manufacturing, utilities, and life sciences/medical devices.</p>
<p>SightCall has some 200 big-name enterprise customers on its books, including the likes of Kraft-Heinz, Allianz, GE Healthcare and Lincoln Motor Company, providing services on a B2B basis as well as for teams that are out in the field working for consumer customers, too. After seeing 100% year-over-year growth in annual recurring revenue in 2019 and 2020, SightCall&#8217;s CEO says it&#8217;s looking like it will hit that rate this year as well, with a goal of $100 million in annual recurring revenue.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by InfraVia, a European private equity firm, with Bpifrance also participating. The valuation of this round is not being disclosed, but I should point out that an investor told me that <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/52338-88/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook&#8217;s estimate</a> of $122 million post-money is not accurate (we&#8217;re still digging on this and will update as and when we learn more).</p>
<p>For some further context on this investment, InfraVia invests in a <a href="https://infraviacapital.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of industrial businesses</a>, alongside investments in tech companies building services related to them such as recent investments in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/jobandtalent-takes-120m-from-softbank-to-enter-the-us-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jobandtalent</a>, so this is in part a strategic investment. SightCall has raised $67 million to date.</p>
<p>There has been an interesting wave of startups emerging in recent years building out the tech stack used by people working in the front lines and in the field, a shift after years of knowledge workers getting most of the attention from startups building a new generation of apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/workiz-locks-in-13m-for-productivity-tools-aimed-at-home-services-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workiz</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/jobber-raises-60m-as-its-platform-for-home-service-professionals-hits-100k-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jobber</a> are building platforms for small business tradespeople to book jobs and manage them once they&#8217;re on the books; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/bigchange-raises-102m-for-a-platform-to-help-manage-service-fleets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BigChange</a> helps manage bigger fleets; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/hover-secures-60m-for-a-3d-imaging-platform-used-to-assess-and-fix-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hover</a> has built a platform for builders to be able to assess and estimate costs for work by using AI to analyze images captured by their or their would-be customers&#8217; smartphone cameras.</p>
<p>And there is <a href="https://www.streem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Streem</a>, which I discovered is a close enough competitor to SightCall that they&#8217;ve acquired Adwords ads based on SightCall searches in Google. Just ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic breaking wide open, General Catalyst-backed Streem was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191205005459/en/Frontdoor-Acquires-Streem-a-Leader-in-Advanced-Technology-to-Transform-the-Service-Experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Frontdoor</a> to help with the latter&#8217;s efforts to build out its home services business, another sign of how all of this is leaping ahead.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting in part about SightCall and sets it apart is its technology. Co-founded in 2007 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tcottereau/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cottereau</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoine-vervoort-37308925/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Antoine Vervoort</a> (currently SVP of product and engineering), the two are both long-time telecoms industry vets who had both worked on the technical side of building next-generation networks.</p>
<p>SightCall first started life as a company called Weemo that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/19/weemo-brings-its-webrtc-powered-video-chat-solution-to-ios-android-and-phonegap-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built video chat services</a> that could run on WebRTC-based frameworks, which emerged at a time when we were seeing a wider effort to bring more rich media services into mobile web and SMS apps. For consumers and to a large extent businesses, mobile phone apps that work &#8216;over the top&#8217; (distributed not by your mobile network carrier but the companies that run your phone&#8217;s operating system, and thus partly controlled by them) really took the lead and continue to dominate the market for messaging and innovations in messaging.</p>
<p>After a time, <a href="https://sightcall.com/weemo-changes-name-sightcall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weemo pivoted</a> and renamed itself as SightCall, focusing on packaging the tech that it built into whichever app (native or mobile web) where one of its enterprise customers wanted the tech to live.</p>
<p>The key to how it works comes by way of how SightCall was built, Cottereau explained. The company has spent ten years building and optimizing a network across data centers close to where its customers are, which interconnects with Tier 1 telecoms carriers and has a lot of latency in the system to ensure uptime. &#8220;We work with companies where this connectivity is mission critical,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The video solution has to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he describes it, the hybrid system SightCall has built incorporates its own IP that works both with telecoms hardware and software, resulting in a video service that provides 10 different ways for streaming video and a system that automatically chooses the best in a particular environment, based on where you are, so that even if mobile data or broadband reception don&#8217;t work, video streaming will. &#8220;Telecoms and software are still very separate worlds,&#8221; Cottereau said. &#8220;They still don&#8217;t speak the same language, and so that is part of our secret sauce, a global roaming mechanism.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tech that the startup has built to date not only has given it a firm grounding against others who might be looking to build in this space, but has led to strong traction with customers. The next steps will be to continue building out that technology to tap deeper into the automation that is being adopted across the industries that already use SightCall&#8217;s technology.</p>
<p>“SightCall pioneered the market for AR-powered visual assistance, and they’re in the best position to drive the digital transformation of remote service,” said Alban Wyniecki, partner at InfraVia Capital Partners, in a statement. “As a global leader, they can now expand their capabilities, making their interactions more intelligent and also bringing more automation to help humans work at their best.”</p>
<p>“SightCall’s $42M Series B marks the largest funding round yet in this sector, and SightCall emerges as the undisputed leader in capital, R&amp;D resources and partnerships with leading technology companies enabling its solutions to be embedded into complex enterprise IT,” added Antoine Izsak of Bpifrance. “Businesses are looking for solutions like SightCall to enable customer-centricity at a greater scale while augmenting technicians with knowledge and expertise that unlocks efficiencies and drives continuous performance and profit.”</p>
<p>Cottereau said that the company has had a number of acquisition offers over the years &#8212; not a surprise when you consider the foundational technology it has built for how to architect video networks across different carriers and data centers that work even in the most unreliable of network environments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to stay independent, though,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I see a huge market here, and I want us to continue the story and lead it. Plus, I can see a way where we can stay independent and continue to work with everyone.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This year, the whole notion of how we work and where we work is going to change yet again.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic forced many employees <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/06/what-to-consider-when-employees-need-to-start-working-remotely/">to begin working from home</a>, and, in doing so, may have changed the way we think about work. While some businesses have slowly returned to the office, depending on where you live and what you do, many information workers remain at home.</p>
<p>That could change in the coming months as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/30/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases">more people get vaccinated</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/covid-cases-dropping/2021/04/30/0f0bb988-a845-11eb-bca5-048b2759a489_story.html">infection rate begins to drop</a> in the U.S.</p>
<p>As that happens, it is likely that more offices will reopen. We&#8217;ve already heard from major employers like Salesforce, which indicated it will be allowing <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/global-return-to-the-office-the-salesforce-approach/">a percentage of its workforce back to the office</a> this month, starting with the company&#8217;s San Francisco headquarters. The CRM giant plans to move slow and follow the government&#8217;s lead, allowing 20% capacity at first and hoping to build to 70% over time.</p>
<p>Most companies aren&#8217;t the size of Salesforce, which boasts a worldwide workforce of more than 50,000 employees. These smaller companies often don&#8217;t control entire skyscrapers, as Salesforce does in San Francisco. That creates complicating factors, including managing people who aren&#8217;t willing to be vaccinated, dealing with social distancing and masking, and sharing buildings or floors with other companies.</p>
<p>Even more, many companies have discovered that their employees work just fine at home. And some workers don&#8217;t want to waste time stuck on congested highways or public transportation now that they&#8217;ve learned to work remotely. But other employees suffered in small spaces or with constant interruptions from family. Those folks may long to go back to the office.</p>
<p>On balance, it seems clear that whatever happens, for many companies, we probably aren&#8217;t going back whole-cloth to the prior model of commuting into the office five days a week.</p>
<p>Last August, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/amid-pandemic-returning-to-offices-remains-an-open-question-for-tech-leaders/">we spoke to a number of tech company executives</a> about what returning to the office could look like. We recently went back to most of those same executives, as well as a Rhode Island state official and a medical expert we spoke to then to revisit the idea and talk about what&#8217;s changed and what work could look like as move slowly toward the post-pandemic era.</p>
<h2>The office will never be the same</h2>
<p>While their approaches vary, all of the executives I spoke to said that they foresee adopting a hybrid model when they can return in earnest, although there were definitely different interpretations of what that means, and what the office structure will look like.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a>, the continuous delivery pioneer, announced a $100 million Series F today on a $1.7 billion valuation. At the same time, the company announced it has acquired <a href="http://vamp.io">Vamp</a>, a release orchestration startup that should fit nicely in the CircleCI platform. The companies did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>The funding was led by Greenspring Associates with participation from Eleven Prime, IVP, Sapphire Ventures, Top Tier Capital Partners, Baseline Ventures, Threshold, Scale, Owl Rock and Next Equity Partners. Today&#8217;s round comes a little over a year since the late stage startup announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/continuous-delivery-pioneer-circleci-scores-100m-series-e/">a $100 million Series E</a>, and brings the total raised to over $315 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>CircleCI CEO Jim Rose says part of the reason for taking on $200 million in two years is because even though the company was founded in 2011, the continuous delivery approach is still really just getting started.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe in the development space that it&#8217;s really early days [&#8230;] and there&#8217;s so much potential growth in front of us, and so many opportunities to create centers of gravity in the development space [&#8230;] and we expect to to be one of those [key companies], and we are doing everything we can from an investment perspective and from an operations perspective to make sure that we fulfill that vision,&#8221; Rose told me.</p>

<p>Like so many kinds of automation, Rose says that he has seen things accelerate during the pandemic as software development teams look for ways to eliminate manual processes as they moved to work from home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once everyone got pushed remotely they realized, holy moly, we need to automate more and more of this process because that&#8217;s the only way that we can actually deliver things, but it&#8217;s also the way that we can build a system that&#8217;s resilient to these kinds of shocks,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As for the acquisition, acquiring Vamp takes care of what happens after the application gets deployed, and that fills in a big missing piece in the product map.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just great opportunity to not just for us to accelerate roadmap, and just sort of accelerate the addition of this kind of solidification from a first class perspective on our platform, but it was also a great way for the Vamp team to continue to realize their vision, to continue to invest in this problem that they&#8217;ve been focused on for awhile, and we can learn from it,&#8221; Rose said.</p>
<p>Vamp launched in 2013 in Amsterdam and raised around €3 million, according to Crunchbase data. Vamp CEO Nico Vierhout sees a natural fit between the two companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have worked hard over the last eight years to build a platform that makes software releases self-driving and self-healing for users. Joining CircleCI was an organic fit that will provide enhanced visibility and control for developers to build software in a more streamlined way,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The 15 member Vamp team will be joining CircleCI and continuing to support the product, even as the functionality gets folded into the broader platform. CircleCI now has over 550 employees, a number that has doubled since last year.</p>
<p>While a Series F with a fat valuation sometimes signals the end of the private fundraising cycle, Rose wasn&#8217;t quite ready to talk IPO just yet, even while acknowledging his investors would want to cash out at some point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously investors are going to expect liquidity at some point, but we are less focused on what the next kind of funding event, or what the next kind of company event in that transition will be and more focused on figuring out how to stay close to the customer and what&#8217;s necessary to build this out. The rest of it kind of takes care of itself,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.builtbysnowman.com/">Snowman</a>, the small studio behind award-winning iOS games Alto&#8217;s Adventure, Alto&#8217;s Odyssey, Skate City, and <a href="https://www.builtbysnowman.com/">others</a>, is spinning out a new company, <a href="https://playpokpok.com/">Pok Pok</a>, that will focus on educational children&#8217;s entertainment. Later this month, Pok Pok will debut its first title, <a href="https://playpokpok.com/">Pok Pok Playroom,</a> aimed at inspiring creative thinking through play for the preschool crowd.</p>
<p>The launch takes Snowman back to its roots as an app maker, not a games studio.</p>
<p>In fact, the company&#8217;s first iOS app, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/17/checkmark-brings-better-geofenced-reminders-to-iphone-mac-version-in-the-works/">Checkmark</a>, had been in the productivity space, offering location-based reminders to iPhone users. But Snowman later shifted to making games, tapping into the demand for mobile games with early launches like Circles and Super Squares. But it wasn&#8217;t until Alto&#8217;s Adventure came out that Snowman really kicked off its foray into gaming.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve never really considered Snowman to be a video game studio,&#8221; explains Snowman co-founder and Creative Director Ryan Cash. &#8220;A lot of people would assume that because it&#8217;s really all that we&#8217;re known for at the moment. It&#8217;s kind of our core business. But we like to think of ourselves more as like a team of tinkerers who like working on creative stuff. And for now, it happens to be video games, but you never know kind of what might be around the corner,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>Pok Pok actually emerged from Snowman&#8217;s culture of tinkering.</p>
<p>Snowman employees <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathijs-demaeght-172b4930/">Mathijs Demaeght</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/esther-huybreghts-3391b8209/">Esther Huybreghts</a>, now Pok Pok Design Director and Creative Director, respectively, went looking for an app to entertain their young son James when he was a toddler. They soon found that there weren&#8217;t many options that fit what they had been hoping to find.</p>
<p>They had wanted something that wouldn&#8217;t rile him up, something that wasn&#8217;t too technical, and something that wasn&#8217;t gamified, Esther explains.</p>
<p>When they later had their second son Jack, they decided to just built the app they wanted for themselves. After showing a rough prototype to Ryan, he saw the potential and told them to run with it.</p>
<p>Ryan&#8217;s sister, Melissa Cash, whose background was in developing products at Disney for babies and toddlers, had been helping with the Alto&#8217;s Odyssey launch at the time. When she saw what Esther and Mathijs were working on, she was impressed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150427" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150427" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2150427" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/iPad-RedBG-Town.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/iPad-RedBG-Town.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/iPad-RedBG-Town.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/iPad-RedBG-Town.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/iPad-RedBG-Town.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/iPad-RedBG-Town.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/iPad-RedBG-Town.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/iPad-RedBG-Town.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2150427" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snowman</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve worked in the kid space for five years, and I&#8217;ve never seen anything that&#8217;s even remotely like this. And then, I just knew this is what I wanted to work on for the next 20 years,&#8221; she says. Melissa became involved with the project and is now CEO of the Pok Pok spinout.</p>
<p>Although legally a distinctive entity, Pok Pok remains closely tied to Snowman.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been incubating the company within Snowman. We moved desks to a corner and we all work together as mentor, colleagues, and collaborate as a group,&#8221; Melissa notes. Ryan is still involved, as well. &#8220;Ryan is everything &#8212; our advisor, our helper &#8212; we haven&#8217;t even come up with a title for him,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>Today, the Pok Pok team is six full-time employees, but works with contractors and educators on its projects. Snowman, meanwhile, is over 20 people, mostly in Toronto. However, some Snowman employees spend 30% to 50% of their time on Pok Pok, Ryan says.</p>
<p>For the time being, Pok Pok is self-funded thanks to Snowman&#8217;s success on other fronts, which not only includes the Alto&#8217;s series, but also Apple Arcade&#8217;s Where Cards Fall and Skate City, both of which are now expanding to PC and console. The company is also working on <a href="http://playdistant.com/">DISTANT</a>, a collaboration with Slingshot and Satchel.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/T68_cEL_wvI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://playpokpok.com/">Pok Pok Playroom</a>, which is aimed at kids ages 2 to 6, will be the first title to go live from Pok Pok, arriving on May 20th. The app itself will initially contain six &#8220;digital toys,&#8221; so to speak, which encourage kids to creatively play. These toys also grow with the child as they age up.</p>
<p>For example, a stacking blocks toy could appeal to toddlers who just want to move the shapes around, but an older child might build a town with them. A drawing toy can encourage scribbles at younger ages or become a real canvas for art when the child is older. There&#8217;s also a calming toy called &#8220;musical blobs&#8221; that&#8217;s sort of like a lava lamp with differently-shaped that bounce around and respond to touches.</p>
<p>All the toys are designed to be open-ended &#8212; there&#8217;s no right or wrong way to use them. And Pok Pok Playroom is not a game. There are no levels to beat or objectives to achieve. There&#8217;s nothing to buy.</p>
<p>What is different about Pok Pok Playroom, compared with games and &#8220;digital toys&#8221; from rivals like Toca Boca, for example, is that it&#8217;s designed to be more educational and realistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We take a more educational approach, and we still plan to do that for future apps and for whatever Pok Pok Playroom will grow into after launch,&#8221; says Esther. &#8220;For example, we have no unicorns or no wizards in Pok Pok Playroom. Everything is grounded in reality. I think we want to explore with children what the world looks like and how it works. We have tons of ideas for taking a more education-based approach for all the children, as well, that isn&#8217;t necessarily the ABCs, 1,2,3&#8217;s pedagogical, so to speak.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150426" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150426" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2150426" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Drawing.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Drawing.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Drawing.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Drawing.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Drawing.png?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Drawing.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Drawing.png?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Drawing.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2150426" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snowman</p></div></p>
<p>Pok Pok also won&#8217;t use talking animals or fantasy characters in order to avoid the subject of diversity. Instead, its apps will features all races, all genders, all family constructs, all different sorts of abilities and disabilities, as they&#8217;re built.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s very important to us to have kids be able to recognize themselves, and family members and friends in the app,&#8221; says Esther. &#8220;It&#8217;s really important to our entire team that everyone feels respected in who they are and what their family looks like, and&#8230; I think that&#8217;s still really lacking in the kid space right now. We want to be the front-runner there,&#8221; she notes.</p>
<p>The new app, which has been in development for nearly three years, will be priced on a subscription basis with more &#8220;digital toys&#8221; added over time.</p>
<p>Though Pok Pok will aim more at the preschool crowd, the company envisions a future where it designs creative projects for the next age group up and for other types of learning.</p>
<p>Pok Pok Playroom has been beta tested with around 250 families ahead of its launch.</p>
<p>It will be available on iPhone and iPad starting on May 20th at 9 AM ET, with a 14-day free trial. It will then be priced at $3.99 per month or $29.99 per year, and will not feature in-app purchases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Hamburg data protection agency has banned Facebook from processing the additional WhatsApp user data that the tech giant is granting itself access to under a mandatory update to WhatsApp&#8217;s terms of service.</p>
<p>The controversial WhatsApp privacy policy update has caused widespread confusion around the world since being announced &#8212; and already been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15/">delayed by Facebook for several months</a> after a major user backlash saw rivals messaging apps benefitting from an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/">influx of angry users</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/india-tells-court-to-block-whatsapps-policy-update-says-new-change-violates-laws/">Indian government has also sought to block the changes to WhatApp&#8217;s T&amp;Cs in court</a> &#8212; and the country&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/india-antitrust-body-orders-investigation-into-whatsapp-privacy-policy-changes/">antitrust authority is investigating</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Globally, WhatsApp users have until May 15 to accept the new terms (after which the requirement to accept the T&amp;Cs update will become persistent, per a <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-happens-when-our-terms-and-privacy-policy-updates-take-effect">WhatsApp FAQ</a>).</p>
<p>The majority of users who have had the terms pushed on them have already accepted them, according to Facebook, although it hasn&#8217;t disclosed what proportion of users that is.</p>
<p>But the intervention by Hamburg&#8217;s DPA could further delay Facebook&#8217;s rollout of the T&amp;Cs &#8212; at least in Germany &#8212; as the agency has used an urgency procedure, allowed for under the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to order the tech giant not to share the data for three months.</p>
<p>A WhatsApp spokesperson disputed the legal validity of Hamburg&#8217;s order &#8212; calling it &#8220;a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose and effect of WhatsApp&#8217;s update&#8221; and arguing that it &#8220;therefore has no legitimate basis&#8221;.</p>
<p>“Our recent update explains the options people have to message a business on WhatsApp and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data. As the Hamburg DPA’s claims are wrong, the order will not impact the continued roll-out of the update. We remain fully committed to delivering secure and private communications for everyone,&#8221; the spokesperson added, suggesting that Facebook-owned WhatsApp may be intending to ignore the order.</p>
<p>We understand that Facebook is considering its options to appeal Hamburg&#8217;s procedure.</p>
<p>The emergency powers Hamburg is using can&#8217;t extend beyond three months but the agency is also applying pressure to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) to step in and make what it calls &#8220;a binding decision&#8221; for the 27 Member State bloc.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the EDPB to ask what action, if any, it could take in response to the Hamburg DPA&#8217;s call.</p>
<p>The body is not usually involved in making binding GDPR decisions related to specific complaints &#8212; unless EU DPAs cannot agree over a draft GDPR decision brought to them for review by a lead supervisory authority under the one-stop-shop mechanism for handling cross-border cases.</p>
<p>In such a scenario the EDPB can cast a deciding vote &#8212; but it&#8217;s not clear that an urgency procedure would qualify.</p>
<p>In taking the emergency action, the German DPA is not only attacking Facebook for continuing to thumb its nose at EU data protection rules, but throwing shade at its lead data supervisor in the region, Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) &#8212; accusing the latter of failing to investigate the very widespread concerns attached to the incoming WhatsApp T&amp;Cs.</p>
<p>(&#8220;Our request to the lead supervisory authority for an investigation into the actual practice of data sharing was not honoured so far,&#8221; is the polite framing of this shade in Hamburg&#8217;s <a href="https://datenschutz-hamburg.de/assets/pdf/2021-05-11-press-release-facebook.pdf">press release</a>).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the DPC for a response and will update this report if we get one.</p>
<p>Ireland&#8217;s data watchdog is no stranger to criticism that it indulges in creative regulatory inaction when it comes to enforcing the GDPR &#8212; with critics charging commissioner Helen Dixon and her team of failing to investigate scores of complaints and, in the instances when it has opened probes, taking years to investigate &#8212; and opting for weak enforcements at the last.</p>
<p>The only GDPR decision the DPC has issued to date against a tech giant (against Twitter, in relation to a data breach) was disputed by other EU DPAs &#8212; which wanted a far tougher penalty than the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">$550k fine eventually handed down</a> by Ireland.</p>
<p>GDPR investigations into Facebook and WhatsApp remain on the DPC&#8217;s desk. Although a draft decision in one WhatsApp data-sharing transparency case was sent to other EU DPAs in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/18/whatsapp-facebook-data-sharing-transparency-under-review-by-eu-dpas-after-ireland-sends-draft-decision/">January</a> for review &#8212; but a resolution has still yet to see the light of day almost three years after the regulation begun being applied.</p>

<p>In short, frustrations about the lack of GDPR enforcement against the biggest tech giants are riding high among other EU DPAs &#8212; some of whom are now resorting to creative regulatory actions to try to sidestep the bottleneck created by the one-stop-shop (OSS) mechanism which funnels so many complaints through Ireland.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/confusion-over-whatsapps-new-tcs-triggers-privacy-warning-from-italy/">Italian DPA also issued a warning</a> over the WhatsApp T&amp;Cs change, back in January &#8212; saying it had contacted the EDPB to raise concerns about a lack of clear information over what’s changing.</p>
<p>At that point the EDPB emphasized that its role is to promote cooperation between supervisory authorities. It added that it will continue to facilitate exchanges between DPAs &#8220;in order to ensure a consistent application of data protection law across the EU in accordance with its mandate&#8221;. But the always fragile consensus between EU DPAs is becoming increasingly fraught over enforcement bottlenecks and the perception that the regulation is failing to be upheld because of OSS forum shopping.</p>
<p>That will increase pressure on the EDPB to find some way to resolve the impasse and avoid a wider break down of the regulation &#8212; i.e. if more and more Member State agencies resort to unilateral &#8217;emergency&#8217; action.</p>
<p>The Hamburg DPA writes that the update to WhatsApp&#8217;s terms grant the messaging platform &#8220;far-reaching powers to share data with Facebook&#8221; for the company&#8217;s own purposes (including for advertising and marketing) &#8212; such as by passing WhatApp users&#8217; location data to Facebook and allowing for the communication data of WhatsApp users to be transferred to third-parties if businesses make use of Facebook&#8217;s hosting services.</p>
<p>Its assessment is that Facebook cannot rely on legitimate interests as a legal base for the expanded data sharing under EU law.</p>
<p>And if the tech giant is intending to rely on user consent it&#8217;s not meeting the bar either because the changes are not clearly explained nor are users offered a free choice to consent or not (which is the required standard under GDPR).</p>
<p>&#8220;The investigation of the new provisions has shown that they aim to further expand the close connection between the two companies in order for Facebook to be able to use the data of WhatsApp users for their own purposes at any time,&#8221; Hamburg goes on. &#8220;For the areas of product improvement and advertising, WhatsApp reserves the right to pass on data to Facebook companies without requiring any further consent from data subjects. In other areas, use for the company&#8217;s own purposes in accordance to the privacy policy can already be assumed at present.</p>
<p>&#8220;The privacy policy submitted by WhatsApp and the FAQ describe, for example, that WhatsApp users&#8217; data, such as phone numbers and device identifiers, are already being exchanged between the companies for joint purposes such as network security and to prevent spam from being sent.&#8221;</p>
<p>DPAs like Hamburg may be feeling buoyed to take matters into their own hands on GDPR enforcement by a recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">opinion </a>by an advisor to the EU’s top court, as we suggested in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/confusion-over-whatsapps-new-tcs-triggers-privacy-warning-from-italy/">coverage</a> at the time. <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-01/cp210001en.pdf">Advocate General Bobek took the view</a> that EU law allows agencies to bring their own proceedings in certain situations, including in order to adopt &#8220;urgent measures&#8221; or to intervene &#8220;following the lead data protection authority having decided not to handle a case.”</p>
<p>The CJEU ruling on that case is still pending &#8212; but the court tends to align with the position of its advisors.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We'll have to wait to see how public investors value the company once it begins to float later this year. But as far as unicorn SPAC deals go, there have been worse ones that we've viewed.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Better.com, a venture-backed digital mortgage lender, announced this morning that it will combine with a SPAC, taking itself public in the second half of 2021. The unicorn&#8217;s news comes as the American IPO market is showing signs of fresh life after a modest April.</p>
<p>The Better.com deal comes just over a month after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/mortgage-is-suddenly-sexy-as-softbank-pumps-500m-in-better-com-at-6b-valuation/">sold $500 million of its existing shares to SoftBank</a> at a valuation of $6 billion. At the time, TechCrunch described the deal as &#8220;further proof&#8221; that unsexy industries were able to secure attractive valuations despite their relative lack of pizzazz.</p>
<p>The SoftBank secondary round was hardly Better&#8217;s only recent mega-deal; the company raised a $200 million round <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-to-invest-500-million-in-mortgage-startup-better-11617899907">at a $4 billion valuation in November 2020</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p>But the company&#8217;s SPAC combination will affix an even higher price than its April round managed, providing <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bettermortgage/company_financials">the Kleiner-Perkins-backed Better</a> with what <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210511005602/en/Digital-Homeownership-Platform-Better-to-Become-a-Publicly-Listed-Company-via-Merger-with-Aurora-Acquisition-Corp.-Company-is-Redefining-the-Homeownership-Experience">it describes</a> as a &#8220;post-money equity value of approximately $7.7 billion.&#8221;</p>
<p>SoftBank is doubling down on Better, putting together a $1.5 billion private investment in the deal&#8217;s public equity, or PIPE, in effect repricing its own preceding investment. For the Japanese telecom and investing powerhouse, making successive bets in companies at ever-higher prices is essentially gospel. So, don&#8217;t read <em>too</em> much into the commitment.</p>
<p>As with all SPAC combinations, we have a pile of new data from the company that is going public as part of the transaction. So, this morning, we&#8217;re getting our hands dirty.</p>
<p>Our goals are simple: We want to understand whether Better is a weak business, an acceptably strong business or a great business. To get there, we&#8217;ll have to start by digging into how the company functions. From there, we&#8217;ll discuss its valuation stacked against its trailing metrics. We&#8217;ll also take a look at its growth expectations and bring in the recent Compass IPO, a company that focuses on a different part of the mortgage market, to see if we can get a better handle on Better&#8217;s new valuation.</p>
<p>Ready? The deck is <a href="https://aurora-acquisition.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/better-roadshow-deck.pdf">here</a>. Let&#8217;s have some fun.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Better.com?</h2>
<p>If you have heard of Better but really had no idea what it does before this morning, welcome to the club. Mortgage tech is like pre-kindergarten applications &#8212; it applies to a very specific set of folks at a very particular moment. And they care a lot about it. But the rest of us aren&#8217;t really aware of its existence.</p>
<p>For the rest of us: Better is an online mortgage lender that aims to offer lower-than-standard fees to consumers looking for credit to help them buy a house. As the company <a href="https://better.com/content/how-does-better-make-money/">explains</a> on its website, it generates income by selling loans that it helps generate. Per its investor deck, Better also derives top line from selling insurance products.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup that has built a neobank specifically to address the needs of freelancers and sole traders has picked up a growth round to continue expanding its business after seeing its usage grow by 1500% in a year.</p>
<p><a href="https://lili.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lili</a>, which provides a way for freelancers to use a single account both to manage their work and personal financial lives, along with tools to help manage the particular financial and accounting demands that come with being a one-person business, has picked up $55 million in a Series B round that it will be using to continue expanding its platform.</p>
<p>Today the company already provides users with a single account and payment card that can be used both for personal and business expenses, and an &#8220;assistant&#8221; that analyses expenses and budget for paying future taxes based on your incomings. Down the line it will also be expanding into invoicing, payment management and credit (eg, loans or cash advances) for its customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is about financial services for freelancers,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Lilac Bar David said in an interview. &#8220;We are redefining a new kind of user, who is between a consumer and a business and has specific needs. If you look at the economy and what the future of work will look like, this really needs to be addressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lili is based out of New York and Israel, and its focus is primarily on the U.S. market, where Bar David said the opportunity is big enough to keep Lili occupied for some time. It is estimated that currently 40% of workers are freelance, and that proportion is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/921593/gig-economy-number-of-freelancers-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">projected</a> to rise to just over 50% of all working people by 2027.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Group 11, a VC with a <a href="https://group11.vc/portfolio/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong focus on fintech</a>, with Target Global, AltaIR and previous investors also participating. (That list of past backers include Zeev Ventures, Foundation Capital and the Google for Startups accelerator.) The company has now raised $80 million and is not disclosing its valuation yet.</p>
<p>Launched in January 2020, just before the pandemic really kicked off, Lili has picked up 200,000 customers to date, Bar David tells me.</p>
<p>Its growth was very much on the back of a significant shift in the working world put into motion by the Covid-19 crisis, both in terms of a new cadre of potential users; and in terms of how the product is delivered.</p>
<p>On new users, while freelancers have always been present in the economy, their numbers suddenly swelled.</p>
<p>In some cases, people were being forced into pausing their normal employment, for example when say a public venue like a theater had to temporarily close its doors. In others they were simply laid off as businesses no longer appeared viable. In both cases, it led to a sudden surge of people becoming enterprising with their skills to make a living, rather than trying to apply for new full-time work during the pandemic.</p>
<p>It turns out this was a particularly acute predicament for women. More than 5 million women lost jobs in the wake of the pandemic, Bar David said, and many of them turned to freelance work. Lili says that more than half, almost 60%, of its new users are women.</p>
<p>In terms of the technology, Bar David noted that those looking for a new kind of account to help manage finances needed something flexible and completely usable without the need to visit a physical bank branch.</p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;We were definitely in the right place at the right time,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Not only did Covid have an impact on the freelance economy, but it meant no access to bank branches. That meant a greater willingness to adopt a service like ours, and that had a huge effect.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p5">Freelancing &#8212; whatever your actual skill or profession happens to be &#8212; has a lot to recommend it.</p>
<p class="p5">You are, as they say, your own boss: you can choose which hours your work, what work you take on, how to execute it, and whether you want to promote yourself to work on other things without worrying if your manager will endorse or beat down or perhaps worst of all ignore or dismiss your ambition. You have only your own motivation, and luck, to praise or constructively criticize or sympathize with in your annual reviews with yourself about how you have been doing.</p>
<p>But &#8212; and I can say this from very direct experience &#8212; it can also be a real pain in the ass.</p>
<p>You have to figure out how to healthily manage your time well, and not take on too much, or panic when not enough work is coming in. You are constantly fighting your own corner when those contracting your services to exploit you or underpay you, with the understanding that pushing back too much might find out you out of a job altogether. You may not get the chances and work you were hoping to get, and then you don&#8217;t get paid for the shots you never take.</p>
<p>And that is before the considerable efforts you need to put in to effectively become your own business manager.</p>
<p>That includes tracking your expenses, deciding how to itemize things that you spend money on to align them with your taxes, and of course budgeting yourself each month based on your incomings, and using that budget wisely in ways that make the most sense for you as a consumer in the world, and you as a business person. And if this kind of stuff is not your strongest suit, well, that&#8217;s tough. You have to do it anyway.</p>
<p>Lili is an interesting and catchy idea because of how it&#8217;s identified all of those transactional issues, and is building tools to help people manage all of it.</p>
<p>This is not just about having a business card to manage payments, but a bigger system that tracks what you are spending and learns from it to give you advice on how to manage your taxes and expenses, what you should be keeping back each month to pay towards income tax filings, and more. Typically, freelancers either do this on the fly from their personal accounts or set up separate business accounts to try to manage it, but neither of those options really presents a clean and easy to use user experience.</p>
<p>Over time, the plan will be to continue adding in more tools and integrate with a wider set of third-party applications that freelancers might use to invoice customers or pay out invoices themselves. It already has integrations with Venmo and QuickBooks, and more will be coming, Bar David said, &#8220;w<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">hatever a self-employed person needs to be successful,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p>There are now dozens of neobanks on the market, but Lili&#8217;s specific focus on these self-employed freelancers is what has helped it stand out.</p>
<p class="p5">“We anticipate the freelancer economy will continue to robustly grow well beyond the pandemic tailwinds,&#8221; said Group 11 Founding Partner Dovi Frances, in a statement. &#8220;Lili is poised to see exponential growth by continuing to offer this demographic essential, effective and intuitive tools to manage what was previously an extremely complex and inefficient way of doing business.”</p>
<p class="p5">And to be honest, Lili is not the only neobank out there targeting freelancers &#8212; others include all of the usual neobanks as well as specialists like <a href="https://www.lancebank.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lance Bank</a> &#8212; but it&#8217;s putting everything it can into tech to try to make itself the most effective and best at it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://datarobot.com/">DataRobot</a>, the Boston-based automated machine learning startup, had a bushel of announcements this morning as it expanded its platform to give technical and nontechnical users alike something new. It also announced it has acquired <a href="https://www.zepl.com/">Zepl</a>, giving it an advanced development environment where data scientists can bring their own code to DataRobot. The two companies did not share the acquisition price.</p>
<p>Nenshad Bardoliwalla, SVP of Product at DataRobot says that his company aspires to be the leader in this market and it believes the path to doing that is appealing to a broad spectrum of user requirements, from those who have little data science understanding to those who can do their own machine learning coding in Python and R.</p>
<p>&#8220;While people love automation, they also want it to be [flexible]. They don&#8217;t want just automation, but then you can&#8217;t do anything with it. They also want the ability to turn the knobs and pull the levers,&#8221; Bardoliwalla explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To resolve that problem, rather than building a coding environment from scratch, it chose to buy Zepl and incorporate its coding notebook into the platform in a new tool called Composable ML. &#8220;With Composable ML and with the Zepl acquisition, we are now providing a really first-class environment for people who want to code,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Zepl was founded in 2016 and raised $13 million along the way, according to Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zepl-3ee7">data</a>. The company didn&#8217;t want to reveal the number of employees or the purchase price, but the acquisition gives it advanced capabilities, especially a notebook environment to call its own to attract those more advanced users to the platform. The company plans to incorporate the Zepl functionality into the platform, while also leaving the standalone product in place.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gEZV629kQM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/how-artificial-intelligence-will-be-used-in-2021/">How artificial intelligence will be used in 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How artificial intelligence will be used in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/how-artificial-intelligence-will-be-used-in-2021/embed/#?secret=gEZV629kQM" data-secret="gEZV629kQM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Bardoliwalla said that they see the Zepl acquisition as an extension of the automated side of the house, where these tools can work in conjunction with one another with machines and humans working together to generate the best models. &#8220;This [generates an] organic mixture of the best of what a system can generate using DataRobot AutoML and the best of what human beings can do and kind of trying to compose those together into something really interesting [&#8230;],&#8221; Bardoliwalla said.</p>
<p>The company is also introducing a no-code AI app builder that enables nontechnical users to create apps from the data set with drag and drop components. In addition, it&#8217;s adding a tool to monitor the accuracy of the model over time. Sometimes, after a model is in production for a time, the accuracy can begin to break down as the data on which the model is based is no longer valid. This tool monitors the model data for accuracy and warns the team when it&#8217;s starting to fall out of compliance.</p>
<p>Finally, the company is announcing a model bias monitoring tool to help root out model bias that could introduce racist, sexist or other assumptions into the model. To avoid this, the company has built a tool to identify when it sees this happening both in the model-building phase and in production. It warns the team of potential bias, while providing them with suggestions to tweak the model to remove it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli security startup <a href="https://cycode.com/">Cycode</a>, which specializes in helping enterprises secure their DevOps pipelines and prevent code tampering, today announced that it has raised a $20 million Series A funding round led by <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/">Insight Partners</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/cycode-raises-4-6m-seed-round-to-keep-your-source-code-safe/">Seed investor</a> <a href="https://www.ylventures.com/">YL Ventures</a> also participated in this round, which brings the total funding in the company to $24.6 million.</p>
<p>Cycode&#8217;s focus was squarely on securing source code in its early days, but thanks to the advent of infrastructure as code (IaC), policies as code and similar processes, it has expanded its scope. In this context, it&#8217;s worth noting that Cycode&#8217;s tools are language and use case agnostic. To its tools, code is code.</p>
<p>&#8220;This &#8216;everything as code&#8217; notion creates an opportunity because the code repositories, they become a single source of truth of what the operation should look like and how everything should function, Cycode CTO and co-founder Ronen Slavin told me. &#8220;So if we look at that and we understand it &#8212; the next phase is to verify this is indeed what&#8217;s happening, and then whenever something deviates from it, it&#8217;s probably something that you should look at and investigate.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2150117" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cycode-Dashboard.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150117" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2150117" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cycode-Dashboard.jpg" alt="Cycode Dashboard" width="1024" height="594" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cycode-Dashboard.jpg 5298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cycode-Dashboard.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cycode-Dashboard.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cycode-Dashboard.jpg?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cycode-Dashboard.jpg?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cycode-Dashboard.jpg?resize=1536,891 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cycode-Dashboard.jpg?resize=2048,1188 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cycode-Dashboard.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2150117" class="wp-caption-text">Cycode Dashboard.

<p>The company&#8217;s service already provides the tools for managing code governance, leak detection, secret detection and access management. Recently it added its features for securing code that defines a business&#8217; infrastructure; looking ahead, the team plans to add features like drift detection, integrity monitoring and alert prioritization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cycode is here to protect the entire CI/CD pipeline &#8212; the development infrastructure &#8212; from end to end, from code to cloud,&#8221; Cycode CEO and co-founder Lior Levy told me.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Tn27tBN0uG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/cycode-raises-4-6m-seed-round-to-keep-your-source-code-safe/">Cycode raises $4.6M seed round to keep your source code safe</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cycode raises $4.6M seed round to keep your source code safe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/cycode-raises-4-6m-seed-round-to-keep-your-source-code-safe/embed/#?secret=Tn27tBN0uG" data-secret="Tn27tBN0uG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;If we look at the landscape today, we can say that existing solutions in the market are kind of siloed, just like the DevOps stages used to be,&#8221; Levy explained. &#8220;They don&#8217;t really see the bigger picture, they don&#8217;t look at the pipeline from a holistic perspective. Essentially, this is causing them to generate thousands of alerts, which amplifies the problem even further, because not only don&#8217;t you get a holistic view, but also the noise level that comes from those thousands of alerts causes a lot of valuable time to get wasted on chasing down some irrelevant issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>What Cycode wants to do then is to break down these silos and integrate the relevant data from across a company&#8217;s CI/CD infrastructure, starting with the source code itself, which ideally allows the company to anticipate issues early on in the software life cycle. To do so, Cycode can pull in data from services like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and Jenkins (among others) and scan it for security issues. Later this year, the company plans to integrate data from third-party security tools like Snyk and Checkmarx as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem of protecting CI/CD tools like GitHub, Jenkins and AWS is a gap for virtually every enterprise,&#8221; said Jon Rosenbaum, principal at Insight Partners, who will join Cycode’s board of directors. &#8220;Cycode secures CI/CD pipelines in an elegant, developer-centric manner. This positions the company to be a leader within the new breed of application security companies &#8212; those that are rapidly expanding the market with solutions which secure every release without sacrificing velocity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to accelerate its R&amp;D efforts, and expand its sales and marketing teams. Levy and Slavin expect that the company will grow to about 65 employees this year, spread between the development team in Israel and its sales and marketing operations in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been a flurry of investments in startups focused on acquiring third-party sellers on Amazon and helping them build their businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest is <a href="https://www.acqu.co">Acquco</a>, which aims to stand out from the others in that it was formed by a pair of founders &#8212; Raunak Nirmal and Wiley Zhang &#8212; who actually worked at Amazon, and then built multimillion-dollar businesses on its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York City-based startup has raised $160 million in debt and equity in a Series A round that it says will fund its “aggressive growth plans.” CoVenture, Singh Capital Partners, Crossbeam and other notable investors such as GoDaddy CEO Aman Bhutani put money in the equity portion of the round. Acquco would not disclose the valuation at which the money was raised, nor the exact breakdown of debt and equity, other than to say &#8220;a significant portion was equity.&#8221; But CEO Raunak Nirmal did share a few other notable things. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, the company has already scaled to over $100 million in revenue since its founding (in a year’s time) while deploying less than $2 million of equity capital. Plus, it’s been profitable “since day one,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nirmal also claims that Acquco’s proprietary technology and “proven playbooks” give it an edge against competitors such as Thrasio and Perch. Specifically, the company says it helps Amazon sellers exit their business within 30 days and continue to scale their business “to the next level” post-acquisition. It also claims to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offer flexible terms and that it does not prevent entrepreneurs from selling again on Amazon.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Target Global leads $150M round for Amazon Marketplace consolidator Branded&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/embed/#?secret=AN2UsHomhg" data-secret="AN2UsHomhg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquco says it identifies the best businesses to acquire, and leverages what it describes as “flexible founder-friendly deal structures,” which essentially gives sellers a way to make money from the exit and then still get a cut of revenues down the line. The company claims that it on average achieves over 100% revenue growth after migrating brands onto its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forming Acquco was not an overnight story, but rather was years in the making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My first job out of college was actually at Amazon. I worked as a business analyst on the merchant technologies team there, which was really focused on third-party selling and helping empower third-party sellers to grow on the platform and then just growing that segment of the business,” Nirmal recalls. “At the time, third-party selling was smaller than the retail side for Amazon.”</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ec9I3UYGSU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/">Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/embed/#?secret=Ec9I3UYGSU" data-secret="Ec9I3UYGSU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot has changed since then, of course, as that segment of the e-commerce giant’s business has grown dramatically. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, most sales on Amazon have come through Amazon Marketplace, where millions of outside sellers compete to find customers. Many pay Amazon to store and ship their goods, making them eligible for Prime shipping through an arrangement known as Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA. This is where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquco</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is focusing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at Amazon years ago, Nirmal was tasked with starting a brand on the site so he could better understand sellers’ pain points, as well as the tools that could be built “to really help them grow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, Nirmal left Amazon to pursue selling on Amazon full time because the brand he’d started ended up selling over $7 million in its first year. After that, he and COO Zhang built and sold multiple brands in the Amazon ecosystem before going on to consult for “some of the largest sellers in the marketplace,” primarily based in China but selling in the U.S. market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of these guys are actually public companies now,” Nirmal said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The duo went on to co-found a seller outsourcing firm in the Philippines, which helps to minimize the cost of operating the brands for sellers and make it more accessible for sellers that don&#8217;t have a huge team to build something on Amazon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then they founded a company called Refund Labs, a seller tool that helps sellers essentially automatically identify issues in the payments that they receive from Amazon as well as recover money on their behalf for things like inventory that gets damaged or lost or the fees that are being charged that might be incorrect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nirmal stepped down as CEO of Refund Labs to form Acquco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we wanted to do is take this knowledge and experience that we really have built up over the last seven years, and apply it in the best way possible,” Nirmal told TechCrunch. “And rather than building brands from the ground up, or consulting for some of these large sellers, we thought, &#8216;Why not go and buy the best brands, and then help grow them using our expertise?&#8217; ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says its proprietary algorithms analyze thousands of criteria sets and millions of data inputs “to automate and maximize the performance of the core functions within supply chain and brand management” across their portfolio. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquco plans to use its new capital to enter “hypergrowth mode,” according to Chief Strategy Officer Jerel Ho, who most recently led corporate development and strategy at WeWork, where he closed over $40 billion in M&amp;A deals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has the ambitious goal of scaling its portfolio to over $500 million in revenue by 2022. It plans to put the new money toward continuing to build out its technology platform &#8212; including tools that can automate the management of an entire brand on Amazon and across other retail channels &#8212; as well as continuing to acquire brands. It’s also, naturally, going to do some hiring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve done a lot with very little,” Ho told TechCrunch. “But hyper growth plans require a much larger team across all functions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoVenture founder Ali Hamed says that the Amazon third-party seller ecosystem does $200 billion of revenue and is growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 50%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s the most attractive market we&#8217;ve seen since founding our firm,” he told TechCrunch. “And of all the people we&#8217;ve talked to, Raunak is as plugged into the Amazon ecosystem as anyone we could find. In many ways, he taught us how to look, think and deploy capital into the market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To say Hamed is bullish on Acquco would be an understatement. Since first investing in the company in 2020, Nirmal “has exceeded” all of CoVenture’s expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve been begging him to take more money every three months since writing our first check,” Hamed added. “Raunak is able to help buy businesses and make them better than they ever were before. He has a vision of how to operate these assets post-purchase that other operators who are not Amazon-native just don&#8217;t have.”</span></p>
<p>Besides Thrasio, other players in the space that have recently raised funding include Branded, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched its own roll-up business on $150 million in funding, </a>as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berlin Brands Group</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SellerX</a>, <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/press-releases/heyday-emerges-from-stealth-with-175m-series-a-funding-to-accelerate-marketplace-native-brands-15493868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heyday</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroes</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perch</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ultium Cells LLC, a joint venture between General Motors and LG Chem, has been steadily building up its battery cell manufacturing capacity in the U.S. since the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/gm-reveals-ultium-the-heart-of-its-ev-strategy/https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/gm-reveals-ultium-the-heart-of-its-ev-strategy/">venture was first announced</a> in December 2019. But with each battery cell they produce, they’ll also produce waste &#8212; tricky-to-handle waste that also has too much inherent value to toss into a landfill.</p>
<p>Instead of throwing it away, Ultium is sending it to a recycler. The venture has executed an agreement with Canadian company <a href="https://li-cycle.com/">Li-Cycle</a> to recycle critical materials from the scrap produced from Ultium’s manufacturing processes from its Lordstown plant, starting later in 2021. The materials from the Lordstown location will be sent to Li-Cycle’s recycling location in Rochester, New York, to be processed and returned to the battery supply chain.</p>
<p>General Motors and LG Chem are clearly determined to scale their battery cell manufacturing. Around 5-10% of the output of a cell manufacturer is this excess scrap. Considering that the Lordstown facility will be capable of producing 35 gigawatt hours of capacity annually, it’s sure to produce a sizable amount of waste material. (For perspective, Tesla’s factory in Nevada has a 35 GW-hour capacity.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Li-Cycle&#8217;s approach is different from more traditional recycling processes, co-founder Ajay Kochhar told TechCrunch. Traditional recycling efforts use a pyrometallurgical, or high-temperature, process. With this process, batteries go into a furnace and excess material, like plastics and the electrolyte, are burned off, leaving around a 50% recovery rate for the valuable raw materials.</p>
<p>Li-Cycle also differs from competitors like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/redwood-materials/">Redwood Materials</a>, which also use high-temperature processes, Kochhar explained. Redwood processes things like consumer electronics, which require different approaches. Li-Cycle uses a low-temperature mechanical process that shreds &#8212; actually shreds, like a paper shredder &#8212; the battery materials in a submerged, proprietary solution. Doing it this way reduces the thermal risk of a fire and recovers up to 95% of the battery materials (Redwood also claims a recovery rate of 95-98%). By not burning anything off, the company also avoids producing potentially toxic emissions, Kochhar said.</p>

<p>The cathode and anode material is converted into battery-grade chemicals, like lithium carbonate, nickel sulfate and cobalt sulfate. Li-Cycle works with Traxys, a company that buys the chemical material.</p>
<p>“And where it goes from there is back into cathode making and back into the broader economy and battery supply chain,” Kochhar said. The next step would be a “true circular economy closed loop,” where the same material used by a manufacturer is returned back to it.</p>
<p>The company has two recycling &#8220;spokes,&#8221; where shredding and mechanical separation occurs, in Rochester and Ontario, Canada, with a third commercial facility being built in Arizona. Once the Arizona facility becomes operational, Li-Cycle will be able to process around 20,000 metric tons, or 4 gigawatt-hours, of lithium-ion batteries annually. It&#8217;s also building what it calls a &#8220;hub&#8221; to make the battery chemicals in Rochester, which will have an annual capacity to process around 60,000 metric tons of battery scrap and &#8220;black mass&#8221; (a mix of cathode and anode material, and one of the outputs from the company&#8217;s &#8220;spokes&#8221;).</p>
<p>It works with 14 automotive and battery manufacturers (though not all of those deals are public), as well as auto dealers and auto recyclers to accept and process spent lithium-ion batteries.</p>

<p>Ultium in April announced a second $2.3 billion U.S.-based battery factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee that is due to open in 2023. Both factories will supply the automaker with the cells needed for the 30 electric vehicle models it plans to launch by mid decade. However, it is not known if Li-Cycle will process waste from this plant, too.</p>
<p>Notably, the company also recycles R&amp;D scrap from various automakers, giving Li-Cycle “a kind of first look at what’s coming down the pipe” in terms of battery technology, Kochhar said. That helps the company stay on top of the newest battery chemistries and technologies, like solid-state or lithium iron phosphate (LFP), and develop recycling processes accordingly. Li-Cycle already processes some LFP batteries; in those instances it has plans to remake the phosphate back into a fertilizer additive.</p>
<p>In this case, Kochhar said he hopes people see this partnership as a proof point for the economic and environmental case for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>“This should be one commercial example [. . .] that EV batteries will not go into a landfill,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They’re very valuable. The technology’s here to deal with that in an economically and environmentally friendly fashion.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The University of California has always embraced the startup ecosystem in the state, including running a few of its own incubators and accelerators. Now Berkeley will have a huge new incubator of its own, <a href="https://bakarlabs.berkeley.edu/">Bakar Labs</a>, which will host as many as 80 young companies a year and provide access to university facilities and networks.</p>
<p>Hosted at the lovely brutalist Woo Hon Fai Hall, formerly the Berkeley Art Museum, the incubator is just part of the greater Bakar BioEnginuity Hub, an ongoing cross-disciplinary initiative within the university. It will be run by QB3, a pan-UC organization that organizes entrepreneurship efforts, and replaces a much smaller biotech-focused program at Berkeley.</p>
<p>Rather than provide a set curriculum of achieving product fit, building the team and so on that you might find at an accelerator, Bakar Labs will be more of a benevolent host with all the best toys. Berkeley is of course a world-class research institution with an enviable faculty and extensive resources — and those in the incubator will have (limited) access to them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Startups need not be affiliated with Berkeley in any way — the hub is hoping to attract founders from all over the place with its promise of inexpensive office and lab space and the aforementioned extensive resources. The term &#8220;incubator&#8221; seems apt for both the topic and the method — bring in the organisms, provide plenty of nutrients and watch them grow.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150049" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150049" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2150049" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg" alt="Students in a lab space working in white coats." width="1024" height="663" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg?resize=1536,995 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg?resize=2048,1326 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBH-Interior-Inside-Lab.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2150049" class="wp-caption-text">Artist&#8217;s impression of what a lab space in Bakar will be like. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> UC Berkeley</p></div></p>
<p>The relatively hands-off approach applies to funding as well. Companies will pay for their places at the Labs, but there&#8217;s no contract to sign over equity or first rights to Berkeley or its associated organs. A QB3 representative explained that investments may still occur, through an affiliated VC fund, but that it&#8217;s not baked into the program.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no connection with Berkeley&#8217;s Skydeck, another university entrepreneurship program that has produced some highly valued companies in and out of biotech. The team that will be helping select companies for Bakar Labs helped Skydeck with its biotech applicants, so it seems going forward like there will be a friendly bifurcation of streams.</p>
<p>As for entry, companies will be judged on their potential (both business and scientific), but the exact requirements and preferences will no doubt be flexible. Managing director of Bakar Labs Gino Segre explained that they would hope a company has more on its mind than either a buyout or a big paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;We encourage teams with a double bottom line to apply &#8212; they aim to better human health and are pursuing a profit-driven business model. Entrepreneurship for good,&#8221; he wrote in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;We are already seeing interest in therapeutics, diagnostics, research tool, foodtech and agtech.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The strongest teams will be two to 15 people, with operating capital for at least 6 months, and are leveraging an innovative technology for which a lab is required to advance their program,&#8221; he continued. There&#8217;s no limit on how long startups can stay, but after a couple years you might wonder whether there&#8217;s been a failure to launch. Ideally the startup raises money and moves to its own office and lab, but until that&#8217;s an option the incubator would be far superior to garages and temporarily vacated conference rooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bakar BioEnginuity Hub holds enormous promise as a space for mobilizing our vibrant changemaking students and faculty, our powerful research enterprise, and a community of innovators who will maximize societal benefit over profit,&#8221; said UC Chancellor Carol T. Christ in a Berkeley news release.</p>
<p>If this all sounds like a good match for your company (or maybe your roommate&#8217;s, currently operating out of the spare bedroom), <a href="https://bakarlabs.berkeley.edu/get-in-touch">head over here to apply</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boston-based <a href="https://apptopia.com/">Apptopia</a>, a company providing competitive intelligence in the mobile app ecosystem, has closed on $20 million in Series C funding aimed at fueling its expansion beyond the world of mobile apps. The new financing was led by ABS Capital Partners, and follows three consecutive years of 50% year-over-year growth for Apptopia&#8217;s business, which has been profitable since the beginning of last year, the company says.</p>
<p>Existing investors, including Blossom Street Ventures, also participated in the round. ABS Capital&#8217;s Mike Avon, a co-founder of Millennial Media, and Paul Mariani, are joining Apptopia&#8217;s board with this round.</p>
<p>The funding follows what Apptopia says has been increased demand from brands to better understand the digital aspects of their businesses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, Apptopia&#8217;s customers include hundreds of corporations and financial institutions, including Google, Visa, Coca-Cola, Target, Zoom, NBC, Unity Technologies, Microsoft, Adobe, Glu, Andreessen Horowitz and Facebook.</p>
<p>In the past, Apptopia&#8217;s customers were examining digital engagement and interactions from a macro level, but now they&#8217;re looking to dive deeper into specific details, requiring more data. For example, a brand may have previously wanted to know how well a competitor&#8217;s promotion fared in terms of new users or app sessions. But now they want to know the answers to specific questions &#8212; like how many unique users participated, whether those users were existing customers, whether they returned after the promotion ended, and so on.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will Zoom Apps be the next hot startup platform?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/will-zoom-apps-be-the-next-hot-startup-platform/embed/#?secret=nhO5hc8Vf7" data-secret="nhO5hc8Vf7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The majority of Apptopia&#8217;s business is now focused on delivering these sorts of answers to enterprise customers who subscribe to Apptopia&#8217;s data &#8212; and possibly, to the data from its competitors like Sensor Tower and App Annie, with the goal of blending data sets together for a more accurate understanding of the competitive landscape.</p>
<p>Apptopia&#8217;s own data, historically, was not always seen as being the most accurate, admits Apptopia CEO Jonathan Kay. But it has improved over the years.</p>
<p>Kay, previously Apptopia COO, is now taking over the top role from co-founder Eliran Sapir, who&#8217;s transitioning to chairman of the board as the company enters its next phase of growth.</p>
<p>Apptopia&#8217;s rivals like Sensor Tower and App Annie use mobile panels to gather app data, among other methods, Kay explains. These panels involve consumer-facing apps like VPN clients and ad blockers, which users would download <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/vpn-and-ad-blocking-apps-sensor-tower">not necessarily understanding</a> that they were agreeing to having their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/your-vpn-or-ad-blocker-app-could-be-collecting-your-data/">app usage data collected</a>. This led to some controversy as the app data industry&#8217;s open secret was <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/vpn-and-ad-blocking-apps-sensor-tower">exposed to consumers,</a> and the companies tweaked their disclosures, as a result.</p>
<p>But the practice continues and has not impacted the companies&#8217; growth. Sensor Tower, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/sensor-tower-raises-45m-as-demand-for-app-data-grows/">raised $45 million last year,</a> as demand for app data continued to grow. And all involved businesses are expanding with new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/app-annie-ascend/">products</a> and <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/q1-2021-product-updates">services </a>for their data-hungry customer bases.</p>

<p>Apptopia, meanwhile, decided not to grow its business on the back of mobile panels. (Though in its earlier days it did test and then scrap such a plan.)</p>
<p>It gains access to data from its app developer customers &#8212; and this data is already aggregated and anonymized from the developers&#8217; Apple and Google Analytics accounts.</p>
<p>Initially, this method put Apptopia at a disadvantage. Rivals had more accurate data from about 2016 through 2018 because of their use of mobile panels, Kay says. But Apptopia made a strategic decision to not take this sort of risk &#8212; that is, build a business that Apple or Google could shut off at any time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead, what we did is we spent years investing into data science and algorithms,&#8221; notes Kay. &#8220;We figured out how to extract an equal or greater signal from the same data set that [competitors] had access to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using what Kay describes as &#8220;huge, huge amounts of historical data,&#8221; Apptopia over time learned what sort of signals went into an app&#8217;s app store ranking. A lot of people still think an app&#8217;s rank is largely determined by downloads, but there are now a variety of signals that inform rank, Kay points out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, a rank is just an accumulation of analytical data points that Apple and Google give points for,&#8221; he explains. This includes things like number of sessions, how many users, how much time is spent in an app, and more. &#8220;Because we didn&#8217;t have these panels, we had to spend years figuring out how to do reverse engineering better than our competitors. And, eventually, we figured out how to get the same signal that they could get from the panel from rank. That&#8217;s what allowed us to have such a fast-growing, successful business over the past several years.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Apptopia was already profitable, it didn&#8217;t need to fundraise. But the company wanted to accelerate its expansion into new areas, including its planned expansion outside of mobile apps.</p>
<p>Today, consumers use &#8220;apps&#8221; on their computers, on their smartwatches and on their TVs, in addition to their phones and tablets. And businesses no longer want to know just what&#8217;s happening on mobile &#8212; they want the full picture of &#8220;app&#8221; usage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We figured out a way to do that that doesn&#8217;t rely on any of what our competitors have done in the past,&#8221; says Kay. &#8220;So, we will not be using any apps to spy on people,&#8221; he states.</p>
<p>However, the company was not prepared to offer further details around its future product plans at this time. But Kay said Apptopia would not rule out partnerships or being acquisitive to accomplish its goals going forward.</p>
<p>Apptopia also sees a broader future in making its app data more accessible. Last year, for instance, it partnered with Bloomberg to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apptopia-brings-mobile-signals-to-investors-via-the-bloomberg-app-portal-301187599.html">bring mobile data to investors</a> via the Bloomberg App Portal on the Bloomberg Terminal. And it now works with Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/">AWS Data Exchange</a> and <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/data-marketplace/">Snowflake</a> to make access to app data available in other channels, as well. Future partnerships of a similar nature could come into play as another means of differentiating Apptopia&#8217;s data from its rivals.</p>
<p>The company declined to offer its current revenue run rate or valuation, but notes that it tripled its valuation from its last fundraise at the end of 2019.</p>
<p>In addition to product expansions, the company plans to leverage the funds to grow its team of 55 by another 25 in 2021, including in engineering and analysts. And it will grow its management team, adding a CFO, CPO and CMO this year.</p>
<p>To date, Apptopia has raised $30 million in outside capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Imagine if you could settle/rekindle domestic arguments by asking your smart speaker when the room last got cleaned or whether the bins already got taken out?</p>
<p>Or &#8212; for an altogether healthier use-case &#8212; what if you could ask your speaker to keep count of reps as you do squats and bench presses? Or switch into full-on &#8216;personal trainer&#8217; mode &#8212; barking orders to peddle faster as you spin cycles on a dusty old exercise bike (who needs a Peloton!).</p>
<p>And what if the speaker was smart enough to <em>just know</em> you&#8217;re eating dinner and took care of slipping on a little mood music?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now imagine if all those activity tracking smarts were on tap without any connected cameras being plugged inside your home.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">nother bit of fascinating research from researchers at Carnegie Mellon University’s </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="http://www.figlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Future Interfaces Group</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> opens up these sorts of possibilities &#8212; demonstrating a novel approach to activity tracking that does not rely on cameras as the sensing tool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Installing connected cameras inside your home is of course a horrible privacy risk. Which is why the CMU researchers set about investigating the potential of using millimeter wave (mmWave) doppler radar as a medium for detecting different types of human activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The challenge they needed to overcome is that while mmWave offers a &#8220;signal richness approaching that of microphones and cameras&#8221;, as they put it, data-sets to train AI models to recognize different human activities as RF noise are not readily available (as visual data for training other types of AI models is). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Not to be deterred, they set about sythensizing doppler data to feed a human activity tracking model &#8212; devising a software pipeline for training privacy-preserving activity tracking AI models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The results can be seen in <a href="https://karan-ahuja.com/vid2dop.html">this video</a> &#8212; where the model is shown correctly identifying a number of different activities, including cycling, clapping, waving and squats. Purely from its ability to interpret the mmWave signal the movements generate &#8212; and purely having been trained on public video data. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We show how this cross-domain translation can be successful through a series of experimental results,&#8221; they write. &#8220;Overall, we believe our approach is an important stepping stone towards significantly reducing the burden of training such as human sensing systems, and could help bootstrap uses in human-computer interaction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Researcher Chris Harrison confirms the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">mmWave doppler radar-based sensing doesn&#8217;t work for &#8220;very subtle stuff&#8221; (like spotting different facial expressions). But he says it&#8217;s sensitive enough to detect less vigorous activity &#8212; like eating or reading a book. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The motion detection ability of doppler radar is also limited by a need for line-of-sight between the subject and the sensing hardware. (Aka: &#8220;It can’t reach around corners yet.&#8221; Which, for those concerned about future robots&#8217; powers of human detection, will surely sound slightly reassuring.)<br />
</span></p>
<p>Detection does require special sensing hardware, of course. But things are already moving on that front: Google has been dipping its toe in already, via <a href="https://atap.google.com/soli/">project </a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><a href="https://atap.google.com/soli/">Soli</a> &#8212; adding a</span> radar sensor to the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Pixel 4, for example. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Google&#8217;s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/googles-soli-returns-to-track-sleep-on-the-new-nest-hub/">Nest Hub</a> also integrates the same radar sense to track sleep quality.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google’s Soli radar returns to track sleep on the new Nest Hub&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/googles-soli-returns-to-track-sleep-on-the-new-nest-hub/embed/#?secret=KCqR6ZZQWQ" data-secret="KCqR6ZZQWQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;One of the reasons we haven’t seen more adoption of radar sensors in phones is a lack of compelling use cases (sort of a chicken and egg problem),&#8221; Harris tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Our research into radar-based activity detection helps to open more applications (e.g., smarter Siris, who know when you are eating, or making dinner, or cleaning, or working out, etc.).&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked whether he sees greater potential in mobile or fixed applications, Harris reckons there are interesting use-cases for both.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see use cases in both mobile and non mobile,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Returning to the Nest Hub&#8230; the sensor is already in the room, so why not use that to bootstrap more advanced functionality in a Google smart speaker (like rep counting your exercises).</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a bunch of radar sensors already used in building to detect occupancy (but now they can detect the last time the room was cleaned, for example).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall, the cost of these sensors is going to drop to a few dollars very soon (some on eBay are already around $1), so you can include them in everything,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;And as Google is showing with a product that goes in your bedroom, the threat of a &#8216;surveillance society&#8217; is much less worry-some than with camera sensors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/vergesense-raises-12m-series-b-for-its-workplace-analytics-service/">VergeSense</a> are already using sensor hardware and computer vision technology to power real-time analytics of indoor space and activity for the b2b market (such as measuring office occupancy).</p>
<p>But even with local processing of low-resolution image data, there could still be a perception of privacy risk around the use of vision sensors &#8212; certainly in consumer environments.</p>
<p>Radar offers an alternative to such visual surveillance that could be a better fit for privacy-risking consumer connected devices such as &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/take-peloton-style-classes-through-a-smart-mirror/">smart mirrors</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is processed locally, would you put a camera in your bedroom? Bathroom? Maybe I’m prudish but I wouldn’t personally,&#8221; says Harris.</p>
<p>He also points to <a href="https://chrisharrison.net/index.php/Research/SyntheticSensors">earlier research</a> which he says underlines the value of incorporating more types of sensing hardware: &#8220;The more sensors, the longer tail of interesting applications you can support. Cameras can’t capture everything, nor do they work in the dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cameras are pretty cheap these days, so hard to compete there, even if radar is a bit cheaper. I do believe the strongest advantage is privacy preservation,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Of course having any sensing hardware &#8212; visual or otherwise &#8212; raises potential privacy issues.</p>
<p>A sensor that tells you when a child&#8217;s bedroom is occupied may be good or bad depending on who has access to the data, for example. And all sorts of human activity can generate sensitive information, depending on what&#8217;s going on. (I mean, do you really want your smart speaker to know when you&#8217;re having sex?)</p>
<p>So while radar-based tracking may be less invasive than some other types of sensors it doesn&#8217;t mean there are no potential privacy concerns at all.</p>
<p>As ever, it depends on where and how the sensing hardware is being used. Albeit, it&#8217;s hard to argue that the data radar generates is likely to be less sensitive than equivalent visual data were it to be exposed via a breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any sensor should naturally raise the question of privacy &#8212; it is a spectrum rather than a yes/no question,&#8221; agrees Harris.  &#8220;Radar sensors happen to be usually rich in detail, but highly anonymizing, unlike cameras. If your doppler radar data leaked online, it’d be hard to be embarrassed about it. No one would recognize you. If cameras from inside your house leaked online, well&#8230; &#8221;</p>
<p>What about the compute costs of synthesizing the training data, given the lack of immediately available doppler signal data?</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn’t turnkey, but there are many large video corpuses to pull from (including things like Youtube-8M),&#8221; he says. &#8220;It is orders of magnitude faster to download video data and create synthetic radar data than having to recruit people to come into your lab to capture motion data.</p>
<p>&#8220;One is inherently 1 hour spent for 1 hour of quality data. Whereas you can download hundreds of hours of footage pretty easily from many excellently curated video databases these days. For every hour of video, it takes us about 2 hours to process, but that is just on one desktop machine we have here in the lab. The key is that you can parallelize this, using Amazon AWS or equivalent, and process 100 videos at once, so the throughput can be extremely high.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while RF signal does reflect, and do so to different degrees off of different surfaces (aka &#8220;multi-path interference&#8221;), Harris says the signal reflected by the user &#8220;is by far the dominant signal&#8221;. Which means they didn&#8217;t need to model other reflections in order to get their demo model working. (Though he notes that could be done to further hone capabilities &#8220;by extracting big surfaces like walls/ceiling/floor/furniture with computer vision and adding that into the synthesis stage&#8221;.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The [doppler] signal is actually very high level and abstract, and so it&#8217;s not particularly hard to process in real time (much less &#8216;pixels&#8217; than a camera).&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Embedded processors in cars use radar data for things like collision breaking and blind spot monitoring, and those are low end CPUs (no deep learning or anything).&#8221;</p>
<p>The research is being presented at the ACM CHI conference, alongside another Group project &#8212; called <a href="https://karan-ahuja.com/poseotg.html">Pose-on-the-Go</a> &#8212; which uses smartphone sensors to approximate the user&#8217;s full-body pose without the need for wearable sensors.</p>
<p>CMU researchers from the Group have also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/11/google-funded-super-sensor-project-brings-iot-powers-to-dumb-appliances/">previously demonstrated</a> a method for indoor &#8216;smart home&#8217; sensing on the cheap (also without the need for cameras), as well as &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/worldgaze-uses-smartphone-cameras-to-help-voice-assistants-cut-to-the-chase/">last year</a> &#8212; showing how smartphone cameras could be used to give an on-device AI assistant more contextual savvy.</p>
<p>In recent years they&#8217;ve also investigated using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/new-tech-lets-robots-feel-their-environment/">laser vibrometry</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/09/how-a-tap-could-tame-the-smart-home/">electromagnetic noise</a> to give smart devices better environmental awareness and contextual functionality. Other interesting research out of the Group includes using conductive spray paint to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/08/new-technique-turns-anything-into-a-touch-sensor/">turn anything into a touchscreen</a>. And various methods to extend the interactive potential of wearables &#8212; such as by using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/20/skin-buttons-are-working-buttons-projected-onto-the-skin/">lasers to project virtual buttons</a> onto the arm of a device user or incorporating another wearable (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/06/want-more-screen-space-on-your-smartwatch-put-a-ring-on-it/">a ring</a>) into the mix.</p>
<p>The future of human computer interaction looks certain to be a lot more contextually savvy &#8212; even if current-gen &#8216;smart&#8217; devices can still stumble on the basics and seem more than a little dumb.</p>
