										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever had to take out a loan, you know just how many documents are involved in the approval process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process is tedious and time-consuming, and in many more cases than you’d expect &#8212; still manual.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ocrolus.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocrolus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a startup that is hoping to change that with an automation platform that it says analyzes financial documents with over 99% accuracy. To that end, the New York-based company today has announced that it has raised $80 million in Series C funding toward its mission of helping lenders automate the underwriting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fin VC led the financing, which values New York-based Ocrolus at “north of $500 million” and brings its total funding raised since its 2014 inception to over $100 million. Thomvest Ventures, Mubadala Ventures, Oak HC/FT, FinTech Collective, QED Investors, Bullpen Capital, ValueStream Ventures, Laconia, RiverPark Ventures, Stage II Capital and Cross River Bank also participated in the latest round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is one that is refreshingly transparent about its financials. From the first quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2021, Ocrolus has grown its revenue from $1 million to $20 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), according to co-founder and CEO Sam Bobley. It has managed to land a number of high-profile fintech customers, including Brex, Enova, LendingClub, PayPal, Plaid and SoFi. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s done that by spending roughly $10 million in total sales and marketing expenses, Bobley said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it’s ready to go after more traditional financial institutions too. With its new capital, the startup plans to “more aggressively” build products for the mortgage lending and banking industries and expand its U.S. operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocrolus uses a combination of technology, including OCR (optical character recognition), machine learning/AI and big data to analyze financial documents. But what sets it apart, says Bobley, is the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) component also used in document processing to further ensure accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, the company aims to help lenders make “faster, data-driven decisions.” Its technology can classify financial documents, capture key data fields, detect fraud and analyze cash flows, according to Bobley. It’s clear that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a digital acceleration in many industries, with financial services being among the most affected. Prior to the pandemic, less than 1% of loans in the world were made online, notes Bobley. But since the COVID-19 outbreak, demand for digital lending technology among traditional financial services firms has “accelerated dramatically.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, as COVID-19 has forced financial institutions to evolve, every lender and bank has no choice but to offer online options to customers,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fin VC managing general partner and founder Logan Allin agrees, pointing out that fintechs and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">banks alike still struggle with “mountains” of digital and paper documents in extracting the financial data they need to process and analyze during the loan application process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ocrolus has emerged as one of the pillars of the fintech ecosystem and is solving for these challenges using OCR, AI/ML, and big data/analytics,” he wrote via email. “We believe that Ocrolus is just getting started in terms of the use cases and scope of their platform and we are excited about this unconstrained TAM.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocrolus is not the only player in the space, but what’s helping drive its growth and set it apart, Allin believes, is its fraud detection and compliance overlay capabilities, as well as its tailored analytics and benchmarking capabilities for its customer base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, Ocrolus started </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the intent to automate the long-term care Medicaid application process. It found that “well-paid professionals” were spending their time combing through documents page by page, line by line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we started to research the problem and what we learned is that existing technology in the market simply was not accurate enough to be useful,” Bobley told TechCrunch. Tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google offer OCR products, but many struggle at reading text off of PDFs and images, particularly when the documents are semi-structured or unstructured, Bobley said. It’s also difficult for machines to make sense of all the varying formats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We wanted to create a new way of doing this. And what we did was we built a machine learning-based platform that also incorporates humans,” he said. “The goal was that no matter what the document that was submitted looks like &#8212; if it&#8217;s a clean document from Chase, or a blurry cell phone image from a community bank in Kansas &#8212; we&#8217;ll be able to process it with perfect accuracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the solution can’t do automatically, it slices into smaller tasks and routes to its own team of analysts and quality control specialists to perform data verification. The company then uses a series of algorithm checks to make sure its workers did the work correctly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Long story short, we deliver back perfectly accurate structured digital data for every single file we process,” Bobley said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206996" style="width: 2493px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206996" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2206996 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ocrolus-data-extraction-e1632373276873.jpg" alt="" width="2483" height="1674" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206996" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocrolus </span></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About a year or so into the company’s life, the team realized that “lending was a much bigger and more attractive market opportunity”  than Medicaid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really entered the fintech lending space at the right place at the right time,” Bobley told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2016, the company had launched its official product and was generating revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the benefits of our software is that it has really helped fintech lenders scale,” Bobley said. “Our product, frankly, is 10x better than doing it manually. Once we processed the loans instantly or in a matter of minutes, when everybody else was taking hours or days, people started to come to us &#8212; including big fintech lenders &#8212; without us even having a sales force.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for Bobley, the startup is more than just about speeding up the loan process. It is also about financial inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our platform helps lenders automate underwriting and intelligently leverage cash flow and income data for credit scoring” Bobley said. “By enabling lenders to more quickly analyze diverse sources of financial data, Ocrolus levels the playing field for every borrower, providing expanded access to credit at a lower cost.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to also use its new capital to continue to hire, with a focus on its machine learning and data science teams. It’s also planning to open a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">new data quality control facility in Florida to accommodate financial institutions and government entities with onshore data requirements. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Open banking &#8212; a new approach to payments and other financial services that disrupts traditional card-based infrastructure by linking directly into banks &#8212; is having a moment. On the heels of open banking startup TrueLayer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/truelayer-nabs-130m-at-a-1b-valuation-as-open-banking-rises-as-a-viable-option-to-card-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hitting a $1 billion valuation</a> in its latest round after seeing strong traction for its services, today another open banking startup, <a href="https://www.payvyne.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vyne</a>, is officially opening for business, and announcing seed funding of $15.5 million to help it grow.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from Hearst, Entrée Capital, Triplepoint, Seedcamp, Venrex, Founder Collective and Partech, with Alex Chesterman (founder of Rightmove and CEO of Cazoo), Charlie Dellingpole (CEO and founder of ComplyAdvantage) and Will Neale (founder of Grabyo) also participating. CEO Karl MacGregor said in an interview that the round was &#8220;massively oversubscribed.&#8221;</p>
<p>London-based Vyne has been quietly building its platform &#8212; which targets merchants to help them build open-banking-based payment services &#8212; for the past 18 months, honing the tools based on feedback from early customers that it&#8217;s picked up ahead of today&#8217;s wider launch. The sizable seed round from strong investors is due to a few factors. Firstly, because of its early traction &#8212; the company says that it&#8217;s already processing millions of pounds in transactions in the UK each month, and is growing currently at a rate of 95% each month &#8212; in what (secondly) many believe is poised to be a big market in coming years. And thirdly, because of the pedigree of its four founders:</p>
<p>MacGregor&#8217;s long financial services resume included years as an executive at Barclays (at Barclaycard), online betting company Ladbrokes (where he oversaw not just payments but also fraud), and Worldpay. COO Damien Cahill spent years at Worldpay, as well as Amazon. CTO Adam Rowland was also a Worldpay alum, among other financial services roles elsewhere. And business development head Nick Daniel spent years in financial services at Logica (now part of CGI) and VocaLink (which was acquired for nearly $1 billion by Mastercard a few years ago).</p>
<p>With a lot of that experience covering payment systems based on cards and card networks, it was the perfect knowledge bank for understanding why open banking was such an important innovation, and why it had an opportunity to disrupt a lot of what&#8217;s in place today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our key takeaway over those years [of experience] was that payment cards are not a great fit for e-commerce,&#8221; MacGregor said. &#8220;They were designed 40 years ago, and are costly and inefficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that the annual cost of dealing with fraud is now at €25 billion (there is a comparable number in <a href="https://www.merchantsavvy.co.uk/payment-fraud-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this report</a>), and that&#8217;s before considering other issues related the friction of using cards for payments, such as shopping cart abandonment (users give up instead of pulling out cards and punching numbers in), mistyped details, and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Because of that, MacGregor said many in the industry, including Vyne&#8217;s co-founders, &#8220;saw open banking as a huge opportunity&#8221; to transform the rails around how people get paid. &#8220;That is a global scale opportunity, and this is what motivates us,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p>MacGregor claims that implementing an open-banking-based system can save a merchant up to 65% in costs because of the added speed and efficiency (and no longer needing to pay fees to card networks).</p>
<p>TrueLayer&#8217;s value in the market, as one of the early movers in this space, has been in how it worked with a wide range of major and smaller banks to help build the infrastructure and services to integrate their banking services into a wider network where they could be used for direct payments and providing other kinds of financial data about their customers. It then used that critical mass to build out the connectors to those who wanted to use those integrations to do stuff: build payment flows, authenticate users and more.</p>
<p>As a later entrant, Vyne&#8217;s value has been in using some of that groundwork to then focus more on the merchant end of that ecosystem, and to make their open-banking-based services work more seamlessly for their customers. For example, if a customer selects an open banking option for payment in an app, the customer is then redirected to the banking app used for banking to authenticate the transaction and the connection without needing to enter any details. &#8220;The UX has been significantly improved,&#8221; MacGregor said.</p>
<p>Targeting primarily digitally native consumers as the most likely early adopters, Vyne also lets merchants build QR codes and pay-by-link to complete transactions.</p>
<p>The fact that we&#8217;re still talking about early adopters, however, speaks to the bigger challenges that exist, not just for Vyne but all startups focused on open banking. Open banking is at its most mature state in the UK, but even here it&#8217;s relatively young: regulations only came into effect at the start of January 2018. Europe has followed on, and although there are companies like Plaid in the U.S. that have made some interesting headway in building services that bypass payment rails, regulation has been <a href="https://www.finextra.com/the-long-read/234/why-bidens-executive-order-is-a-green-light-for-us-open-banking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow to follow</a>. Some have even <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/open-banking-treasury-prime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculated</a> it may never arrive.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s catchily-named <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Banking Implementation Entity</a> (OBIE for short), a trade body for those building in this area, is predictably upbeat about growth. However, if the numbers speak for themselves, there is clear opportunity. The OBIE <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/news/three-years-since-psd2-marked-the-start-of-open-banking-the-uk-has-built-a-world-leading-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a recent report</a> that some 300 fintechs are now in the open banking ecosystem, and more than 2.5 million consumers in the UK are using services enabled by open banking (these include payments, getting lines of credit, authenticating services, and more). And, API call volumes reached 6 billion in 2020, up from just 66.8 million in 2018. Adoption is coming, if perhaps slowly and not as internationally as what open banking is trying to replace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our view is that this is the hockey stick of growth that all VCs like,&#8221; Megumi Ikeda, the MD for Hearst Investments, said in an interview. &#8220;The second factor is the habits of consumers. They have shifted to a cashless economy [but] merchants are still operating on old banking rails&#8230; Open banking helps the merchants catch up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps just as importantly, by giving customers a more direct grip on how and where their financial data is used, by dis-intermediating the card companies (and credit ratings, and many others involved) in the process, open banking is part of a bigger evolution in how personal data and information are being used. As systems catch up with what we use them for, that can only be a good thing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earning passive income as an investor in single-family rental homes is a dream for many, but also something that can be intimidating to break into.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.awning.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awning</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a startup that aims to make the process less intimidating through a platform designed to allow individuals to invest in single-family rental homes not just in the cities or states in which they live but in other markets remotely as well. And today, the San Francisco-based real estate brokerage is coming out of stealth with $9.3 million in a seed funding round led by Global Founders Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MassMutual Ventures and several strategic angel investors, including Side co-founders Guy Gal &amp; Ed Wu, SafeGraph founder Auren Hoffman, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opendoor’s former VP of Analytics Peter Fishman, Lightspeed Ventures Partner Justin Overdorff</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Scale founder Lucy Guo, also participated in the financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Shri Ganeshram</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">teamed up with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danaus Chang in 2019 to start</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Awning after stints as a founding team member at FlightCar and lead product and engineering at Eaze. Prior to becoming an entrepreneur, Ganeshram had dropped out of high school in Texas after gaining early admission to MIT (where he later co-founded FlightCar).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform launched in closed access earlier this year, and is today open to investors across the U.S. and Canada. Currently, it connects buyers with listings in three states &#8212; California, Texas and Florida. Part of the plans for the new capital is to add new markets to its portfolio in the coming months.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a similar, but different, model to another startup we covered recently &#8212; Mynd, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a company that also aims to make it easier for people to buy and manage single-family rental properties, which last week announced it had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/mynd-raises-57-3m-from-qed-investors-at-a-870m-valuation-to-give-people-a-way-to-invest-in-rental-properties-remotely/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $57.3 million in funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from QED Investors.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Unlike Mynd, Awning won’t manage the properties for investors. It is also different in that it is focused on helping individual investors, while Mynd also serves institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awning’s &#8220;advisors&#8221; (also licensed real estate agents) curate properties that they believe are the best fit for an investor based on their budget and goals, and using the startup’s proprietary machine learning model, can estimate the rent, expenses, appreciation and potential ROI on every listing on the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform does this by ingesting all the listings from different MLSes in the various markets, and automatically analyzes each one for returns and risks after an advisor learns about a potential investor’s financial goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once an investor is ready to move further, they can use our platform to communicate with an advisor and place offers,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ganeshram said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207226" style="width: 2828px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207226" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg" alt="" width="2818" height="1528" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg 2818w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=768,416 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=1536,833 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=2048,1110 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2818px) 100vw, 2818px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207226" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Awning</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ganeshram, the process to invest in single-family rentals has been “cumbersome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It feels like it’s stuck in the last century,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awning’s “strong” human and technology components make it a faster and easier experience, the company claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the platform has helped facilitate the sale of $5 million in real estate. It makes money by taking a commission from the seller, just as other real estate brokerages do, and doesn’t charge any additional fees. That commission is typically 6% built into the listing, paid upon closing &#8212; with 3% going to the respective agents for the buyer and seller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later this year, Awning plans to launch in Florida and Alabama, and then other markets over the next year. Expansion can be challenging because the company must set up a licensed brokerage in each state it wants to enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Founders Capital’s </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donaldstalter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don Stalter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said his firm has known Awning co-founders “for years” before Awning&#8217;s formation, and when they approached his firm about starting the company, he “knew that we needed to lead their first round of financing,” Stalter wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kendrickgeluzkho/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kendrick Kho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Global Founders Capital said he has invested in other real estate investment startups over the past five years, and believed that Awning stands out from other offerings with its focus on individual buyers, rather than institutions. He also likes the company’s approach of  “getting buyers familiar with their potential investments as actual physical houses instead of lines on a spreadsheet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was also attracted to the fact that Awning does not reject the idea of partnering with real estate agents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of entrepreneurs in real estate tech believe that human agents are superfluous, but don&#8217;t realize that when a buyer in New York City wants to buy their very first investment property and are looking at homes hundreds of miles away,” Kho added, “he or she wants a human agent there to answer questions and be an expert guide on the process.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EU lawmakers are finally set to standardize charging ports for consumer electronics devices like smartphones and tablets &#8212; <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4613">announcing</a> a proposal today that, once adopted, will see the region settle on USB-C as a universal charging port for gadgets which will also include cameras, headphones, portable speakers and handheld videogames consoles.</p>
<p>Some smaller consumer electronics devices &#8212; like smart watches and fitness bands &#8212; are being excluded owing to factors like their size and conditions of use.</p>
<p>The Commission plan will also see regional lawmakers unbundle the sale of chargers from mobiles so they are not automatically included in the box.</p>
<p>Fast charging standards will also be harmonized under the proposal &#8212; while device makers will have requirements to provide users with &#8220;relevant information about charging performance&#8221;, including info on the power required and if a device supports fast charging.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will make it easier for consumers to see if their existing chargers meet the requirements of their new device or help them to select a compatible charger,&#8221; the Commission notes, going on to suggest that the full package of measures will help consumers limit the number of new chargers they buy and help them save €250M a year on unnecessary charger purchases.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4613">announcement</a> of the proposal, the Commission acknowledges that the &#8220;voluntary approach&#8221; it has pursued for over a decade &#8212; attempting to nudge the electronics industry toward a common standard through mechanisms like a Memorandum of Understanding &#8212; has failed to deliver the sought for standard, with still three different types of mobile phone chargers in play for instance.</p>
<p>The wider aim here is to make a meaningful dent in the global e-waste mountain by reducing a portion generated by the consumer electronics sector &#8212; with the Commission noting, for example, that consumers already own around three mobile phone chargers on average, of which they use two on a regular basis. Ergo, there&#8217;s simply no call for device makers to put a new charger in the box every time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Disposed of unused chargers are estimated to represent some 11,000 tonnes of e-waste annually, the Commission adds.</p>
<p>One of the non-standard chargers still on the mobile market belongs to the iPhone maker Apple, of course &#8212; which has resisted pressure to put a standard port in its devices &#8212; so a pan-EU law to enforce a universal charger could force the tech giant to finally abandon its proprietary Lightning port.</p>
<p>For years, Apple has presided over a sprawling and doubtless highly lucrative accessories business rather than switch to more standard ports on its devices. Indeed, sometimes it has even removed standard ports &#8212; deleting the 3.5mm headphone jack off of the iPhone, for instance. It means that users of Apple&#8217;s devices typically have to purchase dongles if they wish to gain access to more standard ports &#8212; generating yet more future e-waste.</p>
<p>Whether the EU&#8217;s legislative proposal will actually outlaw Apple&#8217;s dongle-based workaround to embedded universality remains to be seen. (We&#8217;ve put the question to the Commission.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Z8Np6agVet"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/eu-lawmakers-take-fresh-aim-at-apples-lightning-connector-with-latest-e-waste-push/">EU lawmakers take fresh aim at Apple&#8217;s Lightning connector with latest e-waste push</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU lawmakers take fresh aim at Apple&#8217;s Lightning connector with latest e-waste push&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/eu-lawmakers-take-fresh-aim-at-apples-lightning-connector-with-latest-e-waste-push/embed/#?secret=Z8Np6agVet" data-secret="Z8Np6agVet" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Commenting on the Commission proposal in a statement, Margrethe Vestager, its EVP for digital strategy, said: “European consumers were frustrated long enough about incompatible chargers piling up in their drawers. We gave industry plenty of time to come up with their own solutions, now time is ripe for legislative action for a common charger. This is an important win for our consumers and environment and in line with our green and digital ambitions.”</p>
<p>In a mirror statement, Thierry Breton, the EU&#8217;s internal market, added: “Chargers power all our most essential electronic devices. With more and more devices, more and more chargers are sold that are not interchangeable or not necessary. We are putting an end to that. With our proposal, European consumers will be able to use a single charger for all their portable electronics – an important step to increase convenience and reduce waste.”</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s other institutions &#8212; the European Parliament and Council &#8212; will still need to back the proposal in order for it to become law. Although the European Parliament has long expressed frustration with the Commission&#8217;s failure to deliver a common charging standard &#8212; and voted overwhelmingly for tougher action on the issue <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/eu-lawmakers-take-fresh-aim-at-apples-lightning-connector-with-latest-e-waste-push/">last year</a> &#8212; so MEPs will likely be keen to make a pan-EU law on this happen.</p>
<p>Even so, there won&#8217;t be a radical change overnight. The Commission has suggested a transition period of 24 months from the data of adoption of the legislative &#8212; so even if the Parliament and Council quickly agree to the plan it will still be years, plural, before device makers have to comply.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s PR notes that it wants to give industry &#8220;ample time&#8221; to adapt to the planned law change, even though the sector has had over a decade of pressure on exactly this issue.</p>
<p>A further step will be needed for Europe to get the common charger solution the Commission wants &#8212; with more harmonization required to ensure interoperability of the external power supply. Legislators say that piece will be dealt with by the review of the Ecodesign Regulation &#8212; slated to be launched later this year with the aim of it also entering into force at the same time as the common charger port requirement.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_4614">FAQ</a> on the latter proposal, the Commission answers its own question on why it&#8217;s taken it so long to grasp the legislative nettle with this issue, writing that it had initially sought to continue with a more &#8220;ambitious&#8221; voluntary approach in the hopes that the sector would engage. However it said proposals put forward by the industry &#8220;fell short&#8221; &#8212; and would not have delivered a common charging solution.</p>
<p>Legislators learning that they do actually need to legislate looks like an important lesson as the world gears up to tackle other existential environmental challenges &#8212; like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/uns-ipcc-report-on-climate-change-sounds-code-red-for-planet/">climate change</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/calyxia-bags-17-6m-to-tackle-the-global-microplastics-problem/">microplastics pollution</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly been devastating on many levels. But if there’s any silver lining in the global crisis, it could be that it’s less taboo to talk about feeling anxious, depressed or burnt out. Because chances are, the person you’re talking to is feeling one of those things too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it’s no surprise that therapists and psychiatrists alike are struggling to keep up with demand. But not all therapists are created equal and unfortunately, there are psychiatrists out there that can be too quick to dole out medicine to treat a person’s issues.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.meruhealth.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meru Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a startup that aims to solve a number of the challenges associated with getting access to quality mental health care, with what it describes as a comprehensive online mental health solution. Kristian Ranta founded the San Mateo, California-based company in 2016 after his brother, Peter, committed suicide. In his view, if his brother had access to better mental health options, he might not have taken his own life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As COVID forced people to seek online options for all types of healthcare, including mental health, it’s no surprise that Meru Health grew its customer base by 10x and saw about 700% revenue growth in 2020. And today, the startup is announcing that it has secured $38 million in a Series B round of funding, bringing its total raised since its 2016 inception to $51.3 million. Industry Ventures led the $30 million equity round. The remaining $8 million was secured in debt. Early backers Bold Capital Partners, Freestyle VC, FMZ Ventures and Leksell Social Ventures also participated in the equity financing, while J.P. Morgan funded the debt portion of the round.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first two or three years of Meru Health’s life, Ranta focused mostly on research to determine just how well digital therapy and “old school” psychiatry was working. The evidence out there, he felt, was flimsy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things the company concluded was that “digital is great bu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t without the human touch, it&#8217;s not going to get utilization.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or in other words, purely app-based solutions just won’t cut it when it comes to treating depression, anxiety and burnout.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But if there’s no kind of accountability, there or there is no human connection, it’s going to be much harder to keep people engaged and people end up dropping out,” Ranta told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meru Health works with employers such as Stanford University and several Fortune 100 and 500 companies, EAPs such as Wellspring and healthcare payers such as Cigna, Humana and Moda Health to provide an online mental healthcare program that it says </span><a href="https://www.meruhealth.com/science#studies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strong and lasting clinical outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has been able to sell its solution to employers by demonstrating that the benefits of offering the program to employees far outweighs the cost. Specifically, Meru estimates that the average cost savings for an employer for its program is over $6,000 per enrolled participant because the downstream healthcare costs and reduced worker productivity of untreated anxiety and depression are so high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s interesting about Meru Health’s approach is that it aims to be a holistic one &#8212; treating both the mind and body concurrently, rather than just focusing on one thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We learned, for example, if we just do talk therapy, it doesn’t work for all mental health struggles,” Ranta said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, it helps patients with getting better sleep and nutritional coaching because, as Ranta puts it, “sleep is interconnected to mental health.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We still haven’t seen anyone else look at the food and mood connection,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also provides a wearable device to capture physical biomarkers so people can see the effects of things like deep breathing and “start to control their own response to stress,” Ranta said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holistic approach seems to be resonating, and Meru’s plans with the capital include getting fully covered by carriers in more states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are building out our nationwide network, and how to be in 40 states by year’s end,” Ranta said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also, naturally, plans to add to its staff of about 170.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also intends to continue clinical trials, and “do science properly,” as Ranta puts it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do open data sharing through trials with the best universities and share all the results openly,” he said. “We’re now showing with research that this approach has 3-5x better clinical results than the standard of care in the U.S., and a roughly 80% completion rate, which compares to 30% to 50% in traditional therapy because we engage people dramatically better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That engagement caught the eye of Industry Ventures VP Fanni Fan, who said her firm has been following the mental health space for years and “looking to back entrepreneurs leveraging technology to improve access and quality of care in behavioral health.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meru Health stood out among its competitors in many ways, she told TechCrunch, including its “exceptionally high engagement and completion rates, strong clinical outcomes validated by long-term clinical studies and three month curriculum coupled with biofeedback that drive engagement and also enable payers to measure outcomes more easily.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cinematic Mode on the iPhone 13 Pro models had a marquee spot in Apple’s presentation about the devices last week. The reviews so far this week have people acknowledging the cleverness but questioning its usefulness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been testing out the feature for the past week and this weekend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/the-iphone-13-pro-goes-to-disneyland/">took it to Disneyland</a> to give it a real-world rundown in a way that thousands or even millions of people might do over the next few years. Aside from my personal testing, some of which I’ll talk about here and more about which you can find in my iPhone review here, I wanted to dig a bit deeper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I spoke to Kaiann Drance, VP, Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing and Johnnie Manzari, a designler on Apple’s Human Interface Team about the goals and creation of the feature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We knew that bringing a high quality depth of field to video would be magnitudes more challenging [than Portrait Mode],” says Drance. “Unlike photos, video is designed to move as the person filming, including hand shake. And that meant we would need even higher quality depth data so Cinematic Mode could work across subjects, people, pets, and objects, and we needed that depth data continuously to keep up with every frame. Rendering these autofocus changes in real time is a heavy computational workload.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The A15 Bionic and Neural Engine are heavily used in Cinematic Mode, especially given that they wanted to encode it in Dolby Vision HDR as well. They also didn’t want to sacrifice live preview &#8212; something that most Portrait Mode competitors took years to ship after Apple introduced it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the concept of Cinematic Mode didn’t start with the feature itself, says Manzari. In fact, he says, it’s typically the opposite inside of this design team at Apple. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn&#8217;t have an idea [for Cinematic Mode]. We were just curious &#8212; what is it about filmmaking that&#8217;s been timeless? And that kind of leads down this interesting road and then we started to learn more and talk more&#8230;with people across the company that can help us solve these problems.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drance says that before development began, Apple’s design team spent time researching cinematography techniques for realistic focus transitions and optical characteristics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you look at the design process,” says Manzari, “we begin with a deep reverence and respect for image and filmmaking through history. We&#8217;re fascinated with questions like what principles of image and filmmaking are timeless? What craft has endured culturally and why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when Apple decides to deviate from the classical techniques, Manzari says, they try to make those decisions thoughtfully and respectfully in regards to the original context. The team focuses on finding a way to create something that removes complexity and unlocks potential for people by leveraging Apple’s design and engineering capacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/hands-on-with-the-iphone-7-plus-crazy-new-portrait-mode/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">process of developing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Portrait Lighting feature, Apple’s design team on an exploration of classic portrait artists like Avedon and Warhol and painters like Rembrandt and Chinese brush portraits. In many cases going to visit the original pieces and breaking down those characteristics in the lab. A similar process was used to develop Cinematic Mode.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2465.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2207399" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2465.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2465.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2465.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2465.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2465.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2465.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2465.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2465.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2465.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing that the team did was go to speak to some of the best cinematographers and camera operators in the world. They also went to movies and watched examples of films through time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In doing this, certain trends emerge,” says Manzari. It was obvious that focus and focus changes were fundamental storytelling tools, and that we as a cross functional team needed to understand precisely how and when they were used.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They then worked closely with directors of photography, camera operators and 1st ACs, whose responsibilities include focus pulling. Observing them on set and asking questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was also just really inspiring to be able to talk to cinematographers about why they use shallow depth of field. And what purpose it serves in the storytelling. And the thing that we walked away with is, and this is actually a quite timeless insight: You need to guide the viewer&#8217;s attention.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now the problem is that today, this is for skilled professionals,” Manzari notes. “This is not something that a normal person would even attempt to take on, because it is so hard. A single mistake &#8212; being off by a few inches&#8230;this was something we learned from portrait mode. If you&#8217;re on the ear and you&#8217;re not on their eyes. It&#8217;s throwaway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not even counting tracking shots, where a focus puller is continually adjusting focus as the camera moves and even the subject moves in relation to the camera. It’s a highly skilled operation. To pull off a tracking shot, a focus puller must practice and train extensively for years. This, Manzari says, is where Apple sees an opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We feel like this is the kind of thing that Apple tackles the best. To take something difficult and conventionally hard to learn, and then turn it into something, automatic and simple.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the team started working through the technical problems in finding focus, locking focus and racking focus. And these explorations led them to gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In cinema, the role of gaze and body movement to direct that story is so fundamental. And as humans we naturally do this, if you look at something, I look at it too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So they knew they would need to build in gaze detection to help lead their focusing target around the frame, which in turn leads the viewer through the story. Being on set, Manzari says, allowed Apple to observe these highly skilled technicians and then build in that feel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re on set and we have all these amazing people and they&#8217;re really the best of the best. And one of the engineers noticed that the focus puller has this focus control wheel, and he&#8217;s just studying the way that this person does this. Just like when you look at like someone who&#8217;s really good at playing the piano, and it looks so easy, and yet you know it&#8217;s impossible. There&#8217;s no way you&#8217;re going to be able to do this,” says Manzari. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This person is an artist, this person is so good at what they do and the craft they put into it. And so we spent a lot of time trying to model the analog feel of a focus wheel turning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This included the way that long distances of focus change are covered differently than short distances because of the way that the speed of handling a focus wheel ramps up and down. If, he notes, the focus changes don’t feel deliberate and natural, you don’t end up with a storytelling tool. Because a storytelling tool should feel invisible. If you’re watching a movie and notice a focus technique it’s probably because it’s soft and the focus puller missed their mark (or an actor did). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, a lot of these artistic and technical desires that the team came away from their explorations with became really challenging machine learning problems. Thankfully, Apple has a team of machine learning researchers and a silicon team that built the Neural Engine on hand to collaborate with. Some of the problems contained inside the Cinematic Mode are genuinely new and unique ML problems. Many of them ended up being fairly thorny, involving </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333523373_On_the_Potential_for_Open-Endedness_in_Neural_Networks"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open-endedness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> techniques to keep the effects nuanced and organic feeling.</span></p>
<p><b>Testing Cinematic Mode</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My aim in my tests was to shoot what I could in 1 day (and a bit of an afternoon at the pool) just like anyone going to Disneyland would hope to do. One person holding the camera, no setup and very little direction. Now and then I asked a kid to look at me. That&#8217;s about it. What you see in this reel is as close as possible to what you would experience doing this yourself, which is the whole point. There isn’t a bunch of b-roll, I didn’t re-shoot this stuff over and over. What you see is what was shot. The only editing that I did here was using Cinematic Mode to pick some points of focus after the fact, either for effect or because the automatic detection chose something I didn&#8217;t like. I didn’t have to do a lot of that but I was happy I was able to.</span></p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3JcEG5Vjt-w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This footage is not perfect by any means, and neither is Cinematic Mode. The synthetic bokeh that Apple has gotten so good at with Portrait Mode absolutely suffers from having to be performed so many times per second. The focus tracking can still be a bit jumpy too &#8212; making post-shooting editing far more common that it is probably intended to be. And though I found that it does work just fine in low light settings, it’s best if you’re within range of the LiDAR array (about 10 feet or less) if you want accurate results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you can see what they are after and where it is headed. And I found it absolutely usable and fun right now. I know a lot of reviews kind of breezed over it but I think that artificially testing this kind of new thing is a rough way to interpret how it will work for the normal person. It’s one of the reasons I started testing iPhones at Disneyland in 2014. We were exiting the speeds and feeds era with haste as the iPhone began to be used by millions of people &#8212; strapping it to a dyno to test the ol’ HP just wasn’t an important thing to do any more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not all that shocked that an artificial testing framework caused a lot of early reviewers to see primarily flaws (they are there!) but I see a lot more potential.</span></p>
<p><b>What it is</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cinematic Mode is actually a bundle of functions that exist in a new section of the camera app. It leverages nearly every major component of the iPhone to do its thing. It utilizes the CPU and GPU, of course, but also Apple’s Neural Engine for machine learning work, accelerometers for tracking and motion and of course the upgraded wide-angle lens and stabilized sensor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the individual components that make up Cinematic Mode include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subject recognition and tracking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus locking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rack focusing (moving focus from one subject to another in an organic-looking way) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image overscan and in camera stabilization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synthetic Bokeh (lens blur)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A post-shot editing mode that lets you alter your focus points even after shooting</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And all of those things are happening in real-time.</span></p>
<p><b>The way it works</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The processing power to do all of this in a real time preview and in post edits and 30 times per second is intense, to say the least. This is why you see those big leaps forward in performance in the Neural Engine and </span><a href="https://creativestrategies.com/iphone-13-and-apple-silicon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">massive leaps in GPU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Apple’s A15 chips. It’s needed to pull stuff like this off. What’s crazy is that I didn’t really notice any appreciable hit in battery life even though I played with the mode a lot throughout the day. Once again Apple’s power-per-watt work in evidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even while you’re shooting, the power is evident as the live preview gives you a pretty damn accurate view of what you’re going to see. And while you shoot, the iPhone is using signals from your accelerometer to predict whether you’re moving </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">toward</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">away</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the subject that it has locked onto so that it can quickly adjust focus for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time it is using the power of ‘gaze’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This gaze detection can predict which subject you might want to move to next and if one person in your scene looks at another or at an object in the field, the system can automatically rack focus to that subject. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Apple already overscans the sensor for stabilization &#8212; effectively looking ‘beyond the edges’ of your frame &#8212; the design team found that they could utilize this for subject prediction as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A focus puller doesn&#8217;t wait for the subject to be fully framed before doing the rack, they&#8217;re anticipating and they&#8217;ve started the rack,” notes Manzari, “before the person&#8217;s even there. And we realize that by running the full sensor we can anticipate that motion. And, by the time the person has shown up, it&#8217;s already focused on them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can see this in one of the later clips in my video above, where my daughter enters the frame bottom left already in focus, as if an invisible focus puller was anticipating her entering the scene and drawing the viewer’s attention there &#8212; to the new entry into the story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And even after you shoot, you can correct the focus points or make creative decisions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One cool thing about the post-shooting focus selection is that because the lenses in iPhones are so small, they naturally have an extremely deep field of focus available to them (hence the synthetic Bokeh of Portrait and Cinematic Mode). This means that unless you are extremely close to an object, anything in the frame is available for you to pick from to focus on. The changes are then made in real-time using the depth information and segmentation masking that Cinematic Mode carries along with every video shot to re-generate the synthetic lens blur. </span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/the-iphone-13-pro-goes-to-disneyland/">review of the iPhone 13 Pro</a> I said this about Cinematic Mode: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the marketing, this mode is intended to unlock new creative possibilities for the vast majority of iPhone users who have no idea how to set focal distances, bend their knees to stabilize and crouch-walk-rack-focus their way to these kinds of tracking shots. It really does open up a big bucket that was just inaccessible before. And in many cases I think that those willing to experiment and deal with its near-term foibles will be rewarded with some great-looking shots to add to their iPhone memories widget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t care what filmmakers Apple brings in to demo the feature &#8212; I do not actually believe that those people who are the most capable with a camera are the ones that stand to gain the most from the feature. Instead, it is the rest of us that have a hand free if we’re lucky and some basic desire to capture the feeling of what it was like to be there &#8212; sometimes instead of the harsh reality. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s the power of the language of cinema: transportation. Though it’s far from perfect in this initial iteration, Cinematic Mode gives ‘normal people’ a toolkit to build a doorway into that world in a way that’s far easier and far more accessible than it has been in the past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, there’s lots to complain about if you’re staring closely. But also lots to love if you’ve got one shot to get your kid’s reaction to seeing Kylo Ren in the flesh for the first time. And it’s hard to argue </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">against</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accessibility of these tools just because they aren’t yet perfect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One thing that just makes me so proud is when somebody comes to me and they show me their photos&#8230;and they are so proud of what they&#8217;ve captured, and they&#8217;re just beaming because they all of a sudden feel like I&#8217;m creative! I didn&#8217;t even go to art school, I&#8217;m not a designer. No one ever thought of me as a photographer, but my photos look amazing,” says Manzari. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cinema kind of showed us the range of human emotion and the range of human stories and that if you get the fundamentals right they can be communicated.

					<description><![CDATA[The behavioral health startup helps therapists launch their own private practices that are covered by insurance.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Behavioral health is not only a business for Jake Cooper, it is also personal. The <a href="https://growtherapy.com/">Grow Therapy</a> co-founder and CEO has been managing ADHD since he was a child.</p>
<p>He began working with a psychiatrist, and his parents could afford the $300 per session, but when they tried to find an in-network clinician, they came up short. Though Cooper was fortunate his parents were able to make the finances work, he recognizes that this type of care is out of reach for most Americans.</p>
<p>With a mission of providing access to affordable, in-network therapists, Cooper, who came from an investment background, joined with friends he met in college: Dr. Manoj Kanagaraj and Alan Ni, a former product manager at Stripe and Google, to create Grow Therapy, a behavioral health startup that helps therapists launch their own private practices that are covered by insurance.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mental health startups are raising spirits and venture capital&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/mental-health-startups-are-raising-spirits-and-venture-capital/embed/#?secret=LYx36VLZq3" data-secret="LYx36VLZq3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today, the New York-based company announced $15 million in Series A funding, led by SignalFire, bringing the company’s total funding to date to $16.6 million since the company was founded in October 2020.</p>
<p>“On average, our providers have over 10 years of clinical experience, but for 85% of them this is their first time having an independent practice,” Cooper told TechCrunch. “They have come from community settings and other clinical jobs and wanted their own shingle.”</p>
<p>About <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/graisondangor/2020/11/19/this-startup-raised-26-million-to-help-people-find-in-network-therapists/?sh=a9abec7808b1">70% of therapists do not accept insurance</a> due to administrative burdens like all of the paperwork involved to file a claim. Add to that, over <a href="https://www.kff.org/statedata/mental-health-and-substance-use-state-fact-sheets/">30% of American adults reported symptoms of anxiety and/or depression</a>, up from 11% of adults prior to the global pandemic.</p>
<p>To make it less of a burden to accept insurance, Grow Therapy functions as the technology and centralized team providing the resources to help therapists operate in-network. In fact, one of the unique aspects of the company is that it is already working with all of the major insurance payers, Cooper said.</p>
<p>He considers Grow Therapy sitting at the intersection of payers, providers and clients. By being in-network through Grow Therapy, it cuts the price of an average visit to less than $40, and in many cases the visits are all covered. For those who choose not to go with insurance, the company enables therapists to set a sliding scale for price. Meanwhile, Grow Therapy makes revenue in the form of payments from the insurance companies when providers have a visit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We have to make sure we can deliver,” Cooper said. “Being paid by the payer is not only a privilege, but a necessity. If we can only provide out-of-pocket, we would be ignoring 90% of America.”</p>
<p>He explained that the best way to expand the company’s network was to raise capital and partner with a firm that has deep experience in building businesses and a reputation for being a true partner.</p>
<p>Cooper was referring to SignalFire and venture partner Wayne Hu, who is joining the board. Hu was connected to Cooper through a colleague who used to work with him.</p>
<p>Hu considers the approach that Grow Therapy is taking to be the “holy grail” of being able to address the supply and demand balance. The company is helping to grow the supply of people wanting to build a practice while freeing up their time from the non-core activities of maintaining a practice, like scheduling and paperwork.</p>
<p>In addition, he liked that the company was vertically integrated to provide the entire range of services for each practice so that therapists could take insurance for the first time.</p>
<p>“When you do that, you are the synthesizer of care,” Hu added. “They have all of the notes, unlike other players. They can also take the infrastructure data and make it accessible to everyone that touches the patient.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company currently has over 1,000 clinicians on its platform and is operating in five states. With the funding, it will be expanding to 10 states. Cooper is also investing in a team of folks from a degree of specialties like clinical care systems and engineering.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Loyal is building an animal pharmaceutical company that is developing therapeutics aimed at extending both lifespan and healthspan for dogs.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">San Francisco startup <a href="https://loyalfordogs.com/">Loyal</a> is rethinking the concept of longevity and starting with man’s best friend.</p>
<p>The company raised $27 million in Series A funding in a round, led by Khosla Ventures and including First Round Capital, Box Group, Collaborative Fund, The Longevity Fund and Lachy Groom — all companies involved in Loyal’s $11 million seed round raised in 2020, as well as a group of angel investors. To date, the company has raised $38 million since being founded in 2019 by founder and CEO Celine Halioua.</p>
<p>She touts her choice of investor makeup, 50% female, as a way of elevating more women in the areas of deep tech and longevity. Halioua herself comes from a background of both. She began in neuroscience at The University of Texas and from there briefly studied gene therapy at the University of Oxford before leaving to join The Longevity Fund as its chief of staff and an entrepreneur-in-residence.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-anti-aging-drugs-market-survey-2021-analysis-with-top-countries-data-growth-sizecurrent-situation-value-research-method-trend-application-and-forecast-by-2027-with-covid-19-impact-analysis-2021-09-20#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20global%20Anti,Drugs%20Scope%20and%20Market%20Size.">global anti-aging drugs market</a> was valued at nearly $8 billion in 2020 and is projected to double by 2027. Though Botox is well known in this space for its ability to smooth out wrinkles, Halioua told TechCrunch that by addressing aging it could be preventative medicine for age-related diseases affecting humans, like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer&#8217;s.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="MRkiPtYBiT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/the-next-healthcare-revolution-will-have-ai-at-its-center/">The next healthcare revolution will have AI at its center</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The next healthcare revolution will have AI at its center&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/the-next-healthcare-revolution-will-have-ai-at-its-center/embed/#?secret=MRkiPtYBiT" data-secret="MRkiPtYBiT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company’s thesis is that by intending to improve the healthspan and lifespan in dogs, that research will uncover more about how to do the same in humans. Halioua explained that a dog’s lifespan is similar to a human’s due to proximity — dogs have shared environmental factors, sometimes share the same diet and can develop the same aging diseases as humans like cardiac problems and cancer.</p>
<p>Loyal is building an animal pharmaceutical company that is developing therapeutics aimed at extending both lifespan and healthspan for dogs, utilizing companion dog citizen science studies of over 500 dogs to better understand dog aging and eventually parlay that R&amp;D into products intended for humans.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Loyal grew from a team of three to 30 people. The new funding will enable the company to build out a bigger computation biology team to continue focusing on its products: one aimed at expanding the life of large breed animals, which are known to have shorter lifespans than their small breed counterparts, and one for improving cognitive function.</p>
<p>Both of these will go into clinical studies next year, working toward U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, Halioua said. After the company can show that its drugs are doing what it says they can do — help dogs to live longer, healthier lives —Loyal will then focus on building a consumer brand that is direct-to-consumer selling directly to both veterinarians and pet parents.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our next steps are to build out our biology team and data over time so we can take on the gnarly problem of quantifying the aging process,” she added. “There is an opportunity to build a pharmaceutical brand that people love versus being confused by it. These are drugs meant for something happy — giving more years to a dog.”</p>
<p>Pets are a big industry with American spending on pets reaching nearly <a href="https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2020-04-15/annual-spending-pets-nearing-100b">$100 billion</a> in 2020, up from $95.7 billion in 2019, according to the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/american-pet-products-association">American Pet Products Association</a>. Venture capital investment into the space is also growing, for example <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/softbank-backed-embark-veterinary-valued-at-700m-after-75m-series-b/">Embark Veterinary announced a $75 million</a> round from SoftBank in July. The company offers DNA testing with the goal of curbing preventable diseases and increasing the lifespan of dogs by three years within the next decade.</p>
<p>Alexander Morgan, M.D. Ph.D., partner at Khosla Ventures, said that the pet space is an active one and is a large enough opportunity that if Loyal just wanted to focus its energy there, it could build a large, profitable business.</p>
<p>Due to dogs being a good model for human health, many studies on human diseases are done on dogs. However, there is a challenge in knowing if the drug is actually beneficial, he added.</p>
<p>“Loyal is approaching longevity with a narrow mechanism,” Morgan said. “They are differentiated by focusing on overall lifespan and healthspan. Healthspan is important because you don’t want to tack on years of unhealthy life.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jscrambler">Jscrambler</a>, a Portugal-based startup specializing in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> products that protect organizations against web data exfiltration attacks, has secured $15 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The investment, which comes two years after the startup secured $2.3 million in seed funding, was led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ace-capital-partners">Ace Capital Partners</a> and backed by existing investors Sonae IM and Portugal Ventures. Jscrambler said it will use the cash injection to &#8220;strengthen and accelerate&#8221; its product roadmap to meet its customers&#8217; expanding requirements as threat actors increasingly turn to the web.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing clear growth in complex attacks targeting the client-side of websites and yet there are currently no simple and effective solutions to deal with them,” Rui Ribeiro, Jscrambler co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. “This partially stems from misinformation surrounding technologies such as web application firewalls, and the current native browser defenses are severely lacking when it comes to effectively preventing client-side attacks.”</p>
<p>Jscrambler claims it addresses this shortfall. Its Code Integrity tool, which includes polymorphic obfuscation, code locks, and self-defending capabilities, scrambles web source code into a form that is extremely hard to reverse-engineer, helping organizations to prevent intellectual property theft, application abuse, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/piracy/">piracy</a>, and data leakage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The startup also offers a Webpage Integrity module that protects against web <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/supply-chain-attack/">supply-chain attacks</a> by detecting any sign of malicious behavior on the client-side and defining rules that effectively block and prevent malicious behavior before it happens. This tool also helps to stop <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/13/magecart-hackers-persistent-credit-card-skimmer-groups/">Magecart web skimming attacks</a> by allowing companies to create rules that effectively prevent the skimmers from running on the website and exfiltrating credit card information.</p>
<p>&#8220;This marks the beginning of an era where companies will be able to take ownership of their client-side and control everything that happens there,&#8221; Ribeiro said.</p>
<p>The startup’s Series A investment will be used to add more capabilities, including an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>integrated solution that enables website owners to protect the client-side to secure user data and improve compliance with regulations such as Europe&#8217;s GDPR, California&#8217;s CCPA, and U.S. health privacy rules HIPAA.</p>
<p>Jscrambler, which was founded in 2014 and currently has 40 employees, also announced that Pedro Abreu has joined the startup as an independent board member. Abreu is currently COO at Silicon Valley-based cyber risk startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/exabeam/">Exabeam</a>, having previously served as an executive at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/forescout/">ForeScout</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/McAfee/">McAfee</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company is investing in how to find data-quality issues faster and get to the root cause so that data outages can be prevented in the future.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bigeye.com/">Bigeye</a> on Thursday announced a $45 million in Series B funding, just six months after securing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/bigeye-formerly-toro-scores-17m-series-a-to-automate-data-quality-monitoring/">$17 million Series A</a> round.</p>
<p>Coatue led the new investment that included existing investors Sequoia Capital and Costanoa Ventures. Together, the San Francisco-based company has brought in a total of $66 million, which also includes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/toro-snags-4m-seed-investment-to-monitor-data-quality/">$4 million seed</a> raised last May.</p>
<p>The company’s technology automatically recommends and monitors data quality, for example telling customers what kind of data metrics to collect and alerting customers if there is an issue like when one of their ordering systems is down before it becomes a bigger problem.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Usage of the platform has doubled in each of the last four quarters, and the company also brought on new customers, like Clubhouse, Recharge and Udacity, prompting co-founders Kyle Kirwan and Egor Gryaznov to consider another round of funding. The co-founders met while at Uber and worked on similar data quality issues.</p>
<p>“We really started out wanting to fix the problem for people in our shoes, but we didn’t anticipate the quiet demand,” CEO Kirwan told TechCrunch. “Even in the Series A, there was demand, and to go after it, we needed to grow our engineering team even faster. There is so much to do on the product — we have the nugget of the product today, but we want to go further like explore when we detect data outages, how to prevent them the next time and how better to communicate them to the right person.”</p>
<p>In addition to engineering, the new investment will fund growth in product and go-to-market teams as well. Bigeye has 25 employees currently and Kirwan would like to see that be 40 by the end of the year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Having started with automating a way to pay attention to the right signal coming from data, Bigeye is now shifting its attention to helping data teams communicate to the rest of their company when something isn&#8217;t working or broken.</p>
<p>Kirwan plans to invest in how to make it faster to get to the root cause so that data outages can be prevented in the future. In addition, the company is also examining repetitive tasks within a customer’s workflow to see if there is an opportunity for machine learning to automate it.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Caryn Marooney, general partner at Coatue, is joining the company’s board. Coatue is one of Bigeye’s early customers; she was able to see firsthand what the platform could do.</p>
<p>Marooney said she was attracted to the team’s experience building data-quality monitoring to scale at Uber, its approach to helping data teams measure and improve their data quality and the high-level customers the company is serving.</p>
<p>Looking toward the future, she sees data monitoring and observability as a key component of the modern data stack. Rather than examine data once a quarter, companies are using it every day to make business decisions, and therefore, need a reliable method for collecting and utilizing the data.</p>
<p>“Before, if you had bad data, your dashboards would break,” Marooney added. “Today, bad data can disrupt your business. Bigeye was made by data teams for data teams, and we believe they’ve solved this reliability problem for the most data-centric businesses.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The ocean is important to countless industries, but we still only have a rough idea of what it&#8217;s like as a whole at any given time. To foster a new generation of ocean-monitoring floats and other devices, Sofar Ocean Technologies and DARPA are publishing an open hardware standard called <a href="https://www.bristlemouth.org/">Bristlemouth</a> so that researchers will have an off-the-shelf option rather than wasting their precious grant dollars solving the same engineering problems from scratch.</p>
<p>Sofar calls itself a &#8220;real-time ocean intelligence platform,&#8221; which you might think of as a sort of weather service for the seven seas. Unlike the atmosphere, however, the ocean is not easy to remotely observe with satellites and radar — you need to have hundreds, perhaps thousands of devices actually out there bobbing on the waves to understand its motions, salinity, pollutant levels, temperature, and so on.</p>
<p>While the company has its own line of business maintaining a network of its own floats, which produce valuable data it can sell to a variety of interested parties, it also wants to advance the ocean-sensing industry in general, and CEO Evan Shapiro suggests that one of the best ways to do so is to create an open hardware and software standard.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207180" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sofar-intel.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207180" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2207180" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sofar-intel.png" alt="" width="749" height="526" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sofar-intel.png 749w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sofar-intel.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sofar-intel.png?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sofar-intel.png?resize=680,478 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sofar-intel.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2207180" class="wp-caption-text">Sofar&#8217;s interface for showing currents and other ocean conditions.</p></div></p>
<p>The lack of a hardware connectivity standard is a huge hindrance to development and innovation. Today, a large portion of budgets allocated to development of new ocean technologies are spent towards resolving fundamental technical bottlenecks – power, data, and communications connectivity – rather than on actual ocean innovation,&#8221; Shapiro told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very similar to the way space companies have begun to coalesce around the idea of a few standard buses and spacecraft. If you want to observe space dust, or measure radiation outside the atmosphere or some other research goal, you want to spend your time and money on those instruments, not on building a spacecraft. Just as Rocket Lab and others are betting people would rather buy and customize a standard spacecraft than reinvent the wheel, Sofar thinks researchers focusing on the ocean would prefer to focus on their key technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;People rarely want to build a float with power systems, satellite telemetry, GPS, and a dolphin detecting hydrophone. They primarily want to build the dolphin detecting hydrophone, but in today’s environment (given the lack of hardware standards) they end up having to build the rest from scratch too. Sofar’s commercial adoption and support of Bristlemouth is vital to kick-starting value in the ecosystem,&#8221; Shapiro said, though he noted that others have attempted this before. &#8220;We’re not the first to recognize the need for standardization, nor the first to take a credible go at it. We <em>are</em> the first to do so as a large scale commercial platform provider (there’s a reason USB came from Intel, IBM and Microsoft and not a whitepaper out of Berkeley), and we’re doing so in partnership with some of the most influential movers in the domain.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207179" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bristlemouth-node.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207179" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207179 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bristlemouth-node.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="658" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bristlemouth-node.jpg 1937w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bristlemouth-node.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bristlemouth-node.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bristlemouth-node.jpg?resize=768,493 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bristlemouth-node.jpg?resize=680,437 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bristlemouth-node.jpg?resize=1536,986 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bristlemouth-node.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2207179" class="wp-caption-text">A prototype device to demonstrate the Bristlemouth standard sits on a rusty dock..<strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sofar Ocean Technologies</p></div></p>
<p>Among those movers are DARPA, the Office of Naval Research, and conservation organization <a href="https://oceankind.org/">Oceankind</a>. All involved agree that more data coming from ocean sensing can only be a good thing for science and industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for the standard itself, the details aren&#8217;t particularly exciting in consumer tech terms — it&#8217;s not a kit or reference model (the image at top is one of Sofar&#8217;s own smart buoys, though there is overlap) but mainly a hardware-software suite focusing on modularity and interoperability. The idea isn&#8217;t that you buy a Bristlemouth Basic and upgrade it, but rather that many in the industry design to a shared standard that covers basic steps like power management, communication, and so on and ensures resulting devices can work together easily. There&#8217;s more information available <a href="https://www.bristlemouth.org/technology">at the official Bristlemouth site</a>.</p>
<p>Ocean intelligence will be a major part of any industry touching the sea, from kelp farming to robo-shipping to climate change monitoring. If something like Bristlemouth can mitigate the data scarcity that limits these domains, the &#8220;blue economy&#8221; will be able to take off earlier and more safely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sternum, a three-year-old <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/the-past-present-and-future-of-iot-in-physical-security/">IoT cybersecurity</a> startup based in Tel Aviv, has secured $27 million in Series B funding, led by Spark Capital.</p>
<p>Internet of Things devices are more popular than ever, yet cybersecurity remains a looming concern. The number of attacks on IoT devices more than doubled during the first six months of 2021, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/kaspersky/">Kaspersky</a>, and the security credentials of these devices — which often ship with easy-to-crack default passwords and insecure third-party components — is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/uk-connected-devices-security/">starting to attract the attention of governments</a>.</p>
<p>Sternum is aiming to tackle this growing problem by providing embedded security for IoT devices, which can be integrated both at the point of manufacture or retrofitted at any point in their lifecycle. (Sternum says it&#8217;s successfully embedded into code that was written back in 2013.) The technology brings actionable intelligence and active mitigation to any internet-connected device, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/routers/">routers</a> and smart toys to medical devices and critical infrastructure, and pr<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">events the exploitation of known and unknown vulnerabilities in real-time.</span></p>
<p>“No existing product is doing what Sternum is doing,” Natali Tshuva, CEO and co-founder of Sternum tells TechCrunch. “Most solutions in the market today are able to discover anomalies, but they can’t protect the device itself against exploitation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“We have built new algorithms that are capable of identifying the fingerprints of an attacker in real-time and preventing attack,&#8221; Tshuva added. Prior to co-founding Sternum, Tshuva was a software developer in Unit 8200, the Israeli Defense Force&#8217;s equivalent of the U.S. National Security Agency.</p>
<p>The funding round, which also saw participation from existing investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/square-peg-capital/">Square Peg Capital</a>, the Hinrich Foundation, and European VC firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/btov-partners/">btov</a>, is the largest amount ever raised by a female-founded and led security and analytics firm, according to Sternum. The investment will be used for research and development, to advance the platform, and to grow its headcount; Sternum currently employs 20 staff, and plans to increase this number by threefold to 60.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Spotnana's open API platform provides travel inventory from dozens of global sources and integrations with third-party workplace technology providers for ease of travel management.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotnana emerged from stealth Thursday with $41 million in its pocket and an open global platform targeting the $1.4 trillion business travel industry.</p>
<p>The Bay Area company’s investment includes a $34 million Series A, co-led by ICONIQ and Madrona Venture Group with participation from Decibel and Mubadala Capital, and a previous undisclosed $7 million seed round from 2020, also from ICONIQ and Madrona and including 8VC and Global Founders Capital.</p>
<p>Founded by CEO Sarosh Waghmar and CTO Shikhar Agarwal in 2019, Spotnana is designing a software-as-a-service platform for travel buyers and suppliers aimed at automating associated back- and mid-office tasks, providing travel inventory from dozens of global sources and integrations with third-party workplace technology providers for ease of travel management.</p>
<p>Waghmar, who has a background in the travel industry founding and leading digital travel company WTMC, told TechCrunch that scaling in the industry was difficult due to it being “highly broken and highly fragmented.”</p>
<p>He learned that the only way to scale in the travel industry would be to build a technology company first, so with Agarwal, they got started building Spotnana, not knowing that the global pandemic was around the corner.</p>
<p>“Travel is a $1.4 trillion industry and just corporate travel is growing 5% to 6% each year, but accounted for $700 billion of that last year in spite of the pandemic,” Waghmar said. “By 2024, we see this going back to $1.4 trillion, especially as events will get back where they need to be.”</p>
<p>The platform is now open to the public after piloting with more than 50 corporate travel customers that manage travel across global offices, now from a single online dashboard. The company has also grown to over 120 employees over the past year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Steve Singh, former founder and CEO of corporate expense and travel software company Concur, is an investor at Madrona Venture Group and leads Spotnana’s board as chairman. Joining him on the board as part of the investment is ICONIQ investor and former CFO of Expedia Greg Stanger.</p>
<p>Singh referred to the company as “AWS for the travel industry.”</p>
<p>“Customers are using Spotnana in a few ways: They are using the finished product or taking the API and building their own products,” he said. “This will be like walking into a kiosk in the airport and being able to access the same record used in booking travel online or working with a travel agent.”</p>
<p>At his previous company, Waghmar said he had scaled it to over $70 million in travel spend per year as a bootstrapped company. However, with Spotnana, he believes technology will drive change in the industry and that it will take working with investors that understand the space to push it forward.</p>
<p>The new funding will be deployed into additional hires, particularly on the engineering team, building out its travel operations infrastructure and continued development of its open architecture.</p>
<p>“We believe this is the highest-ever raised for a business travel startup,” Waghmar added. “We have built a profitable business before, and we can do it again as we disrupt this industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa and emerging markets continue to live without access to electricity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some reports peg these numbers between 500 million and 2 billion people despite the prevalence of renewable energy providers in these regions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://zolaelectric.com/">Zola Electric</a>, one such provider, is announcing today that it has closed $90 million in new funding to enter new markets and drive distributed renewable energy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Zola Electric </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2011 by Erica Mackey, Xavier Helgesen and Joshua Pierce, the company provided solar home solutions to off-grid rural communities in Tanzania</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has evolved since then. In an interview, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bill-lenihan-79ab372">Bill Lenihan</a>, the CEO who joined in 2015, told TechCrunch that Zola Electric found over time that its singular product could not work for the entire market of customers it wanted to go after &#8212; from off- or on-grid to rural or urban and residential or commercial</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;More than 2.2 billion people in the world lack access to reliable and affordable energy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We needed an energy ladder and a series of products that were all connected in some ways but solve different problems for these 2.2 billion people,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;So we then started to grow and provide more power in these systems.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zola has now become a technology company whose products can solve energy access problems in almost any market, the company said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Zola launched Infinity, a product the company says can power any home or office appliance while integrated into any energy source &#8212; grid, solar or battery</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The product works with power grids, solar panels and other power sources before switching to a ready energy source and storing it simultaneously.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These solutions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are managed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Zola&#8217;s SaaS software system called Vision and it provides customers with data, analytics and control of their systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we have is the semblance of an energy ladder where we can pretty much go into any market and solve any problem, no matter what. Now, there are still gaps in that technology and market segments that we haven&#8217;t addressed. And that&#8217;s where our development and capital is going &#8212; to fill out that energy ladder.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $90 million funding raised is a combination of debt and equity, $45 million each. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The equity bit </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TotalEnergies Ventures — the capital venture of TotalEnergies; SF-based impact VC firm DBL Partners; Africa&#8217;s largest PE firm Helios Investment Partners; Vulcan Capital, the investment arm of Paul Allen; Lyndon and Pete Rive (founders of Tesla-owned SolarCity); and New York-based utility-focused hedge fund Electron Capital Partners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debt financing features top energy lenders FMO and SunFunder, two firms known to provide debt capital to solar companies in emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This group brings more than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capital to the equation. They bring strategic benefit to this company and awareness that is over and above the capital. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">importantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this is the group that demonstrated their confidence and desire to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solve what is a global problem,&#8221; said the CEO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that Zola will use the funding to improve product development and commercial efforts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, around product development, the team is eager to build next-generation digital renewable energy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lenihan shares his view on how the Infinity product is the answer for people in emerging markets where lack of power has resulted in the installation of millions of backup solutions like diesel generations and lead-acid batteries &#8212; solutions that can are unreliable and can be difficult to use and manage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He describes the system as an epicentre of energy provisioning. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a similarity to the offline grid, Infinity connects to all the loads in a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">residence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or business place and controls them </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while providing data and analytics in the process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These are the core differences. The solutions in this part of the world today are backup systems. Zola is primary power, and that&#8217;s how we differentiate ourselves.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 1.5 million users and over 300,000 homes and businesses use Zola products across multiple African countries &#8212; Ivory Coast, Ghana, Namibia, DRC, South Africa, Zambia and Nigeria.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside Africa, the company is also present in the U.S., Brazil, Pakistan, and the Philippines. It has plans to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expand further into Northern Africa, Asia and South America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While speaking with Lenihan, two primary metrics from this news struck me — the total number of users and the growth-stage non-billion-dollar valuation round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a startup around the block these past 10 years, a little over a million customers seems like a meagre sum. While </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lenihan somewhat agrees, he cited the concept of digital distributed energy which is yet to take off globally (the startup only employed last year) and a dearth of on-the-ground personnel as reasons behind the seeming low figure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not as simple to create technology and drop into the shores of whatever country and think your product would get installed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need on-the-ground personnel, strong developers and integrators and distributors; people who can connect with the customer on the ground, solve their problems, install the systems and service those systems,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, this current round comes after Zola&#8217;s Series D equity round of $55 million in 2018. Lenihan did not disclose if this present round is the company&#8217;s Series E which would look like a down round if that was the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2011, the company has raised over $230 million in debt and equity financing. And i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n this age of unconventional rise in funding and valuations, any startup having raised that amount of venture capital could be easily worth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a billion dollars</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that&#8217;s not the case with Zola, at least not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yet. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about valuation, Lenihan said he thinks about valuation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">differently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the traditional market play and only stated that &#8220;the company is very valuable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Lenihan </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is enthused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and believes that digital distributed energy would fix the problems faced by emerging markets faster than other traditional energy providers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a different ballgame because most people initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thought the solar systems would solve emerging markets&#8217; energy problems because Western technology backup systems and inverters are solid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But now it&#8217;s not that solid. We need to start from scratch. We need grid-like characteristics in these markets, and we need integration, modularity and intelligence. That&#8217;s our view.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well that was fast. London grocery delivery upstart, <a href="https://jiffygrocery.co.uk">Jiffy</a> &#8212; which was only founded in April this year &#8212; has nabbed $28 million in Series A funding around half a year after initial £2.6M <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/jiffy-grocery/">seed raise</a>. It says it&#8217;s now raised a total of $35M.</p>
<p>The grocery delivery startup operates a network of its own dark stores to do fulfilment &#8212; enabling it to offer the promise of &#8220;fresh groceries in 15 minutes&#8221;.</p>
<p>Currently it has eight London stores &#8212; now with the funds to expand.</p>
<p>Jiffy tells TechCrunch is has amassed around 20,000 customers so far across its six delivery zones (all in London for now).</p>
<p>The Series A round is led by family-owned investment company Heartland, with Boston-based international VC fund Flint Capital also participating, along with gaming firm Playrix and existing investors Baring Vostok Capital Partners and LVL1 among others.</p>
<p>The fast-following financing is a measure of how hyper competitive the on-demand grocery space has become in the UK capital &#8212; as well as being a clear signal investors are impressed with the startup&#8217;s early execution.</p>
<p>Other on-demand grocery delivery players operating in London include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">Gorillas</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/">Getir</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/zapp/">Zapp</a>. The U.S. unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gopuff-funding/">goPuff</a> is also in the mix &#8212; having acquired UK startups <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210506006037/en/Gopuff-Jumpstarts-International-Expansion-with-Acquisition-of-UK-Based-Fancy">Fancy</a> and <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/gopuff-acquires-dija/">Dija</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jiffy&#8217;s founders describe themselves as &#8220;Q-Commerce veterans&#8221;. Co-founder Vladimir Kholiaznikov was ex-CEO of Russia’s e-grocery player X5 Food Tech, while fellow co-founder, Artur Shamalov, has also founded a previous food-related startup in Russia. Both have also dabbled in investing themselves &#8212; so likely have a burgeoning contacts book to tap when they go fundraising.</p>
<p>Jiffy says its typical customers are families and <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">middle aged grocery shoppers who are switching to its app from traditional convenience supermarkets and online weekly shops. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We are betting this trend will only accelerate as we become a more mature service,&#8221; says Kholiaznikov.</span></p>
<p>The Series A funds will go on expansion within London &#8212; and maybe also further afield, as Jiffy eyes moving into other urban locations in the UK.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are definitely aiming to cover London inside of the M4 by end of the year,&#8221; Kholiaznikov tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Jiffy might move to towns as pilot this year but we will see later.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;long term&#8221; plan is that &#8220;all towns with 100k+ population are on our radar&#8221;, he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are building a nationwide company but will also explore other markets though an alternative route &#8212; we are providing our Q-commerce tech platform to selected local players in international markets (for example, we are a partner of Send in Australia),&#8221; Kholiaznikov also says, adding: &#8220;We will continue this route as well to add value to our core business and shareholders.&#8221;</p>
<p>While there is a smorgasbord of startups vying to delivery groceries and/or snacks to citydwellers in the UK, Jiffy&#8217;s offer puts speedy delivery of fresh produce front and center which looks like a smart differentiation vs operators that mostly want to ship easy to handle produce like bottles of pop and crisps.</p>
<p>Additionally, though, there are a raft of food delivery apps also trying to nibble into the traditional weekly grocery shop &#8212; very familiar names like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/deliveroo-posted-narrowed-loss-of-309m-with-gross-transactions-surging-to-5-7b-in-2020-eitf-shows/">Deliveroo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/just-eat-takeaway-confirms-its-gobbling-up-grubhub-in-a-7-3b-deal/">JustEat</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/uber-eats-beefs-up-its-grocery-delivery-offer-as-covid-19-lockdowns-continue/">Uber Eats</a> &#8212; mostly focused on meal delivery from restaurants but some have been bolting on light groceries picked from stores they don&#8217;t operate.</p>
<p>Going after the full weekly grocery shop, as Jiffy and multiple other startups are, looks like a bigger logistics and execution challenge &#8212; certainly with a promise of 15 minute delivery &#8212; but also has the potential to be a more sustainable and lucrative business vs just catering to sporadic convenience needs and snack cravings, even if the ops are more complicated.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are not only startup rivals for Jiffy and co to worry about here too; traditional supermarkets have made huge profits during the pandemic &#8212; and could certainly splash plenty of cash to dial up their delivery services. But this is also where leaner startups can steal a march by delivering on their promise of hyper fast delivery, albeit with less product choice.</p>
<p>In addition to grocery delivery, Jiffy is adding &#8216;Click &amp; Collect&#8217; ordering &#8212; which is currently offered at two of its London stores, giving its customers more choice about how they get their groceries.</p>
<p>It is also avoiding the myriad (legal, ethical, reputational and logistical) pitfalls of gig work; Its e-bike and moped-riding delivery couriers are liveried employees.</p>
<p>Another differentiating twist to its model is the aforementioned open Q-Commerce play.</p>
<p>&#8220;This <span lang="EN-US">means, we provide our ready-to-go IT platform that other companies can use to launch their own quick-commerce stores,&#8221; notes Kholiaznikov.</span></p>
<p>Commenting on Jiffy&#8217;s Series A in a statement, Lise Kaae, CEO of Heartland said: “The Jiffy team has managed to impress us with their ambitious plans and effective execution, and we are excited about the journey ahead operating in a highly dynamic and exciting growth market.</p>
<p>“We strongly believe in the large and untapped potential of the e-groceries market in the UK and the ultra-fast delivery business model developed by Jiffy. The company is led by a very experienced team of founders and the current round would enable Jiffy to further accelerate growth. We are glad that the fund of Baring Vostok is a part of this exciting story.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google on Thursday filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court against the Competition Commission of India following the leak of a damning confidential report detailing the watchdog&#8217;s interim fact-finding in an antitrust probe.</p>
<p>The report, which Google has yet to formally receive or review, said the American giant had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/google-abused-dominant-position-of-android-in-india-antitrust-probe-finds/">abused the dominant position of Android in India</a> to illegally hurt competitors in the world’s second-largest internet market. The Indian antitrust watchdog began its probe into Google&#8217;s alleged abuse of Android in the country two years ago. About 98% of smartphones in India run Google&#8217;s mobile operating system, according to research firm Counterpoint.</p>
<p>Google said it is seeking &#8220;redress in this matter, specifically protesting against the breach of confidence which impairs Google&#8217;s ability to defend itself and harms Google and its partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week&#8217;s report said Google had reduced device manufacturing firms’ ability and incentive to develop — and sell — devices running alternative versions of Android. Additionally, the report found Google’s requirement to make it mandatory for device manufacturers to pre-install its apps to be in violation of India’s competition law.</p>
<p>The company said today it has not yet had the opportunity to review the report&#8217;s findings, &#8220;much less submit its defence of any allegations.&#8221;</p>
<p>India is a key overseas market for Google where the company reaches over half a billion internet users, according to Comscore. The Android-maker has also made significant investments in the country. Last year, it announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">plans to invest $10 billion in the country</a> over the course of five to seven years, and has already spent a considerable amount of it, thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">a $4.5 billion check to Indian technology giant Jio Platforms</a>.</p>
<p>“We are deeply concerned that the Director General’s Report, which contains our confidential information in an ongoing case, was leaked to the media while in the CCI’s custody,&#8221; a Google spokesperson said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Protecting confidential information is fundamental to any governmental investigation, and we are pursuing our legal right to seek redress and prevent any further unlawful disclosures. We cooperated fully and maintained confidentiality throughout the investigative process, and we hope and expect the same level of confidentiality from the institutions we engage with.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Pay, Apple&#8217;s mobile payments and digital wallet service, provides users with a secure and private way to pay on their iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and Macbooks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite having a presence in almost every continent since 2014, Apple Pay only <a href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/mobile/479503/apple-pay-launches-in-south-africa/">made its way into Africa this March through South Africa</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users in the country with Visa, Mastercard and American Express cards can access the payment service from five banks &#8212; Nedbank, Absa, FirstRand Bank, Investec and Discovery</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the launch in South Africa showed Apple&#8217;s keen interest in increasing its penetration in sub-Saharan Africa, the tech giant didn&#8217;t say if it would expand to other countries like Nigeria and Kenya. Like South Africa, these countries have also seen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the adoption of digital payments significantly increase these past few years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, instead of waiting for Apple&#8217;s next move, Paystack has taken the initiative to integrate the payment service on its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is now the first payment gateway in Nigeria to support Apple Pay. Doing so gives Nigerian businesses access to millions of Apple Pay users in the more than 60 countries where the payments service </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is active</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2207325" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207325" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207325" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632370659871_12-2-PWAP-In-Action-Dark-BG.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="357" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207325" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Paystack</p></div></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works: <span style="font-weight: 400;">A customer with Apple Pay enabled will see the option to checkout using Pay with Apple Pay when they tap to buy from a Paystack merchant. Using Touch ID or Face ID, they can then go ahead and pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay with Apple Pay is available to Nigeria-based businesses that use Paystack. They can accept payments made through any of the Paystack-hosted Commerce tools &#8212; Paystack Storefronts or Invoices &#8212; and via </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payment channels including cards, mobile money, USSD, QR codes and EFT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, Paystack merchants have accepted international payments from customers following the integration with global commerce platforms Wix and Shopify</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, the YC-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/">Stripe subsidiary</a> has also integrated with regional payment channels. One with SnapScan for QR payments in South Africa &#8212; the most recent country it expanded to &#8212; and one with local partners for mobile money in Ghana, the third African country it operates in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/khadijah-abu-pm">Khadijah Abu</a>, the head of product expansion at Paystack, told TechCrunch that the integration with Apple Pay is the platform&#8217;s first global payment channel integration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re the first payment platform to support this channel in Nigeria, and we intend to integrate more global payment channels in the future to help connect Paystack merchants to the global economy,&#8221; she said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We&#8217;ve integrated with Apple Pay because we want to give our merchants and their customers more payment choices. Customers also love Apple Pay, the conversions are great and our merchants can now reach an even larger audience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paystack integration with Apple Pay is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what Flutterwave, another big-name African payments platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/flutterwave-and-paypal-partner-to-allow-african-merchants-to-accept-and-make-payments/">did with PayPal back in March</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While reporting on that, I referenced how PayPal and Flutterwave would coexist if PayPal decided to expand to Nigeria and other African countries where Flutterwave offers the integration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he same applies to Paystack and Apple Pay, the playing ground is quite different. In Nigeria, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/nigeria">Android is king</a> in the mobile operating system market, where the OS commands a more than 87% share, compared to 7.75% for Apple&#8217;s iOS. Little wonder why the iPhone maker isn&#8217;t too keen on expanding Apple Pay into Nigeria (in South Africa, iOS has a <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/south-africa">14.89% market share</a>).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This statistic might be behind</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Paystack&#8217;s optimism that its integration with Apple Pay will not be affected should Apple decide to extend the payment service in Nigeria. If anything, the company is looking to eat into Apple Pay&#8217;s market by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> replicating the integration for businesses in South Africa and Ghana</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing impressive growth in South Africa, with thousands of new businesses of all sizes joining us every month,&#8221; Abu said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regarding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Paystack&#8217;s progress in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Apple Pay is super convenient and secure, and while we&#8217;re beginning with Nigeria, we aim to bring this payment channel to all our markets.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving her opinion on how this would impact e-commerce in Nigeria, Abu said that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to merchants being able to sell to an international audience, the success rates of international transactions on the platform would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">improve significantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s an existing eagerness to connect with the global market. This new payment channel makes it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> easier to access and sell to that market.&#8221;  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.lg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LG Electronics</a>, the Korean tech giant that once was a leading player in mobile phones but is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/lg-is-shutting-down-its-smartphone-business-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">winding down that business</a>, is making an acquisition that points to its ambitions in another, emerging area: next-generation automotive hardware and services. Today the company announced that it will be snapping up <a href="http://www.cybellum.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cybellum</a>, an Israeli automotive cybersecurity specialist that detects and assesses vulnerabilities in connected vehicle services and hardware by way of a &#8220;digital twin&#8221; approach.</p>
<p>The deal is coming in several parts, LG said.</p>
<p>Initially, it is taking a 64% stake in Cybellum for $140 million, and it will contribute a further $20 million in the form of a simple agreement for future equity (SAFE) note, &#8220;upon conclusion of the trading process in the fourth quarter.&#8221; The remaining shares will then be acquired the &#8220;near future&#8221; (no specified date), which is also when the final valuation and investment will be confirmed.</p>
<p>As it stands now, if the valuation remains consistent, the deal in total will be worth some $240 million (market forces or the company&#8217;s own business funnel could impact this).</p>
<p>LG has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/lg-chem-will-invest-5-2b-in-battery-materials-through-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building</a> a profile as an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/aurora-labs-ramps-self-healing-software-with-23m-from-lg-technology-ventures-porsche-se-toyota-tsusho/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor</a> in interesting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/auto-software-company-sonatus-raises-35-million-from-hyundai-motor-group-saic-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automotive startups</a>, but this is its first acquisition out of Israel &#8212; Cybellum is based in Tel Aviv &#8212; and points to the bigger company&#8217;s interest not just in hardware but in providing software solutions to the automotive industry.</p>
<p>“It’s no secret the critical role software plays in the automotive industry and with it comes the need for effective cybersecurity solutions,” said Dr. Kim Jin-yong, president of the LG Electronics Vehicle component Solutions Company, in a statement. “This latest deal will further strengthen LG’s solid foundation in cybersecurity, enabling us to be even more prepared for the era of connected cars.” This is an <a href="https://www.insideindustry.com/index.php/news2/automation/328-lg-and-honeywell-demo-automotive-cybersecurity-solution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">area</a> that LG has been <a href="https://swsolutions.lge.com/insights/trends/automotive-cybersecurity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eyeing up for a while</a>.</p>
<p>This is a good return for Cybellum&#8217;s investors, which included Blumberg Capital, Target Global and RSBG Ventures (the venture arm of German industrial giant RAG). Cybellum had raised just over $14 million prior to this.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup &#8212; which was founded in 2016 by Slava Bronfman and Michael Engstler, two cybersecurity alums from the Israeli Defense Forces &#8212; has over the years picked up a number of big-name customers using its technology, including Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan, with its partners including Harman, Toyota Tsusho, and PTC.</p>
<p>Bronfman told us in an emailed interview that the plan will be to continue working with all of these companies for the time being, and to continue operating as an independent entity.</p>
<p>Cybellum&#8217;s technology, and LG&#8217;s acquisition of it, underscore some significant trends in the world of connected cars and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Connected vehicles represent a new attack vector for malicious hackers, and a very complicated one, when you consider the multiple components that go into vehicles, and the numerous OEMs and automotive companies at work in the bigger ecosystem of the vehicle. That will only become more complex as vehicles evolve to be &#8220;smarter,&#8221; more connected, and eventually more autonomous: there will be more connected systems, and even more reliance on them working correctly to work safely.</p>
<p>One of the big challenges has been having a joined up approach to cybersecurity across all of that. LG, as an existing player in the market with ambitions to grow that position, is making an investment both in its future business, and to address a wider services need in the industry.</p>
<p>Cybellum&#8217;s approach is to create a so-called &#8220;digital twin&#8221; of the system &#8212; an approach also taken in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/lacuna-raises-16-million-in-series-a-to-help-cities-manage-mobility-via-digital-twin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worlds</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/ibm-acquires-italys-myinvenio-to-integrate-process-mining-directly-into-its-suite-of-automation-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enterprise IT</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/unlearn-ai-nabs-12m-to-build-digital-twins-to-speed-up-and-improve-clinical-trials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare</a> &#8212; and to monitor this as a way of capturing the full picture to identify and assess threats. This is one way of bridging fragmentation among individual components, while being able to monitor events in real time without straining the systems of the vehicle itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is first and foremost a security investment,&#8221; Bronfman said. &#8220;Cybellum is a cybersecurity company. As one of the leading automotive suppliers, LG is prioritizing cybersecurity as they understand that it&#8217;s an essential part of the current era of connected vehicles and the transition toward autonomous vehicles.&#8221;</p>
<p>LG is not currently a partner of Cybellum&#8217;s but Bronfman said that the first integrations between the two are likely to come out in 2022.</p>

		Alexander Chachava is a serial entrepreneur, investor and managing partner at <a href="https://en.leta.vc/">LETA Capital</a>, a technology investment firm.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Russian-speaking and Eastern European technology entrepreneurs are acknowledged as some of the most technically skilled in the world.</p>
<p>As a case in point, Coursera’s <a href="https://blog.coursera.org/announcing-the-coursera-2020-global-skills-index/">2020 Global Skills Index</a> found that Russian learners had the highest proficiency in technology and data science among 65 million learners across 60 countries. Levels of entrepreneurship also remain high and are still growing.</p>
<p>Beyond their technical abilities and entrepreneurial flair, a question remains: Are they investable?</p>
<p>Estimates suggest there are already some 17,000 Russian-speaking and Eastern European entrepreneurs operating in key hubs in the U.K., Europe, United States and farther afield.</p>
<p>Unbeknown to many, high-profile success stories include Telegram, Revolut, TradingView, PandaDoc, Preply and more. In 2019 alone, companies founded by Russian-speaking entrepreneurs were sold to U.S. entities for more than $12.5 billion. Some of the most prominent deals included the $5 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/09/insight-partners-acquires-data-management-company-veeam-for-5b/">sale</a> of Veeam to Insight Partners, MagicLab’s $3 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/08/badoos-andrey-andreev-sells-his-stake-in-bumble-to-blackstone-valuing-the-dating-app-at-3b/">sale</a> to U.S. investment management company Blackstone and DXC Technology’s $2 billion <a href="https://www.luxoft.com/pr/dxc-technology-completes-acquisition-of-leading-digital-innovator-luxoft/">acquisition</a> of Luxoft.</p>
<p>Our funds at Leta have also supported startups acquired by international firms, including the <a href="https://www.zurich.com/en/media/news-releases/2017/2017-1222-01">sale</a> of Bright Box HK to Zurich Insurance Group in 2017 and WeWork’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/wework-unomy/">acquisition</a> of sales and marketing platform Unomy.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this track record and success, I believe Eastern European entrepreneurs, even when operating from their home countries, remain overlooked and undervalued by investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Stigma of a Russian heritage</h2>
<p>The reasons are probably myriad, including perceived cultural differences, lack of understanding, trust and confidence, and, sadly, greater risk aversion, probably too often fueled by negative Russian and Eastern European stereotypes. In fact, many entrepreneurs go to significant lengths to downplay their heritage and backgrounds in an attempt to level the playing field with their “Western” peers.</p>
<p>Research conducted recently by our analysts suggests a significant proportion of Russian-speaking and Eastern European entrepreneurs continue to find it challenging to win over investors and are not successfully raising seed funding.</p>
<p>Where they have been successful and raised seed, Series A or Series B funding, they are on average raising 65% less than their U.S. peers and over 40% less than U.K. and EU entrepreneurs. In terms of funding raised per employee, this is almost 2x less than the U.S. and U.K. average, and the ratio of acquisition events for these companies is around 5%, compared with 17% and 20% for U.S. and EU companies, respectively.</p>
<p>Are we then to take it that these companies are less successful or demonstrate different growth characteristics?</p>
<p>This is not the case. The entrepreneurs and companies in our analysis are punching well above their weight in terms of growth and investor returns. Compared to their peers, they generate strong growth (in particular at seed and Series A phases), have smaller burn rates and are highly efficient in converting investments into return for investors.</p>
<h2>A mine of opportunities</h2>
<p>Despite some of the success stories, I believe many Eastern European startups are still overlooked and undervalued. For investors, this represents a massive untapped opportunity.</p>
<p>As an IT entrepreneur myself, fortunate enough to be in a position to put my money where my mouth is; I see it as my mission to help others succeed the way I did, and in the process bring the world some very exciting companies and disruptive technologies.</p>
<p>We are also committed to working with other investors –- in need of greater comfort and convincing &#8212; to better understand and navigate this significant and exciting untapped segment of the market, which we know from our analysis and the performance of our own funds delivers an attractive return to investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cobo.com/">Cobo</a>, a Singapore-based crypto asset management platform, raised a $40 million Series B to accelerate the development of decentralized finance as a service (DFaaS).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The round was co-led by <a href="https://dst-global.com/">DST Global</a>, <a href="https://capitalant.com/">A&amp;T Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.imo.vc/en">IMO Ventures.</a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The company will use its proceeds for the development of DeFi as a service (DFaaS) infrastructure and its existing custody services such as wallet as a service (WaaS), trading and staking as a service (StaaS). The funding will also be used to apply for regulatory licenses to ensure strict compliance to the relevant anti-money laundering (AML) and counter the financing of terrorism (CFT) requirements.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the growing interest for cryptocurrencies among Asian investors, institutional investors and retail investors are seeking diversification options to hedge against inflation and other risks, the company said in its statement.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">“With interest in the crypto revolution soaring across Asia, it’s high time to expand blockchain infrastructures to meet the rising demand, especially as we’re seeing growing enthusiasm among institutions,” said the company CEO and co-founder Discus Fish, also known as Shixing Mao. “In the past, we’d witness crypto applications evolve from Bitcoin to DeFi and now NFTs … Ultimately, this fundraising takes us another step closer to Cobo’s foundational vision of empowering 1 billion users to access crypto.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Cobo was founded in 2017 with a mission to bridge the gap between crypto and users, both retail and institutional, for increasing access to blockchain for all. Cobo’s founders are CEO Discus Fish, the co-founder of F2Pool, and CTO Changhao Jiang, a former platform engineer at Facebook and Google who co-founded Chinese encrypted digital wallet Bihang.</p>
<p>&#8220;As blockchain technology and innovation advances, we are observing a wave of increasing institutional demand,&#8221; said Jasmine Zhang, partner of A&amp;T Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">DeFi typically requires professional managers including fund managers or C-level executives to interact directly with cryptocurrency lending protocols like Curve, Compound, Uniswap and AAVE, the company CEO said. Unlike those existing DeFi platforms, Cobo’s DeFi as a service (DFaaS) allows the institutional investor users to empower staff, even computerized bots, to perform operations of various risks, the company CEO told TechCrunch. Low-risk operations can be automated by bots, whereas high-risk operations such as moving large sums still require multisignature confirmations by managers and/or CXOs, he added.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Cobo’s DFaaS infrastructure underpins its multisignature crypto wallet platform and crypto asset custodial services for retail and institutional investors, respectively. Cobo has served more than 300 institutional clients, including Deribit, F2Pool, BitMart and Pionex through its custody services such as Cobo Custody and DFaaS with a cumulative transaction volume of $20 billion. Its retail investor clients use Cobo Wallet.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Cobo, which also has offices in Hong Kong and Seattle, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/17/cryptocurrency-wallet-startup-cobo-raises-13m-series-a-to-enter-the-u-s-and-southeast-asia/">$13 million Series A round</a> in October 2018 to enter new international markets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cobo supports more than 50 public chains, over 1,000 tokens and serves a total of 75,000 high-net-worth individuals, the company CEO said.</p>
