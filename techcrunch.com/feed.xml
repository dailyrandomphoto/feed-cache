										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Podcasts Subscriptions are now live across more than 170 countries and regions, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-and-channels-are-now-available-worldwide/">announced</a> this morning. First <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">unveiled this spring</a>, subscriptions allow listeners to unlock additional benefits for their favorite podcasts, including things like ad-free listening, early access to new episodes, bonus material, exclusives, or whatever else the podcast creator believes will be something their fans will pay for. Channels allow podcasters to group their shows however they like &#8212; for instance, to highlight a set of shows with a shared theme, or to offer different mixes of free and paid content.</p>
<p>The new subscription features were initially set to arrive in May, but Apple later <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526186/apple-podcasts-in-app-subscription-launch">emailed creators</a> that the launch was being pushed to June. This was likely due to a <a href="https://podnews.net/article/apple-podcasts-lemon-bugs?utm_source=podnews.net&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=podnews.net:2021-05-28">series of backend issues</a> impacting the service, including things like delayed episodes and malfunctioning analytics, among other things.</p>
<p>At launch, Apple says there are thousands of subscriptions and channels available, with more expected to arrive on a weekly basis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When listeners purchase a subscription to a show, they&#8217;ll automatically follow the show in the redesigned Apple Podcasts app. The show&#8217;s page will also be updated with a Subscriber Edition label, so they&#8217;ll be able to more easily tell if they have access to the premium experience.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s Listen Now tab will expand with new rows that provide access to paid subscriptions, including their available channels.</p>
<p>In the app, users can discover channels from show pages and through Search, browse through recommendations from the Listen Now and Browse tabs, and share channels with friends through Messages, Mail and other apps.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s delay to invest in the Podcasts market has given its rivals a head start on growing their own audience for podcasts. At the time of the spring announcement of subscriptions, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spotify-podcast-listeners-to-top-apples-for-the-first-time-in-2021-forecast-claims/">an industry report suggested</a> that Spotify’s podcast listeners would top Apple’s for the first time in 2021.</p>
<p>Despite the competition, Apple is betting its massive install base will bring in creators. Those creators agree to pay Apple a 30% cut of their subscription revenue in year one, just like subscription-based iOS apps. That cut drops to 15% in year two. Spotify, by comparison, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/spotify-launches-paid-podcasts-through-new-anchor-feature/">is taking no revenue cut</a> for the next two years while its program gets off the ground. It will then take only a 5% fee.</p>
<p>Based on the debut lineup, it seems many creators and studios believe Apple&#8217;s footprint is worth the larger revenue share.</p>
<p>Early adopters of subscriptions include notable names like Lemonada Media, Luminary, Realm, and Wondery; media and entertainment brands, including CNN, NPR, The Washington Post, and Sony Music Entertainment.</p>
<p>Other studio participants include Audio Up, Betches Media, Blue Wire, Campside Media, Imperative Entertainment, Lantigua Williams &amp; Co., Magnificent Noise, The Moth, Neon Hum Media, Three Uncanny Four, and Wondery, Audacy’s Cadence13 and Ramble, Barstool Sports, Jake Brennan’s Double Elvis, Headgum, iHeartMedia’s The Black Effect, Big Money Players, Grim &amp; Mild, Seneca Women, Shondaland, Relay FM, Tenderfoot TV, Radiotopia from PRX, Pushkin Industries, QCODE, and others,</p>

<p>Once subscribed, you can listen across Apple devices, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, CarPlay, HomePod and HomePod mini.</p>
<p>Subscriptions were announced alongside a redesigned version of the Apple Podcasts app, which has received <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/users-despair-at-apple-podcasts-app-after-update/">a number of usability complaints</a> and sent some users in search of third-party apps. Apple has been responding to user feedback, and addressed some issues in the iOS 14.6 update with other Library tab updates planned to arrive in future releases, perhaps iOS 14.7.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week we announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/carnegie-mellon-university-president-farnam-jahanian-is-speaking-at-techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburgh/">Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian</a> will be speaking at our upcoming City Spotlight: Pittsburgh event. Today, we’re excited to announce another big guest: Mayor Bill Peduto.</p>
<p>The event will be held on June 29. You can <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">register here for free</a> to listen to our conversations with Mayor Peduto and Jahanian, among others.</p>
<p>An alumni of both Carnegie Mellon University and Pennsylvania State University, Peduto served on Pittsburgh’s City Council for a dozen years before being elected mayor in 2014. I’ve spoken with the mayor on numerous occasions, and aside from being one of the city’s biggest cheerleaders, he’s also a staunch proponent of the startup scene bolstered by local universities like CMU.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Having two world-class research universities allows us to draw the companies here in order to be able to utilize that talent. At the same time, that talent is building out the startup community,” Peduto told me in a recent conversation. “The other components of the startup community are now, for the first time, being properly invested in. I think what you’re seeing change over the past five years in Pittsburgh is West Coast VCs aren’t looking to move startups to California. They’re looking to invest in Pittsburgh.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Calling all Yinzers, TechCrunch is (virtually) headed to Pittsburgh!&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/calling-all-yinzers-techcrunch-is-virtually-headed-to-pittsburgh/embed/#?secret=ThjO9gleDg" data-secret="ThjO9gleDg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Having resources like those universities has been instrumental in building out Pittsburgh’s startup community. But the city &#8212; which long bore the scars of rustbelt depression &#8212; has traditionally had difficulty retaining much of its talent, losing out to better-known startup ecosystems in places like New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p>But that’s changing &#8212; and the city is changing along with it. Pittsburgh currently has one of the world’s most vibrant robotic startup ecosystems, is at the center of much of the world’s autonomous vehicle research and has birthed successful companies like Duolingo.</p>
<p>Event organizer Matt Burns will be speaking to Mayor Peduto about the challenges and successes in building up such an ecosystem.</p>
<p>We’re still looking for startups to participate in the event. It’s free to register and participate in networking and watch the event (<a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">click here to register</a>). It’s also free to apply to pitch your startup at the event (<a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/F2JkiUKt">click here to apply</a>). We’re looking for early-stage companies from the greater Pittsburgh area that can give a two-minute pitch to a panel of local venture capitalists in exchange for feedback.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It certainly follows then that some leading construction robotics companies are able to strike while the iron is hot with some healthy raises. Today, Bay Area-based Dusty Robotics announced a $16.5 million Series A. Led by Canaan Partners and featuring NextGen Venture Partners, Baseline Ventures, Root Ventures and Cantos Ventures, the round brings the startup’s full funding up to $23.7 million.</p>
<p>“We have an enormous amount of demand from customers across the U.S., and around the world,” founder and CEO Tessa Lau told TechCrunch. “In addition to growing our team, we will be expanding our fleet of robots and building more robots to service this demand.”</p>
<p>Canaan partner Rich Boyle adds that the pandemic has helped accelerate some of the already existing demand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8zE4X06fly8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Both markets are incredibly active and evolving quickly, I believe mostly due to longer-term trends. Those include things like continued improvements in AI and labor shortages in key industries, as well as the decreasing price of robotic hardware. That said, COVID has driven changes in how people are thinking about the design, construction and ongoing utilization of real estate assets, and it&#8217;s driven substantial changes in behavior — how we work, how we live, how we shop, and some of those changes that were accelerated by COVID we think are here to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Dusty team is still fairly lean at about 17 employees, largely located in Mountain View. The startup’s first product is the Field Printer, a robot that prints out plans on the floor of construction sites. The company likens the maps to “Ikea Instructions.” The autonomous bot has been used by Swinerton, DPR Construction, Build Group and Pankow Builders, among others.</p>
<p>“We just released our third-generation hardware platform, which was designed from the ground up by our team in Mountain View to be purpose-built for producing accurate and speedy layout on construction sites,” says Lau. “We&#8217;ve been working on this product since fall of 2018 and have incorporated lessons learned from completing over 1 million square feet of production layout into this third-generation design.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nuro, the autonomous delivery startup founded in 2016 by former Google engineers Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu, is expanding into parcel logistics through a partnership with FedEx.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">multiyear, multiphased strategic partnership announced Tuesday aims to test and ultimately deploy Nuro&#8217;s second-generation R2 autonomous delivery vehicle within FedEx operations. Unlike others in the autonomous vehicle industry, Nuro has always focused its </span>efforts on designing a low-speed electric self-driving vehicle that transports packages, not people. But those &#8220;packages&#8221; have been more centered on the delivery of groceries, food and even medical supplies. Nuro has partnered with CVS, Dominoes and Krogers, for instance.</p>
<p>The deal with FedEx marks its first foray into parcels logistics. The pilot program has already started in Houston. This multiyear commitment will allow Nuro to bring its technology to more people in new ways, and eventually reach large-scale deployment, according to Cosimo Leipold, Nuro&#8217;s head of partnerships.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>FedEx has been working internally on its own autonomous vehicle technology, notably a sidewalk delivery bot. The SameDay Bot, which was named Roxo, was developed in collaboration with DEKA Development &amp; Research Corp. and its founder Dean Kamen who invented the Segway and iBot wheelchair. FedEx first unveiled its SameDay Bot in February 2019. The FedEx bot is equipped with sensing technology such as LiDAR and multiple cameras, which when combined with machine learning algorithms should allow the device to detect and avoid obstacles and plot a safe path, all while following the rules of the road (or sidewalk).</p>

<p>The company said at the time it planned to work with AutoZone, Lowe&#8217;s, Pizza Hut, Target, Walgreens and Walmart to figure out how autonomous robots might fit into its delivery business. The idea was for FedEx to provide a way for retailers to accept orders from nearby customers and deliver them by bot directly to customers&#8217; homes or businesses the same day. The company has tested the bots in Memphis, Tennessee as well as Plano and Frisco, Texas and Manchester, New Hampshire, according to a spokesperson.</p>
<p>The partnership with Nuro moves away from the sidewalk and onto the road. Nuro&#8217;s R2 is bigger and designed to operate on public roads, allowing it to travel farther distances and carry heavier loads.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">FedEx said it has made a long-term commitment to use Nuro&#8217;s autonomous bots for last-mile delivery at large scale.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;FedEx was built on innovation, and it continues to be an integral part of our culture and business strategy,&#8221; said Rebecca Yeung, vice president, advanced technology and innovation, FedEx Corporation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pitching is the single-most important skill a founder needs to refine to be successful in building a startup. You can’t attract a co-founder, teammates, customers or investors without a well-crafted pitch about your product and vision, and so learning how to pitch and communicate effectively tends to be the first gateway to early entrepreneurial success.</p>
<p>While books and talks galore have been published on pitching, the reality is that the art of the pitch deck is a constantly changing fashion. The pandemic last year upended notions of how to draft a deck, given that founders had to pitch virtually on shared screens. As always, those aesthetics continue to change: VCs are busier than ever, seeing more companies than ever, and have to wade through ever more decks in their quest to find the next startups to back.</p>
<p>As we enter a hybrid investing world with a mix of online and in-person pitching, getting the pitch deck right has changed again — and remains just as important as ever.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s why we’re excited to be hosting Mar Hershenson, the founding managing partner of Pear VC, on one of our most perennially popular panels about How to Craft Your Pitch Deck, which will happen on the Extra Crunch stage at the all-virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=Hershensonpost">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> coming up this September 21-23.</p>
<p>Hershenson has been a longtime venture capitalist and has consistently invested at the founding stages of startups. She has backed IPO’d companies like Guardant Health and DoorDash, as well as startups such as Aurora Solar, BioAge and Branch. Perhaps most importantly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/the-vcs-who-founders-love-the-most/">in our survey of founders last year</a>, Hershenson was one of the top-ranked VCs in the world in terms of founder recommendations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="O5UBZwUcdq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/the-vcs-who-founders-love-the-most/">The VCs who founders love the most</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The VCs who founders love the most&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/the-vcs-who-founders-love-the-most/embed/#?secret=O5UBZwUcdq" data-secret="O5UBZwUcdq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Her background is as a technical builder and entrepreneur. In addition to nabbing a PhD in electrical engineering from Stanford, Hershenson co-founded three companies before heading into venture: Barcelona Design, Sabio Labs and Revel Touch.</p>
<p>On this panel, Hershenson will discuss what’s changed when it comes to pitch decks in 2021, how she evaluates pitch decks in her day-to-day investing work, and whether and how pitch decks evolve and expand from first connection to final pitch meeting. We’ll also be taking questions from the audience to ensure that we cover all the strategies and tactics you have questions on about this critical skill.</p>
<p>So come <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=Hershensonpost">join Hershenson</a> (and all of our other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=Hershensonpost#eb919231-f3e4-4def-8dd0-afb0bc7c9c6e">fantastic speakers</a>) at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=Hershensonpost">Disrupt 2021 online this September 21-23</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In just one month we kick off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a> (July 8-9). If you’re an early-stage founder (pre-seed through Series A), don’t miss out on this two-day bootcamp. You’ll learn from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#3e01330b-4bf1-4206-b038-769db50898a0">top experts</a> across the startup ecosystem and take away tips and advice that you can implement in your business right now.</p>
<p><strong>Get amongst it:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#tickets">Buy your TC Early Stage 2021 pass</a>, and be sure to look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">our jam-packed agenda</a> to start planning your schedule.</p>
<p>When we say this event focuses on information every startup founder needs to build a successful business, we mean it. Case in point: Nate Wright, vice president of product marketing at UserTesting, will hold forth on the topic of customer experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Customer experience can make or break any business. Right now — in the early stages of building your startup — is the perfect time to bake an outstanding customer experience into your company’s infrastructure. That means evaluating every touchpoint along way and implementing policies that ensure a great experience.</p>
<p><strong>Fact:</strong> A great experience leads to happy, loyal customers, and we all know that happy loyal customers deliver better business results.</p>
<p>That’s a subject worth mastering, amirite? Here’s the description of Nate’s presentation, which takes place on July 8 from 12:45 pm &#8211; 1:25 pm (EDT).</p>
<p><strong>Iterating More Effectively with Feedback:</strong> A great product alone is not enough. To be successful, early-stage companies need to optimize all phases of the customer journey. This session will include tactics, best practices and case studies on how to use customer feedback to understand customer needs, craft more compelling messaging, and improve all phases of the customer experience.</p>
<p>We’ll add more breakout sessions — from Dell, Flatfile and Movile — to the agenda soon. And don’t stress about time conflicts. Your pass includes video on demand, so you can watch any sessions you miss or review sessions to catch any details you might have missed.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a> takes place on July 8-9. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#tickets">Buy your pass</a>, strap on your boots, head to camp and learn how to build a stronger startup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Solid Power, a solid-state battery developer backed by Ford and BMW, is going public. The company said Tuesday it would head to the NASDAQ via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp III at a post-deal implied market valuation of $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>The transaction is expected to generate around $600 million in cash, including a $165 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction from investors Koch Strategic Platforms, Riverstone Energy Limited, Neuberger Berman and Van Eck Associates Corporation. Solid Power said in a statement Tuesday that the funds will go toward growth and operations.</p>
<p>Solid state batteries are considered by many as the next long-awaited breakthrough in battery technology. They are so named because they lack a liquid electrolyte, the mechanism that moves ions between the cathode and anode in traditional lithium-ion batteries, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">as Mark Harris explained in an Extra Crunch article</a> earlier this year. By getting rid of this liquid component, developers say SSBs are safer and with far superior energy density. Solid Power said <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001844862/000119312521190525/d124653dex993.htm">in a June 15 investor presentation</a> that its batteries are expected to deliver a nearly 500-mile range on a single charge and more than double a conventional battery&#8217;s 8-year lifespan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ford Motor Company and BMW AG have made it clear they’re bullish on Solid Power’s ability to deliver. The two OEMs led the battery developer’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/ford-bmw-lead-solid-powers-130m-series-b-round/">$130 million Series B</a> in May and signed joint development agreements for automotive-scale batteries from Solid Power’s pilot production line to be delivered in early 2022.</p>
<p>The SPAC transaction will likely be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021, Solid Power said. It’s expected to trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “SLDP.”</p>
<p>Solid Power is just the latest battery company to go public via a SPAC in recent months. One of its main rivals, Volkswagen-backed QuantumScape, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/">went public via a SPAC merger</a> last September at a valuation of $3.3 billion. Earlier this year, European battery manufacturer FREYR and power system developer Microvast <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/battery-companies-are-the-latest-spac-target-as-evs-get-a-huge-regulatory-boost/">also announced mergers</a> with so-called “blank-check” firms.</p>

<p>The study will be wide ranging, with the watchdog concerns about the nested gateways that are created as a result of the pair&#8217;s dominance of mobile ecosystem &#8212; intermediating how consumers can access a variety of products, content and services (such as music, TV and video streaming; fitness tracking, shopping and banking, to cite some of the examples provided by the CMA).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;These products also include other technology and devices such as smart speakers, smart watches, home security and lighting (which mobiles can connect to and control),&#8221; it went on, adding that it&#8217;s looking into whether their dominance of these pipes is &#8220;stifling competition across a range of digital markets&#8221;, saying too that it&#8217;s &#8220;concerned this could lead to reduced innovation across the sector and consumers paying higher prices for devices and apps, or for other goods and services due to higher advertising prices&#8221;.</p>
<p>The CMA further confirmed the deep dive will examine &#8220;any effects&#8221; of the pair&#8217;s market power over other businesses &#8212; giving the example of app developers who rely on Apple or Google to market their products to customers via their smart devices.</p>
<p>The watchdog already has an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">open investigation into Apple&#8217;s App Store</a>, following a number of antitrust complaints by developers.</p>
<p>It is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">investigating Google&#8217;s planned depreciation of third party tracking cookies</a> too, after complaints by adtech companies and publishers that the move could harm competition. (And just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">last week</a> the CMA said it was minded to accept a series of concessions offered by Google that would enable the regulator to stop it turning off support for cookies entirely if it believes the move will harm competition.)</p>
<p>The CMA said both those existing investigations are examining issues that fall within the scope of the new mobile ecosystem market study but that its work on the latter will be &#8220;much broader&#8221;.</p>
<p>It added that it will adopt a joined-up approach across all related cases &#8212; &#8220;to ensure the best outcomes for consumers and other businesses&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s giving itself a full year to examine Gapple&#8217;s mobile ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is also soliciting feedback on any of the issues raised in its <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/60c8683a8fa8f57cef61fc18/FINALMobile_ecosystems_-_statement_of_scope_-_V4.pdf" rel="external">statement of scope</a> &#8212; calling for responses by 26 July. The CMA added that it&#8217;s also keen to hear from app developers, via its <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/NkC2FNEXxL" rel="external">questionnaire</a>, by the same date.</p>
<h2>Taking on tech giants</h2>
<p>The watchdog has previously scrutinized the digital advertising market &#8212; and found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/uks-competition-regulator-asks-for-views-on-breaking-up-google/">plenty to be concerned about vis-a-vis Google&#8217;s dominance</a> there.</p>
<p>That earlier market study has been feeding the UK government&#8217;s plan to reform competition rules to take account of the market-deforming power of digital giants. And the CMA suggested the new market study, examining &#8216;Gapple&#8217;s&#8217; mobile muscle, could similarly help shape UK-wide competition law reforms.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">Last year</a> the UK announced its plan to set up a &#8220;pro-competition&#8221; regime for regulating Internet platforms &#8212; including by establishing a dedicated Digital Markets Unit within the CMA (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">got going earlier this year</a>).</p>
<p>The legislation for the reform has not yet been put before parliament but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">the government has said</a> it wants the competition regulator to be able to &#8220;proactively shape platforms&#8217; behavior&#8221; to avoid harmful behavior before it happens&#8221; &#8212; saying too that it supports enabling ex ante interventions once a platform has been identified to have so-called &#8220;strategic market status&#8221;.</p>
<p>Germany already adopted similar reforms to its competition law (early this year), which enable proactive interventions to tackle large digital platforms with what is described as &#8220;paramount significance for competition across markets&#8221;. And its Federal Cartel Office has, in recent months, wasted no time in opening a number of proceedings to determine whether <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/amazons-market-power-to-be-tested-in-germany-in-push-for-early-action-over-antitrust-risks/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/googles-data-terms-are-now-in-germanys-competition-crosshairs/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">Facebook</a> have such a status.</p>
<p>The CMA also sounds keen to get going to tackle Internet gatekeepers.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, CEO Andrea Coscelli said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Apple and Google control the major gateways through which people download apps or browse the web on their mobiles – whether they want to shop, play games, stream music or watch TV. We’re looking into whether this could be creating problems for consumers and the businesses that want to reach people through their phones.</p>
<p>“Our ongoing work into big tech has already uncovered some worrying trends and we know consumers and businesses could be harmed if they go unchecked. That’s why we’re pressing on with launching this study now, while we are setting up the new Digital Markets Unit, so we can hit the ground running by using the results of this work to shape future plans.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The European Union also unveiled its own proposals for clipping the wings of big tech last year &#8212; presenting its Digital Markets Act plan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">in December</a> which will apply a single set of operational rules to so-called &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; platforms operating across the EU.</p>
<p>The clear trend in Europe on digital competition is toward increasing oversight and regulation of the largest platforms &#8212; in the hopes that antitrust authorities can impose measures that will help smaller players thrive.</p>
<p>Critics might say that&#8217;s just playing into the tech giants&#8217; hands, though &#8212; because it&#8217;s fiddling around the edges when more radical intervention (break ups) are what&#8217;s really needed to reboot captured markets.</p>
<p>Apple and Google were contacted for comment on the CMA&#8217;s market study.</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson said: <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“Android provides people with more choice than any other mobile platform in deciding which apps they use, and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://googleimpactreport.publicfirst.co.uk/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://googleimpactreport.publicfirst.co.uk/uk/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623853918420000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEgRKoYSRADDqyVAteHhdkRqNDcqQ">enables thousands of developers and manufacturers</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to build successful businesses. We welcome the CMA’s efforts to understand the details and differences between platforms before designing new rules.”</span></p>
<p>According to Google, the Android App Economy generated £2.8BN in revenue for UK developers last year, which it claims supported 240,000 jobs across the country &#8212; citing a <a href="https://googleimpactreport.publicfirst.co.uk/uk/">Public First report</a> that it commissioned.</p>
<p>The tech giant also pointed to operational changes it has already made in Europe, following antitrust interventions by the European Commission &#8212; such as adding a choice screen to Android where users can pick from a list of alternative search engines.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/google-ditches-pay-to-play-android-search-choice-auction-for-free-version-after-eu-pressure/">Earlier this month</a> it agreed to shift the format underlying that choice screen from an unpopular auction model to free participation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise, the self-driving subsidiary of GM, has tapped a $5 billion line of credit from the automaker&#8217;s financial arm to pay for hundreds of purpose-built electric and autonomous Origin vehicles as they start to roll off the assembly line.</p>
<p>The access to the credit provided by GM Financial will push Cruise&#8217;s &#8220;total war chest&#8221; to more than $10 billion as it prepares for commercialization, CEO Dan Ammann wrote in a blog post Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pre-production of the Cruise Origin, which was first unveiled in January 2020, has started at GM&#8217;s Factory ZERO assembly plant. Factory ZERO is the renamed and renovated Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant. Last year, GM announced plans to invest $2.2 billion into the factory to produce all-electric trucks and SUVs as well as Cruise Origin. The automaker said at the time it will invest an additional $800 million in supplier tooling and other projects related to the launch of the new electric trucks. Detroit-Hamtramck will be GM’s first fully dedicated electric vehicle assembly plant. When fully operational, the plant will create more than 2,200 jobs, according to GM.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Origin, the product of a multi-year collaboration with parent company GM and investor Honda, is designed for a ridesharing service. The shuttle-like vehicle has no steering wheel or pedals and is designed to travel at highway speeds. The interior is roomy, with seats that face each other, similar to what a traveler might find on some trains.</p>
<p>The first run of 100 pre-production Cruise Origins will be assembled over the summer and tested at GM&#8217;s Milford proving grounds. Commercial production of the Cruise Origin is expected to begin in 2023.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[E-commerce platform Shopify announced this morning its one-click checkout service known as Shop Pay will become available to any U.S. merchant that sells on Facebook or Google &#8212; even if they don&#8217;t use Shopify&#8217;s software to power their online stores. That makes Shop Pay the first Shopify product offered to non-Shopify merchants, the company notes. [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce platform Shopify <a href="https://news.shopify.com/shop-pay-becomes-first-shopify-product-to-extend-beyond-shopify-merchants-soon-available-to-any-business-selling-on-facebook-and-google">announced</a> this morning its one-click checkout service known as Shop Pay will become available to any U.S. merchant that sells on Facebook or Google &#8212; even if they don&#8217;t use Shopify&#8217;s software to power their online stores. That makes Shop Pay the first Shopify product offered to non-Shopify merchants, the company notes.</p>
<p>First <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/shopify-pay-aims-to-complete-the-picture-for-online-checkout/">introduced</a> at its developer conference in 2017, Shop Pay is similar to other instant checkout solutions that offer an easier way to pay online by reducing the number of fields a customer has to fill out during the checkout process. The service remembers and encrypts the customer&#8217;s information, so consumers can check out with just a tap when shopping online and, as of recently, even <a href="https://news.shopify.com/shop-pay-installments-launches-in-the-us">pay for purchase in installments</a>, thanks to a partnership with Affirm.</p>
<p>Shopify in February had <a href="https://news.shopify.com/shop-pay-expands-to-facebook-and-instagram">expanded</a> Shop Pay to Facebook and Instagram, in partnership with Facebook, but it only worked for existing Shopify merchants selling on those social platforms at the time. In May, Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-partners-with-shopify-on-online-shopping-expansion/">announced</a> at its I/O developer conference it was <a href="https://news.shopify.com/from-discovery-to-checkout-shopify-and-google-deepen-commerce-collaboration">partnering</a> with Shopify on an online shopping expansion that would give Shopify&#8217;s more than 1.7 million merchants the ability to reach customers through Google Search and other &#8220;shopping journeys&#8221; that began through other Google properties like Search, Maps, Images, Lens, and YouTube.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company declined to share how many of its 1.7 million merchants are already available on Facebook or Google today, but said they are two of the most popular channels.</p>
<p>Following today&#8217;s announcement, other merchants will also have the option to adopt Shop Pay for their own Facebook or Google stores. While how many will actually do so is yet unknown, Shopify notes that every day 1.8 billion people log onto Facebook and a billion shopping sessions take place across Google.</p>
<p>The company also touted Shop Pay&#8217;s advantages, including its 70% faster checkout than a typical checkout offers, with a 1.72x higher conversion rate &#8212; meaning fewer abandoned charts.</p>
<p>For consumers, the advantage of using Shop Pay over a traditional checkout, beyond the speed, is its integration with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/shopify-launches-shop-a-new-mobile-shopping-app/">Shopify&#8217;s mobile app, Shop</a>, which organizes and tracks your online orders across merchants, including Amazon,  so you can see when orders are arriving or quickly ask questions and manage returns.</p>
<p>To date, the Shop app has tracked over 430 million orders, the company says.</p>
<p>Over time, the Shop app can also customize a feed including users&#8217; favorite stores to point to other recommendations, including those from local merchants. Shopify confirmed that the Shop app will be able to track the Shop Pay-enabled orders from the non-Shopify merchants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since launching, Shop Pay has set the standard for checkout experiences, facilitating more than $24 billion in orders,&#8221; noted Shopify VP, Carl Rivera, who heads Product for Shop. &#8220;According to studies, cart abandonment averages 70%, with nearly 20% occurring because of a complicated checkout process. Shop Pay makes that process fast and simple, and the expansion to all merchants selling on Facebook and Google is a mission-critical step in bringing a best-in-class checkout to every consumer, every merchant, every platform, and every device,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The expansion could be a notable challenge to other payment mechanisms, including PayPal, Venmo, Apple Pay, and those offered by the platforms themselves, thanks to Shopify&#8217;s growing traction with merchants &#8212; one analysis gives its platform a <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/ecommerce-platform-market-share-in-usa">23% market share</a> in the U.S &#8212; combined with the popularity of the Shop app, now the No. 3 Shopping app on the App Store.</p>
<p>The news follows yesterday&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-shopify-confirms-significant-investment-in-payment-processor-stripe/">confirmation</a> that Shopify has taken a significant stake in payments giant Stripe, the backbone of the Shop Pay service, as well as Shopify&#8217;s partner on merchant services, including bank accounts and debit cards.</p>
<p>Shopify says the Shop Pay service will be enabled for all U.S. merchants selling on Facebook in the &#8220;coming months,&#8221; and will roll out to all merchants on Google by late 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following a smattering of leaks, Sonos and Ikea just unveiled the newest addition to their three-year-old Symfonisk line of home speakers. As the name implies, the Picture Frame is a medium-size, flat-panel speaker that can either be mounted on a wall or sat on a shelf via kickstand.</p>
<p>As with the rest of the Symfonisk line, the product is designed to get out of its own way, and blend in its surroundings. It’s a direction much of the industry has gone in over the last several years, with fabric covers aimed at matching the surrounding décor and more or less fade into the background.</p>

<p>The Picture Frame form factor is another logical extension of this, with a design that doesn’t require clearing off desk space. The front grille is covered in either black or white, with a design created by artist Jennifer Idrizi, which Ikea notes was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymatics">cymatics</a> – a visualization of sound vibrations. Fitting and simple, though the company also offers a pair of replacement panels with different designs, at $20.</p>

<p>The Picture Frame itself is $199 – not cheap, exactly, but certainly not unreasonable – especially by Sonos hardware standards. It features built-in WiFi, connects with the rest of Sonos’ hardware and works with 100 different streaming services. There are volume and Play/Pause buttons built in and a number of small touches, like the ability to reconfigure the power cord placement, based on how the frame is positioned.</p>
<p>It’s will be available online and in Ikea stores starting a month from today. The Symfonisk line also includes a lamp speaker and a more traditional rectangular form factor, ranging between $100 and $200.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Waterloo-based <a href="https://www.skywatch.com">SkyWatch</a> was among the first startups to recognize that the key to unlocking the real benefits of the space economy lay in making Earth observation data accessible and portable, and now the company has raised a $17.2 million Series B to help it further that goal. Fresh on the heals of a partnership with Poland-based satellite operator SatRevolution, SkyWatch is now set to bridge the gulf between satellite startups and customers in a bigger way as it lowers the barriers to entry for new companies focused on high-tech spacecraft payloads.</p>
<p>The new round of funding was led by new investor Drive Capital, and included participation from existing investors including Bullpen Capital, Space Capital, Golden Ventures and BDC Ventures. SkyWatch CEO and co-founder James Slifierz told me that bringing Drive on was a major win for the Series B.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drive is a firm that has actually been researching the space industry for a few years now, and looking for an opportunity that would be their first space technology investment,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Not their first in the [GTA-Waterloo] area  they&#8217;re based out of Columbus, Ohio, made up of Silicon Valley veterans. They were a little early to the trend of believing that a majority of the really interesting and large opportunities would eventually evolve outside of the Bay Area and outside of New York City.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SkyWatch definitely fits the bill, having built strong revenue pipeline for an Earth observation data platform that makes the information collected by the many observation satellites on orbit accessible to private industry, in a way that doesn&#8217;t require re-architecting existing systems or handling huge amounts of data in unfamiliar formats.</p>
<p>This fresh funding will help SkyWatch accelerate the rollout of its TerraStream product, a nw platform that the company developed to provide full-service data management, ordering, processing and delivery for satellite companies. This allows SkyWatch to not only make data collected by Earth observation satellites like those operated by SatRevolution accessible to customers — but also to source customers for those companies, too, effectively handling both sales and delivery, which many satellite startups born from a technical or academic background don&#8217;t start out equipped to tackle.</p>
<p>&#8220;My favorite analogy for TerraStream is it&#8217;s Shopify for space companies,&#8221; Slifierz said. &#8220;It takes away a lot of the complexity of going to market. So if you want to build an amazing shoe brand today, Shopify enables you to not have to worry about the logistics, and shipping, and the inventory management, the website, storefront and all that; it allows you to focus on the things that will build value in your company, which is the quality of your product, and your brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that just like Shopify depends on the existence of a rich third-party ecosystem to support its platform, so does SkyWatch, and that ecosystem is only now reaching maturity after years of infrastructure development, including things like the proliferation of launch startups, ground station build out, data warehousing and more.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what SkyWatch provides is the ability to go to market &#8220;faster and more profitably,&#8221; Slifierz says, which is a major shift for hard tech satellite startups working on new and improved sensor capabilities, often spinning out of research labs at academic institutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The strongest value proposition is that we give you instant access to hundreds of customers, which we&#8217;re growing at a very fast pace on the EarthCache [SkyWatch&#8217;s commercial satellite imagery marketplace] side. So in that way, we sort of joke, it&#8217;s like Shopify for space, but also integrated with the AWS marketplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>SkyWatch can also actually help identify demand, by providing satellite-side customers with real data to back up signals of what the market is actually looking for. Slifierz says that&#8217;s helped them advised partners on how to tweak their offering to meet a real need, which is beneficial in an industry where research and tech development often lead payload design, with actual demand as a somewhat secondary consideration.</p>

Trump is gone now, but Canada hasn’t stopped trying to recruit talent from its neighbor — and one of the hottest fronts in this talent war is biotech.</p>
<p>For generations of Canadian engineers, coders and researchers, Silicon Valley’s better salaries and weather were a siren call. But four years of Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric, policy and visa restrictions gave Canadian tech companies and governments <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-how-canada-is-fighting-the-war-on-talent/">a competitive advantage</a>.</p>
<p>After Trump took office in 2016, Canada’s federal government boosted the tech ecosystems of cities like Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver by creating<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers/global-talent/requirements.html"> a program</a> to fast-track immigration. Canadian tech leaders <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/06/29/h1b-visa-ban-immigration-trump-order-tech-workers-canada/">climbed aboard</a> with <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Canada-to-Silicon-Valley-s-international-15470866.php">campaigns to tempt more workers north</a>. In Quebec, the industry even <a href="https://thelogic.co/news/quebec-ink/quebec-ink-on-immigration-the-caq-government-is-listening-to-tech-entrepreneurs/">persuaded</a> Quebec’s notoriously immigration-shy provincial government to accept as many as 14% more newcomers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pandemic-driven exodus from Silicon Valley has <a href="https://innovationeconomycouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/IEC-Report-Magnetic-North-Dec-2020.pdf">sent large numbers of Canadian expatriates flocking home</a>. The number of Canadians applying for the U.S. H-1B program has fallen dramatically, accelerating a decade-long trend.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Canadians have been broadly supportive of government spending to beat back COVID-19 and hasten the transition to a new economy.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Still, Canadian tech and political leaders remain concerned about the inbound flow of talent to key sectors like advanced manufacturing, clean tech and biotechnology. They’re pressing every button they can to chip away at long-held American advantages.</p>
<p>Much of the action is in biotech. COVID-19 has exposed Canada’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/04/canada-vaccine-rollout-problems/618516/">lack of vaccine manufacturing capacity</a>, but the country has a vibrant biotech and life-sciences research sector, driven by an excellent university ecosystem and several thousand startup ventures doing cutting-edge research. Many of these firms have cashed in on the pandemic biotech investment boom, racking in a <a href="https://www.bctechnology.com/news/2020/11/26/Booming-Canadian-Biotech-Sector-on-Track-for-Record-Year-After-Raising-1-Billion-in-Venture-Capital-So-Far-in-2020.cfm">record amount</a> of venture capital in 2020.</p>
<p>But while this influx has changed the funding landscape, many Canadian companies are still trying to reach scale. The Canadian tech ecosystem is full of talent but it hasn’t traditionally developed, recruited and <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/rob-magazine/article-just-say-ehhhhh-when-it-comes-to-the-lucrative-us-drug-discovery/">retained</a> enough of the senior people these firms need to develop into global powerhouses.</p>
<p>They don’t just need scientists &#8212; they need business leaders. A <a href="https://www.marsdd.com/news/canadas-biotech-and-life-sciences-sector-needs-an-infusion-of-talent-to-scale/">recent survey</a> of Toronto-area hubs and ventures revealed that biomedical engineering, regenerative medicine and related firms are suffering significant shortages of senior executives, top managers and scientific specialists, who gravitate toward the better pay and opportunities of the U.S. industries.</p>
<p>At a recent summit of Canada’s Innovation Economy Council (IEC), which both our organizations belong to, industry leaders spoke of unfilled jobs in global regulatory affairs and business development, even chief medical officers. These are hybrid roles that require the kind of technical and business acumen forged from both academic training and progressive leadership roles in the workplace.</p>
<p>Canadian universities, hubs and <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-programs-target-canadas-chronic-biotech-talent-shortage-by-training/">venture-capital firms</a> are reacting to this need by building specialized training institutes and programs. And scaling Canadian companies are trying to fill the gaps by using newly raised cash to recruit heavily in the U.S. and beyond, offering remote work and flexible work hours while striking partnerships and investigating untapped talent pools.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, Canada’s federal government just delivered its first full budget in two years. It’s one of the <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-budget-promises-more-funding-for-innovative-technologies-including/">most activist tech-spending plans</a> the country has ever rolled out, showing how seriously the federal government is about building out advanced industries and creating STEM jobs at a time when global markets are moving away from the country’s traditional energy exports, natural resources and manufactured goods. The budget includes college research partnerships, hiring subsidies, grants, and support for incubators and hubs. Critically, there is also a $2.2 billion <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/news/2021/04/budget-2021-building-an-innovation-economy-of-the-future.html">commitment</a> for building a life-sciences talent pipeline.</p>
<p>Canadians have been broadly supportive of government spending to beat back COVID-19 and hasten the transition to a new economy. An IEC/Campaign Research poll conducted in early April found 3:1 public support for investments in postsecondary STEM education and similarly strong support for government investment in advanced manufacturing, including biotech. That’s just what it takes to compete with a neighbor 10 times your size.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that Canada won’t drain the U.S. of all its research scientists and Big Pharma CEOs anytime soon. But with an influx of investment capital, a burgeoning tech ecosystem and a concerted policy effort to build, recruit and retain a self-sustaining talent ecosystem, it’s flying under the radar as a place the industry increasingly wants to be.</p>
<p>In other words, America, take note: Canada is actively working to attract your biotech talent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.macrometa.com/">Macrometa</a>, the edge computing cloud and global data network for app developers, announced today it has raised a $20 million Series A. The round was led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/14/pelion-venture-partners-adds-jeff-kearl-as-a-managing-director-opens-southern-california-presence/">Pelion Venture Partners</a>, with participation from returning investors DNX Ventures (the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/dnx-ventures-launches-315-million-fund-for-u-s-and-japanese-b2b-startups/">Japan and US-focused enterprise fund </a>that led Macrometa’s seed round), Benhamou Global Ventures (BGV), Partech Partners, Fusion Fund, Sway Ventures and Shasta Ventures.</p>
<p>The startup, which is headquartered in Palo Alto with operations in Bulgaria and India, plans to use its Series A on feature development, acquiring more enterprise customers and integrating with content delivery networks (CDN), cloud and telecom providers. It will hire for its engineering and product development centers in the United States, Eastern Europe and India, and add new centers in Ukraine, Portugal, Greece, Mexico and Argentina.</p>
<p>The company’s last round of funding, an $7 million seed, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/macrometa-an-edge-computing-service-for-app-developers-lands-7m-seed-round-led-by-dnx/">announced just eight months ago</a>. Its Series A brings Macrometa’s total raised since its was founded in 2017 to $29 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As part of the new round, Macrometa expanded its board of directors, adding Pelion general partner Chris Cooper as a director, and Pelion senior associate Zain Rizavi and DNX Ventures principal Eva Nahari as board observers.</p>
<p>Macrometa’s global data network combines a globally distributed noSQL database and a low-latency stream data processing engine, enabling web and cloud develops to run and scale data-heavy, real-time cloud applications. The network allows developers to run apps concurrently across its 175 points of presence (PoPs), or edge regions, around the world, depending on which one is closest to an end user. Macrometa claims that the mean roundtrip time (RTT) for users on laptops or phones to its edge cloud and back is less than 50 milliseconds globally, or 50x to 100x faster than cloud platforms like DyanmoDB, MongoDB or Firebase.</p>

<p>Since its seed round last year, the company has accelerated its customer acquisition, especially among large global enterprises and web scale players, co-founder and chief executive officer Chetan Venkatesh told TechCrunch. Macrometa also made its self-service platform available to developers, who can try its serverless database, pub/sug, event processing and stateful compute runtime for free.</p>
<p>Macrometa recently became one of two distributed data companies (the other one is Fauna) <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/partnership-announcement-db/">partnered with Cloudflare</a> for developers building new apps on Workers, its serverless application platform. Venkatesh said the combination of Macrometa and Cloudflare Workers enables data-driven APIs and web services to be 50x to 100x faster in performance and lower latency compared to the public cloud.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated Macrometa’s business significantly, said Venkatesh, because its enterprise and web scale customers needed to handle the unpredictable data traffic patterns created by remote work. The pandemic also “resulted in several secular and permanent shifts in cloud adoption and consumption,” he added, changing how people shop, consume media, content and entertainment. That has “exponentially increased the need for handling dynamic bursts of demands for application infrastructure securely,” he said.</p>
<p>One example of how enterprise clients use Macrometa is e-commerce providers who implemented its infrastructure with their existing CDN and cloud backends to provide more data and AI-based personalization for shoppers, including real-time recommendations, regionalized search at the edge and local data geo-fencing to comply with data and privacy regulations.</p>
<p>Some of Macrometa’s SaaS clients use its global data network as a global data cache for handling surges in usage and keep regional copies of data and API results across its regional data centers. Venkatesh added that several large telecom operators have used Macrometa’s data stream ingestion and complex event processing platform to replace legacy data ingest platforms like Splunk, Tibco and Apache Kafka.</p>
<p>In a statement, Pelion Venture Partners, general partner Chris Cooper said, “We believe the next phase of computing will be focused on the edge, ultimately bringing cloud-based workloads closer to the end user. As more and more workloads move away from a centralized cloud model, Macrometa is becoming the de facto edge provider to run data-heavy and compute-intensive workloads for developers and enterprises alike, globally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Serial edtech entrepreneur David Blake, who co-founded Degreed and launched LearnIn, is living the dream of any book worm. He reads at least one book a week, talks to the authors behind it and unpacks his biggest questions around the subtlest of passages.</p>
<p>And it’s all thanks to his latest startup, BookClub, which first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/the-first-rule-of-bookclub-no-boring-book-clubs/">launched in September</a> to bring author-led book clubs to readers. “With Degreed, it’s big, it’s enterprise and it’s structural. It brought a deep sense of fulfillment, it felt rigorous and challenging” he said. “BookClub has felt joyful, a lot of fun, and like a blessing in my life.”</p>
<p>The platform gives authors a chance to hold book groups, share exclusive video-based interviews and engage in questions readers might have. And months after announcing its existence and $6 million seed raise, BookClub is back to announce a $20 million Series A round, led by Signal Peak Ventures. Other investment firms that participated in the round include GSV Ventures, Maveron, Backstage Capital​ and Pelion Venture Partners​.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Blake often describes BookClub as &#8220;MasterClass meets Goodreads.” It’s fitting that he got the founders of both of those companies on his cap table as well, with Aaron Rasmussen, co-founder of MasterClass and founder of Outlier.org, and Otis Chandler, co-founder and previous CEO of Goodreads, joining the Series A round.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qyxAAQmiQj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/how-is-edtech-spending-its-extra-capital/">How is edtech spending its extra capital?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How is edtech spending its extra capital?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/how-is-edtech-spending-its-extra-capital/embed/#?secret=qyxAAQmiQj" data-secret="qyxAAQmiQj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The capital comes as BookClub prepares to open its private beta, which includes thousands of readers, to the public by July. Along with opening up for business, BookClub is investing heavily in adding more authors to its platform. So far, there are 11 books featured on BookClub’s website from writers such as Emily Chang, Lara Prescott, Colin Bryar and Bill Carr.</p>
<p>Blake declined to give specifics for how many books are in production, but said that BookClub’s plan is to hit 200 books for its service by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>The startup is currently experimenting with two services to bring author-led discussions to readers. One service is that users can find a book and then click through videos as they progress through the book. When BookClub was recording with Emily Chang, the author of &#8220;Brotopia,&#8221; it produced eight to 12 hours of content, which ranges from Q&amp;A to readings to behind-the-scenes musings on writing the book, Blake explained.</p>
<p>“A lot of that sounds simple, but in a lot of ways it is special in its own way,” Blake said. “If you grew up in most places in America, there weren’t New York Times best-sellers coming to your local indie bookstore and just doing readings&#8230;in a lot of ways, this is able to democratize a lot of what authors do to engage the big cities [on book tours] but for everyone else,” he said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The first rule of BookClub? No boring book clubs.&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/the-first-rule-of-bookclub-no-boring-book-clubs/embed/#?secret=YTgBw2KTPR" data-secret="YTgBw2KTPR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The other service is similar to Oprah’s Book Club, a long-existent discussion series where Oprah interviews a different author behind a book each month. BookClub’s version of this is picking an author to discuss their book, as well as a series of books with similar themes, in an interview-style format. For example, Barbara Corcoran is discussing her book, &#8220;Shark Tales,&#8221; as well as five other books in an entrepreneurship-featured club.</p>
<p>One limitation for BookClub is figuring out how to generate enthusiasm through its platform. Book clubs often start off with the best of intentions, but then fall apart due to lack of accountability or limited interest among members to invest in deeper conversations. The startup will have to find a way, beyond author appeal, to integrate excitement without being overly prescriptive in its prompts. Another limitation might be the authors themselves. Because the startup&#8217;s products only work with living authors, it is missing out on a chunk of classical text.</p>
<p>The company might need to figure out a different way to represent authors, the non-living or camera shy, to reach what Blake views as its ultimate goal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, statistically, the chance that we&#8217;ve covered one of the books on your nightstand is pretty low,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to get there, fast.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded in 2018, Scythe Robotics is emerging from stealth today by announcing an $13.8 million Series A raise. The round was led by Inspired Capital and features True Ventures, Zigg Capital and Lemnos. It brings the Boulder, Colorado-based landscaping robotics company’s total funding up to $18.6 million, including a $4 million seed, also led by True Ventures.</p>
<p>The startup’s first product is an autonomous mower, offered to customers through a Robot-as-a-Service (RaaS) model. The method is becoming increasingly popular in the enterprise and industrial space, essentially offering clients robotics through a rental model that includes regular updates and maintenance. Interestingly, the company’s charging customers based on acres mowed.</p>
<p>The mower features eight HDR cameras and a variety of sensors designed to help avoid people, animals and various obstacles it might encounter on the job. Naturally, all of those sensors also come with a wealth of data collection aimed at &#8212; among other things &#8212; increasing the robot’s efficiency. Landscaping is a relatively low-hanging fruit for robotics. There&#8217;s certainly a lot to be said for automating the process for those with large swaths of land. Toro, notably, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/toro-acquires-robotic-tractor-snow-blower-maker-left-hand-robotics/">recently acquired Left Hand Robotics</a>, and iRobot has announced its own (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/irobots-terra-lawnmower-will-not-launch-in-2020-as-company-reprioritizes/">since delayed</a>) robotic mower.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qrS_TfJfXKA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>“To date, commercial landscape contractors haven’t had a technology partner who enables them to keep up with demand and to operate emissions-free. We are that partner,” said co-founder and CEO Jack Morrison in a release. “Our autonomous mower gives them the ability to grow their business, while staying green. It’s designed from the ground up to be an order of magnitude more reliable, more productive, and safer than any existing machine by incorporating state of the art autonomy with a rugged, all-electric design.”</p>
<p>Funding will go toward increasing headcount in its Colorado, Texas and Florida offices, R&amp;D on further products and getting the mower in front of new customers.</p>

But even as Covid-19 restrictions are easing up, the demand for mobile gaming isn&#8217;t slowing. According to a new report from mobile data and analytics provider <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/">App Annie</a> in collaboration with IDC, users worldwide downloaded 30% more games in the first quarter of 2021 than in the fourth quarter of 2019, and spent a record-breaking $1.7 billion per week in mobile games in Q1 2021.</p>
<p>That figure is up 40% from pre-pandemic levels, the report noted.</p>

<p>The U.S. and Germany led other markets in terms of growth in mobile game spending year-over-year as of Q1 2021 in the North American and Western European markets, respectively. Saudi Arabia and Turkey led the growth in the rest of the world, outside the Asia-Pacific region. The latter made up around half of the mobile game spend in the quarter, App Annie said.</p>

<p>The growth in mobile gaming, in part accelerated by the pandemic, also sees mobile further outpacing other forms of digital games consumption. This year, mobile gaming will increased its global lead over PC and Mac gaming to 2.9x and will extend its lead over home games consoles to 3.1x.</p>

<p>However, this change comes at a time when the mobile and console market is continuing to merge, App Annie notes, as more mobile devices are capable of offering console-like graphics and gameplay experiences, including those with cross-platform capabilities and social gaming features.</p>
<p>Games with real-time online features tend to dominate the Top Grossing charts on the app stores, including things like player-vs-player and cross-play features. For example, the top grossing mobile game worldwide on iOS and Google Play in Q1 2021 was Roblox. This was followed by Genshin Impact, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/apple-announces-its-2021-apple-design-award-winners/">just won an Apple Design Award</a> during the Worldwide Developer Conference for its visual experience.</p>

<p>The report also analyzed the ad market around gaming and the growth of mobile companion apps for game consoles, including My Nintendo, Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation App, Steam, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox apps. Downloads for these apps peaked under lockdowns in April 2020 in the U.S., but continue to see stronger downloads than pre-pandemic.</p>

<p>On the advertising front, App Annie says user sentiment towards in-game mobile ads improved in Q3 2020 compared with Q3 2019, but rewarded video ads and playable ads were preferred in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab is developing two spacecraft based on its Photon platform to orbit Mars, studying the planet&#8217;s magnetosphere in order to gain a better understanding of the ways in which Mars&#8217; climate has changed over time. The science mission was awarded through NASA&#8217;s Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEx) program, and will fly to Mars in 2024, aboard a yet-to-be-identified commercial lunch vehicle contracted by NASA as a rideshare rocket.</p>
<p>This is a noteworthy development for a few reasons, including that Rocket Lab will realize its earlier announced vision of using Photon as a platform for satellites that travel beyond Earth&#8217;s orbit. It&#8217;s also interesting because it will ostensibly mark the first decoupling of Rocket Lab&#8217;s launch and spacecraft services businesses.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab&#8217;s Photon is a satellite platform that includes the company&#8217;s Curie in-space propulsion system, and they&#8217;ll also be outfitted for this mission with star trackers and reaction wheels to make up a situational control system, as well as a deep space navigation system or way finding. The appeal of Photon is meant to be deep space exploration capability in a small, affordable and relatively low mass for launch package that could broaden access to interplanetary science for more organizations and institutions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Next up for the Rocket Lab-supported Escapate mission that will use these two Mars-bound Photos is a design review in June, which will be followed up by a final confirmation review in July as a last check before the Photons are built, equipped and readied for their eventual flight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, venture firm Andreessen Horowitz is officially launching its media property, called <a href="https://future.a16z.com">Future</a>. I’m on vacation today but couldn’t resist covering this fascinating new project.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The publication will initially focus on topics related to areas that the firm invests in but will expand over time using a mix of full-time staff, paid contributors and industry operators like founders, academics and entrepreneurs. And yes, they did get the dot com.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://future.a16z.com">Future.com</a> that is launching today is an MVP version (on a subdomain initially) of what the firm hopes the publication will be eventually, says Margit Wennmachers, Operating Partner, Marketing and Future at Andreessen Horowitz.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The content will be created by a mixture of staff and outside contributors that run the gamut from big names to up-and-comers says Wennmachers. The publication will cover topics that they find compelling with a broad theme of ‘rational optimism’ — something that the firm feels there isn’t enough of in coverage of tech at large.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This isn’t a news operation, Wennmachers says, and they will focus on future-focused informational and editorial content, rather than day-to-day tech occurrences. Though when the news dovetails with subject matter that they feel they have expertise to cover either from contributors, staff or A16z partners, there will be topical coverage.</p>
<p>The initial leadership staff includes Wennmachers, Editor in Chief Sonal Chokshi, Executive Editor Maggie Leung and Managing Editor Amelia Salyers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The contributors and topics that are set for launch sketch out an idea of the scope that Future is shooting for. A short list of some of them was provided, to give an impression:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Betül Kaçar</b> is a professor at the University of Arizona. She directs a NASA research consortium exploring the origins, evolution, and distribution of life in the Universe. Betül is contributing to Future on paleobiology and how the past can help build the future.</li>
<li><b>Marvin Ammori</b>, Chief Legal Officer of Uniswap Labs and advisor to the Harvard Law School Blockchain &amp; Fintech Initiative. Marvin is writing the definitive Defi explainer for Future.</li>
<li><b>Jade Raymond</b> is a Canadian video game creator, best known for helping create the Assassin’s Creed and Watch Dogs franchises, and for building the Ubisoft Toronto and EA Motive Studios. Jade will contribute on the subject of big company IP, gaming, and creators</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus with the initial wave of establishing content will be to produce explainers, how-to content and cohort learning by experienced founders in and outside of the A16z portfolio.</p>
<p>“We want to write about stuff we know and that we invest in,” says Wennmachers. This includes topics like crypto, biotech, fintech and real-estate, which all have dedicated partners at the firm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>They also want to bring in people who know an extremely technical space particularly well, something like nuclear energy, for instance. They will contextualize and explain these arenas for the hoped-for audience of ‘tech enthusiasts’ as well as founders and entrepreneurs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>They&#8217;re not starting from zero, here. A16z already has a strong reputation for producing content via its popular podcast and company blog posts that outlines the intricacies of a nascent technology, especially those related to deep tech or coalescing out of research.</p>
<p>The firm is prepared to invest in this publication long-term, and they are prepared to take the time to set a baseline for success metrics, says Wennmachers. The success of the publication will be tracked on some hard and soft metrics related to engagement. Traffic to the site will be considered, for instance, but also whether the targeted audience is ‘sending us around’ or ‘talking about the topics we raise’, says Wennmachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Metrics like time on page or whether people are finishing the articles or podcast episodes will take precedent. One big advantage that Future has over other publications in the tech space, Wennmachers admits, is that they don’t have to monetize. A16z will be footing the bill for the buildout and talent here. This, of course, allows more freedom to choose what kinds of metrics are a part of the success rubric.</p>
<p>Video isn’t initially a focus but eventually YouTube or other video platforms could be on the docket.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The content, overall, is aiming to be action-oriented with information that is helpful in defining legislation, charting the course of your company or bringing a good point to your next meeting, says Wennmachers. Usability of information, basically, is a key sight line.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Future will be writing ‘to tech people’ and to ‘the tech curious’. It will ideally, Wennmachers acknowledges, also help A16z win deals in the spaces where it demonstrates interest and understanding through publishing. The firm, she says, often wins deals at the intersection of two areas where they have expertise. Partners that specialize in biotech and consumer can come together, for instance, to support firms like Levels, which have a consumer-facing biotech footprint. Future can help to put those ideas out into the world, creating a sense that the firm knows what they’re talking about there and can add value.</p>
<p>Some other overall goals are to boost nascent tech communities like those around crypto and other edge tech endeavors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Future, says Wennmachers, should ideally provide content that doesn’t currently exist in the market that can be created from a ‘unique, interesting perch’ that the firm has. The audience, she says, is people who are curious, have an open mind and want to understand complex tech topics from the point of view of operators. People in consumer tech that want to cross-pollinate their ideas with deep tech arenas, for instance. With a sub-line of information about how new companies are built and grown.</p>
<p>The combination of full-time writers, paid contributors, entrepreneurs who probably have more ideas than days behind a pen and a wide array of external voices means that the editors have their work ahead of them. A voice will need to coalesce, as well as a reputation for signal and domain expertise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Future isn’t expected to win just because it’s backed by A16, though.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“We have to win in the market,” Wennmachers acknowledges, “people’s attention is all over.”</p>
<p>Since Future is about, well, the future, I was curious whether they were pursuing any alternative structures. Co-ops, DAOs or distributed contribution systems that reflected the diaspora of talent out of the silos of traditional publishers and into other framing devices like Substack.</p>
<p>Not for now, says Wennmachers, as they want to establish Future as a thing that even exists and to make sure its voice is crisp. This will be a ‘traditional’ publication in all of the major ways that count, for now.</p>
<p>The MVP is launching today, and the team is willing to build in public, rather than continue to polish in private. Given the audience, that will likely attract some of the exact people that they want reading — as well as some of the expected critics.</p>
<p>Future launches into a very interesting time in media. There are a variety of different currents that are shifting the shorelines of publishing, renegotiating the relationships between individuals, organizations and audiences. At the same time, in tech, there is an increasing desire to control and shape the narrative around the next wave of world-altering technologies and companies without the involvement of the journalistic apparatus — or at least in counter to.</p>
<p>There is also a trend by media at large away from the same ‘rational optimism’ that Future is leaning into. Instead, the prevailing attitude seems to align more with ‘collective cynicism’. Many scalar entities in tech have enabled harm, therefore any similarly momentum-driven technologies and companies are to be viewed with a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjuvYf42pnxAhUpDzQIHQ2bCMIQFjALegQIEhAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fminorityreport.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FPrecogs&amp;usg=AOvVaw3A4WjEnWwpFMTl7LHVECW3">Precog’s</a> eye for future crimes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>How the media apparatus reacts to a publication like Future will probably say a lot about how the balance is currently being struck between narrative encapsulation and intellectual rigor. For tech journalists who are willing to dig until they hit white paper this may not change much and in fact could become a good source of information about sprouting technical arenas. For those who thrive on access, I&#8217;d expect a good chunk of that access to get swallowed by Future, especially for the firm&#8217;s portfolio companies. Good luck there.</p>
<p>As far as Future&#8217;s chances, the media business is not easy, but the backing is incredibly substantial given that it doesn&#8217;t have to be self-sustaining, and the initial editorial hires say that they’re taking this endeavor pretty seriously.</p>
<p>There has already been chatter about conflict as it relates to the content being produced by efforts like Future &#8212; a huge deal for a journalistic enterprise where you are ostensibly acting as the avatar for the reader. But, if A16z is openly talking their own book with the content on Future then the conflict discussion is really already over. They have a point of view and it is going to be colored by their worldview, deal flow and network. End of story.</p>
<p>Whether the majority of media becomes conflicted ad nauseam and what that means is really another discussion.</p>
<p>I’d also look to see a lot of other firms scrambling to construct a media apparatus out of thin air — shout out to the comms strategists who will have figure out where to begin <i>that</i> discussion with their clients this week.</p>
<p>Whether you view Future as a marketing exercise, a necessary evolution or an immune reaction of the tech ecosystem, it’s doubtful that it will be boring.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I’m out. I look forward to the hot takes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Social calendar app <a href="https://www.irl.com/">IRL</a> has been busy building a messaging-based social network, or what founder and CEO Abraham Shafi calls a &#8220;WeChat of the West.&#8221; Following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/streaming-events-calendar/">pandemic-fueled growth</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/now-with-over-10m-monthly-users-irl-turns-its-events-website-into-a-social-network/">further push</a> into the social networking space with group chat and other features, IRL is today announcing a sizable $170 million Series C growth round, led by <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/softbank-earnings-vision-fund-2-fundraising">SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2</a>. The fundraise also mints IRL as a new unicorn with a $1.17 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Besides SoftBank, new investor Dragoneer also participated in the oversubscribed round, alongside returning investors Goodwater Capital, Founders Fund and Floodgate. To date, IRL has raised over $200 million.</p>
<p>The startup began its life as a tool for discovering real-world events &#8212; an industry that went to zero almost overnight due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That could have been the end for IRL, but the startup quickly pivoted to prioritize discovery of online events instead. Under COVID lockdowns, users could turn to the app to find things like livestreamed concerts, esports events, Zoom parties and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>IRL focused on pulling in popular online events from places like Live Nation, Twitch, YouTube, TikTok and others.</p>
<p>As a result, IRL became more accessible because its audience was no longer limited only to those who had time and money to travel to real-world events.</p>
<p>That focus also helped the app to attract a crowd of younger users who are of the generation that doesn&#8217;t use Facebook.</p>
<p>&#8220;They essentially use Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok,&#8221; explains Shafi. &#8220;But there is no groups and events product for that generation,&#8221; he points out.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/now-with-over-10m-monthly-users-irl-turns-its-events-website-into-a-social-network/"> doubled down on its social networking features</a> with the launch of a new site that added things like user profiles, support for group chats, the ability to join group events, personalized recommendations and more. As users could now network with friends across both web and mobile, IRL began to feel more like a social network, not just an event-discovery engine.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165854" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165854" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2165854" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IRL-College-Network-Overview-large.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="417" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IRL-College-Network-Overview-large.png 10572w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IRL-College-Network-Overview-large.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IRL-College-Network-Overview-large.png?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IRL-College-Network-Overview-large.png?resize=768,471 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IRL-College-Network-Overview-large.png?resize=680,417 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IRL-College-Network-Overview-large.png?resize=1536,941 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IRL-College-Network-Overview-large.png?resize=2048,1255 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IRL-College-Network-Overview-large.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165854" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> IRL</p></div></p>
<p>Today, IRL has 20 million users and 12 million who use the app monthly, which are not startling numbers in comparison to major social networks and their billions of users. But the numbers are representative of a steady approach that helped IRL grow 400% over the past 15 months, despite COVID&#8217;s impact to real-world events.</p>
<p>But as of recently, things are starting to change. In-person events are starting to return. California, the home state for San Francisco-based IRL, is <a href="https://abc7.com/california-reopening-mask-mandate-june-15-covid/10787888/">today re-opening</a>, for example. That opens up IRL to once again focus on connecting people not just online, but also &#8220;in real life,&#8221; as its name implies.</p>
<p>That could mean helping people better connect around events with not just their own friend group, as is often the case today, but helping them discover new groups in their local area or on campus. The company is even planning to use a portion of its fundraise to help fuel the new events economy by allocating a certain amount of money per city that will go toward helping people put on real-world events. The exact details are still being worked out, Shafi says, but says the idea is that IRL wants to help &#8220;bring culture back in cities that are opening up again.&#8221;</p>
<p>IRL also plans to expand its international footprint by finding ways to bring in non-U.S. users to its platform &#8212; possibly beginning with the events focused on watching the Olympics. (If the Games are not again delayed or <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cancel-the-tokyo-olympics-its-unlikely-heres-why/">canceled</a> due to a COVID surge.)</p>
<p>Shafi says IRL hadn&#8217;t been planning to fundraise, but they decided to take the meetings when they were approached.</p>
<p>&#8220;The philosophy is not to raise when you have to, but to raise when it makes sense. And we were scaling like crazy to the point where our servers were melting. It made sense to take those discussions very seriously when they came to us,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The addition of SoftBank and Dragoneer brings some expertise in scaling large social networks to the IRL team. SoftBank&#8217;s other notable social networking investment is with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-26/bytedance-is-said-to-secure-funding-at-record-75-billion-value">TikTok owner&#8217;s Bytedance</a>, while <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/dragoneer-investment-group-portfolio-companies">Dragoneer</a> has backed Snap. IRL has already has a close relationship with TikTok as it&#8217;s worked with the video app to pull in interesting events for discovery. It <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/irl-integrates-with-tiktok/">more recently integrated</a> with TikTok&#8217;s new &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/tiktok-expands-integrations-with-third-party-apps-for-logins-sharing-sounds-and-more/">Login Kit</a>,&#8221; too, allowing TikTok users to authenticate with IRL using their TikTok credentials.</p>
<p>Now, IRL plans to add an even deeper TikTok integration &#8212; something that caught SoftBank&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>Shafi is cagey on the details, but says more will be announced in the &#8220;coming weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what I can say is that we&#8217;ve seen a ton of growth of TikTok users linking to IRL group chats and IRL events through their TikTok profiles as a way to communicate and go deeper in relationships,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If you think about it, right now Instagram has really great messaging&#8230;whereas TikTok is still developing that,&#8221; he hints.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165855" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165855" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2165855" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Paid-Group-Page.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Paid-Group-Page.png 919w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Paid-Group-Page.png?resize=150,118 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Paid-Group-Page.png?resize=300,236 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Paid-Group-Page.png?resize=768,605 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Paid-Group-Page.png?resize=680,536 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Paid-Group-Page.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165855" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> IRL</p></div></p>
<p>Beyond its value to growing social networks for the younger, Facebook-less generation, IRL is thinking about how to build a profitable business without ad revenue. On this front, it sees potential in helping people connect through paid events &#8212; although these wouldn&#8217;t have to be influencer-driven as on other platforms. In fact, when IRL recently piloted paid group chats, users were willing to pay for access to things like a calc homework help group, for example.</p>
<p>IRL also sees demand for tools that help groups and clubs collect membership dues and other fees, as well as for events that are too small for Ticketmaster or Eventbrite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether we succeed or fail will be based on our ability to execute on our opportunity,&#8221; says Shafi, adding that most social networks today are focused on media more so than helping users make connections. &#8220;What we&#8217;re building isn&#8217;t the media part of social, it&#8217;s the real human interaction part of social, because that hasn&#8217;t been paid attention to as much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building a messaging social network,&#8221; he continues, comparing it to the biggest messaging social network in the world, WeChat. &#8220;The big vision that we&#8217;re going for is building the WeChat of the West &#8212; a messaging super social network. And it starts with people organizing groups and doing things together,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>With the additional funding, IRL will invest in product growth, international expansion and its Creator and Culture Fund, and will grow its now 25-person remotely distributed team to 100 by year-end.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are increasingly seeking more in-person social connections and are looking to share meaningful experiences together. As an innovative event-based social network, IRL sits at the intersection of group and event discovery, social calendaring, and group messaging, enabling people to do more together,&#8221; added Serena Dayal, director at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement about its investment. &#8220;We are excited to partner with Abraham and the IRL team to support their ambition of helping everyone deepen their connections to friends and family.&#8221;</p>
