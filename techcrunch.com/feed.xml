										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“It is great that MWC is back,” Samsung UK’s James Kitto said, opening up this year’s presser. “And behalf of everyone at Samsung, it’s great to be back at MWC.”</p>
<p>What, precisely, it means to be “back” in 2021 is another question entirely. Samsung was, of course, one of a number of major industry players who announced that they would not be exhibiting at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. It was hard not to see an echo of last year’s event, when key players pulled out, one by one, forcing the GSMA to cancel the event altogether.</p>
<p>This year’s event is different for myriad reasons. For one thing, MWC’s traditional timeframe of late-February/early-March put the event directly in the crosshairs of COVID-19’s arrival in the EU. For another, this time out, the organizing body had another year to prepare.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The simplest route would have been to do what the CTA did with CES and go all-virtual. The first all-virtual CES had plenty of issues of course, but attempting an in-person element ahead of a widespread vaccine rollout in the U.S. would have, at best, complicated things by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>COVID-19 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/spain-covid-cases.html">continues to be a concern in Spain</a> – as with much of the world. The GSMA opted to go ahead with the event this year, however, after pushing MWC back several months from its standard dates. The company has implemented all sorts of safety measures, but judging from early videos taken at the event, social distancing ought not to prove an issue on the show floor this year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170931" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170931" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2170931" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/New-Unified-Platform-One-UI-Watch-App-Ecosystem.2021-06-28-11_55_13.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170931" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung/Google</p></div></p>
<p>It seems safe to assume that most who are “attending” the event are doing so virtually – a list that includes the vendors themselves.</p>
<p>Samsung is among those high profile companies that presented a pre-recorded virtual press conference. Perhaps companies still see value in being attached to this sort of event even if it’s virtual, or maybe the on-going partnership with the organization is worth nurturing. The cynical part of me wonders how many of the sponsored sessions just couldn’t be reversed.</p>

<p>Samsung’s event was arguably the biggest of the day, but the presser felt like little more than a placeholder. The biggest news of the press conference was an expansion of a partnership Google announced at I/O last month, while much of the rest of the stream was pointing toward an Unpacked event happening later this summer.</p>

<p>In fact, the event closed with a black and white slide reading “See you soon at the next Unpacked,” in case you didn’t get the hint. Bottom line: no hardware.</p>
<p>Lenovo, on the other hand, didn’t hold back. That’s due, in part, to the fact that the company releases a tremendous amount of hardware, so why not tie it to MWC, right?</p>
<p>The list of announcements inluces a new version of the Smart Clock Google Assistant alarm clock with a built-in wireless charging pads for phones and several tablets, including the Yoga Tab 11 and 13, which sport combination hanger/kickstand. The 13-inch system also doubles as an external monitor, which is when the kickstand really comes in handy.</p>

<p>TCL got out ahead of the event early, with the announcement of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tcl-nxtwear-g-smart-glasses-and-multi-screen-collaboration-feature-announced-at-mwc-2021-301319326.html">NXTWEAR G</a> – a wearable OLED cinema display. The headmounted device approximates a 140-inch display with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The company also offered a better look at the 20 Pro 5G, which is coming to the States at just a dollar short of $500, featuring a snapdragon 750G processor and a headphone jack to boot.</p>

<p>Those are your top line headlines for the show so far. The event runs through July 1st, so still plenty of show left, whether or not anyone will be there to see it in person.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Email has the highest return on investment of any other marketing channel. On average, email earns you $40 for every $1 spent. And the best part is that email is an owned channel, which means you can reach your subscriber directly instead of relying on social media algorithms to surface your content.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://demandcurve.com">Demand Curve</a>, we’ve worked with over 500 startups, meticulously documenting growth tactics for all growth channels. We also incorporate what we&#8217;ve learned from our agency, <a href="http://bellcurve.com">Bell Curve</a>, which works with Outschool, Imperfect Produce and Microsoft to name a few.</p>
<p>To understand how to use email marketing effectively, we interviewed email marketers at this year&#8217;s fastest-growing startups. This post covers the most profitable tactics they use that capture 80% of the value using 20% of the effort.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>If people don&#8217;t open it, nothing else matters</h2>
<p>The subject line of your email is the most important, yet most marketers neglect it until after crafting the body of the email.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The subject line of your email is the most important, yet most marketers neglect it until after crafting the body of the email.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Increase the open-rate of your subject lines by making them self-evident. You don&#8217;t want people guessing why you want them to pay attention to your email. If the subject line is unclear or vague, your subscribers will ignore it.</p>
<p>One trick is to write like you speak. Try using subject lines that use informal language and contractions (it&#8217;s, they&#8217;re, you&#8217;ll). Not only will this save character count, it will also make your copy more friendly and quick to read.</p>
<p>Subject lines should be relevant to your subaudiences. Marketers generate 760% more revenue from segmented email campaigns than from untargeted emails.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170792" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170792" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170792 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.png" alt="A good subject line will increase the chances of your email being read" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170792" class="wp-caption-text">A good subject line will increase the chances of your email being read. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re collecting emails from multiple areas on your website, chances are the context will be slightly different for each. For example, people who subscribe after reading an article on ketogenic diets should receive emails that further educate them on keto and seeds products relevant to that lifestyle. Sending them information and product recommendations for vegetarians would not be relevant and could lead to them unsubscribing.</p>
<p>To ensure you&#8217;re sending relevant emails to the right audiences, segment your audience using tags and filters within your email marketing platform. Each platform will do this slightly differently, but all modern platforms should allow you to do this. When crafting your email subject line, ask yourself: &#8220;Would this email make sense to receive for this segment of subscriber?&#8221;</p>
<p>Your subject lines should be short and concise. About 46% of all emails are opened on mobile devices, which means the subject line must be short enough to fit on a smaller screen while getting your point across. Fifty characters is approximately the maximum length a subject line can be before it gets cut off on a mobile screen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Founders, help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keeping your subject lines short also makes them easier to scan when your subscriber is looking through their inbox. Including emojis in your subject line can cut down your character count and emulates how friends send text messages to each other. Including emojis in your subject lines will make your email feel less corporate and more friendly.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2s2TZW5IWG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1/">The Klaviyo EC-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Klaviyo EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1/embed/#?secret=2s2TZW5IWG" data-secret="2s2TZW5IWG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Designing emails that get read</h2>
<p>Once your subscriber opens your email, there are three outcomes that can follow: read, skim or bounce.</p>
<p>Subscribers that read your emails are the most valuable, because they will consume the full contents of your email. Skimmers will only read the headlines and look at the images you include. Subscribers who bounce will open your email, but if nothing catches their attention right away, they will simply delete or close your email.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re going to want to design your emails to minimize the number of bouncers, satisfy readers and provide enough high-level information that skimmers still understand your message.</p>
<p>To minimize the number of bounces, choose an email design that catches the eye and is relevant to your brand. Take the Casper email below for example. The starry night background and moon illustration is directly relevant to the mattresses they sell. Visually branded email designs will help elevate your brand perception.</p>

<p>To optimize for skimmers, write action-focused headlines. Use designs that draw the eye of your reader to key elements. As you can see in the Headspace example, the image of the rising sun pushes your gaze upward to the headline and the call-to-action button. Skimmers should be able to understand the context of the entire email and take action without needing to read the body.</p>
<p>To convert more readers, fulfill the expectation set by the subject line. Readers will be looking for any promises or hints you gave them in your subject line. Be sure to deliver on this promise in the body. Do so in an aggressively concise way — just because they&#8217;re reading doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t value their time.</p>
<h2>Call to actions that convert</h2>
<p>The goal of your body copy is to drive people to your call-to-action button (CTA). Your CTA is crucial, because it&#8217;s how you convert an email subscriber into a paying customer. To increase the conversion of your CTA, make a valuable promise in your body copy and headers that&#8217;s only delivered through your CTA.</p>
<p>Good CTA copy typically begins with a verb that teases what the reader will encounter next:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get</strong> your free sample.</li>
<li><strong>Redeem</strong> discount now.</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> the full inventory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Low-converting CTA copy is vague or nonactive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn more.</li>
<li>See inventory.</li>
<li>Download.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your email should only have one CTA. Any more and your conversion will decrease due to unnecessary decision-making. Ensure that the page on your site that your CTA leads to fulfills the promise you made in your body and CTA button.</p>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>Once the focus of the subject line is clear and the desired outcome is chosen, everything else should be crafted to carry the reader step by step through the email, eventually taking them to the desired action.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to work backward from the desired outcome you want the reader to perform. If the desired outcome is for them to click on a CTA button, frame your subject line, headers and body copy as a valuable promise that can only be achieved by clicking the button.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of your email through the eyes of all three types of subscribers: readers, skimmers and bouncers. Use visual and written prompts that make the purpose of your email clear to all three categories. Failing to do so could lead to unsubscribes and lost revenue.</p>
<p>Email has the highest return on investment than any other marketing channel because you have a captive audience who has opted-in to you communicating with them. Email can drive six times more conversions that a Twitter post and is 40 times more likely to get noticed than a Facebook post.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">One of the biggest factors in the success of a startup is its ability to quickly and confidently deliver software. As more consumers interact with businesses through a digital interface and more products embrace those interfaces as the opportunity to differentiate, speed and agility are paramount. It’s what makes or breaks a company.</p>
<p>As your startup grows, it’s important that your software delivery strategy evolves with you. Your software processes and tool choices will naturally change as you scale, but optimizing too early or letting them grow without a clear vision of where you&#8217;re going can cost you precious time and agility. I’ve seen how the right choices can pay huge dividends &#8212; and how the wrong choices can lead to time-consuming problems that could have been avoided.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The key to success is consistency. Create a standard, then apply it to all delivery pipelines.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As we know from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway&#8217;s law</a>, your software architecture and your organizational structure are deeply linked. It turns out that how you deliver is greatly impacted by both organizational structure and architecture. This is true at every stage of a startup but even more important in relation to how startups go through rapid growth. Software delivery on a team of two people is vastly different from software delivery on a team of 200.</p>
<p>Decisions you make at key growth inflection points can set you up for either turbocharged growth or mounting roadblocks.</p>
<h2>Founding stage: Keep it simple</h2>
<p>The founding phase is the exciting exploratory phase. You have an idea and a few engineers.</p>
<p>The key during this phase is to keep the architecture and tooling as simple and flexible as possible. Building a company is all about execution, so get the tools you need to execute consistently and put the rest on hold.</p>
<p>One place you can invest without overdoing it is in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). CI/CD enables developer teams to get feedback fast, learn from it, and deliver code changes quickly and reliably. While you&#8217;re trying to find product-market fit, learning fast is the name of the game. When systems start to become more complex, you&#8217;ll have the practices and tooling in place to handle them easily. By not having the ability to learn and adapt quickly, you give your competitors a massive edge.</p>
<p>One other place where early, simple investments really pay off is in operability. You want the simplest possible codebase: probably a monolith and a basic deploy. But if you don&#8217;t have some basic tools for observability, each user issue is going to take orders of magnitude longer than necessary to track down. That&#8217;s time you could be using to advance your feature set.</p>
<p>Your implementation here may be some placeholders with simple approaches. But those placeholders will force you to design effectively so that you can enhance later without massive rewrites.</p>
<h2>Very early stage: Maintain efficiency and productivity</h2>
<p>At 10 to 20 engineers, you likely don’t have a person dedicated to developer efficiency or tooling. Company priorities are still shifting, and although it may feel cumbersome for your team to be working as a single team, keep at it. Look for more fluid ways of creating independent workstreams without concrete team definitions or deep specialization. Your team will benefit from having everyone responsible for creating tools, processes and code rather than relying on a single person. In the long run, it will help foster efficiency and productivity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Young startups need to be great at design, not just for their products, but for their brands. The pandemic made that all harder — but lessons are being learned. We caught up with Scott Tong, a startup design expert who advises early-stage companies, to learn more.</p>
<p>The office may still be the best place to hash out big multiteam decisions, he says, but new best practices and modern tools are making remote collaboration easier and easier.</p>
<p>Brand design seems to only be getting trickier, however. &#8220;To users,&#8221; he explains, &#8220;brand and product are lumped together and they each represent the other.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, many users have spent lots of time at home online, often thinking harder about world events and how they are living their lives. They&#8217;re scrutinizing what they can observe about a startup to see if its values line up with theirs before they make a decision to sign up (or quit).</p>
<p>The solution, in Tong&#8217;s view, is to create a unifying plan where design decisions can address problems before they emerge.</p>
<p>More details are in the interview below. For a full conversation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/product-design-expert-scott-tong-will-join-us-at-tc-early-stage-in-july/">check out Tong&#8217;s talk about design strategy</a> coming up at our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021 – Marketing &amp; Fundraising conference on July 8</a>.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The pandemic affected us all. How has it affected user-focused brand design?</strong></p>
<p>The pandemic drove people to consume even more media than before. News about science, politics, race and the economy were unavoidable. Brands have had to navigate a very complex landscape of topics that can be divisive. People increasingly identify with brands that are aligned with their values. But in order to understand a brand&#8217;s values, someone has to sift through competing signals — some from the brand itself, and others from vocal supporters and critics. Say the wrong thing and a brand can risk alienating large portions of their audience (including their own employees). If a brand says nothing, their silence can be interpreted as complicity. And if brand messaging comes across as unauthentic, it could spell disaster. It’s a difficult needle to thread. It&#8217;s not uncommon for companies to run surveys to gather signals about how their brand is perceived by customers and noncustomers alike.</p>
<p><strong>What new things about users should startups consider when working on designing their identities? What are you advising startups now about designing their brands, versus what you said circa December 2020?</strong></p>
<p>Identities are only one part of a much larger constellation of touch points that make up a user&#8217;s perception of a brand. User expectations are extremely high and will continue to rise. Even with their free products, users have gotten accustomed to highly polished experiences. While &#8220;high quality&#8221; is table stakes for users, the challenge for a company is to pinpoint the handful of dimensions that matter most. That&#8217;s why constantly seeking to understand users is so important. Deeply understanding what they care about will help isolate those critical dimensions so teams can focus on areas that will drive the most meaningful impact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Founders, help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What do startups continue to get wrong?</strong></p>
<p>One recurring observation is that brand teams and product teams often sit in different parts of a company&#8217;s org structure. While there are reasons for this, it&#8217;s important to remember that users don’t care about your org structure. To users, brand and product are lumped together and they each represent the other.</p>
<p><strong>Internally, how are companies handling internal challenges like collaborative designing in a more remote world? In-person communication has been vital historically to get all parts of a company thinking in the same way. What is helping those who have gone remote-first succeed (tools, approaches to meeting and documentation, etc.)?</strong></p>
<p>Collaboration tools have never been more abundant. But while tools are plenty, norms around their usage can vary significantly from group to group, even within the same company. Where can I find the project brief? How many back-to-back meetings is too many? How are brainstorms run in a virtual environment? When do I use Slack versus email? Establishing those norms requires conversation and experimentation.</p>
<p>Along with norms around tools, it&#8217;s helpful to establish a cadence/rhythm that allows team members to get and stay in sync. Depending on the team, that cadence may be daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly or quarterly, etc., but find the appropriate cadence for each audience.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatively, do you think the demands of good design work will motivate more early-stage startups back into in-person office work?</strong></p>
<p>There are varying opinions on whether being in-person spurs innovation or productivity. The pandemic has forced us all to adapt, and design is no exception. It&#8217;s been encouraging to see good design happen in remote work environments, and a lot of that has been enabled by tools and the norms around their usage. While I personally would prefer being in-person, especially at the early stages of company building, I think it&#8217;s entirely possible to establish a high-functioning team in a remote environment. Of course there are cases &#8212; like hardware or soft goods &#8212; where tactile feedback is important and hard to replicate remotely. But even then I&#8217;ve seen some successful workarounds (for example, sending the same material sample to every team member). Given that this is all still very new, there will inevitably be hiccups along the way. But a team of willing participants with the right mix of tools and norms can make it work.</p>
<p><strong>Overall, with more teams remote and distributed, it may be even more natural than before to work with a third-party brand design expert. When do you advise startups to bring in an outside consultant today, and how should they work with them?</strong></p>
<p>This depends largely on how design is valued within an organization &#8212; as a service or as a partner.</p>
<p>If design is viewed as a partner, then the relationship is ongoing and iterative. This means design is a function that builds, measures and learns alongside their product and engineering counterparts and the benefits of institutional knowledge compound over time.</p>
<p>If design is viewed as a service, third parties make sense, because in a service relationship there is usually a defined beginning and end to an engagement. Clear scope, timeline and deliverables will set this kind of service relationship up for success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backbone One, the killer iPhone game pad I </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/with-backing-from-mr-beast-and-nadeshot-backbone-one-could-finally-crack-competitive-mobile-gaming/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">profiled here late last year</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> has just scored the mother of all tie-ups for a gaming accessory. It’s getting bundled with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate as it launches on iOS today alongside the xCloud game streaming service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a part of the deal, Backbone is being bundled with Xbox Game Pass in a new retail packaging that gets the Designed for Xbox stamp, making a Backbone + iPhone combo the closest thing we’ve ever seen to a portable Xbox. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my last piece, I noted how Backbone cleverly used the accessory APIs built into iOS to offer super slick functionality for its cross-game dashboard. It’s been updating that dashboard to get better about showing you games, exposing you to new games and letting you use its clipping features to share killer plays with your friends. It’s one of the best gaming apps I’ve seen on iOS in years, and it has big potential to create a cross-universe place to play for the biggest gaming audience in the world. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2171070" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png" alt="" width="1024" height="473" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png 3248w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png?resize=300,139 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png?resize=768,355 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png?resize=680,314 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png?resize=1536,709 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png?resize=2048,946 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Capture Button on Backbone One works with Xbox Cloud Gaming and lets you share it as a link. There’s also a new Xbox Game Pass feed and a way to move between Xbox and iOS games in the same interface. There’s also a big callout for Xbox Remote Play, a feature that’s still super under-utilized and actually quite good on current-gen consoles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The package even makes use of an AppClip to display an AR version of Backbone running xCloud for people happening on the retail packaging at a store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Backbone team continues to impress with its slick and clever integrations and solid instincts. The game controller pedigree of the team shows (some original Xbox 360 controller team members worked on Backbone) but the software aspects are the most impressive. The way that Backbone unifies gaming experiences across AAA iOS ports like Warzone or Minecraft, Xbox and Playstation Remote Play and now native xCloud games feels like the way of the future for mobile gaming in a way that none of the individual players, including Apple, has managed to get right. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2171068" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though xCloud games are web based they are treated and presented as native apps inside Backbone’s really well done dashboard. I’ve personally played a lot of Destiny 2 over Stadia on Backbone and it feels fantastic, I can’t wait for it to be more directly integrated into the dash with clipping and social like the Xbox cloud titles are today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience of discovering, downloading and playing a game is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">better</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a Backbone installed than even Apple Arcade now that the team is getting more into curation. They’ve also got a really slick linking mechanism that allows you to download apps right from the App Store if you see a clip of them being shared on your feed. This is how internet native players want to find and play new games &#8212; a continuously hyperlinked world of games and streams that makes it possible to see, follow and play without having to stop to manually search for anything.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also making me yearn for a time when discovering games goes beyond ‘downloading’ them and into a world where I can see a clip shared by a friend, tap on it and be playing a single level or match that gets me hooked before having to go buy the game. It would be a killer acquisition onramp for new players. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Microsoft tie up means that someone who purchases the Backbone for $99 </span><a href="https://playbackbone.com/products/backbone-one/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from its website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or at Microsoft Stores today gets 3 months of Game Pass Ultimate, making this the absolute best deal for new customers considering GPU is $45 alone. That’s bound to be a huge boost for Backbone as a young gaming startup. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">antitrust suit against Facebook</a> by the FTC and several states had the wind taken out of its sails today by a federal judge, who ruled that the plaintiffs don&#8217;t provide enough evidence that the company exerts monopoly control over social media. The court was more receptive, however, to revisiting the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, and the case was left open for regulators to take another shot at it.</p>
<p>The court decision was in response to a Facebook motion to dismiss the suit. Judge James Boesberg of the D.C. circuit explained that the provided evidence of monopoly and antitrust violations was &#8220;too speculative and conclusory to go forward.&#8221; In a more ordinary industry, it might have sufficed, he admits, but &#8220;this case involves no ordinary or intuitive market.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was incumbent on the plaintiffs to back up their allegation of Facebook controlling 60 percent of the market with clear and voluminous data and a convincing delineation of what exactly that market comprises — and it failed to do so, wrote Boesberg. Therefore he dismissed the complaints in accordance with Facebook&#8217;s legal argument.</p>
<p>The company wrote in a statement that it is &#8220;pleased that today’s decisions recognize the defects in the government complaints.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Boesberg is sensible that lack of evidence in the record does not mean that the evidence does not exist. So he his giving the FTC and states 30 days to amend their filing, after which the complaints will be reevaluated.</p>

<p>He also found that Facebook&#8217;s logic for dismissing the suit&#8217;s allegations regarding its controversial acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp was lacking.</p>
<p>Facebook argued that even supposing that these acquisitions were somehow problematic, the FTC is not authorized to prosecute such &#8220;long-past conduct&#8221; and is limited to more recent or imminent problems. Boesberg was not convinced, finding precedent that essentially says such mergers are legally considered current as long as they exist, and the government can revisit them any time it thinks it has cause. (That&#8217;s not the case for the state lawsuits, however, which he dismissed outright for coming too long after the fact.)</p>
<p>That may very well be the plan of the FTC&#8217;s new Chair, Lina Khan, who has taken a hawkish regulatory position regarding antitrust in general and past acquisitions specifically. At her confirmation hearing she commented that the approvals of the mergers may have been made without complete information and as such represented a &#8220;missed opportunity&#8221; to understand and build rules around.</p>
<p>An FTC representative said that &#8220;the FTC is closely reviewing the opinion and assessing the best option forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll likely know more following the agency&#8217;s meeting on Thursday. The 30 day punt in fact may be a great opportunity for Khan to put her ideas into practice, as the judge practically literally invites them to rewrite the complaint with more information. Whether she and the FTC have enough material to put together a compelling case remains to be seen, but one thing is for certain: Facebook should put the champagne back in the fridge, for now at least. Khan may not stop at a slap on the wrist.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After raising tens of millions from investors and executing a pretty substantial pivot earlier this year, augmented reality startup Ubiquity6 and its team have been acquired by gaming chat app giant Discord.</p>
<p>The ambitious AR startup had raised $37.5 million from a series of top investors including Benchmark, First Round, Kleiner Perkins and Google&#8217;s Gradient Ventures who were betting on its vision of building a consumer-facing platform for hosting augmented reality content. Its most recent publicly disclosed financing was a $27 million Series B in October of 2018.</p>
<p>Terms of the Discord acquisition weren&#8217;t disclosed, though in recent months the startup seemed to abandon most of the products it had spent its first several years building, suggesting that Ubiquity6 had been having some issues finding wide audiences for its products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Launching back in 2017, Ubiquity6 hoped to build an app that would be the central way mobile phone users would browse augmented reality content. In late 2019, the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/ubiquity6s-display-land-is-part-3d-scanner-part-social-network/">launched a product called Displayland</a>, which aimed to gamify the process of 3D scanning physical environments with a smartphone&#8217;s camera.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s efforts to find mass adoption were hampered by a mobile AR market, which has largely failed to gain any momentum in recent years despite hefty investment from tech giants, including Apple and Google.</p>
<p>In early 2020, CEO Anjney Midha told TechCrunch that the startup had some 65 employees.</p>

<p>In recent months, Ubiquity6 had executed a pretty drastic pivot, leaving augmented reality completely behind in favor of building out a desktop platform that allowed users to play simple online party games together remotely. The beta platform, called <a href="https://backyard.co/sunset">Backyard</a>, was designed for pandemic era habits that seem to be on the decline as the US springs back into action. Backyard was discontinued this week as part of the acquisition announcement.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://medium.com/@ubiquity_6/ubiquity6-discord-3b54cd715943">Medium post</a> announcing the acquisition, Midha seems to downplay any expectations that Ubiquity6&#8217;s augmented reality technology will be living on inside Discord.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission at Ubiquity6 has always been to unlock new ways for people to connect through shared experiences,&#8221; Midha wrote. &#8220;Joining Discord today allows us to accelerate that mission — Ubiquity6’s team, Backyard product and multiplayer technology will be integrated into Discord.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The road to entrepreneurship is never easy. The process is stressful and requires a tremendous amount of hustle, risk-taking and comfort with ambiguity. The sacrifices are innumerable, and they sometimes come at the expense of a person’s mental health.</p>
<p>Founders often find themselves in situations where they are under-resourced and overcommitted. While it’s exciting to chase a dream, the weight of responsibility &#8212; to employees, investors and customers &#8212; can feel overwhelming.</p>
<p>Compounding this issue is the reluctance many founders have to disclose how they’re feeling to those closest to them for fear that they will be perceived as a “failure” or ill-equipped to perform their job. Imagine for a moment that a founder is struggling with addiction or substance abuse because of the demands and pressures of running their company. Now imagine compounding the worry and anxiety by having to reveal something like this to investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Michael Freeman, a psychiatrist and former CEO who serves on the faculty of the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, investigated the prevalence and characteristics of mental health conditions among entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Founders are twice as likely to suffer from depression, six times more likely to suffer from ADHD, three times more likely to suffer from substance abuse and twice as likely to have suicidal thoughts than a demographically matched comparison.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>He concluded founders are twice as likely to suffer from depression, six times more likely to suffer from ADHD, three times more likely to suffer from substance abuse and twice as likely to have suicidal thoughts than a demographically matched comparison. Freeman found that entrepreneurs are 50% more likely to report having a mental health condition, with some specific conditions being incredibly prevalent among founders.</p>
<p>The statistics are eye-opening, but the real, tangible impact can be truly devastating.</p>
<p>I say all the time that if I have a sore arm or a sore shoulder, I&#8217;ll come into work and I&#8217;ll whine about it. But if I couldn&#8217;t sleep last night or I&#8217;m paranoid about going outside or I&#8217;ve been taking too many sleeping pills or drinking too much wine, I won&#8217;t talk about it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll say that I&#8217;m going to my doctor to get my shoulder fixed, but I won&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m going to talk to my therapist.</p>
<p>At QED Investors, we experienced the terrible results of this silence firsthand. In 2018, we lost our partner Greg Mazanec after a long battle with substance abuse. Since then, we’ve been working with Greg’s family to determine how we can do our part to prevent others in the VC and startup worlds from suffering the same fate.</p>
<p>I can’t speak highly enough of Greg, both as a personal friend and a colleague. He was the definition of an amazing human being — an orthogonal thinker, tenacious, brilliant, quirky. We lost him far too soon. Today, we carry him around on our shoulders.</p>
<p>We had a team of 15 people at the time, so you can imagine how close everyone was. I swore to myself and to his family that I would talk about him wherever I had the chance. So, whenever I get in front of LPs or my portfolio companies, I bring this issue out into the open to tackle this corrosive stigma head-on.</p>

<p>Taking mental health discussions out of the shadows can massively change the trajectory of outcomes. Our world of venture capital is replete with people who are going through these kinds of difficulties, even before the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated people’s fears and worries. People have felt increasingly isolated, depressed, anxious and helpless. Some may have turned to opioids or another form of addiction or substance misuse.</p>
<p>The research is clear &#8212; support from friends, peers and colleagues is pivotal in conquering mental illness. As companies start returning to the office or adopting a home-office hybrid, organizations have a real chance to refocus their company cultures, destigmatize addiction and make mental wellness a priority. This is a unique window to focus on this disease.</p>
<p>The Mazanec family created <a href="https://theoperationlighthouse.org/">Operation Lighthouse</a> to address substance abuse and addiction in the ecosystem most dear to Greg &#8212; the founder and entrepreneur community. It was the easiest of decisions for QED to lean in heavily to support this wonderful initiative.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, QED piloted a program called Just Five with three of our portfolio companies. Created by national mental health nonprofit <a href="https://www.shatterproof.org/">Shatterproof</a>, <a href="https://justfive.org/">Just Five</a> delivers, in 5 minutes per lesson, the most important concepts and facts regarding addiction.</p>
<p>Today, we are excited to roll out that same self-paced and anonymous educational program free of charge to more than 16,000 employees across all 50 of QED’s U.S.-based portfolio companies.</p>
<p>This program’s intent is to provide mental health education and catalyze informed discussion to ultimately reduce stigma.</p>
<p>Over the course of the year, we intend to expand the reach of this program to our international portfolio companies, as well as to other VCs who might wish to support their founders. A Spanish-language version is already planned.</p>
<p>Each of the six lessons has a specific theme. The first two lessons touch on the science of addiction and how certain factors such as age of first use, genetics and environment can explain why some people become addicted and others do not.</p>
<p>The middle lessons explain the dangers of opioids and the signs, symptoms and treatment options for substance abuse, while the final topics touch on ways people can help. The majority of the overwhelmingly positive feedback we have received so far has been centered around those final two lessons. We learned something that we anecdotally already knew &#8212; people want to help, but those who need help the most don’t always know how to ask for it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken every opportunity I’ve had to discuss mental health over the past few years. I truly believe that if you destigmatize it, people can deal with it. It’s a solvable problem. Just like your sore shoulder, it can be fixed. We just have to do a better job at creating a culture where people can take the first step and speak openly about it.</p>
<p>We can — we <em>must</em> — make a difference. Have your voice join mine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last fall, Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/opening-an-office-in-lagos-nigeria/">announced</a> it was opening an office in Lagos, Nigeria, which would provide the company with a hub in the region and the first office on the continent staffed with a team of engineers. We&#8217;ve now spotted one of the first products to emerge from this office: an education-focused mobile app called Sabee, which means &#8220;to know&#8221; in Nigerian Pidgin. The app aims to connect learners and educators in online communities to make educational opportunities more accessible.</p>
<p>The app was briefly published to Google Play by &#8220;NPE Team,&#8221; the internal R&amp;D group at Facebook, which has typically focused on new social experiences in areas like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/facebook-tests-video-speed-dating-events-with-sparked/">dating</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/facebook-tests-hotline-a-qa-product-thats-a-mashup-of-clubhouse-and-instagram-live/">audio</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/facebook-launches-bars-a-tiktok-like-app-for-creating-and-sharing-raps/">music</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/facebook-publicly-launches-its-collaborative-music-video-app-collab/">video</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/facebook-launches-an-experimental-app-for-messaging-close-friends-over-apple-watch/">messaging </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/facebook-launches-e-gg-an-experimental-collage-making-app/">more</a>.</p>
<p>While the learnings from the NPE Team&#8217;s apps sometimes inform broader Facebook efforts, the group hasn&#8217;t yet produced an app that has graduated to become a standalone Facebook product. Many of its earlier apps have also shut down, including (<a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/egg-is-facebooks-one-good-product-it-doesnt-deserve-to-die">somewhat sadly</a>), the online zine creator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/facebook-launches-e-gg-an-experimental-collage-making-app/">Eg.g</a>, video app<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/facebook-shuts-down-hobbi-its-experimental-app-for-documenting-personal-projects/"> Hobbi</a>, calling app CatchUp, friend-finder Bump, podcast community app Venue, and several others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sabee, however, represents a new direction for the NPE Team, as it&#8217;s not about building yet another social experiment.</p>
<p>Instead, Sabee is tied to Facebook&#8217;s larger strategy of focusing more on serving the African continent, starting with Nigeria. This is a strategic move, informed by <a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/urban-population-to-become-the-new-majority-worldwide/">data</a> that indicates a larger majority of the world&#8217;s population will be in urban centers by 2030, and much of that will be on the African continent and throughout the Middle East. By 2100, Africa&#8217;s population is <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1905838/facebook-to-open-africa-office-in-lagos-nigeria-in-2021/">expected to have tripled</a>, with Nigeria becoming the second-most populated country in the world, behind China.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171015" style="width: 259px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171015" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2171015" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-1.png?w=249" alt="" width="249" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-1.png 249w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-1.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-1.png?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-1.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171015" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook NPE Team</p></div></p>
<p>To address the need to connect these regions to the internet, Facebook teamed with telcos on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/2africa-africa-middle-east-facebook-subsea-cable/">2Africa, a subsea cable project</a> that aims to serve the over 1 billion people still offline in Africa and the Middle East. These aren&#8217;t altruistic investments, of course &#8212; Facebook knows its future growth will come from these demographics.</p>
<p>Facebook confirmed its plans for Sabee to TechCrunch after we discovered it, noting it was still a small test for the time being.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are 50 million learners, but only 2 million educators in Nigeria,&#8221; said Facebook Product Lead, Emeka Okafor. &#8220;With this small, early test, we’re hoping to understand how we can help educators build communities that make education available to everyone. We look forward to learning with our early testers, and deciding what to do from there.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171010" style="width: 259px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171010" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2171010" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-4.png?w=249" alt="" width="249" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-4.png 249w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-4.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-4.png?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-4.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171010" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook NPE Team</p></div></p>
<p>The disparity between learners and educators in Nigeria greatly impacts women and girls, which is another key focus for Sabee &#8212; and the NPE Team&#8217;s efforts in the region as a whole. The company also wants to explore how to better serve groups who are often left behind by technology. On this front, Sabee is working to create an experience that works with low connectivity, like 2G.</p>
<p>We understand the app is currently in early alpha testing with fewer than 100 testers who are under NDA agreements with Facebook. It&#8217;s not available for anyone else beyond that group at present, but the company hopes to scale Sabee to the next stage before the end of the year.</p>
<p>There is no way to sign up for a Sabee waitlist, and the app is no longer public on Google Play. It was available so briefly that it was never ranked on any charts, app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower confirmed to us.</p>
<p>We should note that &#8220;sabee&#8221; and &#8220;sabi/sabis&#8221; have other, less-polite meanings in different languages, per Urban Dictionary. But the team has no plans to change the name for now as it makes sense in the Nigerian market where the app is targeted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On this week&#8217;s episode of <a href="http://pod.link/found">Found</a>, we speak to Rob Schutz, co-founder and Chief Growth Officer at Ro. Ro recently raised $500 million, bringing its total raised to date to near $1 billion. The digital healthcare startup now does everything from telehealth primary care, to operating physical pharmacies, but it originally began life as Roman, a startup addressing men&#8217;s health and, specifically, erectile dysfunction.</p>
<p>Rob told us how a windy path from founding a daily deals site in the heady times of Groupon, to teaching at General Assembly, and being an early employee at Bark Box (now just &#8216;Bark&#8217;) led him to meeting up with co-founders Zachariah Reitano and Saman Rahmanian and setting up Roman in the first place. He also detailed how the company evolved, first to address women&#8217;s health, as well, and eventually to providing much more broad-reaching remote primary care.</p>
<p>We talked about everything from managing the dynamics in a founder triumvirate (including declarations of love), to dealing with the ongoing complications of a rebrand, to operating a business in an industry with dense regulatory requirements that vary considerably state to state.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We loved our time chatting with Rob, and we hope you love yours listening to the episode. And of course, we’d love if you can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Yes, developers are a tough crowd. They hate being sold to, and it’s pretty easy for traditional marketing campaigns to fall flat with them because they’d much rather get a recommendation from a colleague. Failed campaign after failed campaign has led many software company executives to throw up their hands and declare all sales and marketing to be pointless.</p>
<p>And that’s just wrong. Selling to developers isn’t impossible — it’s just difficult. I cover <em>why</em> it’s difficult and offer examples of exceptional developer-focused marketing in <a href="http://offers.openviewpartners.com/developerfocusedgtmplaybook">my new playbook</a>. Part of selling to developers involves balancing two things: building out a strong organic marketing function and targeting your audience with the right message at the right time throughout their buyer journey.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Selling to developers isn’t impossible — it’s just difficult.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Easier said than done, right?</p>
<p>Yep. I see it all the time. Part of what’s blocking marketers from widening the top of the funnel (driving more developers to sign up for their free tools) for their developer-focused businesses is ensuring they have the right data and measurement capabilities in place to understand how much impact their activities have on the business.</p>
<p>That’s mostly because these marketers, community managers and developer relations experts have the most luck with organic marketing. In this industry, organic marketing is one of the most challenging to measure.</p>
<p>Organic marketing means investing in channels like referrals, organic search, organic social (community) and direct traffic to your website (brand). New users from paid marketing, banner ads, events or sales reps (the most measurable channels) don’t count as organic. We measure the fruits of these efforts with a new metric called <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/new-saas-metric/">Natural Rate of Growth</a>.</p>
<p>In a digital, multi-touch-point world, it’s getting more challenging to measure which users hear about your brand from which channels. That’s why tools like <a href="https://orbit.love/">Orbit</a>, <a href="https://tribe.so/">Tribe</a> and <a href="https://www.mightynetworks.com/">Mighty</a> have gained traction so quickly.</p>
<p>That’s all good, and it’ll be a huge boon for community managers in time, but these tools still don’t solve some of the core data strategy issues I see developer-focused software companies fighting. These quick tips should help your team align around what needs to be done and what&#8217;s just a “nice to have” so that selling to developers feels less like a battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Treat data like a product where a core end user is the go-to-market side of the team.</li>
<li>Map your customer’s journey from discovery to expansion and track it religiously.</li>
<li>Don’t overthink it.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LocoNav, an India-based startup that is helping drivers and fleet owners in over two-dozen nations run their vehicles more efficiently and save money, said on Monday it has raised $37 million in a new financing round.</p>
<p>Five-year-old LocoNav&#8217;s new financing round, a Series B, was funded by Quiet Capital, Anthemis Group, Foundamental, Sequoia Capital India, RIT Capital Partners, Uncorrelated Ventures, Village Global and others. The new financing round brings the to-date raise of LocoNav, which has offices in San Francisco and Gurgaon, to $47 million.</p>
<p>Scores of high-profile tech executives, including Anjali Joshi (ex-VP of Product at Google), Anand Chandrasekaran (ex-CPO at SnapDeal and ex-Director Facebook), Manik Gupta (ex-CPO at Uber), Jai Shekhawat, Mark Licht, Akhil Paul, Vas Bhandarkar, Ajay Agarwal (Partner at Bain Capital Ventures), Abhi Ingle (COO at Qualtrics), Aadil Mamujee, also participated in the new round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over half a million vehicle and fleet owners in 25 nations use LocoNav’s platform today, which uses AI to help them manage their fleet operations, keep a watch on performance, and improve efficiency, the startup’s founders Shridhar Gupta and Vidit Jain told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>The startup’s platform delivers assistance and recommendations to drivers to make better choices. <a href="https://loconav.com">LocoNav</a> also enables customers to track fuel usage, and any potential theft. Its platform supports over a thousand devices and sensors, enabling it to onboard new customers very quickly.</p>
<p>The founders said that the market in which they operate has become very large over the past decade as many drivers and fleet owners begin to engage with tech platforms. Some of the players operating in this space include unicorns and decacorns Fleetcor, Trimble and a16z-backed Samsara.</p>
<p>But these players are largely operating in developed markets, which has allowed LocoNav to win customers in emerging nations, the founders said. “In global developing markets, no one has ambitiously built a large player and we see ourselves as the first mover there,” said Gupta. The founders added that the biggest roadblock in the industry remains drivers and fleet owners who are not using any tech.</p>
<p>“LocoNav has built an end-to-end product that becomes deeply embedded in how fleet owners and operators run their business. As a result, LocoNav has been able to scale rapidly through word of mouth, allowing the company to become a hyper growth market leader while also being very capital efficient,” said David Greenbaum, Partner at Quiet Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>By having such deep visibility into a vehicle, LocoNav has also become very attractive to a range of firms &#8212; from app-based cab aggregators, car vendors to fintech startups and sensor manufacturers, said Jain. The startup is also using its data insights to develop customer-relevant services and bringing them to a single platform, he added.</p>
<p>LocoNav plans to deploy the fresh capital to hire data science teams across San Francisco, Gurgaon and Bangalore. In the next two years, the startup aims to broaden its product offerings to help fleet owners cut their costs by up to 50%, the founders said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shridhar and Vidit have found the ideal playbook for delivering world-class value-added services and products to fleet owners across the globe through the use of AI and software solutions. We are thrilled at how rapidly the firm has been able to expand its global footprint by replicating its own model and suite of offerings for fleet owners,&#8221; said Shubhankar Bhattacharya, General Partner at Foundamental, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung’s Mobile World Congress presser was, once again, all about wearables. The big news at this evening’s (or afternoon’s, timezone dependent) event was <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/mwc-2021-samsung-new-one-ui-watch-experience/&amp;reserved=0">our best look yet at a redesigned interface</a> for the company’s line of Galaxy Watches.</p>
<p>One UI Watch – which takes its name from the Galaxy mobile interface &#8212; will share a design language with the one found on the company’s line of Galaxy phones. The upcoming One UI Watch will debut at an upcoming Unpacked event later this summer, sporting the new UI, as well as the forthcoming joint Samsung/Google platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170930" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170930" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170930" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/New-Unified-Platform-One-UI-Watch-Seamless-Experience.2021-06-28-11_56_37.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170930" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung/Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-and-samsung-are-teaming-up-to-take-on-apples-watchos/"> first teased at I/O last month</a> that the two technology powerhouses would be teaming up on a wearables project. We still have little in the way of information about it, however, – including what it will actually be called.</p>
<p>The partnership was initially announced as a “unified platform” that would allow developers to create a single app for both Google’s Wear OS and Tizen, the open-source operating system Samsung has long relied on for its own smartwatches. As we noted at the time, third-party app development has proven a considerable hurdle for both companies as they look to take on Apple’s dominance of the space.</p>
<p>Among the benefits of the partnerships is that once a watch-compatible app has been downloaded on a connected smartphone, it will also be downloaded to the watch. Along with first-party Google apps like Maps and YouTube Music, the list includes Spotify (naturally), Calm, Strava, Adidas Running and Sleep Cycle.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170931" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170931" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170931" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/New-Unified-Platform-One-UI-Watch-App-Ecosystem.2021-06-28-11_55_13.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170931" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung/Google</p></div></p>
<p>“Samsung and Google have a long history of collaboration, and whenever we’ve worked together, the experience for our consumers has been dramatically better for everyone,” Google SVP Sameer Samat said in a release tied to the news. “That certainly holds true for this new, unified platform, which will be rolling out for the first time on Samsung’s new Galaxy Watch. In collaboration with Samsung, we’re thrilled to bring longer battery life, faster performance, and a wide range of apps, including many from Google to a whole new wearable experience.”</p>
<p>Such a partnership seems odd at first blush – Samsung long ago eschewed Google’s wearable operating system in favor of its own heavily customized version of Tizen. Ultimately, however, it seems the two are united against the monolith that is Apple – which currently enjoys somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% of the global market. Samsung is in second, but even with Fitbit under its wing, Google’s still got a ways to go.</p>
<p>Samsung will also be showing off improved development tools that make it easier to create things like watch faces for the platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft today released the first preview build of Windows 11 to those in the Dev Channel of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/">Windows Insider</a> program. If you have joined the Insider program and meet Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/24/preparing-for-insider-preview-builds-of-windows-11/">new &#8212; and somewhat complicated &#8212; system requirements</a> for the new operating system, you should see the update soon.</p>
<p>This first preview includes most of the new features Microsoft has promised for Windows 11, including the new look and feel, themes, widgets, the new snap layouts and the updated File Explorer. But there are also some features that didn&#8217;t yet make the cut for this first release. Support for Android apps and the new built-in Teams integration, for example, are coming in a later release, but a preview of the new Windows Store is already available today.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/g7y1S3wIysg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Otherwise, though, you&#8217;ll get to try out the new Start menu for example (and fret not, you will be able to move the start button to the bottom-left if you don&#8217;t like the centered look &#8212; but you won&#8217;t be able to move the entire taskbar to another side of the screen). And while the Start menu is an iconic part of the Windows experience, most power users probably never use it and instead use their keyboard or the taskbar to start 99% of their applications. Still, Microsoft is trying to do something different here with its new &#8220;recommended&#8221; section that highlights newly installed apps and recently used files.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170667" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170667" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170667" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg" alt="windows 11 file explorer" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg 1535w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170667" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Another new feature you&#8217;ll likely spot right away is the new File Explorer, which now does away with the ribbon-style menu in favor of a flatter look (Microsoft calls it a &#8216;command bar&#8217;) and new, more modern icons across the board. It looks good, but we&#8217;ll have to give it a try to see if it hasn&#8217;t lost a lot of functionality in the process.</p>
<p>The File Explorer, just like every other app in WIndows 11, will also feature support for Microsoft&#8217;s new Snap layouts, which take the existing &#8216;snapping&#8217; gesture or keyboard shortcuts in Windows that let you snap windows to any side of the screen and brings it to the maximize button. While the overall functionality isn&#8217;t new here, I&#8217;m pretty sure that a lot of Windows users never knew it existed, so this new feature will introduce window snapping to a lot more users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170668" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170668" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170668" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg" alt="Windows 11 widgets" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg 1531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170668" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>The new widgets, too, are now prominently highlighted in the taskbar. Right now, there are calendar, weather, local traffic, Microsoft To Do and stocks widgets, as well widgets that show you recent photos from OneDrive and sports and esports news if that&#8217;s your thing. There&#8217;s also a personalized news feed.</p>
<p>The last new feature worth mentioning here is the new Settings menu. Ever since the ill-fated Windows 8, Windows essentially had two settings menus (the Control Panel and Settings). It looks like those confusing days aren&#8217;t over just yet, but the new Settings menu at least looks a lot cleaner than the existing one in Windows 10.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170669" style="width: 1545px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170669" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170669 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg" alt="windows 11 settings" width="1535" height="1020" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg 1535w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=768,510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1535px) 100vw, 1535px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170669" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>There are, of course, plenty of other changes in Windows 11. This is definitely more than just another bi-annual Windows 10 update with a few minor UI changes. Now we&#8217;ll just have to see how all of this works in the real world &#8212; though keep in mind that this is still an early release. The preview is now rolling out to Insiders, so we&#8217;ll likely hear more about how it performs soon. We&#8217;ll also put it through its paces in the coming days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The math is simple: Great research universities beget great startups. Pittsburgh certainly has little want for the former, with two world-class research schools &#8212; Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh – located in the city.</p>
<p>The latter historically presented a challenge for Pittsburgh, as local startups often left for the greener (in the sense of dollars) pastures of vibrant ecosystems like New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/pittsburghs-mayor-on-the-citys-startup-community-and-the-difficulty-of-attracting-venture-capital/">speaking to current mayor Bill Peduto</a> about how Pittsburgh is working to build its own startup community, I hopped on a call with Dave Mawhinney, the executive director of CMU’s Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship. The Center – named for Accel founder Jim Swartz – is tasked with helping grow the student body’s entrepreneurial ambitions.</p>

Join us on Tuesday, June 29 for the free online event where we will be joined by Mayor Peduto, Karin Tsai, director of engineering at Duolingo, and Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">Register for the free event here.</a></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: Can you give me a bit of a brief history on how CMU has developed startups over the years?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dave Mawhinney</strong>: First of all, I’m a CMU alum – and I’m not your typical academic. I had a 30-year entrepreneurial and venture capital career before I came back to Carnegie Mellon a decade ago to make it on-par with Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, Harvard and other great entrepreneurial universities[…] When I came back to CMU in 2011, 2012, there were several different activities across campus that were rather siloed.</p>
<p>There was an effort in the computer science department, there was an effort in the engineering department, there was an effort in the business school and they were all doing their own things and not necessarily getting the economies of scale of working together. When the university asked me to come back and run the Don Jones Center at the business school, I said I would only do so if you give me the agency to try to pull together all of our entrepreneurial activities under one rough.</p>
<p><strong>You can create a really breakthrough technology, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve got the ability to market it yourself to create an effective business plan. How much is that built into the curriculum at CMU? And how much cross pollination is there between the various departments?</strong></p>
<p>We have a sign at our front door that says, “the ideal startup team is hacker, hustler, designer.” The hackers are the technical people, the hustlers are the people that are willing to do business, to talk to partners. And I think designers are absolutely key because they are the glue that holds everything together. They make the products and services useable. It’s truly in our DNA and as we do our education in the four-credit classes, or as we do our workshops that are outside the classroom, that concept of design thinking, really getting to know your customer and solving real world problems that they’re willing to pay for now, is critical to getting the company off to the right start.</p>
<p>We also very much believe in the model of mentorship, so all of our startups get assigned mentors that are from the generalized background of the business that they’re going into. And then we have a roster of several hundred experts, from legal experts, accounting experts, marketing experts, manufacturing experts &#8212; any type of expertise that you can imagine that our teams can reach out to and tap into, to get questions answered and to get set on the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of vetting happens on the university side? Does a startup have to pass a certain threshold to gain access to all of these opportunities?</strong></p>
<p>Everybody’s welcome. Our doors are open to everybody, but there are some steps. When you come and sign up to work at the Swartz Center, you get to go to a first come, first serve table. There’s typically 20 of these tables available at any given time. The teams that show dedication, they participate in our programs, they’re showing up on a daily and weekly basis and they’re making progress, they’ll get a dedicated table, where they get to put their branding on the table and keep their equipment there. And the, ultimately, the teams that are making the most progress have customers and perhaps have raised a pre-seed or seed round, they get their own office. We have ten of those called “Startup Garages.” We do have that bit of meritocracy built in, as you go forward, but it is open to everybody. The truth is the founding teams, the entrepreneurs, they have to make it happen. We’re not going to spoon feed you.</p>
<p><strong>Like a lot of other schools located outside of major metropolitan areas, I assume there’s a lot of bleed when it comes to leaving for different markets.</strong></p>
<p>That has been true historically, but it’s changed. Really, the seminal event was when Google put an office in Pittsburgh in 2006. They have over 1,000 employees. Every major tech company &#8212; Amazon, Facebook, Apple &#8212; have all embedded hundreds of engineers in our community, so we’re growing really, really rapidly. Artificial intelligence was invented at Carnegie Mellon – and that sort of set off the robot revolution […] Now we’re the center of the automated vehicle community. Aurora is co-located here, Argo is here, Aptiv is here. We have a very vibrant community and we do want to continue to grow it.</p>
<p>But one of the challenges is getting that capital to come into the community. If you look at how much Uber ATG brought in, how much Argo AI and Aurora – collectively, those three companies, which have all licensed CMU technologies, they’ve all got over $7 billion in collective capital. Not all of it will be spent here, but a lot of it will be spent here. But that doesn’t necessarily trickle down to the next AI startup raising their first $3 million. So we do need to keep that connectivity to the money centers in the Bay Area and New York to ensure that our startups will get funded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer spending in mobile apps hit a record $64.9 billion during the first half of 2021, according to <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-and-downloads-1h-2021">preliminary data</a> from app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower. This figure represents a 24.8% increase in spending seen across both the App Store and Google Play, compared with the year-ago period. But while industry experts believe the accelerated shift to mobile fueled by the pandemic is a trend that will continue, it&#8217;s worth noting that &#8212; despite the new record &#8212; the growth rate for consumer spending has slightly slowed, and the download growth slowed more dramatically.</p>
<p>From the first half of 2019 to the first half of 2020, consumer spending on mobile apps grew 28.4% from $40.5 billion to $52 billion, for comparison &#8212; slower than the 24.8% seen in the current period.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170935" style="width: 1760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170935" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170935 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png" alt="" width="1750" height="1096" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png 1750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=1536,962 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1750px) 100vw, 1750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170935" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple&#8217;s App Store accounted for $41.5 billion in global consumer spending during the first half of 2021, or 1.8x the $23.4 billion seen by Google Play.</p>
<p>However, Google Play continues to outpace on growth, having jumped 30% from the $18 billion in the first half of 2020 compared with the 22.1% growth from the $34 billion the App Store had seen. This is due, in part, to demand from markets like the Philippines, where the COVID-19 pandemic has forced business closures and quarantines, Sensor Tower noted.</p>
<p>Consumer spend outside of games was driven by sports, finance, business, book and entertainment apps. Subscription-based apps in the top 100 apps (excluding games) were a large part of this spend, too, contributing $8.3 billion during the period. TikTok remained a top grossing app during the first half of 2021, followed by YouTube and regular top-earner Tinder.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170936" style="width: 1460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170936" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170936 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png" alt="" width="1450" height="864" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?resize=768,458 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?resize=680,405 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1450px) 100vw, 1450px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170936" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, mobile game spending continues to contribute to the largest part of the overall consumer spend, reaching $44.7 billion during the first half of the year. The App Store accounted for $26 billion of that figure, but growth slowed from 26.5% in the year-ago period to 13.5% from the first half of 2020 to the first half of 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170954" style="width: 1760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170954" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170954 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-game-revenue-worldwide.png" alt="" width="1750" height="1096" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-game-revenue-worldwide.png 1750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-game-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-game-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-game-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-game-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-game-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=1536,962 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-game-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1750px) 100vw, 1750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170954" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>Top-grossing games in the first half of 2021 were, in order, Tencent&#8217;s Honor of Kings ($15 billion+), PUBG Mobile (including its localized version for China, reached nearly $1.5 billion), Genshin Impact ($848 million+), Roblox and Coin Master.</p>
<p>Mobile app download growth also significantly slowed in the first half of this year, the firm found.</p>
<p>Last year, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a surge of new mobile app installs around the world, as consumers looked to apps for work, school, shopping, heath, grocery and more. During the first half of 2020, app installs had jumped 25.7% year over year to reach 71.3 billion downloads. But in the first half of 2021, downloads only grew 1.7% to reach 72.5 billion installs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170940" style="width: 1760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170940" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170940 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png" alt="" width="1750" height="1096" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png 1750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=1536,962 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1750px) 100vw, 1750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170940" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>The App Store even saw a year-over-year decline in nongame installs in the first half of 2021, dropping 10.9% to 16.3 billion from 18.3 billion in the first half of 2020. Sensor Tower believes this is reflective of the increased competition for consumer attention in markets with a high number of iOS users, like the U.S., where businesses have been reopening and in-person activities are resuming.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Google Play (nongame) installs climbed 6% in the first half of this year to 56.2 billion from the 53 billion in the first half of 2020. This could be tied to the demand for apps in markets where Android is dominant, like India, which has continued to be impacted by the pandemic. As a result, app adoption on Google Play was 3.5 times higher than on the App Store during the first half of 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170941" style="width: 1460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170941" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170941 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-download-chart.png" alt="" width="1450" height="864" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-download-chart.png 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-download-chart.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-download-chart.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-download-chart.png?resize=768,458 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-download-chart.png?resize=680,405 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-download-chart.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1450px) 100vw, 1450px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170941" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>The (nongame) app with the most downloads was TikTok, which gained 384.6 million new installs during the first half of this year. But this is down by around 38% from the 619 million installs it saw during the year-ago period &#8212; a change that can be attributed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">its ban from the Indian market</a> last year. The rest of the top 5 most downloaded app chart was dominated by Facebook, which scored the No. 2, No. 3 and No 4 positions, with Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, respectively. Telegram was No. 5 followed by Messenger, Zoom, Snapchat, CapCut and Google Meet.</p>
<p>Mobile game downloads, meanwhile, fell 22.8% to 4.4 billion on the App Store but grew 3.9% on Google Play to 23.7 billion in the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>The app data presented is a preliminary analysis that may become more precise over time. It&#8217;s also worth comparing it to related reports from other firms for a fuller picture.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["What we need is more capital — angel funds, venture funds so that entrepreneurs have a variety of funding sources to go to locally."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ahead of our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-city-spotlight/">TechCrunch City Spotlight: Pittsburgh</a> event tomorrow, I spoke <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/pittsburghs-mayor-on-the-citys-startup-community-and-the-difficulty-of-attracting-venture-capital/">to current Mayor Bill Peduto</a> and Dave Mawhinney, the executive director of Carnegie Mellon University’s Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship. Like many in the Steel City startup community, both share a focus on the historically difficult task of keeping startups in town.</p>
<p>For more on investing in Pittsburgh, be sure to tune in to our City Spotlight on Tuesday, June 29, where we will be joined by Peduto, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">Duolingo</a> director of engineering Karin Tsai and Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">Register for the free event here.</a></p>
<p>I asked Peduto and Mawhinney what the single biggest obstacle has been in building out Pittsburgh’s startup ecosystem. Both responded the same way: venture capital. Raising funding is, of course, a hurdle regardless of location, but many VCs have been reluctant to invest in startups outside of traditional hubs like San Francisco and New York.</p>

<p>“But one of the challenges is getting that capital to come into the community,” said Mawhinney, who leads CMU’s startup efforts. “If you look at how much Uber ATG brought in, how much Argo AI and Aurora &#8212; collectively, those three companies, which have all licensed CMU technologies, they’ve all got over $7 billion in collective capital. Not all of it will be spent here, but a lot of it will be spent here. But that doesn’t necessarily trickle down to the next AI startup raising their first $3 million.”</p>

<p>Peduto said growing the VC pipeline has been a focus during his time as mayor.</p>
<p>“I think we’ve been able to convince investors from the coast that the companies don’t need to leave Pittsburgh in order to be highly successful and see their investment pay off,” he told TechCrunch. “However, I believe if we had more venture capital arriving here to help take early-stage companies into that critical next stage of expansion, it would build off itself and it would excel growth in all of the industry cluster, significantly.”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.sideinc.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a real estate technology company that works to turn agents and independent brokerages into boutique brands and businesses, has raised “$50 million-plus” in a funding round that more than doubles its valuation to $2.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest financing comes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/side-raises-150m-at-1b-valuation-to-help-real-estate-agents-go-it-alone/">just three months after the San Francisco-based startup raised $150 million in a Series D funding round</a> led by Coatue Management at a $1 billion valuation. Tiger Global Management led the latest investment, which also included participation from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ICONIQ Capital and D1 Capital Partners. With the latest capital infusion, Side’s total raised since its 2017 inception now totals over $250 million. Matrix Partners, Sapphire Ventures, Trinity Ventures and 8VC led its earlier rounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side says that it is now “backed by the three top technology initial public offering (IPO) underwriters” and that the latest funding “sets the stage for a future IPO.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup pulled in between &#8220;$30 million and $50 million in revenue&#8221; in 2020 (a wide range, we know), and expects to double revenue this year. In 2019, Side represented over $5 billion in annual home sales across all of its partners. Today, the company’s community of agent partners represents over $15 billion in annual production volum</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">e.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s predicting that by the end of 2021, it will have closed over $20 billion in home sales, positioning the company “as a top 10 national brokerage by volume.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Side supports more than 1,800 partner agents across California, Texas and Florida. It says it’s seen a 200% year-over-year increase in agent-represented home sales across its three operating markets of California, Texas and Florida. The company plans to enter 15 new states by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guy Gal, Edward Wu and Hilary Saunders founded Side on the premise that most real estate agents are “underserved and under-appreciated” by traditional brokerage models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Gal said existing brokerages are designed to support “average” agents and, as such, the top-producing agents end up having to do “all of the heavy lifting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side’s white label model works with agents and teams by exclusively marketing their boutique brand, while also providing the required technology and support needed on the back end. The goal is to help partner agents “predictably grow” their businesses and improve their productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way to think about Side is the way you think about what Shopify does for e-commerce […] When partnering with Side, top-producing agents, teams and independent brokerages, for the first time in history, gain full ownership of their own brand and business without having to operate a brokerage,” Gal told me at the time of the company’s last raise. “When you spend years solving the problems of this very specific community of agents, you are able to use software to drive enormous efficiency for them in a way that has never been done before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing brokerages, he argues, actively discourage agents from becoming top producers and teams, because agents who serve fewer clients can be forced into paying much higher commission fees on every transaction, which means the incentives between brokerages and top agents and teams are misaligned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Top producers want to grow and differentiate, and brokerages want them to do less business at higher fees and be one more of the same under the same brand,” Gal said. “Side, rather than discouraging and competing with top-producing agents and teams, enables them to grow and scale their own business and brand.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With less than a month to go before the Olympics kick off in Tokyo, cord-cutting services like YouTube TV are attempting to woo new subscribers who are looking for a way to watch summer sports. But whether or not you&#8217;re eager to watch Simone Biles defy gravity, YouTube TV&#8217;s latest upgrades enhance the product with audio and video improvements.</p>
<p>Today, YouTube TV announced a 4K Plus add-on package with offline downloads, 5.1 Dolby audio, and features that make it easier to watch live sports. The company previously <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/neal-innovation-series/">teased these features</a> in February.</p>
<p>YouTube TV is already one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/youtube-tv-hikes-price-to-64-99-per-month-following-new-channel-additions/">the pricier streaming services</a> out there &#8212; at $64.99 per month, you might not save much money by choosing YouTube in lieu of your cable service. Hulu + Live TV is priced the same, but offers a Disney+ and ESPN+ add-on for a total of $72.99 per month. But if you want to kick your video quality (and your monthly bill) up a notch, you can now enable 4K streaming for an extra $19.99 per month, bringing your grand total to $84.98 monthly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The 4K Plus add-on package will also allow subscribers to download shows from DVR to watch offline &#8212; currently, that&#8217;s not possible on the standard $64.99 per month package. Subscribers will be able to try out the package for free for a month, then pay $9.99 per month for a year before the price increases to $19.99. This is pretty consistent with YouTube TV&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/youtube-tv-gets-some-new-channels-and-a-hefty-price-hike/">continual price hikes</a> over the years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 5.1 Dolby audio capabilities will be a free addition for all YouTube TV members &#8212; in a blog post, the company says this has been one of users&#8217; &#8220;biggest requests.&#8221; Over the coming weeks, these surround-sound audio capabilities will begin rolling out to select devices.</p>
<p>The sports upgrades also come at no additional cost &#8212; one new feature will let viewers jump to key plays and specific highlight moments when watching a DVR recording or trying to catch up live. So, if you&#8217;re tuning in an hour late, you can view key moments from the game, then jump right in live. YouTube TV will also let users search for specific sports to add to their DVR, which has no storage space limit. So, again, if you&#8217;re determined not to miss a single Simone Biles floor routine, it will be easier to make sure you&#8217;re in the loop. There will also be a Medal count view during the Olympics within the app.</p>
<p>As the Olympics draw nearer, we can expect other cord-cutting services to up the ante on their live sports offerings &#8212; the $9.99 monthly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/paramount-will-launch-a-4-99-monthly-ad-supported-subscription/">Paramount+ Premium plan</a> includes a wide range of international soccer matches, but no word on the Olympics yet. Still, the service is far less expensive than YouTube TV and already offers 4K, HDR, and Dolby Vision. YouTube TV had<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/youtube-roku-face-off-youtube-tv-added-to-main-app-free-streaming-devices/"> 3 million subscribers</a> as of October 2020, but did not offer an update for Q1 of 2021. As of March, Hulu had <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/hulu-statistics/">4.1 million subscribers</a> to its Live TV service, which will also air the Olympics.</p>
