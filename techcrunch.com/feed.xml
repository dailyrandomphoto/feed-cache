										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a busy summer for Clubhouse. The hit social audio app rolled out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/clubhouse-dms-backchannel/">new messaging features</a> and an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/clubhouse-android-worldwide-launch/">Android app</a> over the last few months and now the company is turning its attention to enhancing its core audio experience. Clubhouse announced Sunday that its rooms will now be infused with spatial audio to give the app’s listeners a richer sense of hanging out live with a group of other people.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Clubhouse’s Justin Uberti about the decision to add spatial audio, which has the effect of making different speakers sound like they’re coming from different physical locations instead of just one spot.</p>
<p>Uberti joined Clubhouse in May as its head of streaming technology after more than a decade at Google where he created Google Duo, led the Hangouts team and most recently worked on Google’s cloud gaming platform Stadia. Uberti also created the WebRTC standard that Clubhouse was built on top of.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things you realize in these group audio settings is that you don’t get quite the same experience as being in a physical space,&#8221; Uberti said.</p>
<p>While Clubhouse and other voice chat apps bring people together in virtual social settings, the audio generally sounds relatively flat, like it’s emanating from a single central location. But at the in-person gatherings Clubhouse is meant to simulate, you’d be hearing audio from all around the room, from the left and right of a stage to the various locations in the audience where speakers might ask their questions.</p>
<p>To pull off the new audio tricks, Clubhouse is integrating an <a href="https://www.highfidelity.com/blog/what-is-spatial-audio">API from Second Life creator Philip Rosedale’s spatial audio company High Fidelity</a> and blending it with the company’s own custom audio processing, tuned for the chat app.</p>
<p>High Fidelity’s HRTF technology, which stands for “Head Related Transfer Function,” maps speech to different virtual locations by subtly adding a time delay between stereo channels and replicating the way that high and low frequencies would sound entering the ear depending on a sound’s origin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The result, long used in social VR, gives virtual social experiences a sense of physical presence that good records have been pulling off for ages. Think listening to Pink Floyd’s <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> in stereo with good headphones but instead of sound effects and instruments playing around your head, you’re hearing the people you’re hanging out with arrayed in virtual space.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="x2nPR6jvRC"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/skittish-andy-baio-virtual-events/">Skittish is what you&#8217;d get if you crossed Animal Crossing with Clubhouse</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Skittish is what you&#8217;d get if you crossed Animal Crossing with Clubhouse&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/skittish-andy-baio-virtual-events/embed/#?secret=x2nPR6jvRC" data-secret="x2nPR6jvRC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Uberti, Clubhouse’s implementation will be subtle, but noticeable. While the audio processing will “gently steer conversation” to put most speakers in front of the listener, Clubhouse users should have a new sense that people are speaking from different physical locations.</p>
<p>The new audio features will roll out Sunday to the majority of iOS users, reaching the rest of Clubhouse&#8217;s iOS and Android users within the next few weeks. The experience will be available to everyone in time, but users will also have the ability to toggle spatial audio off.</p>
<p>Clubhouse will use the same virtual soundstage techniques to give large rooms a sense of sounding large while making more intimate rooms sound like they’re actually happening in a smaller physical space. And because most people use headphones to participate on Clubhouse, most of the app’s users can benefit from the effects possible through two-channel stereo sound.</p>
<p>“You have this notion of people [being] in a space, in a room&#8230; We try to mimic the feel of how it would be in a circle with people standing around talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uberti also notes that spatial audio could give regular Clubhouse users a less obvious benefit. It’s possible that regular, non-spatialized audio in social apps contributes to the pandemic-era phenomenon of Zoom fatigue. As the human brain processes virtual audio like a phone call or group audio room, it differentiates between speakers in a different way than it would in a natural in-person setting.</p>
<p>“Your mind has to figure out who’s talking. Without spatial cues you have to use timbre&#8230; that requires more cognitive effort,” Uberti said. &#8220;This could actually make for a more enjoyable experience aside from more immersion.”</p>
<p>It’s too early to know how Clubhouse’s many subcommunities will take to the spatial audio effects, but it could enhance experiences like comedy, music and even ASMR on the app quite a bit.</p>
<p>“Someone tells a joke and it often feels really flat,” Uberti said. “But on Clubhouse, when you feel the laughter come from all around you, it feels a lot like a comedy club experience.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/">TechCrunch’s China roundup</a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The biggest news of the week again comes from Beijing&#8217;s ongoing effort to dampen the influence of the country&#8217;s tech giants. Regulators are now going after the exploitative use of algorithm-powered user recommendations. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We also saw a few major acquisitions this week. Xiaomi is acquiring an autonomous vehicle startup called Deepmotion, and ByteDance is said to be buying virtual reality hardware startup Pico.</span></p>
<h2>Algorithmic regulation</h2>
<p>Beijing has unveiled the draft of <a href="https://digichina.stanford.edu/news/translation-internet-information-service-algorithmic-recommendation-management-provisions">a sweeping regulation</a> to rein in how tech companies operating in China utilize algorithms, the engine of virtually all lucrative tech businesses today from short videos and news aggregation to ride-hailing, food delivery and e-commerce. My colleague Manish Singh wrote an overview of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/china-proposes-strict-control-of-algorithms/">policy</a>, and here&#8217;s a closer look at the 30-point document proposed by China&#8217;s top cyberspace watchdog.</p>
<p>Beijing is clearly wary of how purely machine-recommended content can stray away from values propagated by the Communist Party and even lead to the detriment of national interests. In its mind, algorithms should strictly align with the interest of the nation:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Algorithmic recommendations should uphold mainstream values&#8230; and should not be used for endangering national security (Point 6).</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Regulators want more transparency on companies&#8217; algorithmic black boxes and are making them accountable for the consequences of their programming codes. For example:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Service providers should be responsible for the security of algorithms, create a system for&#8230; the review of published information, algorithmic mechanisms, security oversight&#8230; enact and publish relevant rules for algorithmic recommendations (Point 7). </em></p>
<p><em>Service providers&#8230; should not create algorithmic models that entice users into addiction, high-value consumption, or other behavior that disrupts public orders (Point 8).</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The government is also clamping down on discriminative algorithms and putting some autonomy back in the hands of consumers:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Service providers&#8230; should not use illegal or harmful information as user interests to recommend content or create sexist or biased user tags (Point 10).</em></p>
<p><em>Service providers should inform users of the logic, purpose, and mechanisms of the algorithms in use (Point 14). </em></p>
<p><em>Service providers&#8230; should allow users to turn off algorithmic features (Point 15).</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The regulators don&#8217;t want internet giants to influence public thinking or opinions. Though not laid out in the document, censorship control will no doubt remain in the hands of the authorities.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Service providers should not&#8230; use algorithms to censor information, make excessive recommendations, manipulate rankings or search results that lead to preferential treatment and unfair competition, influence online opinions, or shun regulatory oversight (Point 13). </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Like many other aspects of the tech business, certain algorithms are to obtain approval from the government. Tech firms must also hand over their algorithms to the police in case of investigations.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Service providers should <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">file with the government if their recommendation algorithms can affect public opinions or mobilize civilians (Point 20).  </span></em></p>
<p><em>Service providers&#8230; should keep a record of their recommendation algorithms for at least six months and provide them to law enforcement departments for investigation purposes (Point 23). </em></p></blockquote>
<p>If passed, the law will shake up the fundamental business logic of Chinese tech companies that rely on algorithms to make money. Programmers need to pore over these rules and be able to parse their codes for regulators. The proposed law seems to have even gone beyond the scope of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/">European Union&#8217;s data rules</a>, but how the Chinese one will be enforced remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>Lei Jun bets on autonomous cars</h2>
<p>In Xiaomi&#8217;s latest earnings call, the smartphone maker said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/xiaomi-reports-record-64-revenue-growth-acquires-deepmotion-for-77-3-million/">will acquire DeepMotion</a>, a Beijing-based autonomous driving startup, to aid its autonomous driving endeavor. The deal will cost Xiaomi about<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/xiaomi-reports-record-64-revenue-growth-acquires-deepmotion-for-77-3-million/"> $77.3 million</a>, and &#8220;a lot of that will be in terms of stock&#8221; and &#8220;a lot of these payments will be deferred until certain milestones are hit,&#8221; <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4451824-xiaomi-corporation-xiacf-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript">said</a> Wang Xiang, Xiaomi president on the call.</p>
<p>Xiaomi&#8217;s founder Lei Jun earlier hinted at the firm&#8217;s plan to enter the crowded space. On July 28, Lei <a href="https://weibo.com/1749127163/KqOGhlxWM?from=page_1003061749127163_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment#_rnd1629974084772">announced</a> on Weibo, China&#8217;s Twitter equivalent, that the company is recruiting 500 autonomous driving experts across China.</p>
<p>Automation has become a selling point for China&#8217;s new generation of electric vehicle makers, often with companies conflating advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) with Level 4 autonomous driving. Such overstatements in marketing material mislead consumers and make one question the real technical capability of these nascent EV players.</p>
<p>Xiaomi has similarly unveiled plans to manufacture electric cars through<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/xiaomi-ev-subsidiary/"> a separate car-making subsidiary</a>. The ADAS capabilities brought by DeepMotion are naturally a nice complement to Xiaomi&#8217;s future cars. As Wang explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe that there&#8217;s a lot of synergies with [DeepMotion&#8217;s ADAS] technology with our EV initiatives. So I think it tells you a couple of points. Number one is, we will roll out EV business. And I said in our prepared remarks, we&#8217;ve been very focused on hiring the right team for the EV business at this point in time, formulating our strategy, formulating our product strategy, et cetera, et cetera. But at the same time, we are not afraid to apply it and integrate other teams if we find that those will help us accelerate our plan right.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s noteworthy that DeepMotion, founded by Microsoft veterans, specializes in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuiyuan-yang-a5a29224/">perception technologies and high-precision mapping</a>, which puts it in the vision-driven autonomous driving camp. A number of major Chinese EV makers<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/xpeng-lidar-adas/"> rely on consumer-grade lidar</a> to automate their cars.</p>
<h2>ByteDance goes virtual</h2>
<p>ByteDance is said to be buying Beijing-based VR hardware maker Pico for 5 billion yuan ($770 million), according to Chinese VR news site <a href="https://www.vrtuoluo.cn/526238.html">Vrtuoluo</a>. ByteDance could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>Advanced VR headsets <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/china-watches-and-learns-from-the-us-in-ar-vr-competition/">are often expensive</a> due to the cost of high-end processors. Experts observe that most VR hardware makers are yet to enter the mass consumer market. They are hemorrhaging cash and living off generous venture money and corporate deals.</p>
<p>ByteDance might be buying a money-losing business, but Pico, one of the major VR makers in China, provides a fast track for the TikTok parent to enter VR manufacturing. As the world&#8217;s largest short video distributor and an aggressive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/bytedance-gaming/">newcomer to video games</a>, ByteDance has no shortage of creative talent. We will see how it works on producing virtual content if the Pico deal goes through.</p>

I am inspired by Cloudflare’s recent <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/aws-egregious-egress/">post</a> explaining the impact of Amazon’s monopoly in its industry. </em></p>
<p><em>Perhaps it was a competitive tactic, but I genuinely believe it more a patriotic duty: guideposts for legislators and regulators on a complex issue.

<p><em>I, personally, and my company both stand to gain little from this — but as a participant in the latest generation of social media upstarts, and as an American concerned for the future of our democracy, I feel a duty to try.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Mark Zuckerberg has reached his Key Largo moment.</p>
<p>In May 1972, executives of the era’s preeminent technology company — AT&amp;T — met at a secret retreat in Key Largo, Florida. Their company was in crisis.</p>
<p>At the time, Ma Bell’s breathtaking monopoly consisted of a holy trinity: Western Electric (the vast majority of phones and cables used for American telephony), the lucrative long distance service (for both personal and business use) and local telephone service, which the company subsidized in exchange for its monopoly.</p>
<p>Over the next decade, all three government branches — legislators, regulators and the courts — parried with AT&amp;T’s lawyers as the press piled on, battering the company’s reputation in the process. By 1982, a consent decree forced AT&amp;T’s dismantling. The biggest company on earth withered to 30% of its book value and seven independent “Baby Bell” regional operating companies. AT&amp;T’s brand would live on, but the business as the world knew it was dead.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg is, undoubtedly, the greatest technologist of our time. For over 17 years, he has outgunned, outsmarted and outperformed like no software entrepreneur before him. Earlier this month, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/08/ftc-alleges-facebook-resorted-illegal-buy-or-bury-scheme-crush">refiled</a> its sweeping antitrust case against Facebook.</p>
<p>Its own holy trinity of Facebook Blue, Instagram and WhatsApp is under attack. All three government branches — legislators, regulators and the courts — are gaining steam in their fight, and the press is piling on, battering the company’s reputation in the process. Facebook, the AT&amp;T of our time, is at the brink. For so long, Zuckerberg has told us all to move fast and break things. It’s time for him to break Facebook.</p>
<p>If Facebook does exist to “make the world more open and connected, and not just to build a company,” as Zuckerberg wrote in the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000119312512034517/d287954ds1.htm">2012 IPO prospectus</a>, he will spin off Instagram and WhatsApp now so that they have a fighting chance. It would be the ultimate Zuckerbergian chess move. Zuckerberg would lose voting control and thus power over all three entities, but in his action he would successfully scatter the opposition. The rationale is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>The United States government will break up Facebook. It is not a matter of if; it is a matter of when.</li>
<li>Facebook is already losing. Facebook Blue, Instagram and WhatsApp all face existential threats. Pressure from the government will stifle Facebook’s efforts to right the ship.</li>
<li>Facebook will generate more value for shareholders as three separate companies.</li>
</ol>
<p>I write this as an admirer; I genuinely believe much of the criticism Zuckerberg has received is unfair. Facebook faces Sisyphean tasks. The FTC will not let Zuckerberg sneeze without an investigation, and the company has failed to innovate.</p>
<p>Given no chance to acquire new technology and talent, how can Facebook survive over the long term? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html">In 2006</a>, Terry Semel of Yahoo offered $1 billion to buy Facebook. Zuckerberg reportedly remarked, “I just don’t know if I want to work for Terry Semel.” Even if the FTC were to allow it, this generation of founders will not sell to Facebook. Unfair or not, Mark Zuckerberg has become Terry Semel.</p>
<h2>The government will break up Facebook</h2>
<p>It is not a matter of if; it is a matter of when.</p>
<p>In a speech on the floor of Congress in 1890, Senator John Sherman, the founding father of the modern American antitrust movement, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html">famously said</a>, “If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation and sale of any of the necessities of life. If we would not submit to an emperor, we should not submit to an autocrat of trade with power to prevent competition and to fix the price of any commodity.”</p>
<p>This is the sentiment driving the building resistance to Facebook’s monopoly, and it shows no sign of abating. Zuckerberg has proudly called Facebook the fifth estate. In the U.S., we only have four estates.</p>
<p>All three branches of the federal government are heating up their pursuit. In the Senate, an unusual bipartisan coalition is emerging, with Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mark Warner (D-VA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) each waging a war from multiple fronts.</p>
<p>In the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has called Facebook “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-pelosi-facebook/pelosi-slams-facebook-as-part-of-the-problem-on-election-misinformation-idUSKBN27T2DR">part of the problem</a>.” Lina Khan’s FTC is likewise only getting started, with unequivocal support from the White House that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/technology/facebook-vaccine-misinformation.html">feels burned</a> by Facebook’s disingenuous lobbying. The Department of Justice will join, too, aided by state attorneys general. And the courts will continue to turn the wheels of justice, slowly but surely.</p>
<p>In the wake of Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html">scathing 2019 New York Times op-ed</a>, Zuckerberg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/11/zuckerberg-responds-to-hughes/">said</a> that Facebook’s immense size allows it to spend more on trust and safety than Twitter makes in revenue.</p>
<p>“If what you care about is democracy and elections, then you want a company like us to be able to invest billions of dollars per year like we are in building up really advanced tools to fight election interference,” Zuckerberg said.</p>
<p>This could be true, but it does not prove that the concentration of such power in one man’s hands is consistent with U.S. public policy. And the centralized operations could be rebuilt easily in standalone entities.</p>
<p>Time and time again, whether on Holocaust denial, election propaganda or vaccine misinformation, Zuckerberg has struggled to make quick judgments when presented with the information his trust and safety team uncovers. And even before a decision is made, the structure of the team disincentivizes it from even measuring anything that could harm Facebook’s brand. This is inherently inconsistent with U.S. democracy. The New York Times’ army of reporters will not stop uncovering scandal after scandal, contradicting Zuckerberg’s narrative. The writing is on the wall.</p>
<h2>Facebook is losing</h2>
<p>Facebook Blue, Instagram and WhatsApp all face existential threats. Pressure from the government will stifle Facebook’s efforts to right the ship.</p>
<p>For so long, Facebook has dominated the social media industry. But if you ask Chinese technology executives about Facebook today, they <a href="https://twitter.com/ruima/status/1396567863280889857?s=20">quote</a> Tencent founder Pony Ma: “When a giant falls, his corpse will still be warm for a while.”</p>
<p>Facebook’s recent demise begins with its brand. The endless, cascading scandals of the last decade have irreparably harmed its image. Younger users refuse to adopt the flagship Facebook Blue. The company’s internal polling on two key metrics — good for the world (GFW) and cares about users (CAU) — shows Facebook’s reputation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/08/business/mark-zuckerberg-sheryl-sandberg-facebook.html">is in tatters</a>. Talent is fleeing, too; Instacart alone <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instacart-ceo-hire-is-part-of-monthslong-raid-of-facebook-staff">recently poached</a> 55 Facebook executives.</p>
<p>In 2012 and 2014, Instagram and WhatsApp were real dangers. Facebook extinguished both through acquisition. Yet today they represent the company’s two most promising, underutilized assets. They are the underinvested telephone networks of our time.</p>
<p>Weeks ago, Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced that the company no longer considers itself a photo-sharing app. Instead, its focus is entertainment. In other words, as the media widely reported, Instagram is <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1410297743285829632?s=20">changing</a> to compete with TikTok.</p>
<p>TikTok’s strength represents an existential threat. U.S. children 4 to 15 already spend over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/kids-now-spend-nearly-as-much-time-watching-tiktok-as-youtube-in-u-s-u-k-and-spain/">80 minutes a day</a> on ByteDance’s TikTok, and it’s just getting started. The demographics are quickly expanding way beyond teenagers, as social products always have. For Instagram, it could be too little too late — as a part of Facebook, Instagram cannot acquire the technology and retain the talent it needs to compete with TikTok.</p>
<p>Imagine Instagram acquisitions of Squarespace to bolster its e-commerce offerings, or Etsy to create a meaningful marketplace. As a part of Facebook, Instagram is strategically adrift.</p>
<p>Likewise, a standalone WhatsApp could easily be a $100 billion market cap company. WhatsApp has a proud legacy of robust security offerings, but its brand has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification">tarnished</a> by associations with Facebook. Discord’s rise represents a substantial threat, and WhatsApp has failed to innovate to account for this generation’s desire for community-driven messaging. Snapchat, too, is in many ways a potential WhatsApp killer; its young users use photography and video as a messaging medium. Facebook’s top augmented reality talents <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/snap-hires-ar-leader-from-facebook-niantic-s-scanning-acquisition?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=article_email&amp;utm_content=article-6167&amp;utm_source=sg">are leaving for Snapchat</a>.</p>
<p>With 2 billion monthly active users, WhatApp could be a privacy-focused alternative to Facebook Blue, and it would logically introduce expanded profiles, photo-sharing capabilities and other features that would strengthen its offerings. Inside Facebook, WhatsApp has suffered from underinvestment as a potential threat to Facebook Blue and Messenger. Shareholders have suffered for it.</p>
<p>Beyond Instagram and WhatsApp, Facebook Blue itself is struggling. Q2’s earnings may have skyrocketed, but the increase in revenue hid a troubling sign: Ads increased by 47%, but inventory increased by just 6%. This means Facebook is struggling to find new places to run its ads. Why? The core social graph of Facebook is too old.</p>
<p>I fondly remember the day Facebook came to my high school; I have thousands of friends on the platform. I do not use Facebook anymore &#8212; not for political reasons, but because my friends have left. A decade ago, hundreds of people wished me happy birthday every year. This year it was 24, half of whom are over the age of 50. And I’m 32 years old. Teen girls run the social world, and many of them don’t even have Facebook on their phones.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg’s newfound push into the metaverse has been well covered, but the question remains: Why wouldn’t a Facebook serious about the metaverse acquire Roblox? Of course, the FTC would currently never allow it.</p>
<p>Facebook’s current clunky attempt at a hardware solution, with an emphasis on the workplace, shows little sign of promise. The launch was hardly propitious, as CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/19/tech/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr/index.html">reported</a>, “While Bosworth, the Facebook executive, was in the middle of describing how he sees Workrooms as a more interactive way to gather virtually with coworkers than video chat, his avatar froze midsentence, the pixels of its digital skin turning from flesh-toned to gray. He had been disconnected.”</p>
<p>This is not the indomitable Facebook of yore. This is graying Facebook, freezing midsentence.</p>
<h2>Facebook will generate more value for shareholders as three separate companies</h2>
<p>Zuckerberg’s control of 58% of Facebook’s voting shares has forestalled a typical Wall Street reckoning: Investors <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-26/facebook-board-rejects-proposals-to-reduce-zuckerberg-s-power#:~:text=Zuckerberg%2C%20who%20has%20served%20as,controlling%20stake%20in%20the%20company.">are tiring</a> of Zuckerberg’s unilateral power. Many justifiably believe the company is more valuable as the sum of its parts. The success of AT&amp;T’s breakup is a case in point.</p>
<p>Five years after AT&amp;T’s 1984 breakup, AT&amp;T and the Baby Bells’ value had <a href="https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1989/01/02/71446/index.htm">doubled</a> compared to AT&amp;T’s pre-breakup market capitalization. Pressure from Japanese entrants battered Western Electric’s market share, but greater competition in telephony spurred investment and innovation among the Baby Bells.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T turned its focus to competing with IBM and preparing for the coming information age. A smaller AT&amp;T became more nimble, ready to focus on the future rather than dwell on the past.</p>
<p>Standalone Facebook Blue, Instagram and WhatsApp could drastically change their futures by attracting talent and acquiring new technologies.</p>
<p>The U.K.’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-takeover-of-giphy-raises-competition-concerns-u-k-says-11628768015">recent opposition</a> to Facebook’s $400 million GIPHY <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/facebook-to-acquire-giphy-in-a-deal-reportedly-worth-400-million/">acquisition</a> proves Facebook will struggle mightily to acquire even small bolt-ons.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg has always been one step ahead. And when he wasn’t, he was famously unprecious: “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348082/zuckerberg-facebook-house-committee-emails-app-development-speed-copying-innovation">Copying is faster than innovating</a>.” If he really believes in Facebook’s mission and recognizes that the situation cannot possibly get any better from here, he will copy AT&amp;T’s solution before it is forced upon him.</p>
<p>Regulators are tying Zuckerberg’s hands behind his back as the company weathers body blows and uppercuts from Beijing to Silicon Valley. As Zuckerberg’s idol Augustus Caesar might have once said, carpe diem. It’s time to break Facebook.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The ownership of startups is often a mystery. In the absence of a public registry, it is difficult to figure out who owns what. Since most startups incorporate in Delaware, the Delaware Division of Corporations holds relevant information, but you may not be able to get all the information you need, and putting it together from the legal paperwork will be challenging.</p>
<p>To understand a startup&#8217;s capital structure, you must have access to its capitalization table, also known as cap table. The cap table shows shareholder information, current ownership stakes along with economic and voting rights, future equity purchase rights, vesting schedules and purchase prices. All of this information is compiled into a format that founders and investors can digest easily, allowing them to calculate payouts in various exit scenarios, analyze equity dilution from new hire equity grants, and understand the impact of additional funding rounds.</p>
<p>Initially, startups might collect this data using Excel spreadsheets, but as the ownership structure grows more complex, it becomes more difficult to follow and document, and the cost of errors become a big problem. This has led to the development of a cap table management software industry.</p>
<p>However, the way in which various cap table data items are organized and accounted for varies among the different service providers. Without a standard, it is impossible to automatically synchronize data between software platforms, making it difficult to switch vendors as well as to ensure that all parties are on the same page.</p>
<p>Now, a coalition of Silicon Valley law firms and startup vendors is forming to address this issue. <a href="https://medium.com/@opencaptable/announcing-the-open-cap-table-coalition-6c2764396e71">In a Medium post from July 27</a>, the Open Cap Table Coalition stated its intention to &#8220;improve the interoperability, transparency, and portability of startup cap table data.&#8221; Since standardization means fewer billable hours for lawyers and less lock-in for software platforms, it may go against the short-term interest of some participants. However, the coalition reflects Silicon Valley&#8217;s way of doing business &#8211; as AnnaLee Saxenian, the Dean of the UC Berkeley School of Information noted in her influential 1994 book &#8220;Regional Advantage&#8221;, the Valley is a place where intense competitors become partners and informal co-operation and exchange become institutionalized.</p>

<p>As such, the founding members certainly deserve praise. Eliminating inefficiencies allows the ecosystem to move faster and allows players to concentrate on creating value. However, if only founders and investors can see the data, the open cap table coalition will fall short of its potential. For the open cap table to be truly open, the information that determines equity value must be accessible to all equity holders, including startup employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/the-sec-should-do-more-to-make-startup-equity-compensation-transparent/">I have written on TechCrunch in the past</a> about the abuse potential of startup equity compensation, a highly opaque and practically unregulated market. Employees are often swayed by the allure of stock options without understanding what these securities are and how they are valued. Successful IPO stories portraying employees as instant millionaires create an impression that startup equity offers a fast track to financial prosperity. However, success is the exception, not the rule, when it comes to startups, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-12-13/work-for-uber-wind-up-in-debt">wrong investment decisions can result in an employee going into debt.</a> Further, it can be damaging to the startup and the ecosystem in the long term if employees&#8217; expectations are not in line with the startup&#8217;s financial reality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty much nothing destroys trust between shareholders and startups quicker than poor communication, especially around issues such as the status of the cap table,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/introducing-the-open-cap-table-coalition/">wrote Aaron Solomon, head of strategy for Esquire Digital</a>, in support of the open cap table initiative. The exact same is true for employee trust in the company and its leadership — miscommunication around equity issues can be detrimental. As Travis Kalanick discovered first hand, messing with employee equity can backfire.</p>
<p>“We are going to IPO as late as humanly possible,” <a href="https://fortune.com/2016/06/09/uber-ipo-travis-kalanick/">Kalanick said in June 2016</a>. “It’ll be one day before my employees and significant others come to my office with pitchforks and torches. We will IPO the day before that.” However, waiting for employees to lose their temper is a risky game; you may wake up a day too late instead of the day before. Nowadays, when it is harder to find good employees than to raise money, transparency with both capital and human capital providers is vital.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3492151">interviewed startup lawyers and founders in Silicon Valley</a> to understand why they don&#8217;t share more information with employees. There was a recurring fear of liability as well as disagreement over disclosure formats. Now, when the industry&#8217;s influential players decide on a cap table format, it is possible to also form an agreement on how these data should be shared with employees. If the coalition takes on this challenge, it could easily change the industry by establishing a voluntary standard that everyone can rally around.</p>
<p>Capital/labor relationships in startups are inherently imbalanced, since employees contribute human capital but are denied information and voting rights. It is possible to partially rectify this imbalance by providing employee equity-holders with bottom-line information on what they stand to gain under various exit scenarios. Making information accessible and easy to understand for employees can help startups attract talent and maintain positive culture.</p>
<p>Saxenian’s book on Silicon Valley&#8217;s regional advantage describes also how employee stock options contributed to the transformation of Silicon Valley in the 1970s. However, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3111045">as capital markets and regulations have changed, employee, entrepreneur, and investor relationships have been negatively impacted</a>, resulting in ongoing friction over liquidity and risk allocation. Today, by establishing real equity transparency, Silicon Valley can retain its competitive edge. Until the Open Capital Table Coalition engages in this challenge, it cannot claim to foster a genuinely open community.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Startups have a seemingly intractable problem: a lack of diversity. Despite research showing that diverse founding teams have a <a href="https://indicators.kauffman.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/2020-New-Employer-Business-Indicators-in-the-United-States_April2021.pdf">higher rate of return than white founding teams</a>, one characteristic of startups remains relatively unchanged: the dearth of BIPOC and women founders, investors, board members, and counsel in the venture capital (VC) ecosystem.</p>
<p>Why should we care? Venture capital has provided early funding for the most innovative and profitable companies of our time — Apple, Amazon, Google (now Alphabet), just to name a few. These companies have changed the way we live, work and play by impacting how we communicate, how we process information, and how we buy goods. With approximately one-quarter of U.S. professionals employed by the high-tech sector — comprising about 5% to 6% of the total workforce, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/special-report/diversity-high-tech">according to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> — imagine how much more innovation could happen with more diverse individuals at the table who bring different life experiences and perspectives. And we’re already seeing states enacting laws, and companies changing their practices, to help make this happen in the public company realm.</p>
<p>Many founders of VC-backed startups are <a href="https://www.diversity.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Diversity-Report-FINAL-2.pdf">white, male, and Ivy League or internationally educated</a>. Women-founded companies <a href="https://elevate.vc/women-and-minority-founders-in-the-venture-capital-pipeline/">receive a fraction of VC investments</a> compared to all-male founded companies. In 2020, women-led startups received <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/women-led-startups-received-just-2-3-of-vc-funding-in-2020">only 2.3% of all VC money</a>. As of June 2021, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard">less than 20%</a> of total VC deals went to a startup with at least one female founder.</p>
<p>When looking at BIPOC representation in the VC ecosystem, the numbers are even more abysmal. <a href="https://www.blckvc.com/">Three percent of VC investors are Black</a> and <a href="https://www.diversity.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Diversity-Report-FINAL-2.pdf">1.7% of VC-backed startups have a Black founder</a>. The number of Latinx founders in VC-backed startups is even lower — <a href="https://www.diversity.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Diversity-Report-FINAL-2.pdf">1.3%</a>. Plus, only <a href="http://about.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020_crunchbase_diversity_report.pdf">2.4% of funding</a> was allocated to Black and Latinx founders from 2015 to August 2020. And, on the startup boards of high tech companies, <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=446005007069124126126096030089113093121054088068002056077030109087123114088066082110030012116061009062052103001114086009100082039039001011046064119015115076095066077033039015094011102005093075125103092095087083103097116125088005011084022091023008078104&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE">women hold a mere 8% of the board seats</a>.</p>
<p>But the lack of diversity extends beyond who gets funding or who is in the boardroom; it is also a problem in the executive suite. In California, Asian Americans were among the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e8bce29f730fc7358d4bc35/t/5ff66a62cc85ca2d29e2d858/1609984611034/Race-Gender-And-The-Double-Glass-Ceiling.pdf">least likely to be promoted</a> to manager or executive positions, and <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/special-report/diversity-high-tech">less than 2% of high-tech executives are Black</a>.</p>
<p>This lack of diversity in the VC ecosystem is a structural problem that has no easy solution. While some VC firms have begun allocating funds for trainings and mentorship programs, additional steps need to be taken.</p>
<p>For example, laws on board diversity have already passed in a few states, but they apply only to public companies and typically focus on gender diversity. The laws generally fall into one of three categories — they mandate, encourage, or require disclosure of board diversity. In 2018, California led the way with <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB826">SB 826</a>, California’s board gender diversity law, which required public companies headquartered in California (irrespective of where they were incorporated) to have a minimum of one woman on each of their boards by the end of 2019. By the end of this year, the minimum threshold increases to two if the board has five directors and three if it has six or more directors. (In the statute, female is defined as “an individual who self-identifies her gender as a woman, without regard to the individual’s designated sex at birth.”)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The law has already had an impact: between 2018 and March 2021, the number of board seats held by women in such companies <a href="https://www.calpartnersproject.org/wocclaimyourseat">increased by a whopping 93.6%</a>, but the law is <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2021/06/21/20-15762.pdf">currently being challenged</a> in the courts.</p>
<p>While legislation regarding gender diversity on public company boards has been passed in certain states, even fewer laws address the issue of the lack of minorities on boards. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/business/economy/corporate-boards-black-hispanic-directors.html">Only 12.5%</a> of the board members of the 3,000 largest public companies come from underrepresented ethnic and racial groups despite the fact that these groups comprise 40% of the U.S. population. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/center-for-board-effectiveness/articles/missing-pieces-board-diversity-census-fortune-500-sixth-edition.html">Deloitte and the Alliance for Board Diversity reported</a> data that Fortune 500 board seats were held by individuals identified as African American/Black, Hispanic/Latino(a), and Asian/Pacific Islander at the rates of 8.7%, 4.1%, and 4.6%, respectively, in 2020.</p>
<p>In order to address this underrepresentation, California’s <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB979">AB 979</a> requires that a public company headquartered in California has at least one director from an “underrepresented community” by the end of 2021, with the minimum number increasing by the end of 2022. That definition includes someone who self-identifies as Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian or Alaska Native, or who self-identifies as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.</p>
<p>In addition to California, <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017A/bills/2017a_hjr1017_enr.pdf">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=3394&amp;GAID=15&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;SessionID=108&amp;GA=101">Illinois</a>, <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/BillDetail/1061533">Maryland</a>, <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s4278?intent=support">New York</a>, <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;sessYr=2019&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=R&amp;billNbr=0114&amp;pn=0736">Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=23B.08.120">Washington</a> have also enacted some type of board diversity measure. <a href="https://cga.ct.gov/asp/CGABillStatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=HB5930">Connecticut</a>, <a href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=SB&amp;billnumber=193&amp;year=2021">Hawaii</a>, <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/H4153">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(nuuxjmlb15uwpr3gdmowgn4u))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=2019-SB-0115">Michigan</a>, <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/BillDetail/1070641">New Jersey</a>, <a href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2021R1/Measures/Overview/HB3110">Oregon</a>, and <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA131-HR-344">Ohio</a> have proposed legislation, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Non-governmental initiatives are also being considered. As an example, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nasdaq-to-advance-diversity-through-new-proposed-listing-requirements-2020-12-01">NASDAQ proposed</a> new listing standards to the SEC requiring disclosure of board diversity. <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-commitments/diversity-and-inclusion/launch-with-gs/pages/commitment-to-diversity.html">Goldman Sachs</a> announced that it would manage initial public offerings only for companies with at least one diverse board member.</p>
<p>These kinds of laws, however, may be difficult to implement in startups. In order to change the narrative on diversity in startups, change cannot be limited to the board but rather should have a multi-pronged approach focused on diversifying (1) employees in middle and executive management, (2) directors in the boardroom, and (3) the VC firms and other funders.</p>
<p>With startups, board diversity mandates similar to the one passed in California would likely not work in the early stages given the size of these boards. However, creating a culture where diversity is prioritized can manifest itself in other ways.</p>

<p>For example, limited partners who invest in VC funds could contractually obligate their general partners to consider diverse candidates for their firms as well as the board and management of any portfolio companies. VCs can also continue to diversify the limited partners that invest in their funds by eschewing their immediate networks and more actively reaching out to groups historically underrepresented in the startup ecosystem, such as HBCUs. In fact, some VCs are using <a href="https://actoneventures.com/diversity-rider/">diversity riders</a> in term sheets to do just that. VCs also need to take a hard look at what type of questions they ask their BIPOC and female founders and consider how they may differ in ways that are detrimental to those historically underrepresented in startups.</p>
<p>We are missing opportunities to foster further innovation by not taking more concrete action to add diversity to the startup ecosystem. There is no magic bullet to address the lack of diversity in the startup ecosystem. However, there are steps that founders, VCs, and limited partners can take to make strides in the right direction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOlLmtPQ0zo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>When Salesforce announced its streaming platform Salesforce+, the CRM Playaz&#8217; Paul Greenberg and Brent Leary interviewed Colin Fleming, SVP of Global Brand Experiences at the CRM company (disclosure: I work at Salesforce). Later, I asked Brent about his show on this episode of the Gang.</p>
<blockquote><p>Brent: With all the things going on with data privacy and cookies going away, companies are going to have to figure out a way to get first—and that third party, but first party data in a clean way.<br />
Me: Can you describe the difference?<br />
Well, a third party, you go to a website and this website has partners that you have nothing to do with, and all of a sudden you land on a website and the next thing you know, you might be getting hit up with an ad or an email from a company you didn&#8217;t even expect, you don&#8217;t have a relationship with. But that company has a relationship with the website owner. So all of this stuff, all of these interactions or nuisance breakup of your day because of ads and notifications you&#8217;re getting, you&#8217;re getting it not because you had a direct relationship, but you landed on a site that has potentially thousands of relationships with other companies that want to get at you.<br />
And that&#8217;s the third party cookies way of doing things. Well, that&#8217;s going away. And one of the things that [Fleming] pointed out is that what Salesforce wants to do is create great content in order to be able to build a direct relationship and not have to depend on the traditional third party backroom deals. And I thought that was really great. I was really excited to hear that part of it, because I think it&#8217;s another way of forcing people to actually get away from this third party stuff and and be more direct about what their intentions are and what they&#8217;re trying to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked Keith Teare how quickly third party data is going to go away.</p>
<blockquote><p>Keith: Well, it&#8217;s already starting to go away because of Apple&#8217;s implementation on iOS blocking things. Microsoft&#8217;s browser [market share] is quite small these days, but it also blocks things. So you&#8217;re moving from these common pools, lakes of data, to what you could think more of as a walled garden data, meaning first person data. Companies can&#8217;t rely on targeting through the network anymore unless they themselves know the users and then they can.<br />
So that leads to this big question, which is: what is the right balance between content marketing (which is what I really think Salesforce is doing) where you&#8217;ve got a direct audience, versus advertising, where you pay somebody to show an ad? The targeting on ads is going to deteriorate and content marketing, which is what you could think of as earned media—that is to say, you work to get the attention—is going to grow. So this is really a fairly major shot in the arm of what some people call the creator economy and spreading it out into the enterprise. Every enterprise is going to have to become a creator in this world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Denis Pombriant added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Denis: I read an interesting report this week. It was the seventh edition of the Salesforce Marketing Survey. The first half of it was very positive about using new technology to support work from anywhere and a variety of other things that free you from the office. But the second part of it had some very interesting data about where investments were going by corporations into new marketing. In about a dozen categories, no category had more than a 50 percent response. Basically saying, yeah, we&#8217;re investing enough or we&#8217;re actively pursuing this. So the conclusion I draw from is that everything we seem to be doing about being more tech savvy out on the Web and addressing customers and colleagues and cohorts or whatever it is, is somewhat lagging and will lag until organizations invest in the skills and the people to support some of the new things like content development, audio content development, video content development, AI, and quite a few other things as well.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I think that&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s not whether there&#8217;s a creator economy or not. The investments made by vendors, while significant and market-making, depend on the market expanding beyond its roots. Blogs and podcasts began as a kind of extension of the mainstream media, but foundered when readers and listeners moved to social authority as a measure of credibility. Newsletters and livecasting suffer when the value proposition of the ad hoc media looks too much like the mainstream media it hopes to replace. Instead, we turn the mute button on and eventually escape to fictionalized stories where good triumphs over evil or the reverse.</p>
<p>The creator economy has produced a kind of vaudeville, where talent bubbles up to feed a hungry niche. Where real success comes is when that consensus of what is right for the emotional center mitigates the extremes of the partisan groups and the controversy that drives the current mainstream model. The Rachel Maddow negotiations and the lumbering infrastructure deals suggest a progress of moderate success. Maddow is moving toward a weekly show with creator spinoffs yet to be defined, and Congress is developing a half a loaf plus a little legislative strategy to carve up an unachievable agenda into small successes loosely joined. Not too left, not too right, but enough to beat back the assault on voter rights while protecting the middle. Half a loaf is better than none.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello friends, and welcome back to Week in Review! Last week we dove into Bezos&#8217;s Blue Origin suing NASA. This week, I&#8217;m writing about the unlikely and triumphant resurgence of the NFT market.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this on the TechCrunch site, you can get this in your inbox from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><span class="s1">newsletter page</span></a>, and follow my tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny"><span class="s1">@lucasmtny</span></a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The big thing</h2>
<p>If I could, I would probably write about NFTs in this newsletter every week. I generally stop myself from actually doing so because I try my best to make this newsletter a snapshot of what&#8217;s important to the entire consumer tech sector, not just my niche interests. That said, I&#8217;m giving myself free rein this week.</p>
<p>The NFT market is just so hilariously bizarre and the culture surrounding the NFT world is so web-native, I can&#8217;t read about it enough. But in the past several days, the market for digital art on the blockchain has completely defied reason.</p>
<p>Back in April, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/">I wrote about a platform called CryptoPunks</a> that &#8212; at that point &#8212; had banked more than $200 million in lifetime sales since 2017. The little pop art pixel portraits have taken on a life of their own since then. It was pretty much unthinkable back then but in the past 24 hours alone, the platform did $141 million in sales, a new record. By the time you read this, the NFT platform will have likely passed a mind-boggling $1.1 billion in transaction volume according to crypto tracker <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/">CryptoSlam</a>. With 10,000 of these digital characters, to buy a single one will cost you at least $450,000 worth of the Ethereum cryptocurrency. (When I sent out this newsletter yesterday that number was $300k)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">When I published this back in April, the cheapest CryptoPunks were $30k, today the cheapest one available for sale is just shy of $300k <a href="https://t.co/X4iTSl6FjC">https://t.co/X4iTSl6FjC</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lucas Matney (@lucasmtny) <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny/status/1431362845472485376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>It&#8217;s not just CryptoPunks either; the entire NFT world has exploded in the past week, with several billions of dollars flowing into projects with drawings of monkeys, penguins, dinosaurs and generative art this month alone. After the NFT rally earlier this year &#8212; culminating in Beeple&#8217;s $69 million Christie&#8217;s sale &#8212; began to taper off, many wrote off the NFT explosion as a bizarre accident. What triggered this recent frenzy?</p>
<p>Part of it has been a resurgence of cryptocurrency prices toward all-time-highs and a desire among the crypto rich to diversify their stratospheric assets without converting their wealth to fiat currencies. Dumping hundreds of millions of dollars into an NFT project with fewer stakeholders than the currencies that underlie them can make a lot of sense to those whose wealth is already over-indexed in crypto. But a lot of this money is likely FOMO dollars from investors who are dumping real cash into NFTs, bolstered by moves like <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/8/visa-enters-nfts-cryptopunk-7610-acquisition-interview">Visa&#8217;s purchase this week of their own CryptoPunk</a>.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s pretty fair to say that this growth is unsustainable, but how much further along this market growth gets before the pace of investment slows or collapses is completely unknown. There are no signs of slowing down for now, something that can be awfully exciting &#8212; and dangerous &#8212; for investors looking for something wild to drop their money into&#8230; and wild this market truly is.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some advice from Figma CEO Dylan Field who sold his alien CryptoPunk earlier this year for 4,200 Eth (worth $13.6 million today).</p>

<h2>Other things</h2>
<p><em>Here are the TechCrunch news stories that especially caught my eye this week:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-suspends-decision-to-ban-explicit-content/"><b>OnlyFans suspends its porn ban</b></a><br />
In a stunning about-face, OnlyFans declared this week that they won&#8217;t be banning &#8220;sexually explicit content&#8221; from their platform after all, saying in a statement that they had &#8220;secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned October 1 policy change.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/kanye-wants-to-sell-you-a-200-music-gadget/"><b>Kanye gets into the hardware business</b></a><br />
Ahead of the drop of his next album, which will definitely be released at some point, rapper Kanye West has shown off a mobile music hardware device called the Stem Player. The $200 pocket-sized device allows users to mix and alter music that has been loaded onto the device. It was developed in partnership with hardware maker Kano.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/">Apple settles developer lawsuit</a><br />
</b>Apple has taken some PR hits in recent years following big and small developers alike complaining about the take-it-or-leave-it terms of the company&#8217;s App Store. This week, Apple shared a proposed settlement (which still is pending a judge&#8217;s approval) that starts with a $100 million payout and gets more interesting with adjustments to App Store bylines, including the ability of developers to advertise paying for subscriptions directly rather than through the app only.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/twitter-starts-to-roll-out-paid-ticketed-spaces-on-ios/"><b>Twitter starts rolling out ticketed Spaces</b></a><br />
Twitter has made a convincing sell for its Clubhouse competitor Spaces, but they&#8217;ve also managed to build on the model in recent months, turning its copycat feature into a product that succeeds on its own merits. Its latest effort to allow creators to sell tickets to events is just starting to roll out, the company shared this week.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/a-california-judge-just-struck-down-prop-22-now-what/">CA judge strikes down controversial gig economy proposition</a></strong><br />
Companies like Uber and DoorDash dumped tens of millions of dollars into Prop 22, a law which clawed back a California law that pushed gig economy startups to classify workers as full employees. This week a judge declared the proposition unconstitutional, and though the decision has been stayed on appeal, any adjustment would have major ramifications for those companies&#8217; business in California.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/future-tech-exits-have-a-lot-to-live-up-to/"><b>Future tech exits have a lot to live up to</b></a><br />
&#8220;Inflation may or may not prove transitory when it comes to consumer prices, but startup valuations are definitely rising — and noticeably so — in recent quarters. That’s the obvious takeaway from a recent PitchBook report digging into valuation data from a host of startup funding events in the United States&#8230;&#8221;</p>

&#8220;&#8230;is the experience of creating and selling an NFT on OpenSea actually any good? That’s what UX analyst <a href="http://builtformars.com/">Peter Ramsey</a> has been trying to answer by creating and selling NFTs on OpenSea for the last few weeks. And the short answer is: <em>It could be much better.</em>..<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span></p>

&#8220;&#8216;Solutions,&#8217; &#8216;cutting-edge,&#8217; &#8216;scalable&#8217; and &#8216;innovative&#8217; are just a sample of the overused jargon lurking around every corner of the techverse, with SaaS marketers the world over seemingly singing from the same hymn book. Sadly for them, new research has proven that such jargon-heavy copy — along with unclear features and benefits — is deterring customers and cutting down conversions&#8230;&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/headspace-and-ginger-are-merging-to-form-headspace-health/"> Headspace merged with on-demand mental healthcare platform Ginger</a>, I was surprised. After all, Ginger raised $100 million<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210324005320/en/Ginger-Announces-100-Million-Series-E-Financing-from-Blackstone-to-Bring-Value-Based-Mental-Healthcare-to-Millions-of-Employees-and-Health-Plan-Members"> in Series E funding</a> just a few months ago — and last time I spoke to CEO Russell Glass, he stressed the importance of integrating into employer-paid health plans. To me, Headspace’s meditation app is about as direct to consumer as one could go, so what business did Ginger have to get into literal business with it? Fragmentation, much?</p>
<p>Turns out, <a href="https://www.lyrahealth.com/blog/lyra-health-calm-announcement/">there’s precedent</a>, and, per a slew of health tech investors and techies, there is more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/28/headspace-ginger-lyra-health-calm/">consolidation and commodification to come in behavioral health.</a> I love learning things!</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/28/headspace-ginger-lyra-health-calm/">As we discussed during a Twitter Spaces</a> about the merger, Headspace has been pursuing clinical validation for mindfulness for quite a while. That validation could help it pitch its somewhat-fresh employee benefit program and compete with its closest rival, Calm. By merging with an on-demand mental healthcare platform such as Ginger, Headspace can now offer a more holistic approach to mental health. Ginger, for those who don’t know, specializes in helping people access care when they need it, ranging from text-based support to escalation to trainers in real time.</p>
<p>But beyond the news, what does this mean? There are a few main takeaways I had after the Spaces. First, in the best-case scenario, Headspace and Ginger’s merger could show us what a holistic and integrative approach to mental health could look like. As Omers Ventures’ Chrissy Farr said, some patients could use a combination of approaches that vary over time. The industry is evolving so that users have more options when it comes to mental health care; from meditation to texts to Zoom therapy sessions. Second, and this came up throughout the chat, parts of behavioral health are going to get commoditized as the sector grows. Now, it’s no longer enough to just connect a user to a specialist. How do platforms more thoughtfully connect nuanced patients to nuanced options? It’s more than holistic, it’s integrative, says Lux Capital’s Deena Shakir.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/03/edtech-2021/">2021 is all about consolidation</a> — and that includes digital health. 7WireVenture’s Alyssa Jaffe noted that 80% of the cost and complexity in mental health is with severe mental illnesses, but 80% of startups begin with lower acuity care. The new combined entity could become more <a href="https://twitter.com/AlyssaJoyJaffee/status/1430566951240323082">acquisitive in what it aspires to address,</a> now, beyond non-acute conditions.</p>
<p>In the rest of the newsletter, we’ll get into fintech’s friendly foes, edtech turning into SaaS and a must-read LatAm deep dive. As always, you can support me by following me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a>, where I post all my work throughout the week.</p>

<p>I wrote two stories this week that underscore two realities about the hiring landscape today. First, I reported that tech bootcamp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/flockjay-cuts-at-least-half-of-its-workforce-as-it-pivots-away-from-bootcamps-into-b2b-saas/">Flockjay cut at least half of its workforce</a> as it pivoted away from its original job placement focus. Second, Workstream <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/workstreams-text-based-recruitment-tool-gets-a-48m-bet-from-bond-and-beyond/">raised $48 million for its text-based recruitment platform</a> for hourly workers.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Flockjay’s entire premise was helping non-tech workers break into tech through sales jobs. Its recent pivot to a B2B SaaS tool tells us how hard of a business job placement may be, even in high-demand roles such as sales operations. A day later, Workstream raised money for its recruitment software for the hourly worker. The $48 million Series B is a note on how employers facing high turnover are willing to spend money on recruitment tools that meet candidates where they are, which may be their cell phones.</p>
<p>While one story tells us hiring is a hard business to do at scale, another shows that existing gaps still need focused attention.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<p>Changes to the App Store ecosystem dominated the headlines this week. In South Korea, legislators are<strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/final-vote-delayed-for-koreas-plan-to-ban-google-and-apple-in-app-payment-rules/">set to vote on a landmark bill</a> that could end Apple and Google&#8217;s payment exclusivity</strong> on their app stores. Meanwhile, <strong>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-lowers-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-for-news-publishers-who-participate-in-apple-news/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">dropped commissions to 15% for news publishers&#8217; apps</a>,</strong> if they agree to participate in the Apple News ecosystem. <strong>Apple also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29&amp;guccounter=1">agreed to settle</a> a class-action lawsuit from U.S. app developers</strong> that, pending court approval, will introduce a few changes to App Store rules &#8212; the most notable being that it allows developers to communicate with their users outside of their iOS apps to tell them about other purchase options.</p>
<h1>Top Story: The App Store settlement underwhelms</h1>
<p><div id="attachment_2133289" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2133289" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2133289" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/app-store-2021-pattern.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/app-store-2021-pattern.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/app-store-2021-pattern.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/app-store-2021-pattern.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/app-store-2021-pattern.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/app-store-2021-pattern.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/app-store-2021-pattern.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/app-store-2021-pattern.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/app-store-2021-pattern.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2133289" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As it turns out, <strong>this App Store settlement agreement isn&#8217;t really as earth-shattering</strong> as some headlines may have made it seem. For starters, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apples-new-app-store-guidelines-aim-to-crack-down-on-fraud-and-scams/">Apple had already slightly adjusted its App Store policies</a> in June when it clarified developers were allowed to communicate through email and text with their customers about other purchasing methods besides Apple&#8217;s own in-app purchases. But this was <em>only</em> permitted if developers weren&#8217;t using contact information obtained from within the app. With the new settlement, that changes a bit.</p>
<p>Developers can now take the smallest of steps forward as they are allowed to inform users  &#8212; well, users who have consented to receive offers via email or other communications &#8212; about <strong>alternative methods of payment besides in-app purchases.</strong> That means developers will also have to collect users&#8217; contact information from their app where users may already be logging in using third-party credentials like Facebook&#8217;s, Google&#8217;s or even Apple&#8217;s own sign-on systems. <em>(Apple&#8217;s system, of course, has an option to hide your email address from developers. Wow, someone was thinking ahead there!)</em></p>
<p>But this change wasn&#8217;t what developers want. They actually want to point users from <em>inside</em> their app to their website where they could market their own payment and subscription options &#8212; possibly even at a reduced rate since they wouldn&#8217;t have to share a commission with Apple. Even if Apple allowed this more permissive action, it&#8217;s likely many consumers would continue to use in-app purchases for the sake of convenience. The real concern on Apple&#8217;s part is that such a change could redirect significant income from the App Store&#8217;s biggest moneymakers, like games, to payment systems outside the App Store.</p>
<p>The settlement agreement proposes other changes as well, such as <strong>the expansion of price points</strong> from fewer than 100 to more than 500. Apple also agreed to<strong> publish a transparency report on the App Review process</strong>. (This could potentially be an even bigger deal than the App Store rule changes, as it could push Apple to address some of the outstanding issues with erroneous rejections, app scams and delays.) And <strong>Apple said it would establish a $100 million fund for U.S. developers less than $1 million per calendar year</strong>, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/26/psa-heres-how-to-check-if-you-are-eligible-for-apples-small-developer-assistance-fund/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29">which will pay out in a range</a> of $250 to $30,000, depending on the size of the developers&#8217; app business.</p>
<h3>Developer responses to the settlement</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2162553" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162553" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2162553" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-tim-cook-crowd-e1623094087992.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="356" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162553" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-us-developers-agree-to-app-store-updates/">put out the news of the settlement</a> in its usual style of a polished press release, albeit one buried late on a Thursday night with reporter <a href="https://time.com/6093282/apple-app-store-payment/">briefings</a> scheduled for hours where they could easily get missed. Apple, in its release, touted the &#8220;even better business opportunity&#8221; this represented for developers whose feedback it &#8220;appreciates&#8221; and whose &#8220;ideas&#8230; helped inform the agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>We wanted to hear what developers thought about this change. Here&#8217;s a sampling of feedback from the community: </strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/rjonesy">Ryan Jones</a>, founder and CEO of iOS flight tracker <a href="https://flighty.app/">Flighty</a> (whose <a href="https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1431080067942207488">Twitter thread</a> offers a good summary of the news): </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I just keep praying Apple will wake up and change the rules themselves but today wasn’t that day. Its not a great idea to let 70-year-old bureaucrats who get tech support from their grandkids write technology ecosystem law. I just have to believe Apple is realizing this is a ticking time bomb &#8211; they have to change it themselves, or we’ll all pay the consequences for years to come. There’s real resentment building the way Apple PR keeps basically gaslighting us. Anyone who can read critically can immediately tell there’s zero substance to this announcement. They need to step up and make changes before courts do it for them.&#8221; </em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/jamesthomson">James Thomson</a>, indie developer and creator of<a href="https://t.co/AFic7jbpox?amp=1"> PCalc</a> app:</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;On the face of it, it doesn&#8217;t seem like the announcements are particularly significant for us. It&#8217;s mainly clarification on existing rules that were already in place. It&#8217;s still not permitted to link within your app to an alternative payment mechanism, but you can at least email the customer to tell them about it, if they have opted-in. It&#8217;s not 100% clear to me that wasn&#8217;t allowed in the first place. The developer fund is also U.S. only, so that doesn&#8217;t help us. Overall, I don&#8217;t see this doing very much to change the opinion of those calling for antitrust legislation.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/bhansmeyer">Becky Hansmeyer</a>, indie developer behind <a href="https://www.yarnbuddy.app/">YarnBuddy</a> and <a href="https://snapthread.app/">Snapthread</a> apps: </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Apple has made zero concessions in this settlement. App Store search and discovery are still terrible, developers still can’t reference outside payment methods within their apps, and App Review is still a needlessly draconian process that discourages innovation and punishes good actors while letting scams run rampant. The &#8216;Small Developer Assistance Fund&#8217; is nothing more than payouts to class members as a form of self-punishment. Nothing about this is good for developers, or consumers.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/apple-s-new-settlement-is-a-corrupt-joke-bd8b9c1e">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>, Basecamp co-founder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/basecamp-launches-hey-a-hosted-email-service-for-neat-freaks/">developer</a> of <a href="https://www.hey.com/">HEY</a> email app and noted Apple critic</strong>:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;The trophy of this settlement, as presented in the press, is supposedly that developers can now tell their customers where to buy services outside the app. Except no, that&#8217;s not actually what&#8217;s happening! Apple is simply &#8216;clarifying&#8217; that companies can send an email to their customers, if they&#8217;ve gotten permission to do so, on an opt-in basis. That email may include information about how to buy outside the app. So the steering provisions of the App Store, that developers are not allowed to tell users inside their app or on the signup screen about other purchasing choices than IAP – the only places that actually matter! – is being cemented with this &#8216;clarification.&#8217; It draws a thicker line, asserts Apple&#8217;s right to steer in the first place, and offers the meaningless concession of opt-in email, which was something developers had already been doing.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Kosta Eleftheriou, FlickType developer who&#8217;s also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">suing Apple over lost revenues</a> due to App Store scams: </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Apple&#8217;s draconian anti-steering provisions remain in place just as before. This settlement is a meaningless concession for developers who all see what PR game Apple is playing. And Apple labelling the restitution they&#8217;ve agreed to pay as an &#8216;assistance&#8217; fund is deceitful and shameful: Developers aren&#8217;t asking for help, they are asking for fairness.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting">Jacob Eiting</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/">RevenueCat</a>, which offers app developers a suite of tools for their subscription-based apps:</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;The changes proposed in the settlement are largely a repackaging of existing work Apple has done, a much smaller change than it seemed from Apple’s press release. They are rolling back one recently enacted anti-steering rule, but leaving all other anti-steering rules in place. The settlement also puts into place commitments to programs that most likely weren’t going anywhere anyway. They’ve also agreed to pay out $100M to small developers as a settlement, acting as if it’s some magnanimous gesture. However, it’s in exchange for developers waiving any claims of unfairness in Apple’s fees for the last 6 years. Seeing how good Apple has gotten at patting themselves on the back, this will likely be dragged out any time Apple needs evidence of developer friendliness for years to come.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/aaron_pearce">Aaron Pearce</a>, indie iOS developer behind <a href="https://pearcemedia.app/">a suite of HomeKit-connected apps</a> including HomeRun, HomeCam, HomePass and others: </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;To me, there weren’t any real changes that matter. These are mostly clarifications of existing rules or statements. The pledge to keep the Small Business program is nice, but no one expected that to go away. Keeping App Store search the same was a near guarantee previously. The only real change is introducing more pricing points that I cannot see helping developers in a huge way in the immediate future. The $100 million fund is a lawsuit settlement, not Apple being generous to help developers. I<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> find the PR spin on these &#8216;changes&#8217; to be disingenuous. They aren’t fixing the core problems with the App Store that small or large developers face when they are simply trying to ship products to their customers.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://appfairness.org/coalition-for-app-fairness-statement-on-apples-sham-settlement-offer/">CAF</a>, a nonprofit representing developers including Epic Games, Spotify, Tile and dozens of others pushing for regulation of app stores:</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Apple’s sham settlement offer is nothing more than a desperate attempt to avoid the judgment of courts, regulators, and legislators worldwide. This offer does nothing to address the structural, foundational problems facing all developers, large and small, undermining innovation and competition in the app ecosystem. Allowing developers to communicate with their customers about lower prices outside of their apps is not a concession and further highlights Apple’s total control over the app marketplace. If this settlement is approved, app makers will still be barred from communicating about lower prices or offering competing payment options within their apps. We will not be appeased by empty gestures and will continue our fight for fair and open digital platforms.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SamJ0hn">Samantha John</a>, CEO and co-founder of coding app <a href="https://www.gethopscotch.com/">Hopscotch</a>: </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Nothing changed. You were always able to write whatever you wanted in your emails or website. They still are not letting you link to or mention an alternate payment processor inside your app. It&#8217;s a weird news story because it made me hopeful when I saw the headlines but nothing had actually happened.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Overall, it&#8217;s seems developers aren&#8217;t impressed with this minor concession and it doesn&#8217;t seem this settlement will do anything to stop the push for increased App Store legislations.</p>

<h3>Google Platform Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/08/making-ratings-and-reviews-better-for.html">announced</a> a change in how ratings and reviews on Google Play will appear to end users</strong>. Developers had complained how negative feedback that only affected users in one region could have brought down the rating for all. To address this, starting in November 2021, users on phones will only see ratings specific to their registered country. Then, in early 2022, users on other devices like tablets, Chromebooks and wearables, will see ratings that are only specific to the devices they&#8217;re on. Google says changes are rolling out to the Google Play Console which will help developers prepare for the changes, including dimensions like &#8220;Device Type&#8221; dimensions.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Snapchat on Thursday upgraded its two-year-old &#8220;Scan&#8221; feature</strong> which lets people use Snap&#8217;s Camera to explore the world around them. The new generation of Scan, which was relocated to be front-and-center in the Snapchat app, will now offer suggestions of different ways to use the Camera, including Camera Shortcuts and shopping features. <strong>Camera Shortcuts</strong> help people capture a moment by suggesting things like camera modes, Lenses and soundtracks relevant to what is seen through the Camera. Over time, Snap will introduce more Shortcuts, including those for its short-form TikTok competitor, Spotlight. With the update, users can now also tap into their screenshots of items they wanted to buy, then use Scan to find and purchase those outfits through Memories. For instance, you can scan a friend&#8217;s outfit then use <strong>Screenshop</strong> to find similar looks across brands. You can also use Scan with food and ingredients at home to get recipe suggestions. Snap says it sees potential for Scan not only on mobile, but also in its next generation of Spectacles glasses.</li>

<li><strong>Very few people used the COVID-19 apps powered by Apple and Google&#8217;s API in the U.S.</strong>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-google-contact-tracing-apps-barely-used-in-us-investigation-2021-8">an Insider investigation found</a>. Only 2.14% of possible COVID cases were recorded in exposure notification apps across 26 U.S. states. The problem was likely hampered by the fact that launching apps was left up to individual states, instead of being a national effort as with the contact tracing apps built using the API in other markets. Less than half of U.S. states chose not to even build an app in the first place, limiting the tools&#8217; reach further.</li>

However, the study didn&#8217;t enable parental controls which is the tools parents would presumably use to keep kids from accessing adult apps.</li>

<p>A new startup called <a href="https://onpopcorn.com/">Popcorn</a> wants to make work communication more fun and personal by offering a way for users to record short video messages, or “pops,” that can be used for any number of purposes in place of longer emails, texts, Slack messages or Zoom calls. While there are plenty of other places to record short-form video these days, most of these exist in the social media space, which isn’t appropriate for a work environment. With Popcorn, you can instead create a short video and then send a URL to that video anywhere you would want to add a personal touch to your message &#8212; like for outreach on LinkedIn or a quick check-in with a colleague, for example. The app is currently a free download on iPhone, iPad and Mac.

Each drawing will connect to the previous one and can be colored in however the user sees fit. As kids draw, they&#8217;ll bring an audio story to life for a more immersive and creative experience. <a href="https://www.madewithlumo.com/">The app was built</a> by Jonathan Wegener (Timehop co-founder, Snapchat designer), Bernardo Nunez (YouTube), Jeffrey Neafsey (Microsoft, Apple), Britt Hatzius and Ant Hampton.

<p>A London-headquartered startup called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/love/id1454778314">LOVE</a>, valued at $17 million following its pre-seed funding, aims to redefine how people stay in touch with close family and friends. The company is launching a messaging app that offers a combination of video calling as well as asynchronous video and audio messaging, in an ad-free, privacy-focused experience with a number of bells and whistles, including artistic filters and real-time transcription and translation features. But LOVE’s bigger differentiator may not be its product alone, but rather the company’s mission. LOVE aims for its product direction to be guided by its user base in a democratic fashion as opposed to having the decisions made about its future determined by an elite few at the top of some corporate hierarchy. In addition, the company’s longer-term goal is ultimately to hand over ownership of the app and its governance to its users.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday?

<p>The debate over remote work, office culture, how to manage teams of distributed staff and the like continues. With the delta variant of COVID-19 pushing back office return dates for many companies, there’s still a healthy argument over what the future of work will look like.</p>
<p>But while large companies hem and haw their way through the present, it’s my view that the debate is largely over and that startups have won it.</p>
<p>I’ve been on a huge number of calls with startup founders since the onset of COVID-19, and in the last few quarters, it seems that nearly every time I talk to an early-stage company they have a remote, distributed team. Some of these startups were literally founded during the COVID era, so it makes sense. But the trend is broader than just those firms.</p>

<p>Thinking only about the startup market for a moment, I think that in time it will be just as weird a concept for startups to raise equity capital to spend on rent as it would be for a startup today to raise equity capital to buy a rack of servers and pay co-location fees. We have AWS and Azure for that now. And regarding offices, we have remote work now. Why shell out shares for square footage?</p>
<p>We’re being simplistic to some degree, but spending seed or Series A money on rent makes early office space some of the most expensive real estate in the world. For successful startups, at least. The savvy will avoid the tax.</p>
<p>There’s more to this: The talent market is incredibly tight for many key roles today. Ask anyone trying to hire machine learning talent. Or senior dev roles. Or marketing team leads. The list goes on. The sort of talent that startups are on the hunt for is scarce, and ‘spensive.</p>
<p>Even worse for upstart tech companies, Big Tech companies have never been more wealthy. So what’s a young company to do? Offer what the big guns appear loath to offer, namely remote-friendly work. This will also help startups poach talent from the bigger tech companies. Talent that they don’t want to shed.</p>
<p>In time, I suspect that softer retention numbers for HR staffs will lead to more workplace flexibility everywhere. And many startups that are remote today will scale while sticking to the model, becoming the big companies of tomorrow with fully remote teams. So the conversation about remote work or returning to high-priced office space is still happening, but it feels more like doomed-cruiseliner deckchair-shuffling than real debate.</p>
<p>Are <em>you</em> going to go back to commuting by car, or a mixture of car and public transit, so that you can put on headphones and try to focus in the office? I doubt it. I’m not.</p>
<h2>More on Boston</h2>
<p>The Exchange is spending time digging into the various startup hubs of the world, with a focus on some U.S. markets that are worth giving more time to. We’ve looked at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/when-vcs-turned-to-zoom-chicago-startups-were-ready-for-their-close-up/">Chicago</a>, for example, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bostons-startup-market-is-more-than-setting-records-in-scorching-start-to-year/">most recently Boston</a>.</p>
<p>After that Boston piece went live, a few more sets of comments came in. Let’s chew on their key bits.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;When VCs turned to Zoom, Chicago startups were ready for their close-up&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/when-vcs-turned-to-zoom-chicago-startups-were-ready-for-their-close-up/embed/#?secret=iwiTYl3unK" data-secret="iwiTYl3unK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Glasswing Ventures’ <a href="https://twitter.com/rudina11">Rudina Seseri</a> provided us with a look at what is ahead for Boston in the coming quarters, saying that “the number of companies coming to market and raising new rounds is high and they are operationally strong. So unless there is a market correction — which would extend far beyond Boston­­ — the funding appetite will remain.”</p>
<p>And if market conditions persist, startup venture activity could get even more heated in Boston. Seseri told The Exchange via email that “the number of pre-seed and seed-stage companies are increasing dramatically. In fact, we have seen 2x growth [year over year] in the number that are highly qualified for funding.”</p>
<p>In her view, the volume of neat startups that Boston is creating is “a testament to the entrepreneurial spirit in early tech and the market opportunities that COVID-19 has initiated and accelerated.”</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariglantz/">Ari Glantz</a> of the New England Venture Capital Association said that after “a slowdown in H1 2020, both founders and funders have seen a historic flow of capital as new needs and opportunities emerged due to pandemic-era shifts,” and that with “companies and their backers continuing to adapt, the prospects remain bright.”</p>
<p>I included that final quote as it applies to, well, nearly everywhere. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">Startups have never had it so good!</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fifteen years ago this week on August 25, 2006, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> turned on the very <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon_ec2_beta/">first beta instance of EC2</a>, its cloud-based virtual computers. Today cloud computing, and more specifically infrastructure as a service, is a staple of how businesses use computing, but at that moment it wasn&#8217;t a well known or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/19/wtf-is-cloud-computing/">widely understood concept</a>.</p>
<p>The EC in EC2 stands for Elastic Compute, and that name was chosen deliberately. The idea was to provide as much compute power as you needed to do a job, then shut it down when you no longer needed it &#8212; making it flexible like an elastic band. The launch of EC2 in beta was preceded by the beta release of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon_s3/">S3 storage six months earlier</a>, and both services marked the starting point in AWS&#8217; cloud infrastructure journey.</p>
<p>You really can&#8217;t overstate what Amazon was able to accomplish with these moves. It was able to anticipate an entirely different way of computing and create a market and a substantial side business in the process. It took vision to recognize what was coming and the courage to forge ahead and invest the resources necessary to make it happen, something that every business could learn from.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/">AWS origin story</a> is complex, but it was about bringing the IT power of the Amazon business to others. Amazon at the time was not the business it is today, but it was still rather substantial and still had to deal with massive fluctuations in traffic such as Black Friday when its website would be flooded with traffic for a short but sustained period of time. While the goal of an e-commerce site, and indeed every business, is attracting as many customers as possible, keeping the site up under such stress takes some doing and Amazon was learning how to do that well.</p>
<p>Those lessons and a desire to bring the company&#8217;s internal development processes under control would eventually lead to what we know today as Amazon Web Services, and that side business would help fuel a whole generation of startups. We spoke to Dave Brown, who is VP of EC2 today, and who helped build the first versions of the tech, to find out how this technological shift went down.</p>
<h2>Sometimes you get a great notion</h2>
<p>The genesis of the idea behind AWS started in the 2000 timeframe when the company began looking at creating a set of services to simplify how they produced software internally. Eventually, they developed a set of foundational services &#8212; compute, storage and database &#8212; that every developer could tap into.</p>
<p>But the idea of selling that set of services really began to take shape at an executive offsite at Jeff Bezos&#8217; house in 2003. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/">A 2016 TechCrunch article</a> on the origins AWS described how that started to come together:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the team worked, Jassy recalled, they realized they had also become quite good at running infrastructure services like compute, storage and database (due to those previously articulated internal requirements). What’s more, they had become highly skilled at running reliable, scalable, cost-effective data centers out of need. As a low-margin business like Amazon, they had to be as lean and efficient as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>They realized that those skills and abilities could translate into a side business that would eventually become AWS. It would take a while to put these initial ideas into action, but by December 2004, they had opened an engineering office in South Africa to begin building what would become EC2. As Brown explains it, the company was looking to expand outside of Seattle at the time, and Chris Pinkham, who was director in those days, hailed from South Africa and wanted to return home.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. Happy Saturday!</p>
<p>After news broke that meditation app Headspace and on-demand mental health care platform Ginger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/headspace-and-ginger-are-merging-to-form-headspace-health/">were merging</a>, we couldn&#8217;t resist hopping on the mics to do a bonus episode. And, because we were in the mood for hot takes, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> held the conversation on Twitter Spaces. The special guests we had on, who we&#8217;ll get to down below, did not disappoint.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a quick show, but the tl;dr is that you want to listen if you&#8217;re curious why a meditation app would get into therapy, the precedent by Lyra Health and Calm, and how consolidation looks for the sector going forward.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s who helped us understand and contextualize the news:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lux Capital partner <a href="https://twitter.com/deenashakir">Deena Shakir</a> (who is also coming to Disrupt, incidentally)</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyfarr">Chrissy Farr</a> of OMERS Ventures (who you may also know as a former CNBC reporter in the healthech space)</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/AlyssaJoyJaffee">7WireVentures&#8217; Alyssa Jaffee </a>(who needs her own podcast because she was shining during the Spaces)</li>
</ul>
<p>And, special shout out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/russellglass">Ginger CEO Russell Glass</a>, who joined the Space but wasn&#8217;t able to come up on stage due to technical difficulties. Twitter Spaces are fun, but the platform is still a bit nascent so goofs can bedevil live production.</p>
<p>However, we managed to get some notes from him via email, so let&#8217;s take a quick look at those:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>Glass said that he agreed with &#8220;what Chrissy Farr and others said about there simply not being enough therapists in the market today to meet the overwhelming demand,&#8221; adding that there&#8217;s &#8220;real global need today for what Headspace Health can offer &#8211; a scaled, comprehensive platform that can truly democratize mental healthcare.&#8221;</li>
<li>He also doubleclicked on the discussing regarding future &#8220;meaningful market consolidation,&#8221; noting that he expects to see it &#8220;especially&#8221; happen in &#8220;areas that address higher acuity care for severe mental illness.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you are <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">following the podcast on Twitter</a> so that you catch us when we go live. These are meant to be spontaneous pop up shows, so your best bet is to turn on notifications to never miss our Spaces. Ok that&#8217;s all. Thanks everyone!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Space may be the endless frontier, but here on Earth, we define space in the modern sense as something enclosed. Walls, fences and barriers enclose space, define it and make it legible. In fact, the sense of limits is so strong these days with place that we often have to add qualifiers like “open space” to describe wholly natural environments like parks and forests as places without spatial limits.</p>
<p>While enclosures have been with us for centuries, the barriers they raise have never been so high or politically fraught. In the United States, one of the most controversial aspects of the Trump administration was over the erection of a southern border wall with Mexico. With climate change accelerating and migrants increasing all around the world though, walls are becoming a common occurrence and political tool. Just this week, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58289893">Greece erected fencing along its border with Turkey</a> in preparation for an expected deluge of Afghan refugees fleeing violence in the wake of the Taliban’s seizure of Kabul.</p>
<p>John Lanchester has taken these themes of barriers, fear, and politics and intensified them in his atmospheric novel appropriately titled “<a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/the-wall/">The Wall</a>.”</p>
<p>The conceit is simple: a thinly-disguised United Kingdom, ravaged by climate change and heavy migration from outside the island, erects a universal wall across all of its shores, posting sentries every few meters or so to monitor the barriers for any potential intruders. Their sole mission: to keep <i>them</i> out, whoever they might be. Failure is symbolically punished with exile and banishment, with the watchers becoming the watched.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2195176" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Wall.jpg?w=447" alt="" width="447" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Wall.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Wall.jpg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Wall.jpg?resize=197,300 197w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Wall.jpg?resize=768,1169 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Wall.jpg?resize=447,680 447w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Wall.jpg?resize=1009,1536 1009w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Wall.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px" /></p>
<p>We predominantly follow a pair of sentries who, as the above rule all but implicates for the plot, will become exiled in the course of their duties. What we get then is a meditation on the meaning of home, and also the meaning of barriers and dislocation in a world that is increasingly hostile to being a refuge for much of anyone.</p>
<p>While the plot and characters are a bit lackluster, what is fascinating with the novel is how well it manages to create an environment and ambiance of dread, of a society at the end of its journey. People live, parties are hosted, work is done, but all these activities takes place in a world where the jet stream has presumably disappeared, plunging our hypothetical U.K. into the cold abyss. That theme of gray, morose darkness exudes throughout the book, describing everything from the construction of the wall itself to the personalities of the people that inhabit this world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s the ironic tension that propels the book forward, of global warming heating us up while we simultaneously develop the distant sangfroid to fight the ravaging effects of that heat. We are human, but wooden, divorced from the connection and community we have known in order to protect what little we have left.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That social coolness also inhabits a new set of class differences, not only between native citizens and refugees, but between generations as well. The younger generation, coming to terms with what has happened to their planet, simply no longer follow the instructions of their supposedly wise elders. A mental barrier has been constructed: how can you learn lessons from the people who allowed <i>this</i> to happen? Yet, the boiling anger has long since cooled to an isolated frostiness — acceptance of reality forces the inter-generational conversation to just move on.</p>
<p>Lanchester is astute and subtle in these extensions of the premise, and they are the most enjoyable part of what is — intentionally — a colorless work. The irony again is that this is probably best read on the beach in the middle of summer, an antidote to the heat of our world. I wouldn’t recommend it for the winter months.</p>
<p>There has been more and more “climate fiction” published over the past few years as the issue of climate change has reached prominence in the global consciousness. Many of these are offshoots of science fiction, with long and meandering discussions of technology, policies, and markets and more depending on the work. That can provide intellectual succor in a way and for a certain type of reader.</p>
<p>What Lanchester does is eschew the minutia and technologies pretty much entirely and instead simply situates us in a realistic future — a space that could even be our home. The limits of our imagination are compacted and we are forced to think in tighter quarters. It’s a thought-provoking look at a world whose frontiers are coming closer and closer to all of us all the time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When did indoor air become cold and clean?</p>
<p>Air conditioning is one of those inventions that have become so ubiquitous, that many in the developed world don’t even realize that less than a century ago, it didn’t exist. Indeed, it wasn’t so long ago that the air inside our buildings and the air outside of them were one and the same, with occupants powerless against their environment.</p>
<p>Eric Dean Wilson, in his just published book, “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/After-Cooling/Eric-Dean-Wilson/9781982111298">After Cooling: On Freon, Global Warming, and the Terrible Cost of Comfort</a>,” dives deep into the history of this field. It took more than just inventing the air conditioner to make people want to buy it. In fact, whole social classes outright rejected the technology for years. It took hustle, marketing skill, and mass societal change to place air conditioning at the center of our built environment.</p>
<p>Wilson covers that history, but he has a more ambitious agenda: to get us to see how our everyday comforts affect other people. Our choice of frigid cooling emits flagrant quantities of greenhouse gas emissions, placing untold stress on our planet and civilization. Our pursuit of comfort ironically begets us more insecurity and ultimately, less comfort.</p>
<p>It’s a provocative book, and TechCrunch hosted Wilson for a discussion earlier this week on a Twitter Space. If you missed it, here are some selected highlights of our conversation.</p>
<p><i>This interview has been condensed and edited.</i></p>
<p><b>Danny Crichton</b>: The framing story throughout the book is about your travels with your friend Sam, who works to collect Freon and destroy it. Why did you choose that narrative arc?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><b>Eric Dean Wilson</b>: Sam at the time was working for this green energy company, and they were trying to find a way to take on green projects that would turn a profit. They had found that they could do this by finding used Freon, specifically what&#8217;s called CFC-12. It&#8217;s not made anymore, thank goodness, but it was responsible in part for partially destroying the ozone layer, and production of it was banned by the 90s.</p>
<p>But <i>use</i> of it, and buying and selling it on the secondary market, is totally legal. This is sort of a loophole in the legality of this refrigerant, because the United States government and the people who signed the Montreal Protocol thought that when they stopped production of it that it would pretty much get rid of Freon by the year 2000. Well, that didn&#8217;t happen, which is kind of a mystery.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2195126" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/After-Cooling.jpg?w=429" alt="" width="429" height="648" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/After-Cooling.jpg 429w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/After-Cooling.jpg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/After-Cooling.jpg?resize=199,300 199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/After-Cooling.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" /></p>
<p>So Sam was driving around the United States, finding Freon on the internet, and meeting people (often people who are auto hobbyists or mechanics or something like that) who happened to have stockpiled Freon, and he was buying it from them in order to destroy it for carbon credits on California&#8217;s cap-and-trade system. And the interesting thing about this is that he was going to basically the 48 contiguous states, and meeting people that were often global warming deniers who were often hostile to the idea of the refrigerant being destroyed at all, so he often didn&#8217;t tell them upfront that he was destroying it.</p>
<p>What was really interesting to me is that, aside from a cast of colorful and strange characters, and sometimes violent characters actually as well, was the fact that sometimes after establishing a business relationship first, he was able to have really frank conversations about global warming with people who were otherwise not very open to it.</p>
<p>In a time in which we&#8217;re told that Americans are more divided than ever politically, that we&#8217;re not speaking to each other across ideological divides, I thought this was a curious story.</p>
<p><b>Crichton</b>: And when it comes to greenhouse gases, Freon is among the worst, right?</p>
<p><b>Wilson</b>: I should be really clear that the main global warming gases are carbon dioxide and methane and some other ones as well. But molecule for molecule, CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) are thousands of times greater at absorbing and retaining heat, meaning that they&#8217;re just thousands of times worse for global warming, molecule for molecule. So even though there&#8217;s not that many of them in terms of parts per million in the atmosphere, there&#8217;s enough to really make a sizable contribution to global warming.</p>
<p>The irony is that the replacements of CFCs — HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons) — for the most part, don&#8217;t really do anything to destroy the ozone layer, which is great. But they&#8217;re also super global warming gases. So the ozone crisis was solved by replacing CFCs with refrigerant that exacerbated the global warming crisis.</p>
<p><b>Crichton</b>: Now to get to the heart of the book, you focus on the rise of air conditioning, but you start by giving readers a wide view of what life was like before its invention. Why did you do that?</p>
<p><b>Wilson</b>: This was a surprise — I did not go into the book thinking that I was going to find this. Before air conditioning really took off in the home, there was a really different sense of what we would call personal comfort, and something that I really argue in the book is that what we&#8217;ve come to think of as personal comfort, and specifically, thermal comfort, has changed. What I argue in the book is that it&#8217;s really in part a cultural construction.</p>
<p>Now, I want to be really careful that people don&#8217;t hear that I&#8217;m saying that it&#8217;s <i>entirely</i> a construction. Yes, when we get too hot or too cold, then we can die, for sure. But what&#8217;s really interesting to me is that there&#8217;s a lot of evidence to show that before air conditioning began at the beginning of the twentieth century, people weren&#8217;t really hungry for air conditioning.</p>
<p>There was this greater sense that you could deal with the heat. I put that really carefully, because I don&#8217;t want to say that they suffered through it. Certainly there were heat waves and summers that got too hot. But there was a real sense that you could manage the heat through analog ways, like sleeping outside, sleeping in parks, or designing buildings that incorporate passive cooling. The thing that really disturbed me was that through the twentieth century, we really kind of forgot all that, because we didn&#8217;t need that knowledge anymore because we had air conditioning. So modernist architecture began to kind of ignore the outside conditions, because you could construct whatever conditions you wanted inside.</p>
<p>I think the question that nobody really asked all along is, is this good for everyone? Should we have a homogenized standard of comfort? Nobody really asked that question. And there&#8217;s a lot of people that find that the kind of American model of an office or American model of comfort is not comfortable, both in the United States, and in other places.</p>
<p><b>Crichton</b>: Even beyond a homogenized standard though, you want readers to understand how comfort connects all of us together.</p>
<p><b>Wilson</b>: I think that one of the pernicious things about the American definition of comfort is that it has been defined as <i>personal</i> comfort. And the reason why I keep using that is because it&#8217;s defined as individual comfort. And so what would it mean to think about comfort as being always connected to somebody else, as more ethical that way? Because it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>The truth is that our comfort is related to other people, and vice versa. It’s really asking us to think interdependently, instead of independently, which is how we&#8217;re often encouraged to think, and that&#8217;s a huge, huge ask. Actually, that&#8217;s a huge task and a huge paradigm shift. But I really think if we&#8217;re really trying to think ecologically, and not just sustainably, we have to think about how we&#8217;re all connected and how these infrastructures, how they influence other people in other parts of the world.</p>

	</p>
<p><b>Crichton</b>: Air conditioning didn’t take off right away. In fact, its inventors and customers really had to push hard to get people to want to use it.</p>
<p><b>Wilson</b>: Air conditioning really got its start in the early twentieth century, in order to control the conditions in factories. I was surprised to find out that air conditioning was used in places to make things hotter, or more humid and slightly hotter in a place like a textile factory, where if it&#8217;s not humid enough, cotton threads can break.</p>
<p>Outside the factory, movie theaters were really the first time that thermal comfort was used as a commodity. There were all kinds of other commodifications of comfort, but this was really the first time that the public could go someplace to feel cooler. And the funny thing is is that most movie theaters in the 20s and 30s were freezing cold, they were not what I would call comfortable, because the people who were running them didn&#8217;t really understand that air conditioning works best when it&#8217;s noticed least, which is a hard sell. In the 20s, though, it was a novelty, and the way that you caught people&#8217;s attention on a summer day was to crank the AC up, which felt good for like five minutes, and then it was terribly uncomfortable and you had to shiver through an hour and a half of the rest of the movie.</p>
<p><b>Crichton</b>: I’m jumping ahead, but what does the future look like as global warming persists and our cooling increases in line with that heat?</p>
<p><b>Wilson</b>: In so many cooling situations, there are major alternatives, like redesigning our buildings so that they require way less energy and way less cooling. There are really amazing architects who are looking to things like termite mounds, because the colonies that they build sort of have brilliantly engineered rooms with different temperatures.</p>
<p>That said, I was surprised how much our opinion on comfort could change by simply understanding that it <i>could</i> change. I think that we have to make the world of tomorrow desirable, and we can take a nod from the commercial advertising industry. We have to sell this future as one that we actually want, not as something that we&#8217;re giving up. And I think the narrative is always like, “Oh, we have to stop doing this, we have to lower this, we have to give this up.” And that&#8217;s certainly true. But I think if we understand that as not something that we&#8217;re giving up, but actually something that we&#8217;re gaining, then it makes it a lot easier. For people, it makes it feel a lot more possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the most unfortunate fault lines in climate change politics today is the lack of cooperation between environmentalists and the national security community. Left-wing climate activists don’t exactly hang out with more right-leaning military strategists, the former often seeing the latter as destructive anti-ecological marauders, while the latter often assume the former are unrealistic pests who would prioritize trees and dolphins over human safety.</p>
<p>Yet, climate change is forcing the two to work ever closer together, as uncomfortable as that might be.</p>
<p>In “All Hell Breaking Loose,” emeritus professor and prolific author Michael T. Klare has written a meta-assessment of the Pentagon’s strategic assessments from the last two decades on how climate will shape America’s security environment. Sober and repetitive but not grim, the book is an eye-opening look at how the defense community is coping with one of the most vexing global challenges today.</p>
<p>Climate change weakens the security environment in practically every domain, and in ways that might not be obvious to the non-defense specialist. For the U.S. Navy, which relies on coastal access to shipyards and ports, rising sea levels threaten to diminish and even occasionally demolish its mission readiness, such as when Atlantic hurricanes hit Virginia, one of the largest centers for naval infrastructure in the United States.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2195153" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg?w=451" alt="" width="451" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg 1696w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg?resize=199,300 199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg?resize=768,1159 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg?resize=451,680 451w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg?resize=1018,1536 1018w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg?resize=1357,2048 1357w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /></p>
<p>While perhaps obvious, it bears repeating that the U.S. military is as much a landlord as a fighting force, with hundreds of bases spread across the country and around the world. A large percentage of these installations face climate-related challenges that can affect mission readiness, and the cost to harden these facilities is likely to reach tens of billions of dollars — and perhaps even more.</p>
<p>Then there is the question of energy. The Pentagon is understandably one of the greatest users of energy in the world, requiring power for bases, jet fuel for planes, and energy for ships on a global scale. Procurement managers are obviously concerned about costs, but their real concern is availability — they need to have reliable fuel options in even the most chaotic environments. That critical priority is increasingly tenuous with climate change, as transit options for oil can be disrupted by everything from a bad storm to a ship stuck in the Suez Canal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is where the Pentagon’s mission and the interests of green-minded activists align heavily, if not perfectly. Klare provides examples of how the Pentagon is investing in areas like biofuels, decentralized grid technology, batteries and more as it looks to secure resiliency for its fighting forces. The Pentagon’s budgetary resources might be scorned by critics, but it’s uniquely positioned to pay the so-called green premiums for more reliable energy in ways that few institutions can realistically afford.</p>
<p>That political alignment continues when it comes to humanitarian response, although for vastly different reasons. One of the Pentagon’s chief concerns with global warming is that it will be increasingly waylaid from its highest priority missions — such as protecting against China, Russia, Iran and other long-time adversaries — into responding to humanitarian crises. As one of the only American institutions with the equipment and logistical know-how capable of deploying thousands of responders to disaster zones, the Pentagon is the go-to source for deployments. For Defense, the difficulty is that the armed forces aren’t trained for humanitarian missions — they’re trained for fighting wars. Attacking ISIS-K and managing a camp of climate refugees are decidedly different skills.</p>
<p>Climate activists are fighting for a more stable and equitable world, one that doesn’t lead to millions of climate refugees fleeing from famine and scorching temperatures. The Pentagon similarly wants to shore up fragile states in the hopes of avoiding deployments outside of its core mission. The two groups speak different languages and have different motivations, but the objectives are much the same.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>The most interesting dynamic of climate change and national security is, of course, how the global strategic map changes. Russia is a major winner, and Klare provides an exacting account on how the Pentagon is securing the Arctic now that the ice has melted and shipping lanes have opened at the pole for much of the year and <a href="https://www.vox.com/22295520/climate-change-shipping-russia-china-arctic">soon to be year round</a>. For the first time, America has run training missions for its armed forces on how to operate in the Arctic and prepare for potential contingencies in the region.</p>
<p>Klare’s book is readable, and its subject is electrifyingly fascinating, but this is not a brilliantly written text by any stretch of the imagination. I dubbed it a meta-assessment because it absolutely reads as if it was written by a team of defense planning specialists in the E Ring. It’s a multi-hundred page think tank paper — and as a reader, you either have the stamina to read that or you don’t.</p>
<p>More caustically, the book’s research and primary citations center on the Pentagon’s assessment reports and Congressional testimony and some secondary reporting in newspapers and elsewhere. There are few to no mentions of direct interviews with the participants here, and that’s a major problem given the extremely political nature of climate change in modern U.S. discourse. Klare certainly observes the politics, but we don’t know what generals and the civilian defense leadership would really say if they didn’t have to sign off publicly on a government report. It’s a massive gulf — and begs the question of how much we really get a true picture of the Pentagon’s thinking with this volume.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the book is an important contribution, and a reminder that the national security community — while protective of its interests — can also be an important vanguard for change on climate disruption. Activists and wonks should drop the animosity and talk to each other a bit more often, as there are alliances to be made.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to climate change, it might seem that a book entitled “How to Do Nothing” would not only be irrelevant, but also downright obscene and even dangerous. Not to mention that after more than a year of pandemic living, many people are understandably fatigued at the prospect of continuing to keep their lives empty of social activities.</p>
<p>Yet, messing with our notions of action and contemplation is precisely the plan that Jenny Odell has laid out in her lapidary work, a meditation that is, ironically, a call to action.</p>
<p>Odell is a Bay Area star, who has been an artist in residence at a variety of institutions from the Internet Archive to Recology, San Francisco’s trash pickup and processing company. Her artistic work centers on attention, of focusing on the details that envelop us in this world and what we can learn from them. It’s an activity that leads her to birdwatching and long walks in Oakland’s public parks such as the Morcom Rose Garden.</p>
<p>Her book, it might be helpful to note, is subtitled “Resisting the Attention Economy” and Odell has made it her mission to help wean a generation, and well, a population off the spasmodic negativity that emanates from our social media platforms. In fact, she has a more ambitious goal: to wean people off the notion that productivity is the only value to life — that action is the only useful metric by which to measure ourselves. She wants to direct our attention to more important things.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2195169" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Do-Nothing.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Do-Nothing.jpeg 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Do-Nothing.jpeg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Do-Nothing.jpeg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Do-Nothing.jpeg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>“I fully understand where a life of sustained attention leads. In short, it leads to awareness,” she writes in the introduction. The key word here is sustained — and that’s also the connection with sustainability and the climate more broadly.</p>
<p>We don’t lack for information, data or opinions. In fact, we are overwhelmed with the dross of human thought. Some studies have shown that modern knowledge workers read more words per day than ever before in history — but they’re reading social media posts, emails, Slack messages and other ephemera that are each nibbling and collectively devouring our attention. What’s left is, for many of us, not much of any thought at all. The world is more frenetic and chaotic than ever before, but in the process, we have traded a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in this world for an incessant deluge of media. Odell wants us to take that imbalance and level it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For her, that means practicing a more sustained form of attention. That’s a skill most of us have little practice with (a deficit we may not even be aware of, ironically), and indeed, sustaining attention might even mean regularly refusing to engage with the world around us. That’s a good thing in her analysis. “At their loftiest, such refusals can signify the individual capacity for self-directed action against the abiding flow; at the very least, they interrupt the monotony of the everyday.”</p>
<p>Controlling our attention, directing it, and filtering out the noise of contemporary life results not in further atomization and narcissism, but rather a more collective sense of being. “When the pattern of your attention has changed, you render your reality differently. You begin to move and act in a different kind of world,” she writes. Suddenly, the trees and flowers that were once backdrops to our walks to brunch become complex and elegant life in their own right. We deepen our camaraderie with our friends and colleagues in ways that we never could with an emoji in Slack. We build up the potential to work together to solve problems.</p>

	</p>
<p>Our sustained attention also allows us to notice the details of what is changing around us, the subtle variations of our environment that come from a warming planet. “Things like the American obsession with individualism, customized filter bubbles, and personal branding—anything that insists on atomized, competing individuals striving in parallel, never touching—does the same violence to human society as a dam does to a watershed.” We can’t fix what we don’t see, and with our fragmented attention, we really don’t see much.</p>
<p>The irony of course is that while technology products dissolve attention — building them takes an extraordinary amount of it. While some startup founders strike it rich on a whim and others are injected with product ideas from friends or VCs, the vast majority learned to sustain their attention on a market or customer for sometimes extraordinarily long periods of time in order to notice the gaps in a market. A founder recently told me that he had been working with customers in his market for more than a decade before he eventually understood a need that wasn’t being fulfilled with existing solutions.</p>
<p>What’s missing in the tech and startup community today is connecting that user empathy and focus on product-market fit to the attention we need in all the other aspects of our lives today. Odell analyzes it a bit more negatively than I would: we actually have these skills and in fact, use them quite specifically. We just don’t use them broadly enough to bring our minds to look at our friendships, communities and planet in a deeper light.</p>
<p>Doing nothing allows us to see what matters and what doesn’t. When it comes to solving big problems, particularly some of the most intractable like climate change, it’s precisely doing nothing that allows us to see the right path to doing something.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bill Gates has solved many problems in his (professional) life, and in recent decades, he’s been dedicated to the plight of the world’s poor and particularly their health. Through his foundation work and charitable giving, he’s roamed the world solving problems from malaria and neglected tropical diseases to maternal health, always with an eye toward the novel and typically cheap solution.</p>
<p>It’s that engineering brain and mode of thinking that he brings to bear on climate change in his book “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the <i>Breakthroughs We Need</i>” (yes, it’s italicized on the cover — we really do need them). Gates describes a bit of his evolution from software mogul to global health wizard to concerned climate citizen. If you look at challenges like neglected tropical diseases, for instance, climate change abundantly affects the prevalence of mosquitos and other vectors for infection. No one can avoid climate change when analyzing food security in developing nations.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2195135" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg?w=465" alt="" width="465" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg 1752w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg?resize=103,150 103w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg?resize=205,300 205w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg?resize=768,1122 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg?resize=465,680 465w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg?resize=1051,1536 1051w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg?resize=1402,2048 1402w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg?resize=34,50 34w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" /></p>
<p>With this early narrative, Gates is attempting to connect perhaps not with climate change skeptics (it’s hard to connect with them on a good day anyway), but instead to build a bridge to the skeptical-but-ready-to-rethink crowd. He admits that he didn’t think much of the problem until he saw its effects first hand, opening the door to at least some readers who may be ready to undertake a similar intellectual journey.</p>
<p>From there, Gates delivers an extremely sober (one could easily substitute dry) analysis of the major components of greenhouse gas emissions and how we get to net zero by removing 51 billion tons of CO2-equivalent emissions per year, which in chapter order are energy production (27%), manufacturing (31%), agriculture (19%), transportation (16%), and air conditioning (7%).</p>
<p>Gates is an engineer, and it shows and it is marvelous. He places a great emphasis throughout the book on understanding scale, of constantly trying to disentangle the numbers and units we hear about in the press and actually trying to understand whether a particular innovation might make any difference whatsoever. Gates offers the example of an aviation program that will save “17 million tons” of CO2, but points out that the figure is really just 0.03% of global emissions and isn’t necessarily likely to scale up more than it already has. With this framing, he’s borrowing the approach of effective altruism, or the idea that charitable dollars should flow to the projects that can provide the biggest verifiable improvement to quality of life for the least cost.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Gates is a capitalist, and his framework for judging each potential solution is to calculate a “Green Premium” for their use. For instance, a carbon-free cement manufacturing process might cost double the more normal carbon-emitting one. Compare those added costs with the actual savings these substitutions would have on greenhouse gas emissions, and voila: you have an instant guide on the most efficient means to solving climate change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The answer he comes up with tends to be quite portable in the end. Electrify everything, decarbonize electricity, carbon capture what’s left, and be more efficient. If that sounds hard, that’s because it is, and Gates notes the challenges in an aptly-named chapter entitled “This Will Be Hard” which begins with the line “Please don’t let the title of this chapter depress you.” I’m not sure you needed to buy the book to figure that out.</p>
<p>Gates ends up being an end-to-end conservative figure throughout the book. It’s not just his general approach of protecting the status quo, which is obviously latent in solutions which are essentially substitutable tweaks to our way of life and shouldn’t be surprising given the messenger. It’s also the surprising conservatism of his views on the power of technology to solve these problems. For a person who has quite literally invested billions in clean energy and other green technologies, there is surprisingly little magic that Gates proposes. It’s probably realistic, but considering the source, it can feel like pessimism.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Read in concert with some of the other books in this group of climate change reviews, and one can’t help but feel a sort of calculated naiveté on the part of Gates, a sense that we should just keep playing our cards a little while longer and see if we get a last-minute royal flush. There are early signs of solutions, but most aren’t ready for scale. Some technologies are already available, but would require prodigious outlays to retrofit cars, homes, businesses, and more to actually impact our emissions numbers. Then there’s everyone outside of the West, who deserve access to modern amenities. It’s all so easy, and yet, so out of reach.</p>
<p>The book’s strengths — and simultaneously its weaknesses — is that it is apolitical, fact-laden and ready to be read by all but the most ardent climate change skeptics. But it also acts as a gateway drug of sorts: once you understand the scales of the problem, the scopes of the solutions, and the challenges of Green Premiums and policy implementation, you’re left with the feeling that there is no way we are going to do this in the next few years anyway, so what’s really the point?</p>
<p>Gates ends the book by saying that “We should spend the next decade focusing on the technologies, policies, and market structures that will put us on the path to eliminating greenhouse gases by 2050.” He’s not wrong, but it’s also an evergreen comment, in a world that won’t be evergreen for much longer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Books on climate change, as diverse as the library is, tend to fall into a couple of categories. There are the field guides and observational accounts that chronicle the destruction of our world and make it legible for readers worldwide. There are the policy and tech analyses that splay out options for the future, deliberating tradeoffs and offering guidance to individuals and governments on their decisions. There are the histories that look at missed opportunities, and the geological histories that show what our world was really like over the eons.</p>
<p>Then there’s the much darker category of dystopia.</p>
<p>Dystopic visions of the future are engaging precisely because they are visions. That makes them easy fodder for climate fiction (“cli-fi”) novels or even video games like Final Fantasy VII, a stream of work that has accelerated much in the way that carbon has in the atmosphere. Yet, it’s a field that almost uniquely remains focused on the imagination, of “what if” scenarios and running those contexts to their narrative conclusions.</p>
<p>What makes “How Everything Can Collapse: A Manual for our Times” a rare read is that it is both dystopic and non-fiction.</p>
<p>The book, which was translated into English last year and first published in French in 2015, argues for a hard acceptance of what the authors Pablo Servigne and Raphaël Stevens dub “collapsology.” Less a movement like the Extinction Rebellion and Deep Adaptation communities that have risen up in the Anglophone world, collapsology is centered around a multi-disciplinary and systematic inquiry into the state of our world, our civilization, and our society.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2195144" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-Everything-Can-Collapse.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-Everything-Can-Collapse.jpg 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-Everything-Can-Collapse.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-Everything-Can-Collapse.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-Everything-Can-Collapse.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>In this, they spurn the American frame of progress and technological advancement to solve challenges, as well as humanity’s innate hopeful desire to see a better world going forward. Instead, they want to understand what’s really happening today, and whether the stresses, shocks, and crises that smash into our consciousness on a regular basis are really just a mirage or a phenomenon far more profound.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It shouldn’t be hard to glean what their answer is. Servigne and Stevens walk through earth systems like energy and food production and more as they scout for tipping points, physical limits, and the other impassable barriers to society’s exponential development. What they find is troubling, of course. Exponential human population growth over more than a century has led to practically insatiable demand for every resource and alimentation that the planet has in stock.</p>
<p>That’s a story many of us are familiar with, but where it gets interesting is when they start to systematically explore what that demand has done for efficiency. Perhaps the most striking example they offered was the history of petroleum and Energy Return on Energy Invested, or the amount of oil and gas it takes to drill for that very resource. ERoEI, they note, has declined from 35:1 in 1990 to a factor today of about 11:1. Fuel is getting harder to find — and that means we use more fuel to drill for less fuel. It’s a negative feedback loop — and worse, an exponential one — and there’s little reason to expect these trends to reverse.</p>
<p>These sorts of negative feedback loops are everywhere in earth systems today if you look closely for them. The permafrost is melting in the Arctic, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/14/amazon-rainforest-now-emitting-more-co2-than-it-absorbs">Amazon rainforest today emits more carbon dioxide than it absorbs</a>, higher temperatures are making it more difficult and more expensive to grow food. All this at a time when the human population is expected to add several billion more individuals this century.</p>
<p>As with any system, there are lock-ins where components can’t adapt because they are connected to other systems. We can’t replace gas because the entire financial and industrial system is predicated on an abundant and relatively affordable form of energy. We could try to limit the use of automobiles and trucks, but few people (in the West at least) live anywhere near the farms or mining sites where the key sustaining goods of our society come from. Those ears of corn and bags of potatoes are going to have to travel to us, or we to them, but either way, traveling is going to take place.</p>
<p>In the authors’ collective minds, collapsology is about coming to terms with the reality of the systems all around us and just reading the dials. It’s about accepting tipping points, discontinuities, and other non-linear paths in these systems and projecting what they mean for our own lives and those of others. It’s a call to reality, rather than a call to arms. Just look, the authors practically say.</p>
<p>While the first half of the book is mostly centered around exploring systems and how they inter-connect, the second half of the work explores us as humans, and debating collapsology as a phenomenon. Is it too negative? Why do we have psychological barriers that prevent us from seeing the fragility of our ecosystems and our planet? How will art and movies and books adapt to our new context? How are we going to respond to the challenges that are about to confront us in a much more visceral way? The answers — when they are available — are interesting if not always novel.</p>

	</p>
<p>It’s fascinating to see a bit of a cultural counterpoint to the American sensibility. In some ways, collapsology is just the latest manifestation of French existentialism, updated for the twenty-first century. The book doesn’t provide solutions, nor does it necessarily argue that progress must happen or even that it could happen. Instead, it just observes the human condition, and the conditions around humans. Humans are diverse, and they are going to react to the cataclysm in the diverse ways one would come to expect.</p>
<p>The book offers no solution and paints a dreary future that’s just on the cusp of dystopia. But the title is fascinating, since it posits a conditional rather than an assurance. The world “can collapse” not that it “will collapse.” A reader will be forgiven for thinking the latter is the case the book is making, but ultimately, Servigne and Stevens believe that the only way to avoid collapse is to fully see the world in all its complexity. Collapsology then is really anti-collapsology, or deeply understanding the brittleness of our systems before the limits are reached. That’s a refreshingly intellectual point of view, if not necessary a salve to the fears we read and see and feel every day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The climate is finally hitting a climax. Decades of discussions and reports by scientists have yielded pathbreaking works by writers like Elizabeth Kolbert, and today, climate fiction and non-fiction are even becoming global bestselling works. Everyone wants to read about collapse, dystopia, the aftermath — it’s in the very air we breathe after all, what with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/following-the-ipccs-report-we-need-more-technology-to-respond-to-more-disasters/">the IPCC just reporting once again</a> that all numbers point hotter, redder, and closer to us than ever.</p>
<p>The shelves of climate change books extend ever farther, and yet, one can’t help but feel that not much is changing about such a dynamic topic. There are always more details to unravel of course: another species that’s meeting the end of its precarious existence, a river that no longer flows, a town losing its last sparks of civilization. Yet, we know the tropes and the typical plots at this point (or just deny any of it is happening so it doesn’t matter anyway). The most challenging problem on the Earth today is, frankly, getting a bit repetitive.</p>
<p>The upshot is that there are still original works, works that push the edges of our understanding, reformulate some of the old tropes, and can deliver a forceful punch that unmoors our thinking and forces us to confront the familiar destruction with a new empathy.</p>
<p>I wanted to find the most intriguing books for engineers and technologists who are interested in more systematic ways for understanding what is happening to our planet. Not so much on point solutions (although we have one book on that), but rather books that can develop our thinking about <i>how</i> to understand the changes that are by now inevitably coming.</p>
<p>And so, I picked out and reviewed six books that I think represent a strong canon by which to develop our intuitions about climate change, not just as an environmental problem, but as an economic, social, and personal one as well. They range from systems-thinking analyses and prototypical non-fiction to personal reflections and an atmospheric novel. Each in its own way can help us come to terms with what will be the most challenging collective mission in our lives.</p>

		Ilyes Kacher is a data scientist at <a href="https://www.autoretouch.com/">autoRetouch</a>, an AI-powered platform for bulk-editing product images online.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">I’m a native French data scientist who cut his teeth as a research engineer in computer vision in Japan and later in my home country. Yet I’m writing from an unlikely computer vision hub: Stuttgart, Germany.</p>
<p>But I’m not working on German car technology, as one would expect. Instead, I found an incredible opportunity mid-pandemic in one of the most unexpected places: An ecommerce-focused, AI-driven, image-editing startup in Stuttgart focused on automating the digital imaging process across all retail products.</p>
<p>My experience in Japan taught me the difficulty of moving to a foreign country for work. In Japan, having a point of entry with a professional network can often be necessary. However, Europe has an advantage here thanks to its many accessible cities. Cities like Paris, London, and Berlin often offer diverse job opportunities while being known as hubs for some specialties.</p>
<p>While there has been an uptick in fully remote jobs thanks to the pandemic, extending the scope of your job search will provide more opportunities that match your interest.</p>
<h2>Search for value in unlikely places, like retail</h2>
<p>I’m working at the technology spin-off of a luxury retailer, applying my expertise to product images. Approaching it from a data scientist’s point of view, I immediately recognized the value of a novel application for a very large and established industry like retail.</p>
<p>Europe has some of the most storied retail brands in the world — especially for apparel and footwear. That rich experience provides an opportunity to work with billions of products and trillions of dollars in revenue that imaging technology can be applied to. The advantage of retail companies is a constant flow of images to process that provides a playing ground to generate revenue and possibly make an AI company profitable.</p>
<p>Another potential avenue to explore are independent divisions typically within an R&amp;D department. I found a significant number of AI startups working on a segment that isn’t profitable, simply due to the cost of research and the resulting revenue from very niche clients.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Companies with data are companies with revenue potential</h2>
<p>I was particularly attracted to this startup because of the potential access to data. Data by itself is quite expensive and a number of companies end up working with a finite set. Look for companies that directly engage at the B2B or B2C level, especially retail or digital platforms that affect front-end user interface.</p>
<p>Leveraging such customer engagement data benefits everyone. You can apply it towards further research and development on other solutions within the category, and your company can then work with other verticals on solving their pain points.</p>
<p>It also means there’s massive potential for revenue gains the more cross-segments of an audience the brand affects. My advice is to look for companies with data already stored in a manageable system for easy access. Such a system will be beneficial for research and development.</p>
<p>The challenge is that many companies haven’t yet introduced such a system, or they don’t have someone with the skills to properly utilize it. If you finding a company isn’t willing to share deep insights during the courtship process or they haven’t implemented it, look at the opportunity to introduce such data-focused offerings.</p>
<h2>In Europe, the best bets involve creating automation processes</h2>
<p>I have a sweet spot for early-stage companies that give you the opportunity to create processes and core systems. The company I work for was still in its early days when I started, and it was working towards creating scalable technology for a specific industry. The questions that the team was tasked with solving were already being solved, but there were numerous processes that still had to be put into place to solve a myriad of other issues.</p>
<p>Our year-long efforts to automate bulk image editing taught me that as long as the AI you’re building learns to run independently across multiple variables simultaneously (multiple images and workflows), you’re developing a technology that does what established brands haven’t been able to do. In Europe, there are very few companies doing this and they are hungry for talent who can.</p>
<p>So don’t be afraid of a little culture shock and take the leap.</p>
