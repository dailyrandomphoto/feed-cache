										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Megvii, one of China&#8217;s largest facial recognition startups, is gearing up for an initial public offering in Shanghai. The company is working with CITIC Securities to prepare for its planned listing, according to an <a href="http://www.csrc.gov.cn/pub/beijing/bjfdqyxx/bjfdqyjbqk/202101/P020210112533742962617.pdf">announcement</a> posted by the China Securities Regulatory Commission on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The move came more than a year after Megvii, known for its computer vision platform Face++, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/megvii-the-chinese-startup-unicorn-known-for-facial-recognition-tech-files-to-go-public-in-hong-kong/">filed to go public</a> in Hong Kong in August 2019. At the time, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-megvii-ipo/chinese-ai-start-up-megvii-files-for-hong-kong-ipo-of-at-least-500-million-idUSKCN1VG05I">reported</a> that the company could raise between $500 million and $1 billion. However, the firm&#8217;s IPO application in Hong Kong has lapsed for undisclosed reasons and its focus is now on Shanghai&#8217;s STAR board, a person with knowledge of the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In 2019, China established the STAR board to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/china-new-tech-board/">attract high-growth, unprofitable Chinese tech startups</a> after losing them to the U.S. for years. In the meantime, a domestic flotation is increasingly appealing to Chinese firms, especially those that count on government contracts and are caught in the U.S.-China tech competition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Megvii and its rivals SenseTime, Yitu, and CloudWalk are collectively recognized as the &#8220;Four AI Dragons&#8221; of China for their market dominance and fundings from highflying investors. Megvii&#8217;s technology can be found powering smart city infrastructure across China as well as many smartphones and mobile apps. Alibaba, Ant Group and the Bank of China are among the group of investors who have pumped about <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/megvii-technology">$1.4 billion</a> into the ten-year-old company since its inception.</p>
<p>The AI Dragons are less celebrated outside their home market. Last year, Megvii, Yitu and SenseTime <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/eight-chinese-tech-firms-placed-on-u-s-entity-list-for-their-role-in-human-rights-violations-against-muslim-minority-groups/">were added to the U.S. Entity List</a> for their alleged roles in enabling the government&#8217;s mass surveillance of the Muslim minority groups in western China. CloudWalk was subsequently added to the blacklist in 2020 and cut off from its U.S. suppliers.</p>
<p>According to the notice posted by China&#8217;s securities authority, Megvii plans to issue <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/china-wants-its-tech-firms-back-are-cdrs-the-answer-quicktake?sref=gni836kR">Chinese depositary receipts (CDRs)</a>, which are similar to American depositary receipts and allow domestic investors to hold overseas shares. That suggests the Beijing-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/megvii-750-million/">AI unicorn</a> has not ruled out listing outside mainland China.</p>
<p>Currently seeking guidance in the pre-application stage, Megvii&#8217;s planned listing still needs approval from Chinese regulators.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.molotov.tv">Molotov</a> provides an OTT TV streaming service in France with live TV, premium channels, a cloud DVR and on-demand content. While the service has managed to attract 13 million users in France, it has yet to expand to other countries.</p>
<p>Molotov is starting its international expansion this year with a dozen countries on the roadmap. First, the service will be available in seven African countries, starting with Ivory Coast where it’s already live, Senegal in January, Cameroon in February, Burkina Faso in March, Tunisia in April, Guinea and Democratic Republic of Congo after that.</p>
<p>“When it comes to features, the service is more or less the same but content is different,” co-founder and CEO Jean-David Blanc told me. Molotov is betting on local partnerships to launch its service in new countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In today’s case, Molotov is partnering with <a href="https://www.digitalvirgo.com">Digital Virgo</a>, a mobile payments company available in 40 countries. Digital Virgo is handling the relationships with local content owners. Molotov is taking care of operations and the tech stack.</p>
<p>There will be 15 channels at launch, such as Nina TV, Passions TV, Trace Urban, Trace Africa, Trace Urban Africa, Savannah TV, Gametoon, Africanews, Euronews, France24, Trace Sport Stars and DocuBox. Molotov will also grant access to its ad-supported on-demand streaming service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/molotov-launches-free-ad-supported-streaming-service-mango/">Mango</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095287" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095287" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="606" class="size-full wp-image-2095287" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=768,455 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=680,402 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=1536,909 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095287" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Molotov</p></div></p>
<p>In order to support its international expansion plans, the startup had to rework its infrastructure so that it’s more robust — it relies more on cloud hosting and it is partnering with more CDN companies. For instance, the service should work better if you don’t have as much bandwidth as before.</p>
<p>And this is just a start as Molotov is already talking with different B2B partners in Asia, South America and Europe. “Our strategy is that we lean on local players to launch Molotov in new countries,” Blanc said. So you can expect more news on the international front with new countries and new partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Glassdoor just released its annual ranking of the<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Best-Places-to-Work-LST_KQ0,19.htm"> best companies to work for in 2021</a>. We broke out the top 10 tech companies from the list of large businesses (1,000+ employees) as well as from the small to medium-sized business list.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">For the large business list, the rankings are based on employee feedback from companies with more than 1,000 employees. Through Glassdoor, employees rate companies based on things like their CEO, career opportunities, compensation and benefits, culture and values, and work-life balance. To be considered for the large list, each employer needed at least 75 ratings across each of the workplace attributes. For the SMB list, companies needed at least 75 ratings to be considered.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are the top 10 tech companies to work for in the U.S., according to Glassdoor. In parentheses, you&#8217;ll find each company&#8217;s overall ranking on the list of the 100 best companies along with the average employee rating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.yokaiexpress.com/">Yo-Kai Express</a> is known for autonomous restaurant technology for venues like office campuses, malls and hotels. As people continue staying home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is introducing a smart home cooking appliance with multiple functions. Called Takumi, it includes a coffee maker, high induction cooktop and a steamer for sanitizing utensils and baby bottles. Takumi is connected by RFID to an app with preprogrammed recipes, which also sends alert when its water container is running low.</p>
<p>The company is currently <a href="https://livetour.istaging.com/3ed249c2-dceb-4649-9aa8-2697dbd1cb6d?index=1">presenting Takumi</a> at CES’ Taiwan Tech Arena.</p>

<p>If you live in the Bay Area, you might have seen Yo-Kai Express’s Octo-Chef, a vending machine that serves hot noodle dishes (ramen, udon and pho), in venues like the San Francisco International Airport, the Metreon mall in San Francisco and corporate campuses. But the company is adapting as people stay home. In April, it launched a <a href="https://www.yokaiexpress.com/homemealkit">home meal kit delivery service</a> that is now available in all states.</p>
<p>Created for people who want a home-cooked meal but are short on time (and space), the Takumi’s pre-programmed recipes have cooking times of just two to eight minutes. Yo-Kai Express is known for noodle dishes, but the Takumi’s menu will also include rice bowls, dim sum, dumplings and pasta.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The spread of misinformation and fake news online has a dangerous impact on public well-being. Misinformation is difficult to fight, and 73% of Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/09/few-americans-are-confident-in-tech-companies-to-prevent-misuse-of-their-platforms-in-the-2020-election/">surveyed by Pew Research</a> ahead of the presidential election expressed little or no confidence in the ability of major tech companies to keep their platforms from being misused. The open-source <a href="https://vimeo.com/494323381">Starling Framework for Data Integrity </a>was launched to protect the veracity of online content using blockchain technology, creating “birth certificates” for photos and videos and tracking any changes made to them. <a href="https://numbersprotocol.io/">Numbers Protocol</a>, a Taipei, Taiwan-based startup, founded by Startling Framework collaborators, is now commercializing its tech to make it more widely available.</p>
<p>Numbers is currently presenting its blockchain camera, Capture App, <a href="https://livetour.istaging.com/f61536ff-5b81-49fd-ba52-8564c2fb8ad7?index=1">during CES at the Taiwan Tech Arena pavilion</a>. The app is available for download in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/capture/id1536388009">App Store </a>and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.numbersprotocol.capturelite">Google Play</a>.</p>
<p>While journalism, especially citizen journalism, is an obvious use case for Capture App, it can also be used by people who want to prove that they created images that are being shared online. Numbers will add more features to the app, including a video camera.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>All photos taken by the Capture App have their metadata <a href="https://medium.com/numbers-protocol/securing-our-data-with-numbers-starling-capture-54dbad4bedc2">certified and sealed on the blockchain</a> (users can adjust privacy settings if they, for example, don’t want to share their precise location). Then any changes to the photo, including ones made with editing software, are traced and recorded.</p>
<p>Numbers plans to add a video function to the app and create a channel where people can publish certified content, with the goal of changing the information industry, co-founder Tammy Yang told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Before launching Numbers, Yang worked with the Starling Framework, an initiative by Stanford University and <a href="https://sfi.usc.edu/">the USC Shoah Foundation</a>. The Shoah Foundation’s work includes preserving testimonies from survivors of genocide and mass violence and the Starling Framework&#8217;s technology was created to help them safeguard photos and videos. The Starling Framework was also<a href="https://filecoin.io/blog/starling-framework/"> used by Reuters journalists</a> to capture, verify and store photos taken during the U.S. presidential primaries in March. (The Starling Framework’s other collaborators include Filechain, Hala Systems and Protocol Labs).</p>
<p>The Starling Framework worked with the Shoah Foundation and Reuters to integrate its technology into their workflows, since many photojournalists use digital SLRs and programs like Adobe Photoshop. Capture App was created to allow wider access to the same technology.</p>
<p>Fake news and misinformation has created more public awareness of the need to preserve photo integrity, said Yang. While there are other companies that use blockchain tech to protect data and content, Numbers focuses on certifying photos at their point of origin, and then continuing to record any alterations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We focus very much on the camera itself, so at the time the photo is taken, the integrity is already preserved,&#8221; said Yang. &#8220;If content is captured on a camera app and then copied to a content platform, it’s already very difficult to verify its origin. If I take a photo from Facebook and register it on the blockchain, it means nothing. It’s very different if I take a photo with Capture App and immediately create a registration on the blockchain.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As expected, this year’s (virtual) CES has brought with it a new flood of smart home gadgets. The technology has been a major presence over the last several CES events, and with a world stuck at home for the foreseeable future, a lot of this tech has become all the more appealing.</p>
<p>Nobi stands out from the pack, not so much because of any flashy features, but rather a kind of practicality it brings to the table. Created by a Belgian startup of the same name, the ceiling-mounted smart light features motion sensors and infrared detection.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/_lapF6eiWzo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When the user sits up, the top light illuminates. If they stand up to walk, it illuminates the ground. More interestingly, it can detect irregular motions in the user, as well as falls. If the user does the latter, the on-board speaker will ask, “did you fall.”</p>
<p>If the answer is “no,” nothing happens. If the answer is anything else, it will send a notification to a caregiver, which may include a photo, depending on the specific settings. The lamp is currently undergoing a testing period and will be available for sale by year&#8217;s end. Users can buy them outright, or rent them, along with a subscription.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brian Acton is crossing paths again with Facebook. Over more than a decade of building and operating WhatsApp, the company&#8217;s co-founder first competed against and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-buying-whatsapp-for-16b-in-cash-and-stock-plus-3b-in-rsus/?_ga=2.110338893.954111183.1610362407-37075995.1609086401">sold his instant messaging app to the social juggernaut</a>. Only a few years ago he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/13/whatsapp-co-founder-brian-acton-is-leaving-to-start-a-non-profit/">parted ways with the company</a> that made him a billionaire in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/whatsapp-founder-brian-acton-says-facebook-used-him-to-get-its-acquisition-past-eu-regulators/">bitter split over messaging and privacy</a>.</p>
<p>Now Acton says the ongoing outrage over what Facebook has done to the messaging service he helped build is driving people to his latest project &#8212; Signal. Acton, who serves as the executive chairman of the privacy-conscious messaging app&#8217;s holding company, told TechCrunch in an interview that the user base of Signal has “exploded” in recent weeks.</p>
<p>“The smallest of events helped trigger the largest of outcomes,” said Acton on a video call. “We’re also excited that we are having conversations about online privacy and digital safety and people are turning to Signal as the answer to those questions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“It’s a great opportunity for Signal to shine and to give people a choice and alternative. It was a slow burn for three years and then a huge explosion. Now the rocket is going,” he said.</p>
<p>The event Acton is referring to is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/elon-musk-dunks-on-facebook-and-recommends-signal-in-wake-of-u-s-capitol-insurrection-attempt/">recent change</a> in <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/answering-your-questions-about-whatsapps-privacy-policy">data-sharing policy disclosed by WhatsApp</a>, an app that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago/">serves more than 2 billion users</a> worldwide.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical alignnone size-full wp-image-2095451" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-data-sharing-policy-new.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="829" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-data-sharing-policy-new.jpg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-data-sharing-policy-new.jpg?resize=109,150 109w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-data-sharing-policy-new.jpg?resize=217,300 217w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-data-sharing-policy-new.jpg?resize=492,680 492w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-data-sharing-policy-new.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Through an in-app alert, WhatsApp has asked users in recent days to agree to new terms of conditions that grants the app the consent to share their personal data with Facebook. Users will have to agree to these terms by February 8 if they wish to continue using the app, the alert said.</p>
<p>Acton said WhatsApp is grappling with incorporating monetization features while still protecting people’s privacy. And its new “complicated policy” has forced WhatsApp and the media to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-facebook-data-share-notification/">scramble for explanations</a> and “everyone is confused.”</p>
<p>Acton did not disclose how many users Signal has amassed in recent weeks, but he said the app currently ranks at the top on App Store in 40 countries and on Google Play Store in 18 countries. (Signal is not the only app that users have explored in recent days as their new home. Telegram said on Tuesday noon that more than 25 million users had joined the platform in the last 72 hours. The app now has over 525 million monthly active users.)</p>

<p>According to mobile insight firm App Annie, data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch, Signal had about 20 million monthly active users globally at the end of December 2020. According to Sensor Tower, the app was downloaded more than 7.5 million times between January 6 and January 10.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2018, Signal has promised that it won’t sell its users’ data and that it won’t show its users ads. In 2018, Acton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/21/signal-expands-into-the-signal-foundation-with-50m-from-whatsapp-co-founder-brian-acton/">invested $50 million in Signal Foundation</a>, a check that he said helped get the ball rolling. But how does the messaging app plan to stay afloat in the future?</p>
<p>Signal today also relies on donations to bankroll the business &#8212; and more users mean more donors, he said. “If Signal gets to a billion users, that’s a billion donors. All we have to do is get you so excited about Signal that you want to give us a dollar or 50 rupees. The idea is that we want to earn that donation. The only way to earn that donation is building an innovative and delightful product. That’s a better relationship in my opinion,” he said.</p>
<p>Acton said this model has worked for the business, which keeps a small staff of below 50. Between its frugal spending and the foundation&#8217;s largesse, Signal still has some money in the bank.</p>
<p>Signal Foundation has also previously said that messenger is its first product, and like Mozilla and Wikimedia Foundation, it intends to expand to more categories. Acton said in the coming years, the team will take a call on whether they want to work on email and storage products, but he said the current focus remains on the messaging app.</p>
<p>Even as Acton has publicly urged users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/after-selling-his-company-to-facebook-for-19-billion-brian-acton-joins-deletefacebook/">get off Facebook</a>, in our conversation he did not suggest that people should stop using WhatsApp. On the contrary, Acton said he envisions people relying on Signal for conversations with their family and close friends, and using WhatsApp for other chats. &#8220;I have no desire to do all the things that WhatsApp does. My desire is to give people a choice,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Otherwise, you&#8217;re locked into something where you have no choice. It&#8217;s not strictly a winner take-all scenario.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the criticisms that WhatsApp often receives is that it does not do enough to curb the spread of false information on its platform, which has resulted in <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/whatsapp-destroyed-village-lynchings-rainpada-india">real-life casualties</a>. I asked Acton what Signal, which also protects its users&#8217; conversations with end-to-end encryption, would do if people started to use his app for a similar purpose. Acton said it&#8217;s a difficult challenge and while technology and platform have their own share of responsibilities, they can only do so much especially when you can&#8217;t look at the content of the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should be teaching your children good digital responsibility. Don&#8217;t just immediately take the information that you get. Understand its source. Understand who are trusted sources. As a society, teach every member how it works,&#8221; he said, pointing to earlier days of the internet when email scams were rampant and with time and education people learned how to identify them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lime has changed its corporate travel policy to ensure not a dime of its money ends up in the coffers of the Trump Organization&#8217;s hotels and other properties in response to the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol that led to several deaths.</p>
<p>The micromobility startup wants to take that action further and has asked TripActions, the Palo Alto-based corporate travel booking service that it uses, to encourage other customers to do the same. TripActions has not returned emails seeking comment.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Lime asked TripActions to remove Trump properties from showing up in a search if one of its employees is booking corporate travel, according to an internal email written by Lime CEO Wayne Ting and sent to the rest of the staff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&#8220;While some startups have argued that companies should never be political, we have always understood that the work we do here at Lime is inherently political,&#8221; Ting wrote. &#8220;We are speaking out and standing up for what we believe is right because that is the right thing to do. And we are looking for ways to ensure our actions &#8212; and dollars &#8212; don’t support those who are complicit in this attack on our democracy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Lime has not made any political contributions to date, according to the email. (TechCrunch confirmed with Lime that it hasn&#8217;t made any federal political contributions.) Ting wrote that the company will never support any elected <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">official who voted to challenge the certification of the results of the Electoral College. He then went further, extending it to the Trump Organization, a real estate portfolio that includes hotels, golf properties and resorts as well as residential holdings like Trump Tower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&#8220;Moreover, we are committing to never support or spend money at any of the business ventures and affiliates of the Trump and Kushner families,&#8221; Ting wrote. &#8220;In fact, earlier today, we asked TripActions to remove all Trump properties from Lime search results and encouraged them to institute this policy for all of their customers.&#8221;</span></p>
<div dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Here&#8217;s the complete email, which TechCrunch has viewed:<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">I know many of us watched last week’s events in Washington DC in shock and horror. The bedrock of any democracy is the peaceful transfer of power based on the will of the people. It was horrific to see a mob of insurrectionists &#8212; including white supremacists, neo-nazis, and conspiracy theorists &#8212; spurred on by the President, storm the halls of Congress to undermine and overturn that most sacred democratic ritual through violence and intimidation. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The day was made even more disturbing by the stark contrast in police response between last week’s violent riots and last summer’s overwhelmingly peaceful protests for racial justice. If the rioters last week had been black and brown and held high the flag of Black Lives Matter instead of Donald Trump and the Confederacy, would they have been allowed to overrun the Capitol, ransacked offices, and walked back out the front door in their own volition? The unfortunate thing is the answer is self-evident.  </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">As more information became available over the last few days, it’s also clear that President Trump and certain Members of Congress still do not comprehend the gravity of their offenses, show appropriate remorse for inciting such unbelievable violence, or commit to ensure they never happen again. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">While some startups have argued that companies should never be political, we have always understood that the work we do here at Lime is inherently political. We are speaking out and standing up for what we believe is right because that is the right thing to do. And we are looking for ways to ensure our actions &#8212; and dollars &#8212; don’t support those who are complicit in this attack on our democracy.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">We signed on to <a href="https://pfnyc.org/news/new-york-business-leaders-issue-statement-to-certify-electoral-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pfnyc.org/news/new-york-business-leaders-issue-statement-to-certify-electoral-vote/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610548332691000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHVwv1sWUxC9SXo4l6C0n0QPZY9ig">PFNYC’s letter</a> calling for Congress to certify the results of the Presidential election ahead of the unrest. And while we have not made political donations to date, we are committing now to never support any elected official who voted to challenge the certification of the results of the Electoral College. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Moreover, we are committing to never support or spend money at any of the business ventures and affiliates of the Trump and Kushner families. In fact, earlier today, we asked TripActions to remove all Trump properties from Lime search results and encouraged them to institute this policy for all of their customers.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Regulatory action prompts Visa to back off a fintech acquisition, Uber and Moderna partner and Checkout.com is valued at $15 billion. This is your Daily Crunch for January 12, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Visa calls off Plaid acquisition</strong></p>
<p>The deal, valued at $5.3 billion, was first announced just over a year ago. However, the Department of Justice <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/doj-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visas-5-3-billion-acquisition-of-plaid/">filed suit to block the acquisition</a> in November, arguing that it would &#8220;eliminate a nascent competitive threat.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In today&#8217;s announcement, Visa said it could still have made things work, but the threat of &#8220;protracted and complex litigation&#8221; ultimately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">prompted it to call things off</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The year of the first-ever all-virtual CES is, unsurprisingly, the year of the virtual gym. The past 12 months have seen most of our fitness routines completely transformed &#8212; speaking for myself, my Apple Watch step count shows two big empty spots where March and April are.</p>
<p>Fitness startups have seen unexpected windfall in all of this. In June, Lululemon announced plans to acquire Mirror for $500 million, while competitors like Tonal saw a 7x increase in sales for the year. In December, Apple launched Fitness+, its own on-demand service designed to take on the Pelotons of the world.</p>
<p>It’s hard to shake the feeling that we’re starting to see a streaming service-style land rush on the fitness side of things. It’s a massive industry, of course, and odds are things will never return exactly to “normal” in the wake of all of this, but unlike movie services, it’s hard to imagine people subscribing to more than one at a time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uyPBzLp7UX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/lululemon-set-to-acquire-home-fitness-startup-mirror-for-500m/">Lululemon set to acquire home fitness startup Mirror for $500M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lululemon set to acquire home fitness startup Mirror for $500M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/lululemon-set-to-acquire-home-fitness-startup-mirror-for-500m/embed/#?secret=uyPBzLp7UX" data-secret="uyPBzLp7UX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Perhaps the biggest name to enter the market thus far at CES is Samsung. The electronics giant announced Smart Trainer, an addition to its growing line of fitness-focused apps. The system is designed specially for Samsung’s Smart TVs, using a webcam to track exercises. On that front, at least, it seems to be a bit more in-depth than Apple’s Watch-only tracking, which relies on an accelerometer and heart-rate monitor for feedback. Like Fitness+, it will employ trainers to lead exercises, including workout celebrity Jillian Michaels.</p>
<p>Ultrahuman is another major fitness video platform making its debut this week. The startup recently closed an $8 million round. Like Fitness+, its biotracking is built around the Apple Watch, showcasing heart rate and calories burned, among other metrics. The service compares its offering to a “masterclass” for fitness.</p>
<p>Partners include leading athletes and celebrities like Crossfit champion Kara Saunders, fitness celebrity Amanda Cerny, coach Johannes Bartl, hybrid athlete and coach Kris Gethin and MindSize CEO Christian Straka to name a few. Available on iOS and Android devices, the app also integrates biofeedback via its Apple Watch integration to measure and improve the efficacy of meditation and workouts. Compared to Calm and Headspace&#8217;s celebrity content approach, Ultrahuman uses a technology platform-based approach to improve experience and long-term results.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PG9spLbhpH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/fitness-wont-replace-the-gym-but-it-will-help-you-break-a-sweat/">It won’t replace the gym, but Fitness+ will help you break a sweat</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;It won’t replace the gym, but Fitness+ will help you break a sweat&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/fitness-wont-replace-the-gym-but-it-will-help-you-break-a-sweat/embed/#?secret=PG9spLbhpH" data-secret="PG9spLbhpH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>These services set themselves apart from the likes of Mirror, Peloton and new offerings from the likes of NordicTrack, in that these technologies ditch the heavy exercise equipment, lowering the barrier of entry (though I suppose Samsung’s does require a big, expensive TV). The fact is that demand will decrease when people feel more comfortable going to the gym. That will certainly shake out the industry to a certain extent.</p>
<p>For many people, however, once the secrets of home fitness have been unlocked, they may never want to visit the gym again.</p>

In a wide-ranging conversation yesterday [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://future.ventures/">Future Ventures</a> &#8212; cofounded by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson and Maryanna Saenko, a colleague of Jurvetson at his last firm, DFJ, as well as an investor previously with Airbus Ventures and Khosla Ventures &#8212; has closed its second fund with $200 million in capital commitments, say the pair.</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging conversation yesterday afternoon, Jurvetson characterized the fund as &#8220;dramatically oversubscribed in a fairly short period of time,&#8221; adding that roughly one-third of its investors are venture capitalists or other investors, that the &#8220;second largest bucket [comprises] tech executives, CEOs, and former CEOs of enormous companies of relevance to our ecosystem&#8221; and that the last third of the firm&#8217;s capital is coming from institutions, including one university endowment. (He didn&#8217;t specify which.)</p>
<p>As with Future&#8217;s $200 million debut fund, which closed two years ago, the outfit&#8217;s newest vehicle has a 15-year time horizon, giving it more leeway to make longer-term bets. Jurvetson also confirmed that as with that debut fund, Future features fairly standard economics, including charging 2.5% in management fees and 25% in so-called carried interest (meaning the share of the profits that Future keeps from its investments).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We tell our LPs, &#8216;Look, this is a long game, these companies take longer than five to seven years to come to full maturity,'&#8221; said Jurvetson, who has been on the board of SpaceX since 2009 and, along with<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/business/tesla-directors-resign.html"> three other directors</a>, left the board of Tesla in September, following a 13-year run as a director. &#8220;They may go public in that timeframe. But as you can see with Tesla and SpaceX and some of the greatest tech stories of our day, you really would regret having feel pressured to punch out early when they&#8217;re really in the greatest phases of torrid growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Future&#8217;s new fund could have been bigger. Jurvetson has been doing business with Elon Musk for more than 20 years, and beyond his early involvement with SpaceX and Tesla, Future participated in the first round of Musk&#8217;s tunnel-based transportation system, Boring Company.</p>
<p>The firm also wrote the first check to Musk&#8217;s neurotechnology startup, Neuralink, which last summer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/take-a-closer-look-at-elon-musks-neuralink-surgical-robot/">unveiled its progress</a> toward developing implantable brain-computer interfaces that include thousands of electrodes that Musk helps will eventually help to cure conditions like Alzheimer’s and dementia, among other things.</p>
<p>Though SpaceX is now an 18-year-old company, Future has a stake in that business, too. In fact, Future&#8217;s first check went to Space X, and the firm last year raised a $100 million SpaceX SPV (special purpose vehicle) in just five days &#8212; capital that Saenko said came from most of the fund&#8217;s investors, who were given the option of participating if they wanted.</p>
<p>These pop-up type funds won&#8217;t happen routinely, according to Jurvetson. &#8220;We communicated in our fundraising that a special situation, maybe two, would occur where we do a later-stage, large check, single investment in a company we have immense conviction in, and we didn&#8217;t anticipate that to happen right away, but the opportunity to reopen the prior year&#8217;s round [in SpaceX] and join an extension of that close made it very tempting to do on behalf of the fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>The broader plan is to continue committing smaller amounts to startups &#8212; $3.8 million on average &#8212; and for that funding to be the first that the teams raise. Future intends to invest in roughly 20 companies altogether from the new fund &#8212; as with the last &#8212; and to take a more relaxed view on board seats than might other firms.</p>
<p>Part of that owes to necessity, suggests Saenko, noting that she and Jurvetson only have so much bandwidth. But she also said she could &#8220;not think of a single situation where we&#8217;re not fully in the information flow of the company&#8221; even without a director role, which is often why VCs insist on one.</p>
<p>In the meantime, well beyond its Musk-related bets, Future has been assembling a portfolio that&#8217;s wide-ranging, with investments tied to cellular manufacturing, longevity, and edge AI, among other things.</p>
<p>It just led a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/sensei-gets-uma-thurman-tesla-board-member-as-investors">follow-on round</a> in <a href="https://senseibio.com/">Sensei Biotherapeutics</a>, a 21-year-old, Boston-based developer of personalized cancer drugs that&#8217;s planning a public offering this year and which uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage">bacteriophage</a> to induce an adaptive immune response.</p>
<p>Future &#8212; which is also investor in the lab-grown meat producer <a href="https://www.memphismeats.com/">Memphis Meats</a> &#8212; is also very focused right now on regenerative agriculture and permaculture, which is an approach to land management that adopts arrangements observed in flourishing natural ecosystems.</p>
<p>Said Saenko, &#8220;I think it would behoove all of us to look at our food industry and ask what are the ways in which we are currently feeding our global population that are unsustainable in the future, given the number of people that we have and are going to continue having on this planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>What doesn&#8217;t interest the pair remotely are other trends sweeping the venture industry right now, from space investing to moving from California.</p>
<p>On space investing, Jurvetson &#8212; who led DFJ&#8217;s investment in both SpaceX and the satellite company Planet &#8212; said it&#8217;s far too crowded now (&#8220;though I&#8217;m going to be a space tourist one day for sure&#8221;).</p>
<p>As for moving &#8212; as Musk did recently to Austin &#8212; Saenko isn&#8217;t going anywhere, she said. Neither is Jurvetson, who spent 12 years in Texas, including in high school, and has no interest in returning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sadly,&#8221; he said yesterday, &#8220;many of my friends have punched out and gone to Texas or Florida.&#8221; He berates them for it, too, he said, explaining: &#8220;If you become wealthy enough as an investor or an entrepreneur such that you could choose to live anywhere you want in your life, why in the world would you pick up and go to some godforsaken place now? Just to avoid capital gains tax? How about, for example, donate to charity instead and avoid that capital gains tax?&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a &#8220;different way to look at the world rather than just trying to do wealth transfer and preservation across generations,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That just feels so short-sighted to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t even get them started on the blank-check companies that have come into vogue as a path for more automotive companies in particular to become publicly traded. For example, Lucid Motors, the California EV startup that gave up majority ownership to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund last year in exchange for $1.3 billion, is reportedly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/lucid-motors-said-to-be-in-talks-to-list-via-michael-klein-spac">in talks to go public</a> through a merger with one of the special purpose acquisition vehicles of Wall Street veteran Michael Klein.</p>
<p>Faraday Future, another electric vehicle startup, is <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/faraday-future-spac-targeting-3-billion-public-debut-electric-vehicles-2021-1-1029956718">reportedly looking to go public</a> via a merger with a separate SPAC sponsor.</p>
<p>Asked what Future Ventures makes of the trend, Jurvetson &#8212; who experienced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/confirmed-six-months-after-leaving-dfj-steve-jurvetson-is-starting-new-venture-firm/">high-profile split</a> from DFJ in 2017 (DFJ has continued on as <a href="https://dfjgrowth.com/">DFJ Growth</a>) &#8212;  did not mince words about the electric vehicle category especially. &#8220;It would be really refreshing if a decent company was included in the mix, but it is just a rogue&#8217;s gallery of horrific companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mostly, he continued, &#8220;these are companies that are unable to raise a penny from any other source&#8221; at this point in their trajectory.</p>
<p>Saenko was more diplomatic if no more optimistic about some of the related deals being struck right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not saying that every SPAC company is a terrible company,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think what we&#8217;re saying is that everyone should be very wary of these companies because of Steve&#8217;s point that they&#8217;re early-stage companies and the SPAC is solely a fundraising system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Public market investors &#8220;expect a particular level of maturity and progress and meaningful forecasting from the companies that are on the public markets,&#8221; she added, &#8220;and that&#8217;s just not going to be true of the vast majority of the companies that have gone through SPACs. And that could have a potentially terrible blowback on the entire tech industry.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Visa and Plaid called off their agreement this afternoon, ending the consumer credit giant&#8217;s takeover of the data-focused fintech API startup.</p>
<p>The deal, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/">valued at $5.3 billion at the time of its announcement</a>, first broke cover on January 13, 2020, or nearly one year ago to the day. However, the Department of Justice <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/doj-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visas-5-3-billion-acquisition-of-plaid/">filed suit to block the deal in November of 2020</a>, arguing that the combination would &#8220;eliminate a nascent competitive threat that would likely result in substantial savings and more innovative online debit services for merchants and consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time Visa argued that the government&#8217;s point of view was &#8220;flawed.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, today the two companies confirmed the deal is officially off. In <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112006080/en/Visa-and-Plaid-Announce-Mutual-Termination-of-Merger-Agreement">a release</a> Visa wrote that it could have eventually executed the deal, but that &#8220;protracted and complex litigation&#8221; would take lots of time to sort out.</p>
<p>It all got too hard, in other words.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Plaid&#8217;s Zach Perret: &#8216;Every company is a fintech company&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/plaids-zach-perret-every-company-is-a-fintech-company/embed/#?secret=RFLE9k44VS" data-secret="RFLE9k44VS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Plaid was a bit more upbeat in its own notes, writing that in the last year it has seen &#8220;an unprecedented uptick in demand for the services powered by Plaid.&#8221; Given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/fintechs-savings-and-investing-boom-isnt-just-a-domestic-affair/">the fintech boom that 2020 saw</a>, as consumers flocked to free stock trading apps and neobanks, that Plaid saw growth last year is not surprising. After all, Plaid&#8217;s product sits between consumers and fintech companies, so if those parties were executing more transactions, the API startup likely saw more demand for its own offerings.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to Plaid for comment on its plans as an independent company, also asking how quickly it grew during 2020. <em><strong>Update: </strong>Plaid responded to TechCrunch noting that it saw 60% customer growth in 2020, bringing it to more than 4,000 clients. If we presume even moderate net dollar retention amongst its customer base, Plaid could have grown by triple-digits last year, in percentage terms.</em></p>
<p>While the Visa-Plaid deal was merely a single transaction, its scuttling doesn&#8217;t bode well for other fintech startups and unicorns that might have eyed an exit to a wealthy incumbent. The Department of Justice, in other words, may have undercut the chances of M&amp;A exits for a number of fintech-focused startups or at least created more skittishness around that possible exit path.</p>
<p>If so, expected exit valuations for fintech upstarts could fall. And that could ding both fintech-focused venture capital activity, and the price at which startups in the niche can raise funds. If the Visa-Plaid deal was a huge boon to fintech companies that used it as a signpost to help raise money at new, higher valuations, the inverse may also prove true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sono Motors wants to bring technology it developed for its solar electric car to the masses. And it&#8217;s starting with autonomous shuttle startup EasyMile.</p>
<p>The German-based startup said Tuesday during a presentation at the virtual 2021 CES tech trade show that it will license its solar body panel technology to other companies. EasyMile, which provides electric autonomous shuttle buses to governments, universities and other companies, will be the first to integrate the solar body panels onto its vehicles, according to Sono Motors co-founder and CEO Laurin Hahn, who made the announcement after the company&#8217;s next-generation Sion solar electric car was revealed.</p>
<p>From afar, the Sono Motors&#8217; electric Sion vehicle looks like a compact car with black paint. Upon closer inspection, the entire exterior of the vehicle is actually comprised of hundreds of solar cells that have been integrated into polymer instead of glass.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This makes them <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">lighter, robust, cheaper and more efficient than any other technology available at the present in the markets, according to Arun Ramakrishnan, senior solar integration manager at Sono Motors, who added that they can be integrated into almost any object. </span></p>
<p>The solar body panels are lightweight — comparable to traditional body panels on today&#8217;s modern cars — and the polymer coating prevents the cells from splintering, the company said.</p>
<p>These solar cells convert sunlight into energy, which is stored in the vehicle&#8217;s battery. The solar cells, which work if a vehicle is driving or parked, can add up nearly 21.7 miles of range per day on the Sion car, the company said, noting that these stats are based on average weather in Munich.</p>
<p>The aim is to make vehicles less dependent on charging infrastructure, Hahn said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095384" style="width: 2800px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-1.57.31-PM.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095384" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2095384 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-1.57.31-PM.jpg" alt="Sono Motors" width="2790" height="1576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-1.57.31-PM.jpg 2790w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-1.57.31-PM.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-1.57.31-PM.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-1.57.31-PM.jpg?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-1.57.31-PM.jpg?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-1.57.31-PM.jpg?resize=1536,868 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-1.57.31-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1157 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-1.57.31-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2790px) 100vw, 2790px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095384" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sono Motors/screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>The solar body panels aren&#8217;t designed to replace traditional charging methods. However, it can reduce how often the vehicle needs to be plugged in. Sono Motors noted that the solar integration in the Sion car extends the need to plug in from once a week to every four weeks, stats based on an average daily commute in Germany of 10 miles.</p>
<p>Sono Motors showed Tuesday a trailer outfitted with the solar body panels, just one use case for the technology. The trailer, which is just a prototype, is capable of generating up to 80 kilowatt hours per day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just imagine the massive potential,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Ramakrishnan said, noting that the tech could be used by </span>refrigerated trucks or other fleets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.techstars.com/">Techstars</a>, a network of startup accelerators and a venture capital fund, announced that <a href="https://twitter.com/maellegavet?lang=en">Maëlle Gavet</a> is its new CEO. Former CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrown?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">David Brown</a> will stay on Techstars&#8217; board, while the group&#8217;s other co-founder, <a href="https://twitter.com/davidcohen?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">David Cohen</a>, will become the chairman of its board.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Gavet this morning about her new job, the timing of the change, the company&#8217;s plans for expansion and her goals in the role.</p>
<p>Gavet, who said she was brought aboard to help Techstars grow, detailed her work experience at prior roles in companies of greater scale and multiple geographies, including Compass and Booking.com.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch was curious how large the startup market is, and how much space is left in different geographies and niches for Techstars and others to expand into. Gavet said that she had asked the same question to Techstars when she was being recruited for her new role. She said there is a wealth of overlooked talent and underinvested geographies that could be empowered and unlocked with capital and help. Techstars wants to go find those founders and invest in them. <em><strong>Update:</strong> The language in this paragraph was edited after publication for clarity.</em></p>
<p>That means, we presume, more accelerators in more places investing in more founders.</p>
<p>Gavet told TechCrunch that Techstars has invested in over 2,300 companies and is putting capital into around 500 yearly.</p>
<p>The new CEO explained that she believes it is possible to generate strong returns for her investors while providing lots of support for entrepreneurs and having a positive social impact. That&#8217;s an ambitious list of things to execute at once, but if she succeeds her effort could help diversify the world of tech entrepreneurs, something that has long been needed.</p>
<p>Seeing a startup exchange leaders to optimize for different, and larger-scale, operating experience is not rare. For a meta-startup, an accelerator-and-investing concern, to do the same is not surprising.</p>
<p>TechCrunch regularly covers accelerator cohorts, including Techstars (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/five-favorite-techstars-startups-ahead-of-its-next-rush-of-demo-days/">some recent</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/10-favorite-startups-from-techstars-october-2020-class/">notes here</a>) and Y Combinator, among other programs. Some of tech&#8217;s biggest names have come out of such accelerator groups, historically, including Airbnb (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">now public</a>) from<a href="https://twitter.com/mwseibel?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"> Michael Seibel</a>-led <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>, TalkDesk (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/talkdesk-series-c--500e9b13">worth over $3 billion</a>) from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinesltsai/">Christine Tsai</a>-led <a href="https://500.co/">500 Startups</a>, and Techstars&#8217; own SendGrid (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/twilio-acquires-email-api-platform-sendgrid-for-2-billion-in-stock/">bought by Twilio for $2 billion</a>).</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see where Techstars takes its accelerator model next &#8212; the group sometimes partners with companies, or groups like the United States Air Force to sponsor and support tailored programs &#8212; in terms of location and focus. But if it can successfully help diversify the founder pool at the same time as making itself money, it will underscore how others in its market could do better.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">While the initial shock of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided for businesses, one of its main legacies is how it ushered in a tidal wave of accelerated digital transformation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/covid-19-digital-engagement-report">A recent Twilio survey</a> revealed that 97% of global enterprise decision-makers believe the pandemic sped up their company’s digital transformation, and on top of that, 79% of the respondents said that COVID-19 increased the budget for digital transformation.</p>
<p>As technology becomes the driving force of competitive differentiation, cloud plays a key role in making this a reality and impacts everything from data and analytics to the modern workplace. Cloud-based infrastructure promises more flexibility, scale and cost-effectiveness, as well as enables enterprises to have more agile application development and keep up with service demand.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			What’s clear is that despite shortfalls in security, innovation in cloud and infrastructure will charge ahead.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Even with all of the hype and excitement around cloud’s potential, it is still early days. In his recent keynote at AWS re:Invent, the <a href="https://www.informationweek.com/cloud/andy-jassy-speed-is-not-preordained-its-a-choice/d/d-id/1339571?">AWS CEO Andy Jassy mentioned</a> that spending on cloud computing is still only 4% of the overall IT market. And <a href="https://twitter.com/jaminball/status/1318675611557056512">a Barclays CIO survey</a> found that enterprises have 30% of their workloads running in the public cloud, with the expectation to increase to 39% in 2021.</p>
<p>It’s become clear that the movement to cloud has its barriers and that large enterprises are often skittish to make the jump. <a href="https://info.flexera.com/SLO-CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud-2020">Flexera’s State of the Cloud 2020 report</a> outlined some of these top cloud challenges, citing security as #1. This has been widely apparent in conversations that I’ve had with Fortune 500 CISOs and security teams, who are wary of the shift from their current state of security operations. Some of the major concerns brought up include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No longer your own master. When working with the public cloud providers, companies must relinquish control to some aspects of back-end management. This is tough for large enterprises who have a history of customizing products because you can’t completely tailor the environment to your liking and are limited to what’s on the cloud service provider’s platform.</li>
<li>Lack of standardization. Each cloud provider has their own solutions and own intricacies. Add to that other pitfalls, like an unknown cadence of updates, there is an opaqueness to interoperability and policies can’t be uniformly applied across environments.</li>
<li>Requires a new skill set. Lack of resources/expertise ranks among the top challenges for enterprises.<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/86-of-it-decision-makers-believe-shortage-of-talent-will-slow-down-2020-cloud-projects-301004464.html"> A recent report on challenges in cloud transformation</a> found that 86% of IT decision-makers believe shortage of talent will slow down 2020 cloud projects.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://youandmrjones.com">You &amp; Mr. Jones</a> announced today that it has added $60 million in new funding from Merian Chrysalis, bringing <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-mr-jones-valued-at-1-3-billion-brandtech-company-says-11575977400">the Series B round </a>announced in December to a total of $260 million.</p>
<p>The round values the company at $1.36 billion, post-money.</p>
<p>You &amp; Mr. Jones takes its name from CEO David Jones, who founded the company in 2015. After having served as the CEO of ad giant Havas, Jones told me that his goal in starting what he called &#8220;a brand tech group&#8221; was to provide marketers with something that neither traditional agencies nor technology companies could give them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;At that moment, the choices were to go work with an agency group, which is great at brand and marketing, but they don’t understand tech, or with a tech company, which will only ever recommend their platform and don&#8217;t have the same [brand and marketing] expertise,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>So You &amp; Mr. Jones has built its own technology platform to help marketers with their digital, mobile and e-commerce needs, while also investing in companies like Pinterest and Niantic. And it makes acquisitions — last year, for example, <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2020/08/06/you-mr-jones-elevates-influencer-offering-with-acquisition-collectively">it bought influencer marketing company Collectively</a>.</p>

<p>You &amp; Mr. Jones has grown to 3,000 employees, and its clients include Unilever, Accenture, Google, Adidas, Marriott and Microsoft. In fact, Jones said that as of the third quarter of 2020, its net revenue had grown 27% year over year.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s particularly impressive given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/5-vcs-agree-the-pandemic-has-reshaped-adtech-and-martech/">the impact of the pandemic on ad spending</a>, but Jones said that&#8217;s one of the key distinctions between digital advertising and the broader brand tech category, which he said has grown steadily, even during the pandemic, and which also sets the company apart from agencies that are &#8220;digital and tech in press release only.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not an ad agency, we&#8217;ll never acquire agencies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have the technology platform, process and people to deliver all of your end-to-end, always-on content — social, digital, e-commerce and community management.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the funding, the company is announcing that it has hired Paulette Forte, who was previously senior director of human services at the NBA, as its first chief people officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;The brand tech category didn’t even exist before You &amp; Mr Jones was established,&#8221; Forte said in a statement. &#8220;The company became a true industry disruptor in short order, and growth has been swift. In order to keep up with the momentum, it’s critical to have systems in place that help talent develop their skills, encourage diversity and creativity, and find pathways to improving workflow. I am excited to join the leadership team to drive this crucial work forward.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Because streaming services only release viewership numbers selectively, and because each one uses its own methodology, it can be hard to compare the popularity of different streaming shows and movies.</p>
<p>So Nielsen, which provides the standard ratings for traditional TV (and is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/nielsen-one/">working to combine those ratings with streaming data</a>), is offering some apples-to-apples comparison today at CES by releasing its own lists of the most popular streaming content in 2020, across Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+ and Hulu.</p>
<p>These lists are limited to U.S. viewership. Unlike Nielsen&#8217;s linear ratings, they don&#8217;t just reflect the total number of people watching, but focus instead on the total number of minutes watched. That also makes for a striking contrast with the ratings that Netflix releases, which count the number of households who watched at least two minutes of a program, but don&#8217;t distinguish between someone who watches two minutes versus two hours versus 20 hours.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, the TV series lists are absolutely dominated by Netflix, while Disney+ puts in a good showing on the movies list. The other services don&#8217;t crack any of the three Top 10 lists.</p>
<p>On the original series side, the surprising winner (at least, surprising to me) was Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Ozark,&#8221; with 30.5 billion minutes streamed, followed by &#8220;Lucifer&#8221; (19 billion minutes) and &#8220;The Crown&#8221; (16.3 billion minutes). &#8220;Tiger King,&#8221; which seems like one of the defining hits of the pandemic, came in at number four, with 15.7 billion minutes streamed — though Nielsen&#8217;s methodology puts it at a disadvantage, since it only has eight episodes. The same could probably be said for &#8220;The Mandalorian,&#8221; the first non-Netflix series on the list, with 14.5 billion minutes streamed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095331" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095331" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2095331" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0.jpg?w=680" alt="Nielsen 2020 list" width="680" height="376" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0.jpg 1895w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=1536,849 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095331" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nielsen</p></div></p>
<p>The numbers were even bigger for acquired series — all of them streaming on Netflix last year, although the number one show, &#8220;The Office&#8221; (57.1 billion minutes streamed) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216867/peacock-office-subscription-streaming-ad-free-premium-plus-netflix">just moved to Peacock</a>. The other shows in the top five are &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy&#8221; (39.4 billon minutes), &#8220;Criminal Minds&#8221; (35.4 billion minutes), &#8220;NCIS&#8221; (28.1 billion minutes) and &#8220;Schitt&#8217;s Creek&#8221; (23.8 billion minutes).</p>
<p>On the movie side, the biggest title was &#8220;Frozen II,&#8221; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/14/homebound-parents-rejoice-disney-is-releasing-frozen-2-on-its-streamer-on-sunday/">came early to Disney+</a> and was streamed for 14.9 billion minutes, followed by &#8220;Moana&#8221; (Disney+, 10.5 billion minutes), &#8220;The Secret Life of Pets 2&#8221; (Netflix, 9.1 billion minutes), &#8220;Onward&#8221; (Disney+, 8.4 billion minutes) and &#8220;Dr. Seuss&#8217; The Grinch&#8221; (6.2 billion minutes). This seems to be a category where family films have advantage, perhaps because kids are more likely to watch them multiple times.</p>
<p>Beyond releasing these lists, Nielsen is announcing a new product designed to measure viewership of theatrical video on-demand, aka movies that are released for rent or purchase online. While studios should already have access to basic purchase data for these titles, Nielsen says it can provide &#8220;the entire media food chain&#8221; with more detailed information about things like the age, gender, ethnicity and geographic territory of who&#8217;s watching.</p>
<p>In a statement, Nielsen&#8217;s general manager of audience measurement Scott N. Brown said:</p>
<blockquote><p>As this unprecedented pandemic continues to influence consumer behavior, perhaps even through a prolonged state of recovery waves, being able to measure and help clients appropriately monetize new revenue streams has never been more crucial. A bigger question might be what will audiences do following any recovery, how the behavior adopted during stay-at-home orders might influence habits when consumers have the ability to go back to theaters to enjoy that experience and how content creators will leverage data to make the best decisions regarding distribution platforms in the future.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Outdoor cooking industry leader and famed kettle-grill-maker Weber has acquired June, the smart cooking startup founded in 2013 by Matt Van Horn and Nikhil Bhogal. While financial terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed, Weber has confirmed that June will continue to operate as its own brand wholly owned by Weber-Stephen Products and will continue to both sell and develop the June Oven and related products. Meanwhile, June co-founder Nikhil Bhogal will take on a role as SVP of Technology and Connected Devices across the Weber lineup.</p>
<p>Weber had already teamed up with June, with the startup providing the technology and expertise behind its Weber Connect smart grilling platform. That includes both the Weber Connect Smart Grilling Hub, which adds connected smart grill features to any grill, and the built-in smart cooking features on its SmokeFire line of wood pellet grills. That partnership began with a cold email Van Horn received in 2018 from then-Weber CEO and current Executive Chairman Jim Stephen, the son of the company&#8217;s original founder.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said he was a fan, he was a customer, and he couldn&#8217;t imagine a future without June technology powering every product in the Weber collection,&#8221; Van Horn told me in an interview. &#8220;I said, &#8216;Slow down — what are you talking about? Yeah, who are you?&#8217; And he said &#8216;I&#8217;m flying out, I&#8217;ll be there Monday.&#8217; &#8221; I normally have my nice demo setup that I do, I&#8217;ll do like chocolate lava cake and a steak [in the June Oven]. So I got there about 15 minutes early to do that, and [Jim] was already sitting in the front steps of the office, ready to open the door for me — he&#8217;s like, &#8216;I don&#8217;t need a demo, I own this.&#8217; &#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;His energy and ability to see things often before other people, it blew my mind,&#8221; Van Horn continued. &#8220;Soon after I met Chris [Scherzinger, Weber&#8217;s current chief executive], who was joining as CEO and [I] was able to experience firsthand this, honestly very surprising and wonderful culture of this historic Weber brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>As mentioned, June became a partner to Weber and powered the connected cooking platform it debuted at CES last year. Weber also led June&#8217;s Series C funding round, a previously undisclosed final round of financing that Weber led in 2018 prior to this exit.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;June’s third-gen smart oven goes up for pre-order, starting at $599&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/junes-third-get-smart-goes-up-for-pre-order-starting-at-599/embed/#?secret=PCq3f9MF5D" data-secret="PCq3f9MF5D" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Van Horn will act as president of June under the terms of the new arrangement and will continue to lead development of its current and future products. He said that Weber&#8217;s ability to help them with international scale and distribution via their existing global footprint was a big motivating factor in why June chose to join the now 63-year-old company. But another key ingredient was just how much Weber proved to be a place where the company&#8217;s culture was still centered on customer focus and a love of food.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously why Nikhil and I started June was that we love food, and we love cooking,&#8221; Van Horn said. &#8220;And a lot of the principles of how we think about how products get made are a lot of Apple&#8217;s principles — a large percentage of the June team comes from Apple. We&#8217;ve obviously kind of brought that to a microscale with our small 60-person startup. But being able to work with this very eager Weber team, that&#8217;s just been really exciting from the start and has been pretty incredible.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Weber, the company gains a software and technology team that was born out of the idea of approaching cooking from a tech-first perspective — and they intend to infuse that expertise throughout their product lineup, with an eye toward building on their legacy of quality and customer enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you infuse the software engineering, the connected product design and the machine-intelligence expertise that you have, you get these core competencies or capabilities, but that really undersells it,&#8221; Scherzinger told me. &#8220;Matt put together a team of superstars, and we just got a first-round draft pick [in June] that takes the Weber game to another level. That allows us to accelerate a significant number of initiatives, and you can expect to see an expansion of what Weber Connect can become in terms of new experiences for consumers, new services and new products, for sure, starting as early as 2021 and 2022.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Weber and June are not sharing specifics around the deal, as mentioned, Scherzinger did mention that &#8220;Matt and his team and his investors all did handsomely.&#8221; June&#8217;s prior investors include Amazon Alexa Fund, Lerer Hippeau, First Round Capital, Promus Ventures, Industry Ventures, Eclipse Ventures and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cannabis has always been essential to some. While it had seemed to start last year in a bit of a correction, demand for it during the pandemic (and its widespread designation as an essential business), created a breakthrough for the industry. We saw early signs of that in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/where-these-6-top-vcs-are-investing-in-cannabis/">cannabis investor survey back in May of 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Today, TechCrunch has surveyed five key investors who touch different aspects of the cannabis business, based on our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/the-techcrunch-list/?verticals=576769646">TechCrunch List</a> of top investors who founders recommend to us, and other sources. We asked these investors the same six questions, and each provided similar thoughts, but different approaches. Despite remaining headwinds, the future is looking up for most cannabis businesses, according to these investors.</p>
<p>Morgan Paxhia, managing director of Poseidon Investment Management, put it this way: &#8220;2021 could be nothing short of amazing for our industry. We expect capital flows to pick up massively from pent-up demand, good public markets bringing more IPOs, lots of M&amp;A and new innovative startups coming on scene. We see opportunity with social equity for the first time, driven by private markets rather than poorly constructed regulations. It&#8217;s going to be fun!&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>2020 was a blockbuster year for cannabis. What advice are you giving your portfolio companies entering 2021?</strong></p>
<p>Typical mantra for us, stay focused. Markets, deals and valuations are volatile in our industry but we all have to do our best to tune out the noise and focus. I&#8217;d say a great example of a team with focus is GTI. They have executed against a strategy while many of their supposed peers have done very irrational deals, impaired shareholder value, etc. GTI continues to march down its path and their results are showing.</p>
<p><strong>How is COVID-19 changing the cannabis landscape?</strong></p>
<p>2020 was an inward-facing year as most companies could not travel, capital was tight and macro was uncertain. This inward work has led to a lot of fundamental improvements for operators. There are others that got one last puff of wind but their businesses are too impaired and will continue to fall to the wayside.</p>
<p>2021 could be nothing short of amazing for our industry. We expect capital flows to pick up massively from pent-up demand, good public markets bringing more IPOs, lots of M&amp;A and new innovative startups coming on scene. We see opportunity with social equity for the first time, driven by private markets rather than poorly constructed regulations. It&#8217;s going to be fun!</p>
<p><strong>From retail to SaaS to research, there&#8217;s a lot of inroads to investing in cannabis. What sector of the business do you see has the best opportunity for growth in 2021?</strong></p>
<p>We are bullish on select state markets. For example, new adult-use markets in NJ and AZ and existing markets with new growth prospects opening in CA and NY.</p>
<p>SaaS could get very interesting as there are several players reaching scale that are garnering mainstream attention.<br />
International opportunity is mostly Mexico. It is the largest federally legal market that will just be opening in 2021. Many have not taken this one seriously but we have and are very proud of the efforts that went to moving such a monumental step forward.</p>
<p><strong>The history of drug enforcement in the United States has been deeply unjust and racist; as we enter a period of growing legalization, are there things that startups and investors can do to address that inequity?</strong></p>
<p>The industry, meaning established companies, entrepreneurs and investors need to drive solutions here. Regulations have been terrible and only exacerbate the issue. We have been putting a lot of thought into this area for years, watching various aspects such as the missteps taken by government and the unfortunate poor intentions from supposed investors.</p>
<p>We see a path emerging here that is collaborative, simple and should be attractive to capital providers. Stay tuned.</p>
<p><strong>Who are some leaders in the cannabis space &#8212; companies, founders, growers?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My sister Emily is a co-founder and rock star! She is a true leader in this space on so many levels.</li>
<li>Ahmer Iqbal, CEO of Sublime — Ahmer took the role at a very challenging time and with very little capital was able to rebuild the company into a leader in the CA market.</li>
<li>Jason Wild — Not only is he a savvy investor, he puts his money where his mouth is. Outside of Poseidon, I do not know any other person in this industry that puts up so much of their own money into what they believe in.</li>
<li>Coleman Beale, CEO of Bastcore — If you are not familiar with the industrial hemp renaissance in the U.S., look no further. This technology-driven hemp-processing company is rejuvenating textiles in the U.S., using domestically grown hemp and processing for uses in such textiles as denim.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer online shopping habits have led to a windfall of revenues for these web storefronts, but COVID-era trends have also breathed new life into the market for developer tools that help e-commerce sites operate more smoothly for shoppers.</p>
<p>LA-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/nacelle-raises-4-8m-for-its-headless-e-commerce-platform/">Nacelle</a> is one of many e-commerce infrastructure startups to earn attention from investors amid COVID.</p>
<p>The web services company helps streamline the backends of e-commerce websites with a so-called &#8220;headless&#8221; platform that shifts how the front end of websites interact with content in the back end. The startup claims its tech can boost performance, promote better scalability, cut down on hosting costs and offer developers a more streamlined experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nacelle has closed an $18 million Series A led by Inovia with participation from Accomplice, Index Ventures, High Alpha, Silas Capital and Lerer Hippeau. The company just closed a $4.8 million seed round in mid-2020, the speedy pace of their Series A&#8217;s close seems to speak to the investor enthusiasm that has deepened around companies operating in the e-commerce world.</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;It’s not secret that commerce has done well during COVID,&#8221; CEO Brian Anderson tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Not only did we get this subtle structural change with COVID that I believe is long-lasting, but merchants have been focusing more on performance.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">One of the startup&#8217;s central points of focus has been ensuring that they can bring customers onboard its platform without causing undue headaches. It can be &#8220;very painful to migrate data&#8221; with other services, Anderson says. The company&#8217;s service is &#8220;anti-rip-and-replace,&#8221; meaning potential </span>customers can integrate &#8220;without having to be rebuild their stores.&#8221;</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s customer base is largely made up of small- to medium-sized e-commerce sites. Nacelle works closely with agencies for customer referrals, also tapping on Anderson&#8217;s past contacts from his days running a Shopify Plus agency.</p>
<p>This past August, data from IBM’s U.S. Retail Index suggested that pandemic trends had accelerated the consumer shift from primarily visiting to physical stores to shopping on e-commerce storefronts by roughly five years.</p>
