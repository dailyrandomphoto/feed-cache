										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The sales process can be chaotic, with data flowing in from a variety of sources and a number of people involved. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Salesforce bought Slack</a> for more than $27 billion last year because it recognized it could be the glue that holds this together. <a href="https://momentum.io/">Momentum</a>, an early-stage startup, wants to build on that relationship by being the automated collaboration layer between sales and the rest of the organization.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $5 million seed round led by Basis Set Ventures with participation from Inovia Capital, Leadout Capital, South Park Commons and a group of industry angels.</p>
<p>Momentum CEO and co-founder Santiago Suarez Ordoñez said the company originally wanted to build a deal room on top of Slack, but when Salesforce took that route in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/after-spending-28b-salesforce-announces-first-direct-integrations-with-slack/">its first round of Slack integrations</a> in August, the company decided to attack a different problem.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232111" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s interesting, and I think this is what ultimately differentiates us from what Salesforce could put together, is as we went down that path of deal rooms and collaboration and we delivered value there, we started realizing that collaboration and sales can be so much more,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said the founders recognized that salespeople need to connect not only to Slack and Salesforce &#8212; they need to connect with tools like Google Calendar, Asana and Jira, and automate follow-ups from a single place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Momentum ended up turning into a platform that allowed those people to streamline that process. Instead of going into Jira and knowing [how to] file a ticket for my security team, I just go to Momentum and raise my hand and I say &#8216;I need a security review,&#8217; and Momentum has codified the process of finding where to go, creating the ticket, sharing all the context about the deal in that ticket for the rep, and the rep doesn&#8217;t have to do anything at that point,&#8221; Suarez Ordoñez explained.</p>
<p>He said that while they still have the deal-room functionality along with this task-driven capability, the plan is to build on that to create a complete platform of similar automated workflows inside Slack, such as getting approval for a discount rate or asking for engineering support for a sale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company just hired its 14th employee since closing the seed round in August. The company has a diverse founding team that includes Suarez Ordoñez&#8217;s wife &#8212; COO Ashley Wilson &#8212; and CTO Moiz Virani. The company said it takes building a diverse team extremely seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually have a mandate from the top to drive diversity and inclusion,&#8221; Suarez Ordoñez said. &#8220;In fact, one of our investors made it a term in their investment and it ended up being what made us go in with them and make room for them in our round as an investor.&#8221; He added that half the board is female at this early stage and that two of the three investor partners in the round are women.</p>
<p>They launched the company last year amid the heart of the pandemic. &#8220;One of the craziest things about it is that we already had half a dozen employees and customers and we had raised millions of dollars and 99% of that work had happened sitting at the kitchen table in my house, which was quite a wild realization of what happened,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is now operating at least part of the time out of shared spaces, but he said that being together makes it feel more real to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that it wasn&#8217;t real half a year ago, [but the fact that] we couldn&#8217;t be together was just just a weird artifact of how the world was working,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My company wants to send one of its employees to India to open an office there. He came to the United States from India as a child on a visa, but he now has DACA status. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can he take on this project and still be able to return to the United States? Will this impact his ability to renew DACA? Are there any other potential repercussions that we should keep in mind?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Devoted to Dreamers</strong></p>
<p>Dear Devoted,</p>
<p>I appreciate that you and your company are supporting Dreamers and providing peace of mind for your employee. My law partner, Anita Koumriqian, and I have worked with many Dreamers to help them obtain and renew DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) so they can attend university and work. Like other immigrants, Dreamers have to work harder to live the American dream, particularly since the DACA program has faced so many challenges in recent years, which Anita and I chatted about on my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/096-daca-in-tech/">podcast</a>.</p>

<h2>Traveling abroad with Advance Parole</h2>
<p>To answer your first question, your employee can travel to India to set up your office there only if he gets what’s called an “Advance Parole” document from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).</p>
<p>Since the U.S. ended its COVID-related travel restrictions from India this week, your employee could probably return to the United States with an approved Advance Parole document, complete COVID-19 vaccination and a negative COVID-19 test. You and your employee should know this comes with some risk.</p>
<p>For Advance Parole, your employee (who already has DACA) would have to file <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-131">Form I-131</a> (Application for Travel Document) to USCIS and receive approval <em>before </em>he leaves for India. USCIS usually takes eight months or more these days to process travel document applications due to pandemic-related backlogs. Advance Parole is basically a travel document that allows DACA recipients living inside the United States to travel abroad temporarily for up to a year and seek to reenter the United States.</p>
<p>At its discretion, USCIS may grant Advance Parole for one of three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educational purposes, such as academic research or a semester-long study abroad program.</li>
<li>Employment purposes, such as overseas projects, conferences, training, interviews or meeting with clients.</li>
<li>Humanitarian purposes, such as to receive medical treatment, visit an ailing relative or attend the funeral of a family member.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our experience, DACA recipients requesting Advance Parole based on employment purposes tends to be more difficult to obtain. USCIS adjudicators seem to be more willing to approve Advance Parole based on humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p>Some things to keep in mind: Your employee should not leave the U.S. before USCIS issues the Advance Parole document, otherwise his departure from the U.S. will automatically terminate his DACA status, his application for Advance Parole will be considered abandoned and he will not be able to reenter the U.S. In addition, he must have a valid passport from his country of citizenship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://evergrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evergrow</a>, a stealth climate fintech startup, just landed over $7 million in seed funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a two-pronged approach, Evergrow aims to be the world’s first dedicated carbon offtake company &#8212; rapidly funding climate developer projects and initiating long-term offtake agreements for these projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the larger seed rounds of 2021 in the industry, the raise was led by XYZ Venture Capital and Congruent Ventures with participation from First Round Capital, Garuda Ventures, MCJ Collective, Skyview Ventures and numerous other individual investors. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232035" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>The problem with climate project financing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are core issues in launching and scaling a successful climate project.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Banks require an offtake contract &#8211; guarantee purchase of carbon credits created by the project &#8211; to underwrite any financing; securing an offtake contract is difficult when a company is young.  </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/key-takeaways-from-the-sosv-climate-tech-summit/?cx_testId=6&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_undefined&amp;cx_artPos=0#cxrecs_s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A VC’s expectation on ROI often clashes with industry standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Multiple stakeholders &#8212; insurance, investors, offtakers, debt investors and the project developer themselves &#8212; create long financing timelines, intensive negotiation and extremely complex underwriting processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, climate risk underwriters and insurers have lacked data to create efficient underwriting processes. Each time a project turns up, there is an entirely new underwriting model developed. Finally, securing an offtake contract is done one-to-one. This means projects without an offtake agreement from the onset will have to pander to buyers after the fact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evergrow founders James Richards and Luke Whiting aim to streamline and standardize this process. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have set the goal internally of supporting the avoidance, reduction or removal of one gigaton of CO2e by 2030; scaling to a billion tons a year shortly there after,&#8221; Richards states.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With CEO Richards’ background as a former Wall Street lawyer, serial entrepreneur and early-stage investor, and Whiting’s data and software experience as former founding COO of Clearbit, Evergrow shows promise in tackling this enormous challenge. The growth of the carbon markets over the past two years suggests the endeavor could be lucrative as the long-term offtake carbon purchase price is set. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Evergrow] can reduce the complexity two ways,&#8221; Richards said. “One, we can do the work upfront to make a programmatic underwriting and funding model for each project type. And second, we can use data and technology to underwrite or do the majority of the heavy lifting and underwriting versus humans. And so our goal internally is to be almost an order of magnitude faster in terms of time to close than a traditional project financial.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked for details on the underwriting structure itself and the capital partners who back them, Richards said, “We aren&#8217;t ready to describe this in detail yet, but we&#8217;re exploring a range of structures with our capital partners to meet their needs. &#8230; We&#8217;re actively building up a base of multiple financial partners.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232041" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232041" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2232041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="163" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png 2760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=1536,837 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=2048,1116 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Evergrow</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Richards did provide insight on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">they will be judging risk. Evergrow will utilize historical data points to predict which sets of projects can be underwritten and how. Standardizing the underwriting process is only possible now because the industry has hit a critical mass of data points and success metrics for carbon projects.</span></p>
<h2>Why long-term offtake contracts matter and how they’ll make money</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many financial institutions won’t consider financing climate projects unless they have a dedicated offtake contract. The risk is considered too great. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By bringing long-term offtake contracts to the carbon markets, we provide price certainty and unlock capital for these projects,” Richards said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/09/15/2297338/0/en/Voluntary-Carbon-Markets-Rocket-in-2021-On-Track-to-Break-1B-for-First-Time.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecosystem Marketplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the voluntary carbon market has “posted a near-60% increase in value from last year … [with] markets on track to hit $1B in transactions by the end of this year.” Judging by the growth rate, long-term offtake contracts could generate a significant amount of returns for Evergrow’s capital partners.</span></p>
<h2>Fragmented competition and market validations</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are multiple players across the different parts Evergrow aims to streamline. Long-term offtake contracts are not new to commodities, though newer in the carbon markets. There is a growing trend among corporations to create long-term offtake contracts with climate projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><a href="https://www.swissre.com/media/news-releases/nr-20210825-swiss-re-climeworks-partnership.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiss Re’s partnership with Climeworks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; valued up to $10 million &#8212; is one of the largest long-term offtake contracts to date. The large insurer and reinsurer </span><a href="https://www.reinsurancene.ws/siriuspoint-strategic-partnership-parameter-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SiriusPint Ltd. partnered with Parameter Climate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides full-service climate underwriting and distribution.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232042" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232042" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2232042 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="144" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png 2574w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png?resize=150,72 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png?resize=300,144 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png?resize=768,368 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png?resize=680,326 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png?resize=1536,736 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png?resize=2048,982 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232042" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Evergrow</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evergrow believes that these companies are signals for market readiness, not necessarily direct competitors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were really pleased to see what Swiss Re did with Climeworks because we think it&#8217;s great validation of the market,” Richards said. “When a balance sheet as large as Swiss Re thinks that it&#8217;s worthwhile to enter this market and provide what we&#8217;re providing, that&#8217;s really great validation. The opportunity has to be measured in the billions in order for Swiss Re to even think about it or care about it. That was great validation for us.”</span></p>
<h2>It’s not a marketplace</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final step after underwriting, funding and signing the offtake agreement is the eventual return to the capital partners. One competitor, Puro.earth, created a carbon removal marketplace simplifying developers’ access to offtakers. When asked about creating one-to-one marketplace similar to this, Richards was quick to clarify. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Evergrow does not match offtake contracts to investors on a deal-by-deal basis,” Richards said. “When you borrow money from Brex, whether on a credit card or working capital line, it&#8217;s not like Brex matches you with an investor on the backend who gets to set the price and you know, say yes or no. Instead, Brex has arranged warehouse financing and more, so Brex can give you that financing immediately. It all gets pooled and then the investors take the pool of return.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The analogy is especially relevant because Brex CFO Michael Tannenbaum is an investor in Evergrow, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re hoping to emulate that kind of a structure, where we raise one or more facilities from the capital markets into which all of our offtake contracts get pooled,” Richards said. “Investors get the benefit of aggregation and pooling and also levered exposure to the underlying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The set price of a long-term offtake agreement allows stability for the developer and financing partners with understandable risk growth. The silver bullet lies in Evergrow’s ability to efficiently underwrite the right products, though without the specifics on the exact underwriting model, it’s tough to fully predict their success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evergrow has a handful of notable individuals investing in the startup &#8212; Bridgewater Associates Sustainability investor Karen Karniol-Tambour, Plaid CEO Zach Perret and Instacart co-founder Max Mullen, among others. Evergrow will start in California and expand to the U.S. with hopes of international expansion depending on the climate project type. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Christopher Male’s son was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in 2018, the long-time investor found himself in unfamiliar territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the time, I literally knew the word ‘autism,’ and that was about it,” he recalls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to help his son, Male immersed himself in the topic and found what he described as an “incredibly fragmented and polarized community and marketplace, inadequate, antiquated solutions with hefty price tags and long wait lines.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231310" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He determined there was “no scientific understanding of what was happening in the marketplace.” In part driven by capitalism but mostly driven by an eagerness to help his child and others like him, Male dove in and, earlier this year, teamed up with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian O&#8217;Callaghan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to found t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he</span><a href="https://autismimpact.fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Autism Impact Fund (AIF)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The fund’s mission is to &#8220;revolutionize the status quo for diagnosing treating and living with autism through a venture-capital model.”  So far, AIF has invested in seven early-stage companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AIF brought</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob Sarrazin </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to serve as its chief investment officer and managing partner. Male and Sarrazin manage the fund’s day-to-day operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need is there. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html#:~:text=About%201%20in%2054%20children%20has%20been%20identified,occur%20in%20all%20racial%2C%20ethnic%2C%20and%20socioeconomic%20groups." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">impacts 1 in 54 children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and millions of families around the world, according to the CDC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We created the Autism Impact Fund with the ambition of becoming the investment and innovation arm of the autism community,” said Male. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is just a massive societal issue with a system that is very, very broken, and our goal is to change that system.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For nearly a decade, Male operated his family’s investment office. He then launched his own venture fund. But he admits there has been no role in his life more important than his current one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AIF has enlisted a high-profile group of advisors, including Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who has</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">twin boys with autism; Jennifer Frist of the Frist Center for Autism &amp; Innovation at Vanderbilt University; and Bob Nelson, co-founder and managing director of ARCH Venture Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Male declined to reveal AIF’s LPs, he </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said they include high net worth institutions and family offices. The fund is actively fundraising so Male could not comment on those plans, other than to say things were going well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The market for us has been quite positive and on track, so we’re further ahead than we thought we would be,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AIF makes direct investments across a variety of sectors, such as biology, environment and behavior, and stages of financing. It is intentionally focused on for-profit companies so that its work doesn’t overlap with nonprofits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not just a group of individuals. We&#8217;re professional investors,” Male said. “We&#8217;re also bringing together the community through academics, government institutions, nonprofits and foundations.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portfolio companies include Axial, which is developing gut-restricted small molecule agents intended for the treatment of core autism symptoms; BioROSA, which is developing a biomarker for autism; Floreo, which provides a range of therapies through an AI-driven virtual reality platform; and Joshin, a digital care platform for people with special needs whose funding TechCrunch </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/minnesota-twins-raise-3m-to-increase-accessibility-to-disability-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently covered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Slattery and Marie Causey founded Boston area startup </span><a href="http://www.biorosa.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BioROSA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is developing a biomarker that aims to detect ASD in children as young as 18 months, in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That would bring down the average age of diagnosis, which is currently four plus years and is very skewed with minority and less affluent populations not doing well with that,” Male told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BioROSA has raised just north of $3 million, including a round in which AIF participated in July. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is strong academic research that supports the thesis that this company is built on,” Slattery said. “Our goal is to allow for early detection, and transform the diagnostic standard of care.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For families with autism, the investments made by AIF could be life-changing &#8212; and you can’t get much more meaningful than that.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://getcacheflow.com/">Cacheflow</a> this morning announced its exit from stealth and a seed round worth $6 million.</p>
<p>The startup is a wager that the software buying experience of today is antiquated &#8212; and a rising source of frustration. So, Cacheflow is building a hybrid buying service and financing solution to make it simpler.</p>
<p>On the money side of things, <a href="https://www.ggvc.com/team/glenn-solomon/">GGV&#8217;s Glenn Solomon</a> led the company&#8217;s seed round, which also saw participation from <a href="https://pelionvp.com/">Pelion Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.neythrifuturesfund.com/">Neythri Futures Fund</a>, a collective of South Asian women looking to change the ratio in venture capital investing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232021" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Cacheflow CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/sarikagarg">Sarika Garg</a> emphasized to TechCrunch the importance of having a diverse cap table in the round, and at her company more broadly. Per Neythri Futures Fund, a slim quarter of a percent of U.S. venture partners are South Asian women, meaning that getting the group onto the Cacheflow ownership docket early could provide material upside to the investor demographic if the company succeeds.</p>
<p>Thematically, Cacheflow&#8217;s market wager makes sense. According to Garg, companies are no longer buying software in long procurement cycles that involve golf and dinners. Correct. And modern corporations are buying more discrete pieces of software than ever before. Also correct. But, almost oddly, although companies need more software, the selling process is still somewhat manual, with myriad phone calls and documents and e-signatures. Anyone who has friends working in SaaS sales can confirm this.</p>
<p>With most companies wanting to sell yearly contracts with upfront payments for cash flow reasons, SaaS sales can prove oddly rigid in the modern era, when you&#8217;d expect more flexibility. To attack that issue, Cacheflow wants to offer buyers a number of payment options while also providing upfront cash to software companies.</p>
<p>Cacheflow will let customers choose to pay for their software contract monthly, quarterly or even on a deferred basis. This may help customers buy software even when they have exhausted a particular budget cycle, Garg said. And that means that software concerns can sell more consistently without having to wait for yearly budgets to reset late in the year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regarding the risk that Cacheflow will take on regarding non-payment of a contract &#8212; if the company allows a software customer to defer payment on a yearly contract while also paying the provider upfront, there&#8217;s risk inherent &#8212; Garg said that her company can peer into a customer firm&#8217;s SaaS metrics and properly take into account the chance of customer infidelity.</p>
<p>I presume that the startup will get better at that work as it grows its customer base. Today Cacheflow has a few pilot customers, with intentions to bolster its roster in the coming months. It&#8217;s just coming out of stealth, mind, so it&#8217;s still early days on an operating basis.</p>
<p>Checkout technologies in general have had a big few quarters, with names <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/checkout-com-raises-450-million-and-reaches-15-billion-valuation/">like Checkout.com,</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/fast-raises-102m-as-the-online-checkout-wars-continue-to-attract-huge-investment/"> Fast</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/bolt-adds-75m-to-its-series-c-as-the-battle-to-rule-online-checkout-continues/">Bolt raising oodles of boodle</a>. And we&#8217;ve seen SaaS financing services also scale rapidly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/">like Pipe</a>. Cacheflow is a little bit of both.</p>
<p>Cacheflow thinks that it can make the SaaS buying process more flexible &#8212; and faster. That could mean better sales results for software companies and simpler procurement for software customers. Given the growing bulk of the software market more generally, the goals make sense. From here, it&#8217;s up to Cacheflow to prove that it can embed its software into a great number of SaaS checkout processes and generate material top line from its labors.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. This is our Wednesday show, the time of the week when we niche down to a single topic. Today we spoke about the revolution within agriculture otherwise known as <strong>vertical farming</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> spoke to Hardware editor <a href="http://twitter.com/bheater">Brian Heater</a>, who recently wrote a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1/">TC-1 about Bowery Farming </a>spanning over 11,000 words and topics such as the taste of sustainable turnips and produce sections at grocery stores. The core of his multi-part exploration, though, was built around a question: Can Bowery Farms bring the newest and most innovative technologies to bear on civilization’s oldest and most optimized industry?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231506" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As a result, our episode went down a lot of tasty rabbit holes. We spoke about the current state of vertical farming, the challenges that come with commercialization and our struggling climate, and if your local dairy farm is actually thinking about adding a robot to their staff.</p>
<p>There was more to chew on, including the balance between sustainability and profit, how to think about carbon footprints, the commercialization of vertical farming today, and how some folks are spending $30 on a strawberry. We had lovely time and will have Brian back on the pod.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the TC-1 if you&#8217;re interested:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-origin/">Bowery Farming is forcing us all to look up at the future of vertical agriculture </a>(3,500 words/14 minutes) — explores the evolution of vertical farming, it’s expansion in Japan and how Bowery Farming was started to bring indoor farming to the masses in the United States.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-produce/">Hacking lettuce for taste and profit</a> (2,500 words/10 minutes) — evaluates how Bowery collects data from its farms in order to optimize flavor while also potentially expanding its produce line into new categories like strawberries and turnips.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-technology/">Can LEDs ultimately replace the sun?</a> (2,100 words/8 minutes) — investigates two of the most important questions about Bowery Farming: Can it develop a competitive moat with its technology (which it dubs BoweryOS) and just how much environmental benefit can the company derive from its farms?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-competition/">The voracious fight for your salad bowl </a>(3,000 words/12 minutes) — looks at the extremely competitive nature of the produce section at the grocery store and how Bowery intends to build a brand with consumers while finding a route to profitability.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/a-chat-with-the-author-of-the-vertical-farm/">An Interview with the author of The Vertical Farm</a> — A bonus conversation with Dickson Despommier, frequently credited as the creator vertical farming in its modern context.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Equity team will be back Friday morning with our weekly roundup. Our hearts go out to Mary Ann who will return to us in due time, and our general ire is reserved for Danny. Because we are still smarting from his divorcing of us for Lux.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter and ViacomCBS today announced a sizable global deal that will see the social media platform streaming digital content from across the ViacomCBS portfolio of news, sports, and entertainment brands &#8212; including content from live events, TV shows, and other franchises. In addition, ViacomCBS-owned streaming service Paramount+ will host three &#8220;Twitter Watch Parties&#8221; designed to capitalize on Twitter&#8217;s ability to serve as a second screen and a home to fan communities and conversations.</p>
<p>The companies did not specify which Paramount+ shows would be hosted as Watch Parties, only noting that they would be original series.</p>
<p>The content partnership represents a significant expansion of Twitter&#8217;s prior deal with the media giant. Before, Twitter&#8217;s deal had been a U.S.-only partnership with just Viacom, ahead of the ViacomCBS merger. The renewed agreement is now a multi-year, global deal and expands to include the entire ViacomCBS portfolio. That means it also now includes news and sports, instead of only entertainment properties, as before. The companies declined to detail the financial terms, however.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232046" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The ViacomCBS umbrella today cover a wide range of brands, such as BET, CBS Television Network, CBS News, CBS Sports, Channel 5, CMT, Comedy Central, MTV, Network 10, Nickelodeon, Paramount Network, and Telefe.</p>
<p>In recent months, Twitter and ViacomCBS have partnered on select live events, including the 2021 MTV Music Video Awards, which aired its live pre-show on Twitter, and the BET Awards, which live-streamed from the red carpet to Twitter. It&#8217;s likely that under the new agreement, Twitter users will gain continued access to these types of events. As for which other properties and programs will be featured on Twitter in the months ahead, ViacomCBS would not say.</p>
<p>While the new agreement is focused on hosting digital content, it will also involve Twitter&#8217;s marketing support. The ViacomCBS programs will be eligible for both marketing support and brand sponsorship sales through Twitter&#8217;s Amplify program, which connects ViacomCBS&#8217; video with Twitter&#8217;s paid reach and targeting, the company said. ViacomCBS will also leverage other marketing features around live video, real-time highlights, and Twitter Moments.</p>
<p>Twitter in previous years had heavily focused on its ability to serve live video content to its users, by doing things like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/15/twitter-now-puts-live-broadcasts-at-the-top-of-your-timeline/">pinning live video to the top of the Timeline</a>, offering live-streamed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/01/twitter-announces-new-live-shows-from-the-wnba-buzzfeed-live-nation-and-more/">events</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/01/twitter-stream-concerts/">concerts</a>, and more. But over time, news of those types of partnerships dwindled. Twitter even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/periscope-will-shut-down-by-march-twitter-confirms/">shut down</a> its own live-streaming app Periscope to focus more on its new set of social features, like Fleets, Spaces, Communities, Super Follows, and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Twitter is again doing deals to make digital content a part of its core offering. In early 2021, for example,<a href="https://together.nbcuni.com/news/nbcu-twitter-expand-digital-content-partnership/"> NBCUniversal and Twitter announced</a> their own global, multi-year partnership, similar to this with ViacomCBS.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re thrilled to extend our long-standing relationship with Twitter in this expansive global deal that brings together the full ViacomCBS portfolio and magnifies the scale and scope of our valued partnership,&#8221; said Andrea Wolinetz, SVP, Distribution &amp; Business Development-Streaming at ViacomCBS, in a statement. &#8220;Twitter is the digital water cooler for trending topics and fandom worldwide, and we’re excited to provide front-row access to innovative digital content experiences and culture-defining moments across the best of entertainment, news and sports for Twitter users everywhere.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Crypto giveth, and crypto confuseth the heck out of Wall Street.</p>
<p>In the wake of Coinbase&#8217;s <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Coinbase-Q321-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">earnings report</a> yesterday afternoon, shares of the U.S. crypto exchange are off sharply this morning. What happened? Public-market investors continued to underestimate how volatile the crypto market is, leaving them to over-index on gains and over-despair on less impressive results.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Coinbase is not alone in giving Wall Street raptures followed by panics. Thanks to falling crypto trading activity, we recently saw a similar miss in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/robinhoods-nasty-quarter-shows-the-ups-downs-of-trading-incomes/">Robinhood&#8217;s earnings</a> in terms of raw results and sharp resulting declines in its share price.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220370 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Notably, both companies made noise before their earnings reports that their crypto incomes would fall in Q3 2021 compared to the second quarter. And yet it appeared that public investors were still surprised when that, in fact, happened.</p>
<p>The speed of the crypto economy as a whole may be simply too quick for public-market investors to fully grok. And the exchanges aren&#8217;t even the swingiest of crypto-themed investments. Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Up, down, up, down (repeat)</h2>
<p>Robinhood saw its trading revenues from crypto fall from $233 million in <a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-2021-Press-Release-(1).pdf">Q2 2021</a> to just <a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Q3-2021-Press-Release.pdf">$51 million</a> in the third quarter. That the company had explicitly told investors that a slowdown was coming does make the declines less painful, although it may be that Wall Street had simply expected a <em>smaller</em> decline.</p>
<p>To reiterate, Robinhood had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/robinhood-targets-ipo-valuation-up-to-35b-amid-warning-that-crypto-incomes-are-slipping/">previously told investors</a> during its IPO process that it expected to post sequential revenue declines in Q3 &#8220;as a result of decreased levels of trading activity relative to the record highs in trading activity, particularly in cryptocurrencies, during the three months ended June 30, 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet! Investors were perplexed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alex Gorsky, the chairman and CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson, has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/alex-gorsky-joins-apples-board-of-directors/">joined Apple’s board of directors</a>. Gorsky’s move to Apple’s board comes ahead of his planned departure as CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson in January 2022. It also coincides with Apple focusing more on health technology.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising that Apple has tapped Gorsky to be part of its governance team, as the company has been very public about its health and wellness ambitions, including launching a number of health-focused features for iOS and WatchOS over the years.</p>
<p>“Alex has long been a visionary in healthcare, applying his tremendous insight, experience, and passion for technology to the cause of improving lives and building healthier communities,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/alex-gorsky-joins-apples-board-of-directors/">press release</a>. “We’re excited to welcome him to Apple’s board of directors, and I know that all of us will benefit from his leadership and expertise.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232057" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Gorsky began working at Johnson &amp; Johnson in 1988 and became CEO in 2012. Apple notes that Gorksy has made innovation and technology key priorities, with investments that have helped shape the future of the pharmaceutical, medical device, and consumer health sectors.</p>
<p>“I’ve long shared Apple’s belief that technology has the potential to improve lives and create healthier communities,” said Gorsky, in the press release. “It’s an honor to join Apple’s board of directors, and to be part of a values-led company that’s constantly innovating to both enable and enhance the way we live.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For many small businesses, trying to manage their employees&#8217; Apple devices and keep them up-to-date is a huge challenge. These businesses tend to lack sophisticated IT departments, and when devices break down or users have questions, they are often left to figure out things on their own using Apple&#8217;s consumer support tools.</p>
<p>Recognizing this issue, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/apple-has-acquired-fleetsmith-a-startup-that-helps-it-manage-apple-devices-remotely/">Apple acquired Fleetsmith</a> last year, and today the company announced the beta of a device management solution called <a href="http://apple.com/business/essentials">Apple Business Essentials</a> aimed squarely at businesses with less than 500 employees.</p>
<p>Susan Prescott, vice president of enterprise and education marketing at Apple, said that the company wanted to help these customers onboard, support and update employee Apple devices, then offboard them when workers leave the company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231649" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;​​It is designed to manage Apple devices across that lifecycle of the device and it&#8217;s comprised of three core pieces. It&#8217;s got device management, along with storage, as well as support in one single subscription,&#8221; Prescott explained.</p>
<p>The management component is composed of a combination of the Fleetsmith acquisition and the Apple Device Enrollment Program. It enables small businesses to have access to a similar set of tools as their larger counterparts, giving them more control over the devices and ensuring they work as soon as the employee logs in.</p>
<p>After a business signs up for the service, admins can create users and groups. Users belong to groups and admins can set up a configuration for each group that includes the number of supported devices and an amount of storage. Each company or group can also include a base set of apps that make sense for that group.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231653" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231653" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2231653" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Apple_Apple-Business-Essentials_11102021.jpg?w=680" alt="Apple Business Essentials device management interface on MacBook Pro, iPad and iPhone" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Apple_Apple-Business-Essentials_11102021.jpg 1960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Apple_Apple-Business-Essentials_11102021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Apple_Apple-Business-Essentials_11102021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Apple_Apple-Business-Essentials_11102021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Apple_Apple-Business-Essentials_11102021.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Apple_Apple-Business-Essentials_11102021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Apple_Apple-Business-Essentials_11102021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231653" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that employees can bring their own devices, and when they sign in to a supported device, the company will set up a work profile for them. That way, only their work product is backed up, and should they leave the company, only their work will be deleted, leaving their personal stuff intact and out of the reach of the employer.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it&#8217;s a personal or work-owned device, the solution also helps maintain security by keeping it up-to-date with the latest system updates. In addition, it enables admins to enforce security settings such as FileVault full-disk encryption on the Mac or Activation Lock to lock down any Apple device should it be lost or stolen.</p>
<p>The storage piece comes from iCloud, although companies are free to connect to a third-party storage provider like Dropbox. The support element will include help desk services for both the IT department running Apple Business Essentials and employees who have any Apple-related questions. That part will be handled through AppleCare+, Apple&#8217;s business-level support arm. Finally, when it launches out of beta, it will also include onsite service, whether in an office or at home, within four hours of reporting an incident. The latter will be run by Apple partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maribel Lopez, founder and principal analyst at Lopez Research, said that it&#8217;s a service that should appeal to small businesses, essentially saving them from having to go through Apple consumer support channels, which aren&#8217;t really designed to meet business requirements.</p>
<p>&#8220;SMBs [have been] effectively left out of management and support. Many would&#8217;ve thought the heavier MDM (mobile device management) wasn&#8217;t for them, and The Genius Bar lacked the real-time support that every business, especially SMBs, needs. Fleetsmith was viewed as a more user-friendly, mobile-friendly way to think of [device] management, so that is part of it. User-centricity versus device-centricity is also a part of it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Tom Mainelli, an analyst in IDC&#8217;s device and consumer research group, said that the new program gives small businesses access to a set of services that were previously only available to larger companies, and as long as the price is reasonable, chances are that they will be willing to pay Apple to provide these services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple’s focus on small businesses makes a great deal of sense. Enterprise customers likely already have management systems in place to manage their Apple products, but smaller companies don’t always have full-time IT. That means it can be tough for them to manage everything, especially when it’s a mix of employer-provided and employee-purchased devices,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple will likely need to drive some education about what the various levels of service offered, and why a small business needs them, but I suspect many business owners will gladly pay Apple to take care of these challenges for them,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Although the service is free during beta, the company will charge on a per-user, per-month basis for the device management and storage components, based on the chosen configuration. There will be an additional per-user charge for the support pieces, although that won&#8217;t be ready until the solution is generally available, which is expected in spring next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apps catering to frontline workers are seeing a surge of interest in the market these days, as businesses finally start to wake up to using tech to better connect with these employees, and investors eye up an interesting and new growth opportunity in enterprise IT. In one of the latest developments, <a href="https://joinblink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blink</a> &#8212; a startup and app of the same name that provides a platform for frontline workers to use and engage with the various IT services used by their organizations, as well as with each other &#8212; has picked up $20 million, a Series A that is being led by Next47, with participation from early investors Partech and TechStars. Blink has confirmed that the funding values it at $100 million.</p>
<p>The startup will be using the capital to double down on growth. Blink was founded in London &#8212; where it has found strong traction with metropolitan bus networks (where some 5,000 bus drivers are using the Blink app) and the NHS (where thousands of front-line workers in clinical and non-clinical roles are also on Blink). Those users are very engaged, CEO Sean Nolan tells me, with some 72% of all users opening it on average 13 times a day to check things like pay slips, shift rostering, holiday and overtime pay, to chat with each other and read their company&#8217;s latest announcements.</p>
<p>Now Blink is planning to relocate its HQ to New York to better tackle the U.S. The global opportunity is a big one with an estimated 2.7 billion people working on the front line, according to the company. Blink currently has some 93,000 users, so there is a lot of growing to do.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232033" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After years of being overlooked in favor of so-called knowledge workers &#8212; those who sit at screens day in, day out and are more likely to be using software all the time &#8212; frontline workers are experiencing a kind of renaissance in the world of enterprise IT. There are now a number of companies building solutions to provide more digital solutions to them, whether it&#8217;s a platform to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/wonolo-raises-140m-for-its-staffing-platform-used-by-1m-laborers-and-front-line-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help them find work</a>, or any number of communication and productivity apps. Just last week, one them &#8212; another frontline worker productivity app called When I Work &#8212; raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/when-i-work-an-messaging-app-that-lets-shift-based-teams-schedule-work-and-more-raises-200m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 million</a>. Others include Workplace from Meta (fka Facebook); Microsoft&#8217;s Teams; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/homebase-raises-71m-for-a-team-management-platform-aimed-at-smbs-and-their-hourly-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebase</a>, which raised $71 million earlier this year; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/workiz-locks-in-13m-for-productivity-tools-aimed-at-home-services-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workiz</a>, which focuses on home services pros; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/workwhile-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WorkWhile</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/yoobic-raises-50m-for-its-chat-and-communications-app-app-aimed-at-frontline-and-service-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoobic</a> (more of a productivity platform for frontline workers currently); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/crew-a-workplace-and-slack-messaging-rival-for-shift-workers-raises-35m-adds-enterprise-version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crew</a> (which <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-acquires-crew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Square acquired</a> earlier this year); and <a href="https://www.justworkshours.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justworks</a> (which in September filed to go public).</p>
<p>Nolan said that Blink&#8217;s particular approach has been to try to create a user interface, and functionality, that caters both to asynchronous activities as well as real-time information, the idea being that front-line workers are most likely not going to be looking at the app continuously throughout the day, so the priority for making sure important things surface when they do is especially higher.</p>
<p>The company has built some functionality, such as its chat feature, in-house, but otherwise its strategy is to integrate, integrate, integrate. It has built APIs and flows to bring in the most popular software used by its customers so that essentially when a user wants to access documents or information from any of them, that person logs in with a single sign-on process to do so, and then essentially uses the other app within the Blink experience.</p>
<p>The company is planning to hire some 40 more people in New York as it looks to double its base of 60 employees to 120.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p3">“Today’s top enterprise software companies are reexamining the way we work; Blink is uniquely positioned to lead in this category for frontline workers”, said Daniel Kirchleitner, Partner at Next47, in a statement. “We’ve been blown away by their customer feedback and results so far, especially the impact on employee retention. We look forward to partnering with the Blink team as they continue their expansion into the US market and beyond.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security researchers have uncovered a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/spyware/">spyware</a> campaign that’s targeting South Korean residents with Android devices in order to steal confidential data.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Unlike other spyware campaigns that typically take advantage of on-device vulnerabilities, this <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">campaign, known as PhoneSpy, hides in plain sight on victims’ devices, masquerading as legitimate </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/android/">Android</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> lifestyle apps</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> from TV streaming to yoga instruction. In reality, however, the spyware is stealthily exfoliating data from the victim’s device, including login credentials, messages, precise granular location and images. PhoneSpy is also capable of uninstalling any apps, including </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mobile-security/">mobile security</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> apps.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Researchers at mobile security firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/zimperium/">Zimperium</a>, which discovered PhoneSpy inside 23 apps, say the spyware can also access a victims’ camera to take pictures and record video in real-time, and warned that this could be used for personal and corporate blackmail and espionage. It does this without a victim knowing, and Zimperium notes that unless someone is watching their web traffic, it would be difficult to detect.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231172" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The legitimate-looking apps request excessive on-device permissions — a common red flag.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Once the permissions are granted, the attackers can take control and hide the app from the user&#8217;s menu, staying behind the scenes to continue to track and steal with little to no interruption,” Zimperium’s Richard Melick told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>PhoneSpy is not known to be listed in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google-play/">Google Play</a>, nor were samples found in any Android storefront. Rather, Zimperium says that attackers are using distribution methods based on web traffic redirection or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/social-engineering/">social engineering</a>, an attack method whereby users are manipulated into performing certain actions or handing over confidential data.</p>
<p>“PhoneSpy is distributed through malicious and fake apps that are downloaded and sideloaded onto the victim&#8217;s devices,&#8221; Melick said. &#8220;There is evidence pointing to distribution through web traffic redirection or social engineering, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a>, tricking the end-user into downloading what they think is a legitimate app from a compromised website or direct link.”</p>
<p>PhoneSpy, which has so far claimed more than 1,000 victims in South Korea, according to Zimperium, shares many similarities with other known and previously used spyware and stalkerware apps. “This leads us to believe that someone compiled the features and capabilities they wanted into a new spyware setup,” Melick added. Using off-the-shelf code also produces fewer fingerprints, making it easier for attackers to obscure their identity.</p>
<p>Zimperium says it has notified U.S. and South Korean authorities of this hyper-targeted spyware campaign and has reported the host of the command and control server multiple times. However, at the time of writing, the PhoneSpy spyware campaign is still active.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/stalkerware-security-phone-data-thousands/">TechCrunch revealed a significant stalkerware campaign</a> that’s putting the private phone data of hundreds of thousands of people at risk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>ControlUp is already a substantial business: it says that its customers include four of the top five U.S. health insurance companies, five of the top eight U.S. healthcare companies, and four of the top six global telecoms carriers. ControlUp&#8217;s revenues grew 50% in the last year, with enterprise accounts growing 67%. Its technology is now monitoring desktops covering some 1 million &#8220;seats&#8221; globally. To give you an idea of how big its customers are, those 1 million seats are connected to some 1,500 customers in all.</p>
<p>K1 Investment Management and JVP, both previous backers, co-led this round. ControlUp was founded in Israel, where it continues to have a strong R&amp;D presence, alongside wider operations out of San Jose. The company&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Asaf Ganot said the startup would not be disclosing its valuation, but from what we understand it&#8217;s significantly higher than the $330 million valuation it had a year ago (per <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/159260-14/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a>), when it announced its Series C, although it is still under $1 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232019" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ganot tells me that ControlUp was originally founded to address the performance shortcomings that you get when running virtual machines on a network: issues like broadband speed, running too many applications on too little compute power, and high latency with app performance all potentially result in degraded computing experiences, and worker frustration. That challenge has become more complex in recent times, with the rise of people working from home, using WiFi and broadband networks of varying quality, and sometimes working on their own computers, which again might not be optimized for business needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;User experience was always a big thing,&#8221; he said of the company&#8217;s earlier days. &#8220;Good means high productivity, that people are happier and will probably work better. What is happening in the last year or two is that the issues have become more predominant. It&#8217;s not just a niche.&#8221; Addressing remote and hybrid working is essentially targeting, he said, &#8220;the same things we’ve been doing forever, just now with more workloads.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s solution is based around deploying &#8220;agents&#8221; that exist in the background on a person&#8217;s computer that are continually monitoring how applications and the general device is working. These agents are powered by AI, and they can not only identify when, say, a broadband network is too slow, but also provide remediation in the form of automated or non-automated technical suggestions for what a person, or IT person remotely, can do to fix the particular issue.</p>
<p>The company covers both remote users as well as physical endpoints including Citrix Virtual Apps, VMWare Horizon and Microsoft RDS and WVD, but for now at least it doesn&#8217;t extend to mobile devices, which have their own specialized set of device management issues, Ganot said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These days people might be wary of &#8212; if not downright resistant to &#8212; the idea of &#8220;agents&#8221; quietly sitting in the background monitoring your every computer move. Asked about this and the issues that it poses, Ganot said that ControlUp is built with more privacy in mind, looking and monitoring only in cases where a &#8220;work asset&#8221; is used: that work asset could be a work-issued computer, or it could be an employee accessing their work email via a browser: the system only &#8220;reads&#8221; data related to that usage.</p>
<p>&#8220;The IT team can monitor the home networking and WiFi signature. However, we do that only when you are connected to a work asset,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This fits even if it’s not a corporate device. We don’t do anything in fact unless you are connected to a work asset such as an application for work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ganot said that to date the system is light enough that it doesn&#8217;t impact on user experience itself. &#8220;Monitoring apps are notorious for slowing things down,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but our agents are super non-intrusive. This is one of our core values: we don&#8217;t want to become one of the causes of user experience being a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>With remote and hybrid working looking like they are here to stay for the foreseeable future, it&#8217;s likely investors will continue to look for opportunities to back startups that are helping to make that a manageable, and perhaps even improved, experience for end users and their organizations.</p>
<p>“In the post-COVID-19 era, IT managers of large organizations have the unique challenge of monitoring the performance of the network for each of their employees in the office, at home or in any other remote location,” said Erel Margalit, founder and chairman of JVP, in a statement. “ControlUp provides a deep analysis of mission critical applications—for every employee—highlighting problems and finding remedies to solve them. The company’s dashboard enables IT managers to monitor, assess and improve the productivity for all the employees in the company.”</p>
<p>“We continue to see a significant shift toward work-from-anywhere across all industries,” added Roy Liao, SVP at K1. “K1 is proud to partner with ControlUp as it continues to innovate and change the landscape of the digital employee experience market. By focusing on making the employee experience simpler, faster, and more cost-effective, ControlUp provides a unique value proposition that no other vendor fills.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The race to automate the world of business is on, and today one of the bigger players in the market has picked up another major round of funding to meet that demand to speed up work, reduce some of the costs around repetitive procedures, and perhaps gain some new insights in the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.workato.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workato</a>, which has built a platform that lets organizations set up and run automated solutions to speed up repetitive processes in their workflows, has closed a Series E of $200 million at a $5.7 billion valuation. Workato said that it plans to use the funding to continue investing in its platform, and to make acquisitions, ahead of eyeing up an IPO down the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s our plan to eventually go public, but there is no official timeline set,&#8221; Vijay Tella, Workato CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Right now we’re focused on making Workato the company you think of when you think of Integration and Automation. We believe customers can benefit so much from wall-to-wall integration, and for that reason our goal is for our customer usage to continue to grow over time and to stay on the revenue path we are already on.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231943" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In line with that, along with the funding news, Workato is also disclosing an acquisition that it made with some of its funds: <a href="https://www.railsdata." target="_blank" rel="noopener">RailsData</a>, a startup that has built API-based technology to integrate apps, data and devices. Workato had been a <a href="https://www.railsdata.com/client.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer</a> of Chennai, India-based RailsData prior to the acquisition, so it was already using the smaller startup&#8217;s technology to power some of its own automation solutions, specifically for deploying services at scale, via APIs, for larger customers of Workato&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Battery Ventures led this latest round, with Insight Partners, Altimeter Capital and Tiger Global also participating in equal amounts, the company said. Workato, which has now raised $421 million to date, has been more generally on a funding and growth tear this year: it was only in <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112005023/en/Workato-Announces-110M-at-1.7B-Valuation-to-Transform-How-Enterprises-Work-with-Integration-Led-Automation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January</a> of this year that the Mountain View-based startup had raised $110 million at a $1.7 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the big valuation hike has been the company&#8217;s growth. There are now a number of companies, including Salesforce&#8217;s Mulesoft, UiPath, Boomi, ServiceNow, Tray.io, SnapLogic, Blue Prism, IBM and so many others offering different approaches to providing automation of one kind or another to organizations, and as the space matures we&#8217;re even starting to see an increasing number of approaches <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/notable-which-makes-rpa-based-tools-to-speed-up-healthcare-admin-raises-100m-at-a-600m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeting specific use cases and verticals</a>.</p>
<p>Workato&#8217;s pitch is that it has managed to bridge the gap between automation and the non-technical users who are most likely to want to use (and build robotic process automation and other workflow automation experiences using) tools like these.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It has some 500,000 &#8220;recipes&#8221; available for companies to use, covering operational areas like HR, marketing, sales, finance, IT, revenue operations and product (where its automations can be embedded into other services), and popular enterprise apps like Salesforce, Slack, ServiceNow, Snowflake, and Workday. Even though a number of RPA and other automation vendors tout &#8220;low code&#8221; or even &#8220;no code&#8221; solutions aimed at non-technical people, the reality is that this is often not really the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="il">Workato</span> has looked at the integration and automation problems differently, that they are two sides of the same coin,&#8221; said Tella. &#8220;Today integration tools like iPaaS, ETL/ELT, and API management are focused at data level and don’t do end to end process automation or workflows. Tools like RPA and BPM approach the problem from a business process perspective but lack a strong foundation of connectivity or integration leading to brittle, hard to implement and change workflows</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We see business processes as inseparable from underlying data,&#8221; Tella continued. &#8220;<span class="il">Workato</span>’s automation is built on a foundation of industry leading iPaaS or integration. Integration or data is where the rubber meets the road and automation is how the <span class="il">work</span> gets done. We uniquely do both in one platform. A <span class="il">Workato</span> recipe is a single concept that handles both data and process level integrations. It is not a swiss army knife of integration and automation technologies under the cover.&#8221; The idea is that this approach works both for non-technical business teams as well as IT teams.</p>
<p>The company says it has some 11,000 businesses as customers, with the list featuring a heavy dose of tech companies as well as non-tech ones. It includes Atlassian, AT&amp;T, Adobe, Autodesk, Box, Stitch Fix, Gitlab, NYU, Nokia, Lucid Motors, Broadcom and Toast.</p>
<p>Workato quoted 7,000 customers in January, and the company&#8217;s annual recurring revenues have more than doubled in the last year. It seems to have gotten deeper engagement with its customers, too, with users growing to 100,000 from 70,000 in January. Its biggest verticals currently are Technology, Financial services, Retail, Logistics &amp; Transportation, and Healthcare, said Tella.</p>
<p>One of the big trends, of course, in enterprise IT in the last two years has been &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; and specifically modernizing systems to cope with the fact that we are working differently now because of Covid-19, and consumers are demanding different things from the organizations they engage with. That&#8217;s been a big reason that investors are interested in the company.</p>
<p>“The events of the past 10 months have made operational excellence more critical than ever, and businesses understand that enterprise automation is a cornerstone to achieving the heightened agility, innovation and performance they need to succeed in any environment,” said Pauline Yang, partner, Altimeter Capital, in a statement. &#8220;The market for automation products will only continue to expand, and we believe that Workato has the best technology, partnerships and leadership team in place to capitalize on this exciting opportunity.”</p>
<p>Tella notes that Workato&#8217;s approach has been one of the more uniquely scalable, due to how it has been built.</p>
<p>&#8220;The scale and scope of sales, marketing, finance, HR, customer and other operations today mean 10,000 salespeople in 10,000 companies are not reinventing the same wheel,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is untenable, unproductive and results won’t be great.&#8221; He notes that <span class="il">Workato</span>’s recipe builder is AI-powered &#8220;so it recommends next steps and helps you build the right recipes by default.&#8221;</p>
<p>He describes the 500,000 community-created recipes as &#8220;a Github for automation and operations&#8221; for users to find, one automation and adapt it to their own companies and use cases. &#8220;This is built on <span class="il">Workato-</span>patented cloning technology that makes it possible to reuse recipes created in a different company with apps like Salesforce that are customized very differently than your own. A template model does not <span class="il">work</span> for reuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s big opportunity in the coming years will be to tap into a global demand for more automation tools. Workato plans to add a new data center in the Asia Pacific region to complement the business its already in there; and it will be bringing on more firepower also in the EMEA region, alongside more growth in the U.S.</p>
<p>Battery is a repeat backer of the company, giving it perspective and an insider&#8217;s view of how Workato has grown.</p>
<p>“Since leading Workato’s Series B in 2018, we’ve been excited to see the steady growth of usage among Workato’s customers—many of them leaders in their respective industries—and Workato’s solidifying position as a leader in the automation market, one of the fastest-growing sectors in technology,” said Neeraj Agrawal, a general partner at Battery Ventures, in a statement. “We’ve had a front-row seat to watch Workato truly transform many of its customers’ businesses, which is one reason why we and other existing investors in the company are excited to lead this new funding round.”</p>
<p><em>Updated with new figure on total customers to 11,000 from 7,000.</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company saw an 18-month time period of rapid growth, which included seeing from 10 times to 30 times growth across all the metrics Daily tracks.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve all embraced video calls, whether it is with our work colleague or our physician, but for developers, it remains a challenge to build both real-time audio and video features into products.</p>
<p>That’s where <a href="http://www.daily.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily</a> comes in. The company provides APIs so developers can add those features into products or websites using just two lines of code. Use cases include video calls, audio-only apps, webinars, live classes, interactive collaboration, e-commerce, customer support, IoT and robotics.</p>
<p>Since being founded in 2015, the company has amassed a customer list that includes AppFolio, HotDoc, Pitch, Kumospace and Teamflow, and its customers report seeing up to 80% fewer video call errors after using Daily, Kwindla Hultman Kramer, co-founder and CEO of Daily, told TechCrunch via email.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231380" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Following an 18-month time period of rapid growth, which included seeing from 10 times to 30 times increase in all the metrics the company tracks &#8212; overall traffic volume, freemium sign-ups, paid usage and the number of customers scaling applications on top of the platform &#8212; Daily today announced $40 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>“The most interesting trend we’re seeing is that new use cases for video and audio are showing up every week,” Hultman Kramer said. “We’ve seen the growth of events platforms, new social/spatial video environments, live commerce, live classes, fitness and workout applications, and a huge amount of experimentation in education and tutoring, just to name a few.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EQBych0uIe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/daily-co-raises-4-6m-video-chat-api-service/">Daily.co raises $4.6M video chat API service</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Daily.co raises $4.6M video chat API service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/daily-co-raises-4-6m-video-chat-api-service/embed/#?secret=EQBych0uIe" data-secret="EQBych0uIe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Renegade Partners led the round, which included new investors Heritage Group, Cendana Capital and Sean Rose, and participation from existing investors including Lachy Groom, Tiger Global, Freestyle Ventures, Slack Fund, Root VC, Moxxie, Haystack Ventures, Todd &amp; Rahul’s Angel Fund, David Eckstein and Aston Motes.</p>
<p>The latest round brings total funding to over $60 million, which includes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/daily-co-raises-4-6m-video-chat-api-service/">$4.6 million round raised</a> in May 2020. The company is not sharing its valuation, but Hultman Kramer revealed that valuation stepped up three times with each of the three funding rounds the company raised in the last 18 months.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/video-conferencing-market-100293" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global video conferencing market</a> was valued at $5.8 billion in 2020 and is expected to be $6.28 billion by the end of this year, then double in seven years. Healthcare is one of the areas Daily, which is HIPAA-compliant, is seeing accelerated growth in as startups introduce new apps and tools so that patients can more easily access things like primary care, mental health services and standard prescriptions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Equally, we’re seeing really interesting things happening with large, traditional healthcare organizations and with government leadership,” Hultman Kramer added. “HIPAA legislation in the U.S. pushed providers to get better at both patient privacy and data interoperability, and that’s bearing fruit. Medicare and other federal programs now reimburse for telehealth services on a par with reimbursement for in-person visits, while many rural health networks are investing heavily in telehealth tools to extend high-quality care to more people than ever before.”</p>
<p>Gearing up to meet future demand, Hultman Kramer intends to use the new funding to build Daily’s team and expand its global infrastructure. The company recently hired Varun Singh as chief product technology officer and Sarah Milstein as vice president of engineering.</p>
<p>“Real-time video is a specialized area,” he said. We think we have an unfairly good engineering team from a competitive perspective. Raising another round of funding helps us extend that lead and be able to push our infrastructure out closer to the edge of the network, everywhere that our customers see traffic.”</p>

<p>As part of the investment, Roseanne Wincek, co-founder and managing director of Renegade Partners, and Lee Edwards, partner at Root Ventures, joined Daily’s board.</p>
<p>Hultman Kramer says the company did not intend to raise a round in 2021 — it had “plenty of runway and no immediate need for new capital.” However, when investor Jenny Lefcourt introduced the company to Wincek, Hultman Kramer said the company didn’t want to miss the opportunity to bring her onto Daily’s board. Same with Edwards, who introduced Daily to Lachy Groom, which led to Lachy leading Daily’s Series A.</p>
<p>Wincek said via email that Renegade invests in companies that have found product market fit and are ready to scale. She feels the pandemic showed that lowest-latency, high-performance video “is an incredible way to interact,” but that experience is locked in standalone apps that offer video communication and little else.</p>
<p>Daily is bringing innovation, creativity and rich experiences through its API tools that were created with developers in mind and are easy to use and build on, while also being secure.</p>
<p>“In the future, video calls will not look like Zoom, and they will be powered by Daily,” she added. “Daily has real platform potential — it&#8217;s a great product with stellar engineering culture, coupled with Kwin&#8217;s experience building video for the enterprise. Video has become ubiquitous in the way we work, live and interact online, and Daily is going to create a sea-change in the way we use video on the internet.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Moov, a data-fueled <a href="https://www.moov.co/">marketplace for used manufacturing equipment</a>, has closed a $41 million Series A funding round led by Tiger Global. Investors joining the round include public semiconductor investor Gavin Baker of Atreides Management, Valor Equity Partners, Avenir Growth Fund, and existing investors.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company’s co-founders, Steven Zhou and Maxam Yeung, came up with the idea for Moov around a decade ago. The two say that they recognized that companies in the industry, such as Qualcomm and Samsung, spend billions of dollars a year purchasing manufacturing equipment only for it to get scrapped or forgotten in an offsite warehouse in a few years despite being usable for decades.</p>
<p>“We identified an opportunity that existed based on how long the equipment is being used versus how long it’s usable for,” Moov CEO Steven Zhou told TechCrunch in an interview. “There was a billion-dollar opportunity to repurpose this equipment. That’s where the idea of Moov came about. It’s essentially leveraging data and technology automation algorithms to more effectively match unused equipment and find new homes for it all over the world.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231333" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>One of Moov&#8217;s use cases is to help manufacturing companies recoup capital that would have otherwise been lost. On the buyer side, Moov aims to help small businesses and universities around the world that don&#8217;t have the budget or network to acquire equipment to further their innovation.</p>
<p>The platform’s software matches equipment listed by sellers to companies that can use it by automatically serving them those listings. Buyers can also manually search through a mass list of equipment. Along with a real-time marketplace, Moov also features additional services such as logistics, refurbishment, insurance, and asset management software.</p>
<p>As for the new funding, Moov plans to use it to expand its domestic presence into other semiconductor hubs such as Austin and New York. It also plans to expand its global presence in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and Europe. The company will also hire executives, invest in research and development, and also continue to strategically purchase more inventory. Moov also plans to examine acquisition strategies with other industry players that could be plugged into its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Moov’s Series A funding round comes in the midst of the ongoing global chip shortage, as many industries have slowed production because manufacturers are unable to obtain the required equipment. Zhou says that Moov is working to help alleviate local shortages and that the company is able to reduce the lead time for companies to purchase equipment from months, down to days or hours.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s data suggests that the value of used equipment has more than doubled over the past year, and these numbers are expected to continue to grow, doubling to around $200 billion per year within the next six to eight years. With close to $1.5 billion in active and available listings on its platform, Moov plans to play a role in shifting the global equipment purchasing mindset.</p>
<p>Zhou says the company is also proud to have built a marketplace that helps to reduce electronic waste globally. “As we grow, we’re really excited to play an increasing role in helping the reduction of the carbon footprint of global manufacturing and also to help alleviate the global chip shortage,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Emergence, a storied venture capital firm known for its enterprise bets in Salesforce and Zoom, announced today that it has promoted Carlotta “Lotti” Siniscalco from principal to partner. The appointment marks Emergence’s first female partner in its 18-year history, and comes months <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/emergence-known-for-its-enterprise-bets-just-rounded-up-nearly-1-billion-across-two-new-funds/">after the firm closed two funds totaling $1 billion.</a></p>
<p>Siniscalco&#8217;s new job title comes without precedent. Emergence has historically struggled on the diversity of its partnership: all five partners within Emergence&#8217;s new funds are male. Emergence doesn&#8217;t hire a partner level and prefers to build up investors over time, a policy that appears to have delayed some of its diversity efforts. Kevin Spain, Emergence Capital GP, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/05/05/vc-firm-emergence-raises-950-million-across-two-new-funds-to-find-the-next-zoom/?sh=74e92a6838fe">hinted to Forbes in May</a> that Lotti will join the partner ranks &#8220;in the next few years.&#8221; Months later, it looks like that timeline has been accelerated. Along with Siniscalco&#8217;s move, the firm promoted Yaz, a Palestinian-American, to senior associate.</p>
<p>The change is showing up in data, too. Recent Pitchbook data says that female-founded companies raised $40.4 billion across 2,661 deals through the first three quarters of 2021, almost doubling 2019’s total of $23.7 billion and over 10 times 2011’s total of $3.6 billion. The growth is partially due to a rise of diversity within partnerships. Last year, Terri Burns became GV’s youngest partner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/new-gv-partner-terri-burns-has-a-simple-investment-thesis-gen-z/">and the first Black woman to hold the role.</a> This year, Female Founders Fund <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/female-founder-fund-closes-third-fund-with-57m-for-female-bipoc-founders/">closed its third fund with $57 million</a>; Forerunner, led by Kirsten Green, <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/why-kirsten-green-might-not-invest">closed a growth-stage fund</a>; and Variant, with Li Jin joining as a general partner, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/variant-debuts-a-new-110m-fund-for-crypto-startups-announces-li-jin-has-joined-as-a-general-partner/">closed a $110 million fund</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231769" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Siniscalco, who was born and raised in Milan, moved to the United States when she was seventeen. She plunged into the competitive undergraduate life at University of Pennsylvania and soon realized what she had been missing in Italy, as “a country that thrives on tradition more than innovation.”</p>
<p>“I was always driven by what the future looks like more than what our history looks like,” Siniscalco said. Early on in college, she was introduced to the world of venture and cold emailed between 50 and 60 people on an Italians in VC list. Only two firms responded, and at the age of 19, she joined a small, local venture fund that let her cut her teeth in early-stage support and founder services.</p>

<p>After a stint in venture, she spent time in investment banking, private equity, and business operations within a fast-growth startup before turning to venture with Ribbit Capital and Kauffman Fellows. In 2018, when she joined Emergence as a senior associate, she soon rose to principal, and now, a year later, is a partner.</p>
<p>Alongside enterprise SaaS, Siniscalco is focused on fintech, a sector that hybridizes her interest in the future and her respect for tradition. “Something that is very true to my core is the idea of improving and changing something that feels old in order to create a better experience for everyone involved,” she said. The investor explained how at 23, when she was a financial analyst at Goldman Sachs, she consistently kept getting rejected for credit cards (even though she had a very stable income). The difficulty of securing a card as a non-US citizen planted a seed in her mind on the importance of rebuilding systems for people like her.</p>
<p>“And that was before the initial wave of companies that were really disrupting the traditional banks,” she said.</p>
<p>One of Siniscalco’s first investments was Talent Hack, which announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/talent-hack-raises-17-million-led-by-emergence-to-power-the-fitness-creator-economy/">$17 million Series A this week</a>. While this was the first female partner-led deal that Emergence has made public, the raise was game changing for another reason: led by Alexandra Bonetti, Talent Hack is the first Latina female-led startup in the Emergence Portfolio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When we think of exiting via acquisition, it&#8217;s easy to think that if it&#8217;s a reasonable deal that it&#8217;s going to be an easy decision to say yes, but for three founders we spoke to at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/">TC Sessions: SaaS</a> recently, It was anything but. Founders have to balance many different decision points and deciding whether to sign on the dotted line is going to come with some anxiety and doubt before reaching a conclusion.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			It wasn&#8217;t an easy decision. Even though, at $3.7 billion, everyone thought it should probably be a no-brainer; it wasn&#8217;t.							<cite>Jyoti Bansal</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The panel, which looked at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/learn-what-happens-after-you-sell-your-startup-at-tc-sessions-saas-on-wednesday/">what happens after you get acquired</a>, included: Jyoti Bansal, current founder and CEO at Harness, who sold his previous startup AppDynamics<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/cisco-snaps-up-appdynamics-for-3-7b-right-before-its-ipo/"> to Cisco for $3.7 billion</a> in 2017, the week he was going to IPO; Monica Sarbu, who is currently founder and CEO at Xata, who sold her startup<a href="https://www.elastic.co/about/press/elastic-acquires-packetbeat"> Packetbeat to Elastic</a> in 2015 just two years after launching the company, and finally Nick Mehta, who is currently co-founder and CEO at Gainsight, who sold his email archiving startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/16/symantec-buys-cloud-based-email-archiving-company-liveoffice-for-115m/">LiveOffice to Symantec</a> in 2011 for $115 million.</p>
<p>As you can see there was life with new startups after the sale for each of these founders, all of whom founded new companies after they left, but first they had to go through the sale process and decide to sell or not. Each founder took a slightly different path.</p>
<h2>The sales process</h2>
<p>Bansal was ready to take his company public in 2017 and was content to do just that when Cisco came knocking while the company was doing its roadshow. He rejected two initial offers, but when the company sweetened the pot enough, he simply couldn&#8217;t say no.</p>
