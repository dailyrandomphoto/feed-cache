</div><p id="speakable-summary">Facebook may have a new name, but a rebrand won’t erase the multiple recent disclosures illustrating how destructive the company is for society — and how harmful it is for its own investors.</p>
<p>The revelations from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen were shocking but not surprising. According to Haugen, who worked for the tech giant on election security matters before leaving and turning over a large cache of documents to the press, lawmakers and regulators, Facebook consistently knew that its algorithms were harming society and the vulnerable, with reprehensible actions like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/10/frances-haugen-takes-on-facebook-the-making-of-a-modern-us-hero">pushing so-called “thin-spiration”</a> to teenage girls, which can increase the likelihood of anorexia.</p>
<p>A recent analysis of internal Facebook documents showed that Facebook engineers treated emoji reactions — including the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/26/facebook-angry-emoji-algorithm/">“angry” emoji</a> — as five times more valuable than “likes,” favoring controversial posts to keep users engaged &#8212; and profits flowing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226192" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This isn’t just a story of a company acting against the public interest and harming its own consumers; it is also a story about one acting against its investors. According to Haugen, the company misled its shareholders about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/05/facebook-whistleblower-accuses-firm-of-serially-misleading-over-safety">basic business facts</a>, from how it addresses safety to the size of its user base.</p>
<p>By serially failing to tell investors this kind of critical information, Facebook may have violated our securities laws and regulations. And Haugen has filed <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-misinformation-public-60-minutes-2021-10-03/">at least eight complaints</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission alleging that Facebook has broken the law for withholding material information related to the company’s internal research.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/facebook-new-whistleblower-complaint/">second unnamed whistleblower</a> provided an affidavit to the SEC alleging that Facebook prioritizes growth and profits over hate speech and misinformation.</p>
<p>As notable as whistleblower allegations are, it is surprising that the role the SEC could play in regulating and containing Facebook hasn’t received top billing. While Facebook is a tech company, it is first and foremost a publicly traded company, and therefore subject to SEC regulations and oversight.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was the Obama-era SEC that originally <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/facebook-stock-approved-for-listing-on-the-nasdaq/">approved</a> Facebook’s 2012 initial public offering although the process included a <a href="https://www.herrick.com/publications/sec-challenges-dual-class-structures/">strange special class of shares</a> that continued to give Mark Zuckerberg total effective control over the company even after it became public. Additionally, it was the Trump-era SEC that <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2019-140">settled</a> with Facebook over its failure to properly disclose to investors that it knew the scandalous data company Cambridge Analytica had accessed and misused the Facebook data of approximately 30 million Americans.</p>
<p>Asking the SEC to take a closer look at Facebook, a company that has settled with the commission within the last two and a half years over securities law violations, should be ordinary, reasonable and what we expect of our securities regulator.</p>
<p>Americans are lucky that the Biden administration has placed strong regulators in charge of the SEC and Federal Trade Commission by appointing Gary Gensler and Lina Khan their respective chairs. But just as Facebook and the other Big Tech behemoths have come to touch all aspects of our economy, politics and everyday life, the task of properly regulating and containing these firms is larger than any one or two agencies.</p>
<p>What we need to truly tackle the questions and threats posed by large tech firms is a whole-of-government approach. The Biden administration has made <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">a good first step</a> with its Council on Competition, but this must represent the first cut rather than a final product. It also means refusing to give large tech firms access to new markets to dominate, from fintech to currency to special government contracts, understanding that these companies would almost certainly use these opportunities to grow even more powerful at the expense of smaller firms and consumers.</p>
<p>We also need the engagement of Congress on these critical questions. On the same day that Haugen was testifying before a Senate subcommittee, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on SEC oversight. Despite several days of coverage of Haugen’s incendiary claims, the hearing went for hours without a single comment or question about the SEC’s role in holding <span style="font-size: 1rem;"><span style="letter-spacing: -.1pt;">Facebook </span>accountable to its investors.</span></p>
<p>The failure of this key oversight opportunity represents a lack of imagination and coordination. To truly address the dangers of Big Tech, we need every member to be thinking about remedies for dealing with these gigantic companies, including pushing the Biden administration to do more.</p>
<p>Haugen is not the first whistleblower to emerge from Facebook, nor will she be the last. The time has passed for the U.S. federal government to meekly watch as Big Tech employees, shareholders, contractors and even the founders lay out the dangers these companies pose to Americans.</p>
<p>As the companies grow in size, power and danger, now is the time for the Biden administration to act boldly, aggressively and cohesively, beginning with the SEC taking up the cause and thoroughly investigating Facebook and fully enforcing our laws.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Big Three cloud infrastructure vendors &#8212; Amazon, Microsoft and Google &#8212; all reported earnings this week. As you might expect, they did just fine with a growing market that passed $45 billion worldwide, good for a mind-boggling $180 billion run rate and trailing 12 month revenue of $164 billion. Revenue grew 37% overall in the quarter, <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/amazon-microsoft-google-grab-the-big-numbers-but-rest-of-cloud-market-still-grows-by-27">according to Synergy Research</a>.</p>
<p>The question is can these vendors stay ahead of the chip shortages that are having an impact across the entire technology supply chain from smart phones to computers?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the top three vendors, who accounted for 70% of the market share this quarter. Amazon led the way once again, and while its market share percentage held steady, as it has for years at 33%, revenue grew at a remarkable 39%, an increase of 2% from the previous quarter and 10% over the year-ago report.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226342" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Amazon reported $16.1 billion in revenue, up from $11.6 billion a year ago. If you&#8217;re doing the math at home, you will note that this number is not one-third of $45 billion, and that&#8217;s because Synergy tracks infrastructure, platform services and hosted private clouds, and subtracts any revenue that&#8217;s not purely from these buckets such as consulting or hardware.</p>
<p>Microsoft makes it even harder to determine total cloud infrastructure market, but if you do the math based on Synergy&#8217;s data, it&#8217;s $9 billion for Azure infrastructure revenue, up from $8.4 billion last quarter. According to Microsoft, the company&#8217;s Azure and other cloud services grew 50%, down ever so slightly from 51% growth last quarter and up 2% from the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Finally, we have Google, which held steady with 10% market share, good for $4.5 billion, up from $4.2 billion last quarter, and up from $2.9 billion in the year-ago period, as Google continues to make steady progress in the cloud infrastructure market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-cloud-services-q3-2021?ctid=2417-50d63ea149222a6f4a24e71c605e07b3">Canalys estimated</a> even larger overall revenue of $49.4 billion, putting it on a run rate of almost $200 billion. They estimated a slightly lower growth rate of 35%, and the market share estimates for the Big Three varied slightly with the firm estimating Amazon with 32%, Microsoft 21% and Google 8%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regardless of whose numbers you use, it&#8217;s a significant market that is still growing at a substantial rate, but Canalys warns that chip shortages could slow that growth in the coming year. &#8220;Overall compute demand is outgrowing chip manufacturing capabilities, and infrastructure expansion may become limited for the cloud service providers,&#8221; Blake Murray from Canalys said in a statement.</p>
<p>Supply chain constraints were certainly on the mind of these companies and analysts in earnings calls. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/microsoft-msft-q1-2022-earnings-call-transcript/">had this to say</a> when asked specifically about the supply chain problem&#8217;s impact on data center expansion by Kash Rangan, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Secondly, you asked some good questions about the supply chain impact, and specifically around data centers, given our spend this quarter and my guidance should be similar next. A lot of that, Kash, is long lead time. So, we do have a good understanding of lead times required to meet the capacity signals that we&#8217;re seeing. I think we did a good job managing that, it&#8217;s not to say we&#8217;re not impacted, multiple suppliers are important to be able to manage through that. And I feel the team has done a very good job,&#8221; Hood said in the call.</p>
<p>John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy, says that the clout of these large vendors means they&#8217;ll likely get what they need in spite of overall chip market issues. &#8220;These companies are pretty good at managing their supply chains and they are such huge customers that you have to believe they will get preferential treatment from suppliers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are also a few knobs they can adjust in terms of things like build versus lease decisions, extending server lifespan a little and switching workloads to different geographies. They now have enormous and geographically dispersed data center networks that gives them a lot of wiggle room to get what they need, &#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategies, who keeps a close eye on the chip market agrees, saying that the costs may go up, but the hyperscalers are probably still going to get their supplies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re at that point yet. If the shortage gets worse, yes, but I don&#8217;t foresee that happening. Chipmakers prioritize the data center as it&#8217;s higher margin, so they&#8217;re first in line versus consumer PCs and smartphones,&#8221; Moorhead told me.</p>
<p>Even if supply issues had a short-term impact on data center growth, it seems nothing is going to slow down this market over the long haul. With companies ready to move more workloads into the cloud, growth seems assured, but we&#8217;ll see next quarter if the supply chain has had any effect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1453847498200686596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolling out</a> the ability for all iOS users globally to Super Follow select creators.

<p>— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1453847498200686596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 28, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226368" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/">launched</a> in September after first being announced in February. Super Follows are another tool for creators to earn money through the social media platform. Eligible accounts are able to set the price for Super Follow subscriptions, with the option of charging $2.99, $4.99 or $9.99 per month. Creators can choose to mark some tweets for subscribers only while continuing to reach their unpaid follower base in regular tweets.</p>
<p>The process for activating Super Follows for creators is currently application-based. Creators need to be in the U.S. and have 10,000 followers and at least 25 tweets within the last month to be eligible.</p>
<p>Last month, a report from Sensor Tower <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/">revealed</a> that Super Follows had only generated around $6,000 in the U.S. and around $600 or so in Canada in its first two weeks since launching. Twitter’s position on the slower start to Super Follows is that it’s still too early to make any determinations.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Super Follows isn’t Twitter’s only monetization feature.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this year, Twitter introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">Tip Jar</a>, a way for accounts to receive one-time payments from their followers. The test is currently limited to a subset of eligible accounts including creators, journalists, experts and nonprofits. Twitter has also launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/twitter-starts-to-roll-out-paid-ticketed-spaces-on-ios/">Ticketed Spaces</a> for its live audio rooms feature to let creators charge anywhere from one dollar to $999 for advanced ticketing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zeitmedical.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zeit Medical</a>, which makes an early warning system for strokes during sleep, has raised $2 million in a seed round just after leaving Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2021 cohort. The company&#8217;s work suggests the brain-monitoring headband could save lives by alerting people to possible strokes hours before they might otherwise be noticed, and the new funding will help propel them toward commercial availability.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s device is a soft headband with a lightweight electroencephalogram (EEG) in it. It works with a smartphone app to analyze brain activity and, using a machine learning model trained by human experts, watch for signs of an impending stroke.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/zeits-early-warning-wearable-for-sleep-strokes-could-save-hours-and-lives/">I wrote up Zeit&#8217;s system in detail in August</a>, and little has changed since then, though co-founder and CEO (and now <a href="https://www.fogartyinnovation.org/ferolyn-fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ferolyn fellow</a>) Orestis Vardoulis noted that a usage study found that people wore the headband on 90% of nights, including people using <span id="m_4638394149977372911docs-internal-guid-db6a6661-7fff-7e2d-b808-61cc14fd9c7c">CPAP </span>machines, and there were few complaints about fit or comfort. Consistent usage is important if the goal of mitigating the effect of strokes is to be achieved, and an uncomfortable or bulky headband would certainly affect that negatively.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226042" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Besides pushing hard on getting the product finalized and ready to be tested in our upcoming studies, we have also been experimenting with different applications of our AI in the inpatient setting. Many intensive care unit patients require close ischemia monitoring,&#8221; Vardoulis said. Various conditions can potentially be warned of by the model Zeit has created that would otherwise need an expert or a dedicated system to diagnose. &#8220;We have approached several large national academic centers that monitor their subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with EEG to understand if this would be an acceptable application for our technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vardoulis said the stroke survivor community has been very interested in the device, and even on our coverage people in the comments noted how useful the device might be to them. For anyone wondering how they can get hold of a device, it may be a while — Zeit is charging toward FDA clearance and has received &#8220;Breakthrough designation,&#8221; a sort of fast track, but it may still be a year or two before it&#8217;s widely available.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s still a remarkably short lead time for a medical device, and investors clearly thought this was an opportunity for both impact and ROI.</p>
<p>The $2 million round was co-led by SeedtoB and Digilife, with participation from Y Combinator, Gaingels, Northsouth Ventures, Tamar Capital, Axial, Citta Capital, as well as angels Greg Badros, Theodore Rekatsinas and a few others in the medical world.</p>
<p>The money will be used, as you might expect, to continue and expand operations, building the team and funding the studies prerequisite to FDA consideration and approval. With luck, Zeit&#8217;s device could be standard issue as early as 2023 to anyone at risk of a stroke.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Denver-based startups raised around $2.7 billion in all of 2020. The same data set says that startups in the city have raised $3.1 billion through Q3 of 2021 — more capital in less time.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As startup funding increases around the world, The Exchange has poked its head into markets as far-flung as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/investors-say-indian-startup-funding-could-get-even-hotter-after-record-q3/">Southeast Asia</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/the-european-vc-market-is-so-hot-it-may-skip-its-summer-holiday/">Europe</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">Africa</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/vcs-say-there-are-more-startup-opportunities-to-chase-in-latin-america/">Latin America</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">elsewhere</a>. Wherever we looked, we&#8217;ve found venture capital flowing in record quantities.</p>
<p>The story has been largely the same inside the United States, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bostons-startup-market-is-more-than-setting-records-in-scorching-start-to-year/">Boston</a> having a solid year, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/from-the-american-heartland-a-startup-boom/">the Midwest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/atlantas-sundry-startups-join-in-global-vc-funding-boom/">Atlanta</a>. Denver, our focus this morning, is similar.</p>
<p>After digging through recent venture capital data via <a href="https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Q3_2021_PitchBook-NVCA_Venture_Monitor.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> and <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CB Insights</a> and talking to a few companies in the area, we discovered something notable: Venture capital results are rising in Denver after the city and its near-neighbor Boulder had attracted huge investment from the biggest technology companies.</p>

<h2>A brief history lesson</h2>
<p>If you read megatech earnings reports, you’ll sometimes get a look at how many folks work for the majors. It’s a lot of people. For example, Alphabet recently <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q3_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disclosed that</a> it closed Q3 2021 with just over 150,000 employees, up from a few more than 132,000 in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Denver has attracted more than a slice of interest from names like Microsoft, which has a <a href="https://www.dailycamera.com/2010/11/16/microsoft-moving-boulder-operations-to-downtown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-standing presence in Boulder</a>, about 40 miles away. Google <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/photo-essays/2018-02-23/inside-google-s-131-million-boulder-campus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped $131 million on a Boulder campus</a> back in 2018, to add another nearby example to our list. (Some tech companies solve the commute issue between the two cities by <a href="https://www.builtincolorado.com/2018/04/12/colorado-tech-companies-boulder-denver-offices-colorado" target="_blank" rel="noopener">operating offices in both locations</a>.)</p>
<p>Inside Denver, Facebook started hiring back in 2017, the Denver Business Journal notes, <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2018/11/15/facebook-officially-opens-denver-office.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opening an office in the city the following year</a>, when Microsoft also <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2018/05/03/microsoft-denver-tech-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built a technology center in Denver</a>. Zoom <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2016/02/22/1311048/0/en/Zoom-Expanding-With-New-Denver-Office.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed up in Denver back in 2016</a>, notably,</p>
<p>The city is also attracting folks in what we might call tech&#8217;s middle tier. Michigan-based Service Express <a href="https://serviceexpress.com/about-us/newsroom/service-express-announces-new-office-opening-in-denver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened an office in Denver in 2016</a>, indicating that the city is not merely a place for the coasts to snag talent and rent offices.</p>
<p>More to our interests, the largest Denver technology employers have familiar names. Per a <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/subscriber-only/2021/03/26/2021-largest-denver-area-tech-employers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list compiled by the Denver Business Journal</a>, HR platform Gusto and edtech startup Guild Education are two companies with among the largest staffs in the city. The publication reckoned this March that Gusto had 800 of its 1,400 staffers in Denver, while Guild had 650 of its 768 workers in Denver earlier this year.</p>
<p>Digging into Denver and Boulder&#8217;s history painted a far richer picture of historical technology investment than we anticipated. It underscores just how broad tech is moving that so many companies have put down roots in the Denver area. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOB4VdlkzO4">Rocky Mountain High</a> indeed!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gone are the days when your A/C and washer/dryer were the movers and shakers (electrically speaking) in your house. These days, electric vehicle chargers, solar power and battery storage solutions set more electrons a-dancin&#8217;. <a href="https://www.span.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Span</a> is one of the companies running point on adding some smarts to the process. The company today launched the Span Drive, an EV charger that is making it possible to further empower your EV based on various rules.</p>
<p>Our homes are becoming more and more electrified, and modern units, in particular, can have power draws that homes of an older design don&#8217;t have. A/C and heating, heat pumps, water heaters, washers and dryers, induction cooktops, electric ovens, EV chargers and battery-based electrical storage can draw tremendous amounts of power. In addition, more and more homes have solar installed, which means a huge chunk of electricity going in the other direction. Between all of this, our homes are getting more complex and power-hungry, but the truth is that not all of these appliances run at the same time. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This is the conundrum facing modern electric design: Your house may have a 100-ampere maximum power delivery from the grid, you may have 180 amps&#8217; worth of appliances, but you probably won&#8217;t use them all at the same time. The problem is that you have to assume that, at some point, the homeowner will turn every appliance on at once, and the power company is going to get very grumpy &#8212; at least until your main circuit breaker cuts you off. </span></p>
<p>That is one of the challenges Span solves. The company launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/span-introduces-a-new-home-electric-panel/">smart home electric panel</a> in May, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/span-the-smart-fusebox-replacement-founded-by-an-ex-tesla-engineer-gets-an-alexa-upgrade/">announced a $20 million funding round a few months earlier</a>. Today, it launches the Span Drive, a $500 electric car charger that extends the functionality of the $3,500 electric panel with some extra smarts targeted at one of the most power-hungry devices in a modern home: the electric vehicle.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224431" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are able to allow homes to continue to add electric appliances without having to bear the cost and time expense of upgrading the service from 100 to 200 amps, or from 200 to 400,&#8221; says Arch Rao, Span&#8217;s CEO.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not so much just that the panel is upgraded. We&#8217;re fundamentally rethinking what that device in our home needs to be, to enable much better power management and integration of clean energy and electric devices. The traditional panel was doing a very good job of being a safety device: It used to be the device where your power came in and got distributed out to different appliances and circuits in your home. And if your circuits were operating at a level that was unsafe, it would shut off the circuit. This is what a breaker does, and that hasn&#8217;t really evolved in about 100 years: It&#8217;s serving as a passive safety device,&#8221; explains Rao. &#8220;The location where the breaker panel sits is the most obvious place for innovation to happen: The panel sits at the intersection of the grid and all the things in your home. That isn&#8217;t just your appliances, but your solar system, your electric vehicles, your storage system, etc. The new panel that we&#8217;ve built performs the function of a passive safety device but does an order of magnitude more than that, in that it is the device that can safely disconnect or reconnect into the grid.&#8221;</p>
<p>This connecting to and from the grid aspect is key for people who want to try to live off the grid. Being able to turn a home into an island, at least electrically speaking, is one of the things that makes Span&#8217;s systems so interesting, from a future-proofing point of view. It also means that the panel can make your home operate independently for longer during a power outage. In a home with power-storage solutions installed it can get extra clever. When the panel detects a power cut, it can turn off non-essential electric devices. For example, it might turn off your thermostat to keep your fridge and freezer running for as long as possible so your food doesn&#8217;t go bad.</p>

<p>The system can be controlled with an app, which enables you to set up &#8220;rules&#8221; for how you want your house to operate. For example, you could choose for the A/C to run only when it can be powered by solar. Or you could choose to pump 48A into your car for an hour to fast-charge it, while the panel shuts off power to some of your other high-draw devices to keep the total power consumption under 100 amps. The reverse use case is also possible: Charge the car as fast as possible, with as many amps as you can, and if you put on a load of laundry, your A/C and you start making dinner with your electric oven and induction stove-top, the Span Drive simply drops the electric current that&#8217;s available to your car until your kids are fed and your clothes smell like lavender and group hugs again.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you use your EV only rarely, you could program the Span Drive to only ever charge your car with solar power. Undoubtedly, this is a smugness multiplier for Tesla owners wanting to beat Ferraris off the stoplights in your own local reproduction of &#8220;Tokyo Drift: Less Vroom, More Whine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, the Span panel itself can only turn circuits on or off, but because it knows how much power each circuit is drawing, it would be possible to use additional devices to get more granular control over your home. That&#8217;s probably part of the thinking from Amazon, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/span-the-smart-fusebox-replacement-founded-by-an-ex-tesla-engineer-gets-an-alexa-upgrade/">it participated in Span&#8217;s recent investment round</a> &#8212; and the company announced Alexa compatibility.</p>
<p>In a way, it feels as if Span is adding a lot of smarts to a traditionally dumb part of the home. Power is about as un-sexy as it comes, but as appliances get smarter and the IoT wave swallows up larger and larger parts of the devices we use every day, it seems as if Span is building a micro-power-grid across your home, with discrete zones and powerful features that nobody quite knows how to use yet. To his credit, the CEO seems to be aware of that, and agrees that his company is in the middle of a land grab for the future of our homes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where we sit, we have the type of persistence that very few products do. We are on your walls and stay there for the next 30 years or so. <em>Of course</em> we are thinking about future-proofing. The functionality we offer today is differentiated from anything our competitors are doing. Being focused on the future makes us fundamentally better than incumbent solutions,&#8221; argues Rao.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber, Lyft, Spin, Bird, Lime and other mobility companies have been working with cities to develop a set of guidelines over how to protect riders&#8217; data.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.mobilitydataprivacyprinciples.org/#principles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Privacy Principles for Mobility Data</a>, which were presented at the <a href="http://nabsa.net/webinars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual North American Bikeshare &amp; Scootershare Association (NABSA) conference</a> on Thursday, marks a new level of cooperation between cities and companies that have previously clashed over transit data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidelines were developed through a collaboration of more than 20 cities, privacy advocates, technology companies, mobility service providers and organizations like NABSA, t<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he New Urban Mobility Alliance (NUMO) and Open Mobility Foundation (OMF)</span>.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226143" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>New technologies have both enabled and enhanced the transportation ecosystem, and with those new technologies come scores of data on how people move. Cities, understandably, want a piece of that data so they can create policies and regulations that are informed by how private businesses are operating in the public right of way.</p>
<p>Regulators learned too late after the advent of ride-hailing how difficult it would be to get private companies to share much-needed data about how services are used and the impacts on communities, labor laws and climate goals.</p>
<p>&#8220;The history of ride-hail in cities is one in which city governments largely were cut out from having regulatory oversight over the services as they were deployed and often didn&#8217;t even have the most basic data about how those services were operating on public streets,&#8221; said <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jascha Franklin-Hodge, executive director of OMF, during the NABSA conference</span>.</p>
<p>Uber was founded in 2009, and Lyft just three years later. It took until about <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/uber-nacto-data-sharing/">2018 for Uber, for example, to give into sharing data</a> regarding curb use, traffic speeds and general transit data in order to help cities plan how to use the limited and shared spaces better.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When micromobility hit the scene, we saw cities across the country get ahead of it and say, &#8216;Instead of coming to companies after the fact, let&#8217;s be proactive,'&#8221; Angela Giacchetti, OMF&#8217;s member engagement manager, told TechCrunch. &#8220;So they got more information from operators on the basics, like where they&#8217;re deploying vehicles in the public right of way, where the vehicles are being parked, how is it putting stress on the infrastructure, where do we need more safety infrastructure?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Department of Transportation started that trend back in 2019 <a href="https://www.axios.com/uber-scooter-data-privacy-battle-los-angeles-962f2f01-7146-4f33-9ebc-7f5eabd271f2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when it introduced the &#8220;mobility data specification,&#8221;</a> (MDS) a data-sharing format created so that transit agencies can collect vehicle data from scooter and bike companies while also sending them information, like where to put geofences based on street closures. LADOT made sharing via MDS a requirement for scooter and bike-share companies, and the ride-hail industry fought back on behalf of its scooter subsidiaries, largely because they saw cities having access to company data as a slippery slope. If they have to share their scooter data, next it will be their ride-hail data, and that would put companies like Uber and Lyft in a position where they might have to actually work with cities to prioritize the community rather than their own business.</p>
<p>Uber, Lyft and privacy advocates like the Center for Democracy and Technology and the Electronic Frontier Foundation<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-uber-fighting-cities-data-about-scooters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> objected to LA&#8217;s use of MDS</a> during a public comment period, arguing that the LADOT doesn&#8217;t answer how it intends to de-identify data or how they will use the information.</p>
<p>Now that things have simmered down a bit and everyone has had a chance to talk things through, many of the same stakeholders have come together to build strong protection frameworks that ensure we&#8217;re not sacrificing essential privacy rights as our lives, and our movements, become more digitized.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anytime there&#8217;s a situation in which data is being shared, especially data about movement is being shared, between a private sector entity and the public sector, there&#8217;s a need for guardrails. There&#8217;s a need for clear guidelines around how to protect privacy, what uses and types of data are appropriate. So that really is the core of why we&#8217;re doing this work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seven principles are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will uphold the rights of individuals to privacy in their movements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will ensure community engagement and input, especially from those that have been historically marginalized, as we define our purposes, practices, and policies related to mobility data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will communicate our purposes, practices, and policies around mobility data to the people and communities we serve.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will collect and retain the minimum amount of mobility data that is necessary to fulfill our purposes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will establish policies and practices that protect mobility data privacy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will protect privacy when sharing mobility data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will clearly and specifically define our purposes for working with mobility data.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, setting these guidelines is only a start, and will require momentum and accountability to ensure both governments and operators are adhering to the standards.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Based on my work with bikeshare programs and also working with cities on privacy I think the absolute biggest challenge is the fact that even when cities implement these types of principles there is very little transparency and trust with how the data is being used with/from the public,&#8221; Tamika Butler, community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer, told TechCrunch. &#8220;But the big picture: I love these and think they are important, but the real work comes from implementation, accountability and transparency. It has to go beyond being performative with statements, pledges and sign-ons. The process of how these principles are delivered and implemented is what matters. And then how do we support cities to do this work and not allow them to be villianized by operators who don&#8217;t have the same public interest at the heart of their capitalist business models.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Giacchetti agrees that there&#8217;s not yet a prescriptive way to use these principles, but says they were created to be engaged with and enacted within each organization that endorses them. The creators of the principles are inviting organizations from both the public and private sectors to endorse and engage with the principles, and ultimately use them to inform transportation policies and mobility data practices.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">This past April, Toyota <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-bz4x-suv-concept-202644349.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1"><ins>teased the bZ4X</ins></a>, the first of seven “Beyond Zero” fully electric vehicles the automaker said it would debut by 2025. Other than to reveal it was working with Subaru to develop the SUV and that it would include its upcoming e-TNGA powertrain, the company didn’t share many details about the bZ4X. On Friday, it changed that by unveiling the <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/toyota/36254760.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">production version of the vehicle</a>.</p>
<p>Toyota will offer the bZ4X in front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive variants. The former will feature a single 150 kW capable of accelerating the car from zero to 100 kilometers per hour in 8.4 seconds. Per the WLTC standard, the automaker claims the FWD model’s 71.4 kWh battery will allow it to travel approximately 500 kilometers or 310 miles on a single charge. Expect that estimate to decrease once the EPA tests the car. It’s also worth noting these measurements come from the Japanese model, which may end up featuring different specifications to whatever model(s) Toyota releases in the US.</p>

<p>The battery will support 150 kW DC fast charging, allowing it to go from dead to 80 percent after about 30 minutes of charging. As for the AWD model, it will feature two 80kW motors, one built into each axle, for a total power output of 160 kW. It can accelerate from zero to 100 kilometers per hour in 7.7 seconds. Toyota estimates the ranges of the AWD model at 460 kilometers or 285 miles on a single charge. In both variants, the battery is integrated into the chassis, a design choice the automaker helps lower the SUV’s center of gravity and improve the rigidity of the chassis.</p>
<p>Toyota also plans to equip the bZ4X with some nifty extra features. One of those is a solar roof the automaker says will generate about 1120 miles worth of free power generation. It will also offer a steer-by-wire system that removes the mechanical connection between the steering wheel and front wheels. Both features will be available in select models.</p>
<p>The bZ4X will debut in the US and other markets in mid-2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Patreon CEO and co-founder Jack Conte and Chief Product Officer Julian Gutman spoke on a panel at The Information&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/events/creator-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 Creator Economy Summit</a> yesterday, where they were asked about the membership platform&#8217;s plans for crypto.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s clearly enormous innovation happening in the crypto and NFT space,&#8221; Gutman said. &#8220;Obviously there&#8217;s the art market and precious goods market that we&#8217;re seeing, with crazy pricing, evolve. It&#8217;s unclear if that is sustainable across the entire creator economy, but there&#8217;s some fundamental technological components to NFTs as a way to sell value to your audience and sort of continue to gain value from that from secondary sales as what you do becomes more and more important to the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, Patreon <a href="https://blog.patreon.com/fall-2021-creator-policy-engagement-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floated the idea</a> of creator coins to its creator community in advance of a quarterly<a href="https://blog.patreon.com/announcing-our-new-creator-policy-engagement-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Creator Policy Engagement Program</a> livestream, which allows creators to weigh in on platform policy changes. But the concept was proposed alongside a more pressing crisis related to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/patreon-to-roll-out-tools-to-help-its-adult-creators-meet-mastercards-new-standards/">Mastercard&#8217;s new standards</a> for adult content, which prevented the company from engaging in a more in-depth conversation with creators about the topic.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226001" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re right now not talking about creating any type of initial coin offering, which is specifically not allowed under Patreon&#8217;s current guidelines,&#8221; Laurent Crenshaw, Patreon&#8217;s head of Policy, had said on the Patreon Connect livestream. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve heard from a number of creators who have been interested in the opportunity to offer exclusive memberships and benefits to their patrons through a coin or token, a digital item that they can hold onto that shows that they are part of your fan club. And so we thought that at the very least, we could explore the opportunity of making that type of offering allowable under our guidelines.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Patreon allows creators to share personal investment stories or advice, its guidelines currently prohibit coins for the purpose of the direct financial benefit for a creator or patron, coins offered as part of an investment scheme, or any explicit incentives to purchase or obtain cryptocurrency. But if creators were to express interest in offering creator coins, Patreon would consider changing these policies.</p>
<p>A creator coin is a kind of crypto-based social currency &#8212; companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/crypto-social-network-bitclout-arrives-with-a-bevy-of-high-profile-investors-and-skeptics/">BitClout</a>, <a href="https://tryroll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roll</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/rally-raises-17m-to-expand-a-platform-that-lets-you-invest-in-but-not-buy-collectibles/">Rally</a> have worked on creating individual tokens, which essentially allow fans to invest in creators&#8217; success. So, if you buy a creator&#8217;s token early, and then they become a superstar, you reap benefits too.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing that I think Patreon has always been committed to at its core is making sure that we&#8217;re creating a sustainable, long-term path for creators, right? It&#8217;s not just a burst of monetization,&#8221; Gutman said at The Information&#8217;s summit. &#8220;So I think we&#8217;re certainly interested in evaluating and understanding how NFTs or some of the underlying technologies help us create that sustainable long-term earnings for creators. But I think when it comes to the hype around sales of individual assets and what not&#8230; not that we wouldn&#8217;t offer that if we felt it was really valuable to creators, as part of the broader portfolio of what they can offer&#8230; but I think for us, really thinking through how we&#8217;re continuing to ensure we&#8217;re creating a sustainable recurring future for creators is why we&#8217;re evaluating the crypto space more broadly.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some crypto initiatives are focused on offering more ownership to creators over their work &#8212; for instance, an artist will continue to earn royalties on an NFT every time it is sold, while the same usually isn&#8217;t true for more conventional fine artists.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I will say about crypto and NFTs in general is I really love the idea of creators owning their media and owning their content. I love the idea of creators having leverage and control. I love the idea of creators owning their audience data instead of platforms. I love the idea of a lot of this underlying infrastructure empowering creators for independence. I love the idea of shifting power away from institutions and toward individual creative people,&#8221; Conte said during yesterday&#8217;s event. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s what a lot of this technology is getting at, and what I think is really deeply exciting about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, many creators winced at the idea of Patreon adding the ability for creators to dabble in crypto when it was proposed last month, mostly due to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/the-debate-about-cryptocurrency-and-energy-consumption/">environmental cost</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea of adding crypto worries me, because the reputation of crypto in artist communities is absolutely destroyed, even if it is beneficial at face value. I worry I would lose patrons due to them not agreeing with Patreon&#8217;s use of adding crypto to the platform,&#8221; a creator wrote in a public chat on the livestream.</p>
<p>The Information&#8217;s Laura Mandaro, who moderated the panel, asked Conte if Patreon has any full-time employees working on crypto.</p>
<p>&#8220;No comment is what I will say about that, but we&#8217;re thinking about it,&#8221; Conte said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Europol and its law enforcement partners have disrupted a network of organized cybercriminals behind a string of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attacks that has claimed more than 1,800 victims across 71 countries since 2019.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s police agency <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/12-targeted-for-involvement-in-ransomware-attacks-against-critical-infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said on Friday</a> that 12 individuals had been “targeted” in raids in Ukraine and Switzerland this week following a two-year investigation. The agency didn’t say whether these individuals had been arrested or charged, and has yet to respond to our request for more information.</p>
<p>The unnamed individuals were “known for specifically targeting large corporations, effectively bringing their business to a standstill,” Europol said. One of the ransomware strains the group used was LockerGoga, the same strain used in the attack against Norwegian aluminum processor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/norsk-hydro-ransomware/">Norsk Hydro</a> in March 2019. The cyberattack forced the company’s plants across two continents to stop production for almost a week and cost Norsk Hydro more than $50 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226308" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In <a href="https://www.politiet.no/nn/aktuelt-tall-og-fakta/aktuelt/nyheter/2021/10/29/kripos-del-av-stor-aksjon-mot-organiserte-digitale-kriminelle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a separate press release</a>, Norway’s National Criminal Investigation Service, commonly known as Kripos, confirmed that the targeted individuals were responsible for the Norsk Hydro attack.</p>
<p>Europol said the hackers also deployed the ransomware MegaCortex and Dharma, as well as malware like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/12/trickbot-spam-millions-emails/">TrickBot</a> and post-exploitation tools including Cobalt Strike and PowerShell Empire, to stay undetected and gain further access. &#8220;The criminals would then lay undetected in the compromised systems, sometimes for months, probing for more weaknesses in the IT networks before moving on to monetizing the infection by deploying a ransomware,&#8221; Europol said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how much money the criminals made through their attacks, though Europol said it seized $52,000 in cash and five luxury vehicles.</p>
<p>“Most of these suspects are considered high-value targets because they are being investigated in multiple high-profile cases in different jurisdictions,” Europol said. “The targeted suspects all had different roles in these professional, highly organized criminal organizations.”</p>
<p>Europol added that a number of the individuals are suspected of being in charge of laundering the ransom payments: “They would funnel the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> ransom payments through mixing services, before cashing out the ill-gotten gains,” Europol said.</p>
<p>Europol said law enforcement agencies from Norway, France, the U.K., Switzerland, Germany, Ukraine, the Netherlands and the U.S. participated in this week’s operation, with more than 50 foreign investigators deployed to Ukraine on October 26 to target the cybercriminals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spot works hard and plays hard. In its latest video, Boston Dynamics’ quadrupedal workhorse invokes the Jagger swagger in tribute to the 40th anniversary of The Rolling Stones’ Tattoo You album. “Spot Me Up” finds a quartet of Spot robots doing their best to mimic the 1981 “Start Me Up” music video.</p>
<p>Viral videos, of course, have been an important marketing tool for Boston Dynamics for years now &#8212; and the feats have only become more impressive as the robots have grown more sophisticated. The Stones, too, have had their dalliances with tech marketing. In fact, the band licensed “Start Me Up” for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0AJM6HMYjM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a well-known Windows 95 campaign</a> in the mid-90s, when selling songs to corporate commercials wasn’t the ubiquitous activity it is these days.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnZH4izf_rI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226309" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The split screen finds the robots doing their thing as the video plays, with the Stones at peak spandex form (RIP Charlie Watts, always the best dressed of the bunch). The track “Start Me Up” reportedly took The Stones six hours to record &#8212; no word on how long it took to choreograph the Rolling Spots, though, as we’ve seen,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/atlas-slugged/"> a lot goes into a minute and a half video</a>, moves like Jagger or no.</p>
<p>The video drops during a time of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/guns-on-robots/">increased scrutiny of autonomous robotic systems</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hellosalted.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salted</a>, a Los Angeles-based startup creating digitally native quick-service restaurant brands, brought in a new round of $16 million in Series A funding to continue its nationwide expansion.</p>
<p>The company was founded seven years ago by CEO Jeff Applebaum, but a focus on providing healthy QSR brands and going after the <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/food-delivery-app-profits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$325 billion food delivery space</a> came about three years ago. Applebaum told TechCrunch that he aims to be “the Yum! Brands for the digital age.”</p>
<p>Salted has created six brands so far, including moonbowls, Califlower Pizza and lulubowls, and serves food from Chinese takeout to pizza to salads.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225919" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Our technology and Salted Analytics product helps us grow at the rate we want to and still maintain customer experience,” Applebaum said. “We don’t consider ourselves a ghost kitchen, but a builder of budding brands that are going to be around for a hundred years. The great value is going to be in the brand layer, similar to Domino’s and Panda Express, which are scaling brands that people love.”</p>
<p>Creadev led the Series A that also included Proof Ventures and B. Riley Financial. The new investment joins with a $4 million seed round raised in May. At that time, Applebaum was using the funds for growth, and that strategy will continue with this new funding toward his goal of “building the next Chipotle,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has over 200 employees, including kitchen staff, and recently opened its 19th location. It is serving food in seven states, including California, Illinois and Ohio, and each location operates four to six brands. Applebaum expects to have over 50 locations by next year.</p>
<p>The locations are already collectively showing profitably and are generating between $1 million and $2.5 million in annual sales, he added.</p>
<p>Adrien Lejal, investment director at Creadev, said he was attracted to Salted because the company “doesn’t take shortcuts in the healthier food options and stands true to its mission, which speaks to the values of the team.”</p>
<p>He has been following the company for about 18 months and decided to jump in when the company started raising its A round. The QSR space isn’t one Creadev typically invests in, but Lejal said it does invest across the food chain and in companies that have “huge scalability potential,” and Salted was an interesting example, he added.</p>
<p>“The company as it is now was founded in 2018 and is already operating in seven states and combines scalability with execution, quality and speed,” Lejal said. “We also definitely invest in people first and Jeff’s leadership and management style is very impressive in the way he is reaching milestones in a short period of time.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Social Chat was founded on the premise that social commerce should be the standard for every store, and it may very well be soon.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When brands sell through social media and other third-parties, they often spend millions of dollars to advertise on those platforms, yet have little or no knowledge of who their customers actually are. Social commerce startup <a href="https://socialchat.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Chat</a> is out to change that.</p>
<p>Frost Li, the former head of growth at Wish, founded the company in May to create software that leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence for personalization, recommendations and live customer service — all to enable brands to convert lost social engagement into revenue and customer acquisition without having to rely on a big engineering team.</p>
<p>“While at Wish, we learned that to offer the right shopping experience, you had to do absolute personalization,” Li told TechCrunch. “That was done with machine learning engineers, but when I left Wish and was advising brands, I found that what we had at Wish was rare. People were doing things manually and could not do personalization as much as a result.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225898" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>She aims to mimic the customer experience you might receive in-store working with a favorite salesperson, but in the digital world, and allow consumers to purchase and transact during the social events, she added.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9vOP1dYkGG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-acquisitions/">Can social and e-commerce transform the future of the open web?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Can social and e-commerce transform the future of the open web?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-acquisitions/embed/#?secret=9vOP1dYkGG" data-secret="9vOP1dYkGG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Li believes that social commerce should be the standard for every store, and it may very well be soon. Earlier this year, Grand View Research reported that the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/social-commerce-market-size-worth-3-369-8-billion-by-2028--cagr-28-4-grand-view-research-inc-301207167.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global social commerce market</a> was forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion by 2028 from growing annually by over 28% between now and then.</p>
<p>“Online shopping is very transactional right now, but we help construct, over time, a long-term relationship through social interaction with customers,” she added.</p>
<p>As it launches its e-commerce customer engagement and revenue software, Social Chat also announced a $6 million seed round co-led by Race Capital and Gradient Ventures and that included Kevin Lin, co-founder of Twitch; Tony Zhao, founder of Agora.io; Ran Makavy, former chief product officer at Lyft; Alanna Gregory, global head of engagement at AfterPay; and Jack Xie, vice president of engineering at Wish.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225908" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225908" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2225908 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Social-Chat-Team.png?w=680" alt="Social Chat" width="680" height="396" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Social-Chat-Team.png 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Social-Chat-Team.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Social-Chat-Team.png?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Social-Chat-Team.png?resize=768,447 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Social-Chat-Team.png?resize=680,396 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Social-Chat-Team.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225908" class="wp-caption-text">Social Chat team, from left, Richard Lin, Pearl Tsang, Frost Li and Michael Chen. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Social Chat</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Edith Yeung, partner at Race Capital, says the future of shopping will be social — children are watching less television and more TikTok, so brands need to take control of their data so they don’t lose their audience to another platform.</p>
<p>“What Frost is doing is giving power back to the brands so that they can shift customers back to their own websites to convert them to sales, that is why Shopify is doing so well,” she added. “Facebook is trying to get people to trust them again, but companies are still at their mercy to keep paying millions, but they don’t know who their customers are.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Social Chat previously raised $200,000 and will use the new funding to hire more AI and ML engineers to expand its product offerings.</p>
<p>Though it is a fairly new company and too early to see concrete growth metrics, Social Chat is already working with customers like HTC and 10 other brands and seeing some early traction.</p>
<p>As Li watches the social commerce market grow into a multitrillion-dollar market and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/the-demise-of-browser-cookies-could-create-a-golden-age-of-digital-marketing/">technical part of tracking going away</a>, it will provide the company an opportunity to scale and solve problems for its users.</p>
<p>“We are differentiating ourselves with the AI play so that you can see value, but don’t have to keep paying Facebook to keep your users,” she said. “When Google gets rid of the cookies, it is going to be crazy: you will have to really own the first-party data to communicate with users, or you will lose visibility.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google and top Indian telecom network Jio Platforms said on Friday that their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/google-and-jio-platforms-announce-worlds-cheapest-smartphone-jiophone-next/">much-anticipated budget smartphone, JioPhone Next,</a> will go on sale in the world&#8217;s second-largest smartphone market on November 4 (coinciding with the big Indian festival of Diwali). The firms said the JioPhone Next will cost 6,499 Indian rupees ($87), and can also be purchased in multiple instalments with an entry price as low as $27.</p>
<p>The smartphone runs Pragati OS, which is powered by an &#8220;extremely optimized&#8221; Android mobile operating system with a range of customized features such as Read Aloud and Translate Now that will work with any text on the phone screen, including web pages, apps, messages and even photos, as well as support for 10 Indian languages.</p>
<p>&#8220;Among the many rich features of JioPhone Next, the one that has impressed me the most — and one that will empower common Indians the most and take their digital journeys to the next level — is its contribution to India’s linguistic integration. India’s unique strength is our linguistic diversity. Those Indians who might not be able to read content in English or in their language can get it translated, and even read out, in their own language on this smart device,&#8221; said Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, which operates Jio Platforms.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226279" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The two firms also revealed the specifications of the JioPhone Next. The smartphone features a 5.45-inch HD+ display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. It is powered by Qualcomm&#8217;s quad-core QM-215 chipset that clocks up to 1.3GHz, coupled with 2GB of RAM and 32GB internal storage, which is expandable. The dual-SIM capable JioPhone Next, which houses a 3,500 mAh battery, features a 13-megapixel rear camera with support for HDR and an 8-megapixel selfie sensor.</p>

His firm has grown extremely bullish in India in recent years. Last year, the company announced it will invest $10 billion in India over the course of next five to seven years. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>The JioPhone Next is Google&#8217;s latest attempt at reaching the masses in developing markets. The Android-maker has launched several programs over the past decade, including Android One to deliver budget smartphones with improved user experience. At an event in India in 2017, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai noted that many markets such as India need phones at a price point of $30 for mass adoption.</p>
<p>&#8220;The JioPhone Next is an affordable smartphone designed for India, inspired by the belief that everyone in India should benefit from the opportunities the internet creates. To build it, our teams had to work together to solve complex engineering and design challenges, and I’m excited to see how millions of people will use these devices to better their lives and communities,&#8221; he said in a statement Friday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Analysts have said in recent months that the JioPhone Next could disrupt the Indian smartphone market — the world’s second largest — and help the telecom network, which has amassed over 400 million subscribers and last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">raised over $20 billion from a range of marquee investors including Google and Facebook</a>, further solidify its dominance in the country.</p>
<p>The JioPhone Next &#8212; which was originally scheduled to launch in the second week of September, but the two firms had to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/jiophone-next-launch-delayed-november-google-reliance-india/">delay the sale citing global chip shortage</a> &#8212; is aimed at helping roughly 300 million users in India who are still on a 2G network upgrade their gadget to access faster networks, Ambani said at an event earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am delighted that Google and Jio teams have succeeded in bringing this breakthrough device to Indian consumers in time for the festival season, inspite of the current global supply chain challenges caused by the Covid pandemic. I have always been a firm believer in the power of the Digital Revolution to enrich, enable and empower the lives of 1.35 billion Indians. We have done it in the past with connectivity. Now we are enabling it again with a smartphone device,&#8221; he said in a statement Friday.</p>

App developer Steve Moser found the image inside the company&#8217;s app used to control its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Ray-Ban Stories</a> AR sunglasses, hinting that it could also be used to control the watch in the future.</p>

<p>In addition to having rounded corners and a camera, the smartwatch appears to have a stainless steel casing and detachable straps.

<p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Meta is hoping to launch a smartwatch as early as 2022, but nothing has been finalized yet. Further, Facebook&#8217;s parent company is reportedly already working on three generations of product that will be released at different times. It&#8217;s not clear if the device shown in the image is one of those, or if it will even be released at all. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526266/facebook-smartwatch-two-cameras-heart-rate-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>The Verge</em></a> also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-smartwatch-camera-detachable-heart-rate-monitor-184825648.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">reported</a> earlier this year, though, that Facebook is working on a smartwatch with a front-facing and a 1080p rear camera with autofocus. It could have a heart rate monitor and LTE connectivity, as well, though those features could be distributed across the three different models.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A spokesperson at Kurly said the IPO is likely to be in June after it files an IPO application as early as December and expects to get approval in February by South Korean financial authorities. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kurly has reviewed its listing in the U.S. but changed the plan to a Korean IPO. The company, which will continue to focus on its business in the home market, does not have an overseas expansion plan, and that’s one of the reasons why Kurly will list in South Korea, the spokesperson at Kurly told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">South Korean authorities have eased IPO requirements for Korea-based startups to attract them to get listed on the domestic bourse after Korean e-commerce company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/coupang-follows-roblox-to-a-strong-first-day-of-trading/">Coupang listed</a> on the New York Stock Exchange early this year.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beta Finance, a decentralized finance protocol that has developed a one-click solution for lending, borrowing and shorting of any crypto asset, said on Friday it has raised $5.75 million across its private and public launchpad investments rounds.</p>
<p>The private investment round was led by Sequoia Capital India. ParaFi Capital, DeFiance Capital, Spartan Group, GSR, Delphi Digital and Multicoin Capital also participated.</p>
<p>The startup, founded by Allen Lee, is attempting to make it easier for users to short a crypto coin to fight the price volatility and also give them another avenue to hedge their risk.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226238" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Existing DeFi protocols only support the borrowing and shorting of a very limited selection of mature crypto assets &#8212; leaving the vast majority of such tokens inaccessible to users.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.betafinance.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beta Finance</a>, which is built atop the Ethereum blockchain, says it is filling this inefficiency by creating what it calls the first user-friendly protocol that offers a wider choice and functionality.</p>
<p>Its one-click solution enables traders without technical know-how to manage and update their short positions on any token with all relevant token information directly available on the interface to guide their decision. &#8220;Users can short many of the most volatile assets neglected by existing money markets, which helps offset volatility, hedge risk and gain healthier returns,&#8221; the startup said.</p>
<p>“We see short selling as a critical piece of financial infrastructure that has been missing from the DeFi protocol,” said Lee in an interview with TechCrunch. “For DeFi to replace traditional finance, we believe that it’s necessary to build tools such as short selling.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Beta Finance, whose coin BETA trades on Binance, &#8220;has the potential to be a category-defining protocol,&#8221; said Pieter Kemps, principal at Sequoia India, in a statement.</p>
<p>The startup says within the first month of its platform&#8217;s launch, it had processed more than 10,000 deposits, 1,000 borrows and 500 short positions for over 10,000 unique addresses. The protocol had an average total value locked of over $195 million, the startup said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to being the pioneer for one-click shorting, Beta has already proven its ability to accommodate a diverse range of assets (including volatile ones) while remaining secure by becoming the very first protocol to short an NFT when it enabled short-selling for the $NFD token, just a week after launching the protocol. We are very optimistic that Beta will become a key stakeholder for the DeFi ecosystem going forward,&#8221; said Kemps.</p>
<p>Beta Finance will deploy the fresh capital to broaden its product offerings and hire more talent, Lee said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German technology and parts supplier Robert Bosch GmbH will invest another €400 million ($467 million) to expand its chip manufacturing facilities in response to the ongoing semiconductor shortage that has wreaked havoc on the production of everything from vehicles and appliances to personal computers and power tools.</p>
<p>The boosted expenditure, which is earmarked for 2022, will go toward expanding operations at the company’s wafer fabrication plants in Dresden and Reutlingen, Germany, and its semiconductor component facility in Penang, Malaysia. The majority of the funds will be used to increase manufacturing capacity at the Dresden site, which the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/bosch-opens-1-2-billion-chip-plant-in-germany/">opened in June</a> at a cost of €1 billion ($1.2 billion), the single largest investment in its history. That facility produces 300-millimeter wafers, a larger size that yields more individual chips per wafer.</p>
<p>Around €50 million will be spent in Reutlingen in both 2022 and 2023, where the company has been making semiconductor components since 1970. There, Bosch will expand its &#8220;cleanroom&#8221; &#8212; a specially engineered environment where the silicon wafers are made into semiconductor chips &#8212; by more than 4,000 square meters (about 43,000 square feet), to a total of 14,500 square meters (156,000 square feet). The expansion will also create 150 new jobs, according to Bosch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225855" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In Penang, Bosch will construct a new semiconductor test center, which will enter operations in 2023. The test center will take up around 14,000 square meters (150,696 square feet) initially. However, the company has the space — more than 100,000 square meters — on the Penang strip, and plans to eventually develop all of it.</p>
<p>The huge investment comes during a protracted semiconductor shortage that automotive executives and industry analysts forecast will extend into next year. Executives from both Ford Motor Company and General Motors told investors in their respective third-quarter earnings calls this week that they foresee the shortages persisting into 2022, and possibly even 2023.</p>
<p>It’s a sensible move for the company, which not only supplies automakers and other companies, but also uses its chips in-house for products such as Bosch power tools. It’s also good news for the European Union, which aims to increase domestic supply chain resilience by boosting the production of semiconductors in the EU to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/europes-digital-decade-digital-targets-2030_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-fifth of the world’s supply</a> by 2030.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is working on a new high-end VR headset codenamed Project Cambria. The company teased the device during its recent Connect conference on Thursday. It plans to release the headset sometime next year. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said it will be a separate &#8220;high-end&#8221; product from the company&#8217;s $299 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Quest 2 headset</a>. It will also cost more than that device.</p>
<p>Cambria will include capabilities that currently aren&#8217;t possible on other VR headsets. New sensors in the device will allow your virtual avatar to maintain eye contact and reflect your facial expressions. The company says that&#8217;s something that will allow people you&#8217;re interacting with virtually to get a better sense of how you&#8217;re feeling. Another focus of the headset will be mixed-reality experiences. With the help of new sensors and reconstruction algorithms, Facebook claims Cambria will have the capability to represent objects in the physical world with a sense of depth and perspective.</p>
<p>Cambria will also feature new optics that the company said will increase visual fidelity. Facebook promised to share more details about the headset next year. In the meantime, it mentioned that third-party developers are already working on experiences for the device.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226147" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
