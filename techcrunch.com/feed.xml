										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Travel tech company Hopper has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/hopper-raises-170m-and-partners-with-capital-one-on-a-new-cardholder-travel-booking-portal/">raised a $170 million Series G</a>, the company said today. Astute observers may recognize the number — that&#8217;s the same amount it raised in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/hopper-raises-170m-and-partners-with-capital-one-on-a-new-cardholder-travel-booking-portal/">Series F round</a> that closed earlier this year. These are indeed new funds, however, bringing its total raised to date to nearly $600 million, with the company now valued at over $3.5 billion. This latest round arrives as Hopper is seeing impressive growth as travel starts to surge on the recent downswings in cases in North America following large-scale Covid-19 vaccination campaigns.</p>
<p>Hopper says that its revenue is on track to surge 330% vs. last year, which is hardly surprising given that 2020 saw the depths of the pandemic and a widespread screeching halt to the bustling global travel industry. The more impressive stat is that Hopper&#8217;s revenue is already up 100% vs. its last pre-pandemic quarter, indicating the tough choices and aggressive re-prioritization of its products and business it underwent as a result of the pandemic are working well.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a looming spectre threatening the overall narrative of a travel industry bounce-back: Delta and other Covid-19 variants, which are currently driving another wave of resurgence of the disease in North America. I asked Hopper CEO and co-founder Fred Lalonde about Delta&#8217;s impact on Hopper&#8217;s business so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently, we have not seen an incremental impact of the Delta variant on Hopper’s domestic bookings,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In recent weeks, we have seen higher domestic bookings and lower international bookings on Hopper, as travelers look to stay closer to home. Since Hopper’s customer base is predominantly younger, leisure travelers and the majority of our bookings have been domestic throughout the pandemic, our domestic bookings still remain stable. &#8221;</p>
<p>Regardless of the impact on the nature of bookings, though, Lalonde notes that Hopper&#8217;s line of fintech products (something the company increasingly sees as its key differentiation) are in increasing demand as elements of uncertainty like the impact of the Delta variant enter into customer travel planning considerations.</p>
<p>We are, however, seeing increased demand for our flexible booking products in recent weeks,&#8221; Lalonde said. &#8220;In fact, purchases of Hopper’s Cancel for Any Reason are up 33% from early July, Change for Any Reason is up 9.3% from early July, and Rebooking Guarantee is up 12% in the past month, as travelers look for more flexibility and protection over their trips.&#8221;</p>
<p>These AI-powered tools offer protections against pricing fluctuations and volatility, no hassle rebooking even up to the day prior to your trip, cross-airline rebooking for missed connections and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2190388" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190388" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190388" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190388" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hopper</p></div></p>
<p>Hopper is also looking to use these newly-raised funds to further reinforce its business through increased customer support hiring (it&#8217;s already scaled the team by 200% and rolled out a suit of new automated tools that Lalonde says resolves 60% of its inbound requests &#8220;instantly&#8221;). The company intends to bring on 500 new employees in the near future, with 300 of those dedicated to customer service roles.</p>
<p>Another area of interest for Hopper with this funding is acqui-hiring: Lalonde says specific targets include teams focused on &#8220;travel, data science or engineering-heavy startups to help introduce new product offerings and fuel its international expansion.&#8221; The company&#8217;s product expansion goals include opening up home rentals on the platform, and its global ambitions include expanding to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>When it raised its Series F in March, Hopper also announced that it would be white labeling its booking products through <a href="https://cloud.hopper.com/">Hopper Cloud</a>, and partnering first with Capital One to launch a travel booking portal for its cardholders, which is on track to debut later this year. Since then, Hopper has also revealed that it will be <a href="https://amadeus.com/en/insights/press-release/amadeus-hopper-expand-relationship-to-stimulate-return-to-travel-with-fintech">working with Amadeus</a> to roll out its fintech products to any travel provider that wants to use them, including airlines, online travel agencies and more.</p>
<p>Covid-19 was obviously a shock to the system across all industries and almost every aspect of daily life, but the travel industry likely experienced some of the most dramatic upheaval. Hopper&#8217;s ability to attract significant pools of new funding in the wake of the pandemic, including this new round led by GPI Capital, reflect the impressive flexibility and speed with which it&#8217;s been able to shape an entirely new kind of digital travel company that anticipates and even thrives on volatility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unbundling financial data through APIs and driving data-driven insights with value-add products in Africa keeps getting more exciting as major players continue to raise more money for scale</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than a year after its $3 million seed round, San Francisco- and Africa-based fintech <a href="https://pngme.com/">Pngme</a> has snapped up another $15 million for its financial data infrastructure play</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company is also describing itself as a machine learning-as-a-service platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Octopus Ventures led the Series A round, with follow-on investment from Lateral Capital, EchoVC and Raptor Group.  Other investors like Unshackled Ventures, Future Africa and Two Small Fish Ventures participated too. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme also received checks from angel investors; some include Hayden Simmons of RallyCap, Plaid&#8217;s Dan Kahn, Richard Talbot of RBC Capital and Kyle Ellicott of Intersect VC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme&#8217;s platform caters to fintechs and other financial institutions across sub-Saharan Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the founders, Brendan Playford and Cate Rung, last spoke with TechCrunch, Pngme was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">heading out of stealth mode in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cSuHt5i2rx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/pngme-a-financial-data-platform-closes-3m-seed-to-accelerate-growth-in-sub-saharan-africa/">Pngme, a financial data platform, closes $3M seed to accelerate growth in Sub-Saharan Africa</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pngme, a financial data platform, closes $3M seed to accelerate growth in Sub-Saharan Africa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/pngme-a-financial-data-platform-closes-3m-seed-to-accelerate-growth-in-sub-saharan-africa/embed/#?secret=cSuHt5i2rx" data-secret="cSuHt5i2rx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, Pngme has three core products for clients in these three markets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to its already known API and mobile SDK, Pngme has added a customer management platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says combining the three products will drive its customers&#8217; adoption and use of personalized user experiences and financial products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a conversation with TechCrunch, Playford references building personalized user fintech experiences to what Alipay and WeChat have done in the past couple of years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When users sign up, both platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the right recommendations on every financial service before offering the right product when they make up their minds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data-driven user experience. And every fintech or bank wants to provide that same data-driven user experience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From instant loans or savings, or overdrafts, or whatever it might be, it&#8217;s all </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like a user experience around a product,&#8221; Playford said, referring to both Chinese super-app juggernauts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;If you get to the core of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the business problems for financial institutions, they&#8217;re looking at doing two things. One is they&#8217;re looking at lowering their customer acquisition costs. And then they&#8217;re looking at increasing the lifetime value of their customers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playford says Pngme wants to mirror this playbook. But why has it become important for the company all of a sudden?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most African financial institutions and fintechs are racing to offer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> customized user experiences and financial products tailored to their customers’ needs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To fuel these products and user experiences, data infrastructure </span>is needed<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Machine learning models </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are supposed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be trained</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and maximize the lifetime value of a customer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These processes can be expensive and time-consuming, leaving them with the difficult task of choosing between building the infrastructure or serving their customer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme allows financial institutions and fintechs to collect and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> financial data at scale</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says its mobile SDK and data processing pipelines collect alternative financial data and unify it with other data sources to create a holistic picture of an individual&#8217;s financial behavior</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The pain point we solve is the cost of building the infrastructure is very high. And the data science, the data engineering talent, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> globally is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">hard to find. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So building a data infrastructure as a service works </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> well because it&#8217;s a subscription to get those services which you&#8217;d </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">normally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need a five- or six-person team to build this structure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The close of Pngme&#8217;s Series A brings its total investment to $18.5 million, making it the most funded in this fintech category across the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other prominent startups include South African-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/stitch-emerges-from-stealth-with-4m-for-its-api-fintech-play-in-africa/">Stitch</a>, and Nigeria&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/nigerian-fintech-okra-raises-3-5m-backed-by-accenture-ventures-and-susa-ventures/">Okra</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/nigerias-mono-raises-millions-to-power-the-internet-economy-in-africa/">Mono</a> and OnePipe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although each platform has morphed into providing more complex data offerings, Playford says one of the important things Pngme has considered since February is clearly distinguishing itself from these other platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we do is that we&#8217;ve kind of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> differentiated ourselves to be not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> collecting the data that we can see but also, we can connect to Mono data, Okra data, and we can connect with banks&#8217; data</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> merge all that data and then put machine learning models on top for the clients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That can be predictive credit models, segmentation models and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> positioning ourselves as a data processing infrastructure for banks and fintechs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playford&#8217;s explanation of how he thinks Pngme is different resonates with the way other founders think of their own platforms. But time will tell how long these products can keep being dissimilar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme&#8217;s proposition has found traction with some tier-one banks in Nigeria and South Africa like ABSA, UBA, First Bank, fintechs Kuda, Umba, Renmoney, CredPal and credit bureaus like TransUnion Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme will use the investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more customers, it says. One way the company plans to make this happen is by expanding its executive team. Pngme is hiring Lorraine Kageni Maina as the CSO and Nick Masson as the CTO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside key executive hires, Pngme is expanding its data science, engineering and sales teams globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">COO Rung says Pngme’s infrastructure has processed billions of data points from hundreds of financial institutions across sub-Saharan Africa. The next plan is to double down on its Insights Library product and expand its third-party data connections to other markets over the next year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Octopus Ventures, the lead investor in this round, Pngme shows the need for actionable data to drive the explosion of digital fintech services for Africans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On why the VC firm invested, Tosin Agbabiaka said, &#8220;The elegance of the technology solution, combined with an exceptional team and strong market traction with large institutions underlines our belief that Pngme will power the next generation of financial services in Africa, helping to give millions of more people access to banking and lending</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.molocoads.com/en/">MOLOCO</a>, an adtech startup that uses machine learning to build mobile campaigns, announced today it has raised $150 million in new Series C funding led by Tiger Global Management, taking its valuation to $1.5 billion. This is separate from the $20 million Series C round MOLOCO <a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202105040008">announced three months ago</a>, which brought it to unicorn status. Co-founder and chief executive officer Ikkjin Ahn told TechCrunch that MOLOCO raised again so soon because “as we gear up for a potential IPO, we wanted more funding to help us grow faster.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2013 and based in Redwood City, California, MOLOCO has now raised $200 million in total. The company claims it has “consistently grown in excess of 100% annually,” and has an annual net revenue run rate of more than $100 million.</p>
<p>Its clients range in size from mobile developers who have less than 100,000 users to more than a billion, Ahn said in an email, with some spending more than $1 million a month through MOLOCO Cloud, its demand side platform (DSP). MOLOCO’s customers include King Digital, Playrix and Netmarble.</p>
<p>MOLOCO already serves mobile app developers in a wide range of industries, like gaming, social networking, e-commerce, ride-sharing, food delivery and fintech, helping them turn their first-party user data into marketing, monetization and user acquisition campaigns. The new funding will be used to expand MOLOCO’s machine learning engine to more use cases by focusing on research and development, product and engineering. Part of the raise is earmarked for hiring, adding to MOLOCO’s 200 employees, who are spread across the world in eight offices: San Francisco, Seattle, London, Beijing, Seoul, Singapore and Tokyo.</p>

<p>MOLOCO is getting ready to launch its Retail Media Platform, currently in beta, which helps e-commerce companies create revenue streams like sponsored ads.</p>
<p>Before launching MOLOCO, Ahn was a machine learning engineer at YouTube from 2008 to 2010, then Android from 2010 to 2013. Back then, MOLOCO’s founding team “noticed that a lot of mobile businesses struggled to generate sustainable growth and monetization,” Ahn said. “A big reason for that was that they offered very unique services and therefore generated very unique data—data that traditional tools were incapable of helping make use of.” MOLOCO’s machine learning engine was created to help companies turn their first-party data into growth campaigns and monetization strategies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eight years later, mobile developers now view machine learning “as an essential part of their tech stack in order to advertise and monetize their apps effectively,&#8221; Ahn said.</p>
<p>Some try to build their own machine learning algorithms, but this can be a drain on their resources. Others outsource the work, but that means losing transparency and control of their data. Ahn said MOLOCO’s goal is to help app developers maintain control of data while giving them access to the same quality of algorithms as tech giants like Facebook and Google, which he describes as the startup&#8217;s main competitors.</p>
<h3>Beyond walled gardens</h3>
<p>“Let’s face it, most ad spend today is going to Facebook and Google, because they have excellent machine learning and they make it easy for advertisers to scale their campaigns,” Ahn said.</p>
<p>But a major drawback for businesses is that first-party data generated on Facebook or Google Ads for targeting and optimization can’t be used on other platforms, creating walled gardens. On the other hand, MOLOCO allows businesses to retain full access to their data. “We believe they should own it and do with it what they want,” Ahn said.</p>
<p>This also helps businesses adapt to new consumer privacy laws. Stricter regulations make it important for companies to gather as much of their own data as possible, since they will get less of it from other sources, and make sure that they keep that data secure. Ahn said MOLOCO’s platform and cloud service “are built with security and privacy in mind, so our partners can simply plug in their data and trust that we handle all compliance matters.”</p>

<p>Part of MOLOCO’s new funding will be used to expand MOLOCO Cloud, which programmatically bids on ad exchanges like Google AdX and Twitter Mopub, into new verticals and geographic markets.</p>
<p>To make the most efficient use of ad budgets, MOLOCO Cloud analyzes signals like in-app purchases or in-app activities that allow businesses to gauge the effectiveness of a campaign.</p>
<p>“For mobile games, those activities often include level completions or friend invites; for ride sharing apps, it’s likely to be a ride order; for e-commerce apps, it’s likely to be a purchase,” Ahn said, adding “the strength of our machine learning is that it is flexible enough to automatically adjust to an advertiser’s unique KPIs and embrace different, diverse data sets.”</p>
<p>MOLOCO’s Retail Media Platform was created to help e-commerce companies make more money off their sites through features like Recommended Products and Sponsored Ads. “For example, our machine learning can tell them, in real time, which products a visitor is most likely to purchase next, so that they can make intelligent recommendations that drive incremental revenue,” Ahn said. The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/amazon-ad-revenue-now-twice-as-big-as-snap-twitter-roku-and-pinterest-combined.html">massive growth of Amazon’s ad platform</a> also demonstrates how sponsored ads can be a significant source of revenue for e-commerce businesses, he added.</p>
<p>In a statement about Tiger Global’s investment in MOLOCO, partner John Curtius said, “The volume of digital data produced is growing exponentially yet the tools available for taking action on that data remain relatively limited. We invested in MOLOCO because its machine learning algorithms have proven to be among the best available and the level of transparency and sophistication the company brings to data-driven businesses is paramount in today’s world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech </span><a href="https://www.brex.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first partnered with </span><a href="https://www.weav.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weav</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a developer of a universal API for commerce platforms, last summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, Brex </span><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/faster-payments/2021/brex-instant-payouts-live-shopify-sellers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched Instant Payouts for Shopify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sellers using the startup’s technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results were impressive enough that by April, Brex co-founders Henrique Dubugras and Pedro Franceschi participated in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/weav-raises-4-3m-to-knit-together-a-universal-api-for-commerce-platfofrms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weav’s $4.3 million seed round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as strategic angel investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few months, the pair determined that Weav’s technology &#8212; and team &#8212; was too good to share. So today, the fintech is announcing that it is acquiring one-year-old Weav for $50 million in its first significant acquisition, TechCrunch has learned exclusively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, the deal was forged without the founders of either company having met &#8212; which may have been more unusual before the COVID-19 pandemic but is likely more commonplace these days. (Although they have since met.) Brex has previously made &#8216;acquihires&#8217; but has not previously acquired both a company&#8217;s team and technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brex started working with Weav “pretty early on” in the company’s life as a partner, Dubugras said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were so impressed with [CEO] Nadav [Lidor] and his team, how fast they were building and how good the technology is, that we wanted to expand to a more strategic partnership,” he told TechCrunch. “Then, we started talking about an acquisition.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch talked with Dubugras and Weav CEO and co-founder Lidor to find out the details of the deal, and why it’s significant for both companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, as part of the acquisition, Brex will be expanding its global presence by building an “innovation hub” and hiring employees in Israel beyond Weav’s nine-person team, which is located in Israel and New York. CEO Lidor will head up Brex&#8217;s new Israeli office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides expanding its global reach, the technology that Brex is acquiring will help accelerate the fintech’s connectivity of its platform, Dubugras said. Currently, Brex offers credit cards, business cash accounts, spend management and bill pay software together in a single dashboard for its customers. Its goal is to continue expanding its product and services portfolio to become “a fully-integrated and holistic financial platform for businesses.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Weav’s technology helps make Brex even better for our customers,” he said.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Weav raises $4.3M to knit together a universal API for commerce platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/weav-raises-4-3m-to-knit-together-a-universal-api-for-commerce-platfofrms/embed/#?secret=HjKKAo3IEa" data-secret="HjKKAo3IEa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded last year by engineers Ambika Acharya, Avikam Agur and Lidor after participating in the W20 YC batch, Weav was among the wave of fintech infrastructure companies that aimed to give fintechs and financial institutions a boost. Specifically, Weav’s embedded technology was designed to give organizations access to “real time, user-permissioned” commerce data that they could use to create new financial products for small businesses.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its products will allow customers to connect to multiple platforms with a single API that was developed specifically for the commerce platforms that businesses use to sell products and accept payments. Weav has operated under the premise that allowing companies to build and embed new financial products creates new opportunities for e-commerce merchants, creators and other entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception last year, Weav’s API call volume has grown by 300% each month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increased adoption of cloud and SaaS technologies has led to data being stored in a variety of disparate systems. Weav’s API aims to build digital connections that enable automatic sharing and analysis, thus (as mentioned above) allowing commerce platforms to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">access their customers&#8217; standardized transaction data in real time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is important to Brex because the premise is that by using Weav, businesses can get financial services and new products “more quickly and precisely.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to build this all-in-one finance platform,” Dubugras told TechCrunch. “That was already the direction we were headed with the partnership but this acquisition helps us so that we can build a better integration across all our financial products, and we can do more, and a lot faster than what we were originally planning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, he added, Brex integrates with platforms such as Shopify. With the acquisition of Weav, it intends to build more lending, visualization and insights products for its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Weav team will basically m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">anage any third-party integration,” Dubugras said, “so that Brex can be your financial operating system no matter where your data is. You can have everything in one place.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidor admits that Weav did not expect to be exiting so soon after founding. But the companies found themselves on the same page, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Our goal has always been to connect businesses, creators, and other entrepreneurs with fintech to expand financial access, and this aligns with Brex’s mission,” Lidor added. “After working with Henrique and Pedro, we realized they couldn’t be a better partner. We too were so impressed with the Brex team, and had a great time learning from them, and building with them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company did not disclose its valuation at the time of its $4.3 million seed round earlier this year. The $50 million price tag represents a “healthy multiple for all involved,” Dubugras said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansion into Israel is also exciting to the Brex team, which went remote last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic with operations in the United States, Canada and Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2017, San Francisco-based Brex earlier this year was valued at $7.4 billion after raising a $425 million Series D led by Tiger Global. The company has raised $1.2 billion in debt and equity financing, according to Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/brex">data</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the company announced it had put together a new service </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210426005625/en/Brex-Unveils-All-In-One-Financial-Solution-For-Businesses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called Brex Premium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that costs $49 per month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The number of premium subscribers that we now have definitely blew away our expectations,” Dubugras said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, Brex was the latest fintech </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/brex-applies-for-bank-charter-taps-former-silicon-valley-bank-exec-as-ceo-of-brex-bank/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to apply for a bank charter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which sells a credit card tailored for startups, with Emigrant Bank currently acting as the issuer,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">had submitted an application with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI) to establish Brex Bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, the company said it would <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/brex-will-withdraw-applications-for-industrial-bank">voluntarily withdraw</a> its bank charter and federal deposit insurance applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will permit us to modify and strengthen our application and resubmit at a later date,” the company said. “We appreciate the support and thoughtful guidance from the Utah DFI and FDIC.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprise Resource Planning systems have traditionally been the preserve of larger companies, but in recent years the amount of data small medium sized businesses can generate has increased to the point where even SMEs/SMBs can get into the world of ERP. And that&#8217;s especially true for online-only businesses.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/germanys-xentral-nabs-20m-led-by-sequoia-to-help-online-facing-smbs-run-back-offices-better/">covered</a> the $20 million Series A funding of <a href="http://Xentral.com">Xentral</a>, a German startup that develops ERP for online small businesses, but it clearly didn’t plan to stop there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now raised a $75 million Series B funding from Tiger Global and Meritech, following up from existing investors Sequoia Capital, Visionaries Club (a B2B-focused VC out of Berlin), and Freigeist.</p>
<p>The cash will be used to enhance product, hire staff and expand the UK operation towards a more global ERP market, which is <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/cloud-based-enterprise-resource-planning-erp-market">expected to reach</a> $32 billion by 2023.</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call, Benedikt Sauter, founder and CEO of central, said: “We hook into Shopify, eBay, Amazon, Magento, WooCommerce, and also CRM systems like Pipedrive to collect the software together in one place, and try to do it all automatically in the background so that companies can really focus. Our goal is that a business owner who decides on Friday that they need a flexible ERP can implement and configure xentral over the weekend and hand it over to their team on Monday.”</p>
<p>The German startup covers services like order and warehouse management, packaging, fulfillment, accounting, and sales management, and, right now, the majority of its 1,000 customers are in Germany. Customers include the likes of direct-to-consumer brands like YFood, KoRo, the Nu Company and Flyeralarm.</p>
<p>John Curtius, Partner at Tiger Global, said: “Our diligence has uncovered a delighted customer base at xentral and a product offering that has evolved into a true mission-critical platform for ecommerce merchants globally. We are excited to partner with such product visionaries as Benedikt and Claudia as the business scales to serve customers not only in Europe but around the globe in the future.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Xentral was Sequoia’s first investment in Europe since officially opening for business in the region this year. Sequoia backed other European startups before, including Graphcore, Klarna, Tessian, Unity, UiPath, n8n, and Evervault — but all of those deals were done from the US. Sequoia and its new partner in Europe, Luciana Lixandru, is understood to be joining Xentral’s board along with Visionaries’ Robert Lacher.</p>
<p>Alex Clayton, General Partner at Meritech said: “Meritech invested in NetSuite in 2008 with the vision of bringing ERP to the cloud… We believe that xentral will bring automation to hundreds of thousands SME businesses, dramatically improving multi-channel processes and data management in an ever-growing e-commerce market.”</p>
<p>Sauter and his co-founder Claudia Sauter (who is also his wife) built the early prototype of central originally for their first business in computer hardware sales.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a while, there have been talks about revamping the outdated 2007 Act of Nigeria&#8217;s information and technology body, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, in March, the director-general Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi <a href="https://nitda.gov.ng/nitda-to-realign-its-2007-act-with-digital-economy-ideals/">proposed the realignment of the Act</a> with &#8220;tenets and ideals of the fourth Industrial Revolution&#8221; and Nigeria&#8217;s Digital Economy Policy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we might</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have caught a glimpse of what that amended bill looks like, and its details are rather </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">concerning</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, the bill states that NITDA wants tech companies operating in Nigeria to get a license, pay pre-tax profit levies, and sanction whoever (person or company) that operates contrary to the new Act&#8217;s provisions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, the World Bank ranked Nigeria 131 out of 190 countries on its <a href="https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploreeconomies/nigeria">Doing Business Index</a>, which measures the ease of doing business through a comparative assessment of regulatory environments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the <a href="https://home.kpmg/ng/en/home/insights/2019/10/nigeria-ranks-131-in-world-bank-s-2020-doing-business-report.html">report</a>, Nigeria was one of the top 10 countries with the most notable improvements during the review period of May 2018 to April 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granted, the country made some improvements during this period but since last year, any talk of progression from the country has been on paper</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reality, businesses especially those with focus on technology, have faced harsh regulations and policies that are detrimental to their growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/after-vcs-spend-millions-nigeria-restricts-ride-hail-motorbike-taxis/">operations of motorcycle-haling companies in Lagos</a> were halted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">indefinitely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in early 2020, forcing them to switch business models </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> survive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March this year, the country&#8217;s apex bank <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1985223/nigerias-crypto-ban-has-startups-and-traders-in-a-frenzy/">barred people from trading cryptocurrency through banks</a>; crypto startups haven&#8217;t looked the same despite using peer-to-peer methods</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more recently, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">Twitter ban</a> has affected small businesses in general and how tech startups communicate with customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>What&#8217;s in the bill?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Section 6 of the amended bill details the powers accrued to NITDA. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of them include the powers to fix licensing and authorization charges, collect fees and penalties and issue contravention notices and non-compliance with the Act</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency says it also reserves the right to &#8220;enter premises, inspect, seize, seal, detain and impose administrative sanctions on erring persons and companies who contravene any provision of the Act&#8221; subject to a court order</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In section 13, NITDA proposes establishing a fund (The National Information Technology Development Fund) to carry out the country&#8217;s digital economy objectives</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How will this Fund </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be financed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Grants-in-aid, fees, accrued money under administrative payments, and levies charged from tech companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill declares that tech companies making an annual turnover of N100 million (~$200,000) will have to pay a levy of 1% of their profit before tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In section 20 of the leaked bill, NITDA says it will issue licenses and authorizations for tech companies regardless of their size. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The licenses </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are classified</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into three &#8212; product, service provider, and platform provider. The bill provided no </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> information</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">about</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what these licenses entail and how startups qualify to get them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the agency is more concerned about stating what will happen to individuals or companies that do not get these licenses or pay the 1% levy fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Any person or body corporate who operates an information technology or digital economy service, product, or platform contrary to the provisions of this Act, commits an offense,&#8221; the agency said in the statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals found guilty by the agency will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be fined</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not less than N3 million (~$6,000) or placed into custody for a year or more. The bill states NITDA can also decide to charge such a person both the fine and imprisonment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a fine of not less than N30 million (~$60,000) will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be charged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against corporate bodies. The &#8216;principal officers&#8217; of the companies may also serve a prison sentence for two years or more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And individuals or corporates that deny personnel from the agency to carry out duties </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">under</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Act will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be fined</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not less than N3 million (~$6,000) and N30 million (~$60,000), </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Prison terms range from a year to two in this section for individuals and members within a corporate body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further offenses and penalties </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are mentioned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later in the bill. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, any company which falls into the category of paying levies and does not pay after two months will be liable to a fine of 0.5% of the total amount to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be paid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every day after the default</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch reached out to the agency for comment regarding the validity of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaked bill but did not receive any response as of press time.</span></p>
<h2>Startup bill v. NITDA Act</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NITDA&#8217;s leaked amended bill is coming when the Nigerian tech ecosystem has rallied around to engage policymakers in the country to <a href="https://medium.com/@startupbill_ng/whats-going-on-with-the-nigeria-startup-bill-577efc21603f">enact a Startup Bill</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Startup Bill is geared toward creating an enabling environment for tech startups through co-created regulations with the Nigerian government</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The first draft will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> public this month towards a first reading in the country&#8217;s National Assembly in October. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Momentarily, uncertainty hovers around the stakeholders&#8217; next steps following the content revealed in NITDA&#8217;s revised bill because the agency is supposed to play a major role in bringing the Startup Bill to fruition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leaked NITDA Amendment Bill also presents a whole new level of threat. It is heads and shoulders above what tech companies might have faced in recent memory. If passed, it will alter how they operate and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">drastically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affect the ease of doing business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many have called for startup leaders and tech companies to lobby the legislators behind such bills. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the general sentiment is that lobbying is a dead-end for now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the Lagos state government banned ride-hailing companies from operating on its roads, sources say they tried to lobby with necessary stakeholders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Popular players like Gokada and OPay took to the media to take pictures with the governor. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it still ended in a ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being one of the pioneers of the Startup Bill, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, co-founder of Andela and Flutterwave, also thinks lobbying might make for a futile effort</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a tweet, he says Nigerian legislators are not &#8220;lobbyable,&#8221; and startups should prepare for the worst while hoping for the best. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also offered advice to Nigerian startups to start building for a global audience and incorporate their companies outside the country if necessary</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News is vital to society, but it’s also incredibly expensive to produce. As ad rates have suffered across the industry (minus a positive blip this summer), publishers have increasingly turned to paywalls to make ends meet. There’s just one problem: the open internet which allowed readers to range over the entire thought of humanity has transformed into row after row of walled gardens locked down by angry sentries. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/06/subscription-hell/">subscription hell</a> I talked about three years ago has indeed only accelerated.</p>
<p>Fixing hell is going to take some doing, but three veterans of news and media in Europe are ready to take a crack at it.</p>
<p>Benjamin Mateev, Martin Kaelble, and Axel Bard Bringéus have come together to launch <a href="https://www.informed.so">informed.</a> (official branding: no caps, mandatory period). The Berlin-based startup wants to be a layer on top of prominent paywalled news services, connecting readers with curated “playlists” of news and opinion stories called Read Lists and augmented with an original summary. The company was founded in January, is currently in beta, and has raised a “significant pre-seed by modern standards” from local shop <a href="https://www.468cap.com">468 Capital</a>.</p>
<p>What’s interesting here is the team. Bringéus previously spent six years at Spotify where he ultimately worked as global head of markets during the company’s rapid overseas expansion. He has most recently been a deal partner at prominent European firm EQT Ventures. Meanwhile, Mateev was a lead engineer on to-do list platform Wunderlist <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/02/microsoft-purchase-of-wunderlist-confirmed/">through its Microsoft acquisition</a> and head of product at opinion news site <a href="https://www.theeuropean.de/en/">The European</a>, and Kaelble has been a long-time business journalist at places like <a href="https://www.capital.de">Capital</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189944" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189944" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2189944" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg 4942w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189944" class="wp-caption-text">informed.&#8217;s founders Martin Kaelble, Benjamin Mateev, and Axel Bard Bringéus. Image Credits: informed.</p></div></p>
<p>The trio, who have seen success in their varied careers, took a step back to explore how they could fix the varied challenges of the news industry circle 2021. They did “diary studies” where they asked people to track what they read in the news, ran surveys across thousands of people, and also talked to media executives and investors.</p>
<p>They found that paywalls have been mostly successful the past few years for media companies, but that growth is flagging as core readers have purchased subscriptions. “Almost all publishers post-COVID and post-Trump have hit a wall with their paywall strategies,” Bringéus said. “Many were able to monetize their content directly in their core geo, so they are very open to working with non-cannibalizing third parties like us.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Simultaneously, young readers in the Gen Z crowd increasingly want to peruse quality news, but lack the means to pay the exorbitant subscription fees at some of the most prestigious sites. “They want to read but financially they can’t afford [it],” Mateev put it. I asked somewhat skeptically whether our illustrious progeny actually want to read quality news over viral TikToks, but Mateev said the evidence pointed strongly to yes. “That’s where the interesting thing lies … the old publishers do have a lot of good standing with the younger audience,” he said.</p>
<p>Informed, which is working with the Washington Post, The Economist, Financial Times, and Bloomberg, will group articles from those sources among others onto Read Lists, while adding its own news summary to the event. For example, you could imagine today that the platform would have a Read List on Afghanistan that would include breaking news stories from the Kabul airport as well as a curated selection of deeper-dives and opinion pieces that talk about the history and perspective of the crisis in the Central Asian nation. “You can snack or you can eat if you want to,” Bringéus said of the design.</p>
<p>He noted that while there are similarities with Spotify playlists, a subject with which he is very familiar, news doesn’t have the same properties as music. “In news, you don’t need all the news and it is perishable, [so] you want to cluster it,” he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189952" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189952" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2189952" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed_logo.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="140" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed_logo.png 3945w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed_logo.png?resize=150,31 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed_logo.png?resize=300,62 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed_logo.png?resize=768,158 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed_logo.png?resize=680,140 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed_logo.png?resize=1536,317 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed_logo.png?resize=2048,423 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed_logo.png?resize=50,10 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189952" class="wp-caption-text">informed.&#8217;s logo and branding design. Image Credits: informed.</p></div></p>
<p>The company will launch its mobile-first product later this year, although you can sign up for the beta test today. Ultimately, the company is looking to pursue a freemium model with all the licensed content behind the paywall, while its own news summaries will be free. The team is testing pricing and hasn’t determined a launch price at this time.</p>
<p>It’s a bold initiative in a space riven with the tombstones of past startups and even larger corporate initiatives such as Apple News+, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/14/apple-news-fails-to-bring-in-new-subscribers-despite-impressive-launch">which has mostly failed to gain traction</a> despite owning a foothold on every iOS device. That harrowing history aside, the hope here is that the timing is propitious: a new generation of news readers are clamoring for quality, and publishers are ready to let go of some control over their audience in exchange for growth in the post-Trump news landscape. If it succeeds, it’d definitely be front-page news.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s not even half a year since crypto exchange Bitpanda announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/neobroker-bitpanda-raises-170m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-to-take-its-trading-platform-beyond-crypto/">$170M Series B</a> &#8212; when, back in March, Austria&#8217;s first unicorn was being valued at $1.2 billion. Today it&#8217;s topping that: Announcing a $263M Series C, led by Peter Thiel&#8217;s Valar Ventures, with the fintech startup now valued at a whopping $4.1BN &#8212; more than 3x its earlier valuation as crypto trading continues cooking on gas.</p>
<p>The round was signed earlier this month, just four months after the business gained unicorn status. Other participating investors include Alan Howard and REDO Ventures, with existing investors LeadBlock Partners and Jump Capital also joining the Series C.</p>
<p>There are a number of exchanges and trading platforms targeted at retail investors, of course, including some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/robinhood-is-now-a-stonk/">big US-based players</a>. But Bitpanda has been making its mark by being Europe-focused, with offices and physical tech hubs located in eight cities across the region, including Vienna, Barcelona, Berlin, Krakow, London, Madrid, Milan, and Paris.</p>
<p>The platform has a further twist in that it lets its ~3 million users easily invest (commission-free) in precious metals (like gold) or in any established stock they fancy &#8212; in addition to encouraging individuals to hop aboard the crypto rollercoaster, which was its first focus. (The minimum investment amount set by the platform is €1.)</p>
<p>Despite diversification beyond crypto, a spokeswoman confirmed to us that crypto trading remains &#8220;the preferred choice&#8221; for Bitpanda&#8217;s current users, noting the Stocks trading product is still in beta. &#8220;With Bitpanda Stocks, we introduced a new way of investing in stocks and ETFs; it enables investing 24/7, any time, day or night. This is still in a beta phase, we’re adding constantly new assets. That said, stock trading is slowly picking up and increasing its share in overall trading,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>More recently (in June) Bitpanda expanded into the b2b market &#8212; with a white label platform offering that lets other fintechs and banks offer trading to their own clients.</p>
<p>This combination of products and regional focus has helped the platform pile on new users in short order: Bitpanda says it&#8217;s &#8220;on track&#8221; to achieve 6x customer growth year over year, with revenues projected to increase sevenfold in 2021 vs the previous year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series C funding will be used for international expansion and growth, per a press release, as well as going on further beefing up headcount (500+ strong at this stage), as well as on gearing up for further scaling of the business.</p>
<p>Tech and product are also set to get juiced with Series C funds.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Eric Demuth, co-founder and CEO, said: “We started Bitpanda in 2014 with a clear vision: To bring investing closer to everyone, everywhere. We wouldn’t be here today without the efforts of our talented team members who are constantly &#8216;rolling up their sleeves&#8217; to make things happen. We’re grateful to share our journey with these incredible people — and that’s why a key area of focus for us is to keep strengthening our team by bringing onboard world-class talent.We’re also grateful for the vote of confidence received from our investors, old and new, in this investment round. We look forward to working together as we shape the future of finance and grow Bitpanda into the #1 investment platform in Europe<br />
and beyond”.</p>
<p>Bitpanda&#8217;s spokeswoman also told us that international expansion and growth are &#8220;key priorities&#8221;, adding: &#8220;We’ll keep building the team, opening new offices, and launching new products as we design for scale and optimise for growth. This also means strengthening Bitpanda’s position in existing markets &#8212; such as in the DACH region, Spain, France, Italy, and Poland, and also enter new markets, such as the UK or the markets in Central and Eastern Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Andrew McCormack, founding partner of Valar Ventures, said: “We believed in Bitpanda’s potential from the beginning and we are impressed by the results that Eric, Paul, Christian and the Bitpanda team have achieved. With more than 1.2 million users acquired in the first half of 2021, impressive net revenue growth and world-class executive hires, Bitpanda stands as the living proof that hypergrowth can be achieved in a sustainable way. We’re excited to further work together to bring the world of investing at the fingertips of everyone, anywhere.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fitness platform <a href="https://ultrahuman.com">Ultrahuman </a>has officially announced a $17.5 million Series B fund raise, with investment coming from early stage fund Alpha Wave Incubation, Steadview Capital, Nexus Venture Partners, Blume Ventures and Utsav Somani’s iSeed fund.</p>
<p>A number of founders and angel investors also participated in the Bangalore-headquartered startup&#8217;s Series B, including Tiger Global’s Scott Schleifer, Deepinder Goyal (CEO of Zomato), Kunal Shah (CEO of Cred), and Gaurav Munjal and Romain Saini (the CEO and co-founders of unacademy), among others. The latest tranche of funding brings its total raised to date to $25M.</p>
<p>While the subscription platform has been around since 2019, offering a fairly familiar blend of home workout videos, mindfulness content, sleep sessions and heart rate tracking (integrating with third party wearables like the Apple Watch), its latest fitness tool looks rather more novel &#8212; as it&#8217;s designed for monitoring metabolic activity by tracking the user&#8217;s glucose levels (aka, blood sugar).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Keeping tabs on blood sugar is essential for people living with diabetes. But in the US alone millions of people are prediabetic &#8212; meaning they have a higher than normal level of blood glucose and are at risk of developing diabetes, though they may not know it yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">More broadly, Ultrahuman claims over a billion people in the world suffer from a metabolic health disorder &#8212; underlining the scale of the potential addressable market it&#8217;s eyeing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">H</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">aving sustained high blood glucose is associated with multiple health issues so managing the condition with lifestyle changes like diet and exercise is advisable. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Lifestyle changes can reduce elevated blood glucose and shrink or even avoid negative health impacts &#8212; such as by averting the risk of a prediabetic person going on to develop full blown diabetes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But k</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">nowing what type of diet and exercise regime will work best for a particular person can be tricky &#8212; and involve a lot of frustrating trial and error &#8212; since people&#8217;s glucose responses to different</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> food items can differ wildly. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">These responses depend on a person&#8217;s metabolic health &#8212; which in turn depends on individual factors like microbiome diversity, stress levels, time of day, food ingredient and quality</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. (See also: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/personalized-nutrition-startup-zoe-closes-out-series-b-at-53m/">Personalized nutrition startups like Zoe</a> &#8212; which is similarly paying mind to blood glucose levels but as one component of a wider play to try to use big data and AI to decode the microbiome.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">With metabolic health being so specific to each of us there&#8217;s a strong case for continuous glucose monitoring having widespread utility &#8212; certainly if the process and price-point can be made widely accessible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Here, Ultrahuman is having a go at productizing the practice for a fitness enthusiast market &#8212; launching its first device in beta back in June &#8212; although the price-point it&#8217;s targeting is starting out fairly premium. </span></p>
<p>The product (a wearable and a subscription service) &#8212; which it&#8217;s branded &#8216;Cyborg&#8217; &#8212; consists of<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> a skin patch that extracts glucose from the interstitial fluid under the skin, per founder and CEO, Mohit Kumar, with the data fed into a companion app for analysis and visualization.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190321" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190321" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2190321" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png 4437w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ultrahuman-app-image.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190321" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: Ultrahuman</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> The patch tracks the wearer&#8217;s blood glucose levels as they go about their day &#8212; eating, exercising, sleeping etc &#8212; with the biomarker used to trigger the app to</span> nudge the user to &#8220;optimize your lifestyle&#8221;, as Ultrahuman&#8217;s website puts it &#8212; such as by alerting the user to a high blood glucose event and suggesting they take exercise to bring their level down.</p>
<p>If the product lives up to its promise of continuous glucose monitoring made easy, lovers of junk food could be in for a rude awakening as they&#8217;re served fast feedback on how their body copes (or, well, doesn&#8217;t) with their favorite snacks&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We use medical grade sensors that have been used in the sports technology domain for the last 6-7 yrs with decent accuracy levels,&#8221; says Kumar when we ask about the specifics of the wearable technology it&#8217;s using. (</span>The sensing hardware is being &#8216;worn&#8217; here in the sense that it&#8217;s directly attached to (i.e. stuck into/on) bare skin.)</p>
<p>While Ultrahuman&#8217;s platform has plenty more vanilla fitness content, the company is now billing itself as a &#8220;metabolic fitness platform&#8221; &#8212; putting the nascent product front and center, even though the<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> glucose tracking subscription service remains in closed beta for now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup is operating a waitlist for sign-ups as it continues to hone the technology. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">  </span></p>
<p>Ultrahuman touts &#8220;thousands&#8221; of people signed up and waiting to get their hands on the glucose tracker service &#8212; and says it&#8217;s seeing 60% week over week growth in sign ups, with wider availability of the product slated for &#8220;early 2022&#8221;.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Some of the Series B cash will be used to make improvements to the quality of the glucose biomarkers ahead of a full product launch.</span></p>
<p>On the enhancements side, Kumar tells TechCrunch the team is exploring &#8220;other form factors and other types of sensors that could help us capture glucose in a more accurate way and for a longer duration than 14 days&#8221;, as they work to hone the wearable. (The current version of the skin-worn sensor only lasts two weeks before it must be replaced with another patch.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to add more biomarkers like HRV [heart-rate variability], sleep zones and respiratory rate to help people understand the impact of metabolic health on their recovery/sleep and vice-versa,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Ultrahuman says it decided to focus on tracking glucose as its &#8220;main biomarker&#8221; as it can be used as a proxy for quantifying a number of fitness and wellness issues &#8212; making it a (potentially) very useful measure of individual health signals.</p>
<p>Or provided the startup&#8217;s technology is able to detect changes to glucose levels with enough sensitivity to be able to make meaningful recommendations per user.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glucose is interesting because it is a real-time biomarker that&#8217;s affected by exercise, sleep, stress and food,&#8221; says Kumar, adding: &#8220;We are able to help people make lifestyle changes across many vectors like nutrition, sleep, stress and exercise vs being unidimensional. It is also highly personalized as it guides you as per your body&#8217;s own response.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gives some examples of how the product could help users by identifying beneficial tweaks they could make to their diet and exercise regimes &#8212; such as figuring out which foods in their current diet yield &#8220;a healthy metabolic response&#8221; vs those that &#8220;need more optimization&#8221; (aka, avoiding the dreaded sugar crash). Or by helping users identify &#8220;a great meal window&#8221; for their lifestyle &#8212; based in their body&#8217;s glucose consumption rate.</p>
<p>Other helpful nudges he suggests the service can provide to sensor-wearing users &#8212; with an eye on athletes and fitness fanatics &#8212; is how best to fuel up before exercise to perform optimally.</p>
<p>Optimizing the last meal of the day to improve sleep efficiency is another suggestion.</p>
<p>If Ultrahuman&#8217;s Cyborg can do all that with a (bearably) wearable skin patch and a bit of clever algorithmic analysis it could take the quantified self trend to the next level.</p>
<p>A simple stick-on sensor-plus-app that passively amplifies internal biological signals and translates individual biomarkers into highly actionable real-time personalized health insights could be the start of something huge in preventative healthcare.</p>
<p>Again, though, Ultrahuman&#8217;s early pricing suggests there will be some fairly hard limits on who is able to tap in here.</p>
<p>Early adopters in the closed beta are shelling out $80 per month for the subscription service, per Kumar. And &#8212; at least for now &#8212; the startup is eyeing adding more bells and whistles, rather than fewer. &#8220;[Product pricing] will mostly be in the same range but may introduce more services/premium features on top of this,&#8221; he confirms.</p>
<p>The (typically higher) cost of eating healthily and having enough leisure time to be able to look after your body by taking exercise are other hard socioeconomic limits that won&#8217;t be fixed by a wearable, no matter how smart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Many Southeast Asian digital businesses run into obstacles when seeking early-stage growth financing. They might not want to sell equity in their company, but often struggle to secure working capital loans from traditional financial institutions. That’s where Singapore-based <a href="https://jenfi.com/">Jenfi</a> comes in, providing revenue-based financing of up to $500,000 with flexible repayment plans that co-founder and chief executive officer Jeffrey Liu refers to as “growth capital as a product.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">While <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/revenue-based-financing-the-next-step-for-private-equity-and-early-stage-investment/">revenue-based financing is gaining traction in many other markets</a>, Liu told TechCrunch that Singapore-based Jenfi is the first company of its kind focused on Southeast Asia. The startup announced today that it has raised a $6.3 million Series A led by Monk’s Hill Ventures. Participants included Korea Investment Partners and Golden Equator Capital, 8VC, ICU Ventures and Taurus Ventures. The company previously raised $25 million in debt financing from San Francisco-based Arc Labs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p2">Jenfi works primarily with “digital-native” companies, including SaaS providers and e-commerce sellers. Some of its clients include Tier One Entertainment, Pay With Split and Homebase. Jenfi hasn’t disclosed how much non-dilutive financing it&#8217;s provided so far, but its goal is to deploy $15 million by July 2022. It claims that the average Jenfi customer experienced compounded sales growth of about 26.5% over three months, 60% over six months and 156% over twelve months.</p>
<p class="p2">The aggregate sales of companies in its portfolio is currently more than $30 million, and Jenfi expects that the capital it has already deployed will help them generate $47 million in sales, or a 156% increase by July 2021.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Liu launched Jenfi with Justin Louie in 2019, after seeing how traditional financial institutions were lagging behind <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/e-conomy-sea-2019-swipe-up-and-to-the-right-southeast-asias-100-billion-internet-economy/">Southeast Asia’s digital boom</a>. The two previously founded GuavaPass, the fitness studio membership platform that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/06/fitness-marketplace-classpass-acquires-competitor-guavapass/">acquired by ClassPass in 2019</a>. Jenfi&#8217;s creation was motivated by some of the challenges Liu and Louie faced while financing a high-growth startup focused on Asian markets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Jenfi’s application process is completely online and in some cases, companies have received financing in less than 24 hours, though it typically takes a few days. This is another benefit over traditional working capital loans or private equity financing, which can take months to complete, making it difficult for companies to respond quickly to revenue growth opportunities. For example, an e-commerce company may need quick working capital to purchase more inventory if it suddenly gets a lot of demand for a certain product.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p class="p2">Some of Jenfi’s Series A will also be used to develop more integrations for its proprietary risk assessment engine, which analyzes how efficiently companies use their growth spending. Currently, it can tap into information from bank accounts; software like Xero or Quickbooks; payment gateways including Stripe and Braintree; e-commerce platforms like Shopify, Shopee and Lazada; and Facebook Ads and Google Ads.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Instead of fixed installment repayment plans, Jenfi gives companies more flexible target repayment plans and charges them a flat fee based on the amount of financing they received, their monthly sales and how many months it will take to pay back the loan. Jenfi continues analyzing the data sources provided by companies, so it can tell if a client potentially needs more capital or an adjustment to their repayment terms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Ultimately, Jenfi’s plan to move beyond financing and also provide tools to help businesses. “We see ourselves as partners in our portfolio companies’ growth,” said Liu.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Since Jenfi taps into a mix of data sources—including bank accounts, accounting software and digital advertising platforms, it can use that same information to identify opportunities. Part of Jenfi’s Series A funding will be used to develop automated analytics. For example, the platform would be able to identify an advertising opportunity with high ROI on Google Ads and notify the company, asking if they want to apply for more capital to finance the campaign.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p-rich_text_section">EV startup Canoo has hired hundreds of employees and is homing in on a production date, but critical milestones including landing a battery supplier remain, according to the company&#8217;s second quarter earnings report.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Canoo&#8217;s earnings report comes just a few weeks after the company&#8217;s first investor relations day when it named Dutch company<a href="https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner"> VDL Nedcar as its contract manufacturing partner</a> for its lifestyle vehicle. At the time, Canoo estimated the Nedcar facility would build up to 1,000 units in 2022 for U.S. and European markets, with a target of 15,000 units in 2023. During Monday&#8217;s earnings call, CEO Tony Aquila said the company is now expecting 25,000 units in 2023.</p>
<p>Canoo also provided updates on its plans to build a U.S.-based factory, which it describes as a &#8220;mega microfactory&#8221; for its pickup truck and multipurpose delivery vehicle. In June, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/canoo-to-build-its-first-electric-vehicle-factory-in-oklahoma/">EV startup announced plans to build its first factory in Oklahoma</a>. The state has committed $300 million in non-dilutive financial incentives to support the facility and Phase 2 of manufacturing.</p>
<p>&#8220;This two-pronged strategy is important for a few reasons,&#8221; Aquila said during Monday&#8217;s earnings call. &#8220;As a new OEM, working with Nedcar will allow us to refine our manufacturing process. While augmenting our production expertise, which will be deployed in our Oklahoma manufacturing plant, it will allow us to geographically diversify our manufacturing operations and position us to increase our commitments, products and volumes to adapt to changing market demands and build flexibility in distribution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aquila said about a third of Oklahoma&#8217;s investment will be available within the first 36 months. These funds will help the company progress as it moves into its Gamma phase, which means Canoo is getting ready to launch. Year over year, Canoo upped its workforce from 230 to 656 total employees, 70% of which are hardware and software engineers. The startup&#8217;s operating expenses have increased from $19.8 million to $104.3 million YOY, with the majority of that increase coming from R&amp;D.</p>
<p>The ramping up of expenses pre-revenue is a signal that Canoo is pushing forward on its production goals, but there&#8217;s still work to be done before construction begins on the Oklahoma factory. Aquila said Canoo is in the final process of selecting a construction manager, an architect and an engineering firm and will likely have more updates on the construction progress by next quarter.</p>
<p>The company is still working on making a final decision for a battery partner in the third quarter, a move that is becoming increasingly important as more legacy OEMs work to control their supply chain with battery joint ventures. Canoo is also struggling with semiconductor supply chain issues, as is the rest of the industry, but says its streamlined manufacturing process means its vehicles will require less chips to function.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On IR day, Canoo announced that it had completed 500,000 miles of beta testing. As of June 30, Aquila said the company has locked in engineering and design to commence &#8220;gamma&#8221; builds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have also sourced 87% of components, compared to 74% in the first quarter of the year, and excluding bulk material, we are 95% sourcing complete,&#8221; said Aquila. &#8220;Our CTO and his team have completed engineering design for 67% of the lifestyle vehicle components and have moved those into tooling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aquila said Canoo would begin its countdown to standard operating procedure for its lifestyle vehicle during the fourth quarter. The lifestyle vehicle is probably closer to production, but Aquila said out of the 9,500 non-binding refundable preorders, preorders for Canoo&#8217;s other two vehicles, the pickup truck and the multipurpose delivery vehicle, are the most popular.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 16, 2021. While the world deals with myriad issues, we’re sticking to our usual remit. Hugs and love to everyone, and here’s hoping for a better tomorrow. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec-1/">How Nuro is taking on Google, the world:</a> </strong>The race to build commercial-ready self-driving cars is big, well funded and competitive. And companies are taking diverging paths in their approach to the autonomous driving question. Nuro is one such company, and TechCrunch has the inside scoop in our latest EC-1. Enjoy!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">Tesla under investigation for Autopilot crashes:</a> </strong>Speaking of self-driving cars, Tesla’s efforts on the project are in the spotlight after a number of collisions between the company’s cars and parked first-responder vehicles. Tesla’s diver assistance program appears to be the culprit. How you feel about the inquiry will depend on whether you hold Tesla stock, but the situation underscores just how hard it is to get self-driving, full or not, to work in the wild.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/the-hyperactive-late-stage-market-should-keep-the-startup-investing-game-afoot/"><strong>Chime, Carta and Discord:</strong></a> As U.S. unicorns raise new mega-rounds, or work to close their next epic funding round, TechCrunch wondered what the rash of startups worth $10 billion or more could mean for startups earlier in their lifecycle. The news is good for startups and their founders alike.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/roblox-acquires-discord-competitor-guilded/"><strong>Guilded sells to Roblox:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Microsoft failed to acquire Discord, but Roblox didn’t miss when it came to Guilded. Admittedly, Guilded is a far smaller company than Discord, but the two startups play in the same space, so the Roblox deal really does matter. The market for gamer chat apps is probably big enough to support a few players, but Roblox, flush with cash, was more than happy to pony up for Guilded, which raised just over $10 million while private.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/tropic-picks-up-25m-to-streamline-software-procurement-experiences/"><strong>Tropic raises $25M for better software procurement:</strong></a> The pandemic taught the world that software gets paid for. Why? Because without it business literally stops. Software companies did well during the pandemic thanks to the centrality to regular operations that their business enjoyed. But no one wants to overpay. That’s where Tropic comes in &#8212; and now the startup that wants to help others spend less on software has $25 million to play with.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/shopistry-bags-2m-to-provide-headless-commerce-without-the-headaches/"><strong>Shopistry raises $2M for better headless commerce:</strong></a> We are presuming that this startup’s name is pronounced <em>SHOP-istry</em>, else it would make little sense. Regardless, Shopistry is building a modular e-commerce service that it thinks is better than other headless e-commerce services. It has pretty big competition in BigCommerce and Shopify, but those companies were also once wee startups.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/brainq-raises-40m-to-transform-stroke-patient-rehabilitation-with-its-home-therapy-device/">BrainQ wants to transform stroke rehab:</a> </strong>At-home stroke therapy startup BrainQ has racked up a $40 million round, TechCrunch wrote today. What does its hardware do? It “stimulates the damaged part of the brain and promotes self-repair,” and does so with enough impact that it secured “a Breakthrough Device certification from the FDA.” I mean, that’s super cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/how-one-founder-identified-a-gap-in-education-working-as-a-teacher-and-built-a-startup-to-fix-it/"><strong>How Amanda DoAmaral built Fiveable:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today on the Found podcast, TechCrunch has a real treat: “Hear how DoAmaral took her dissatisfaction with an inadequate system and turned that into the motivation to build a venture-scale business outside of it.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Nuro EC-1</h2>
<p>In 2010, Google&#8217;s autonomous vehicle project placed self-driving cars on Bay Area streets and freeways, but practical applications were thought to be at least a decade away.</p>
<p>The futurists were right on schedule: In 2020, Mountain View-based Nuro was testing its second-generation R2 robotic vehicle, the first to earn a federal exemption to operate an autonomous vehicle.</p>
<p>By the time Nuro raised $940 million for its Series B, it had already partnered with companies like CVS, Walmart and Domino&#8217;s to use the R2 for last-mile deliveries.</p>
<p>But before Nuro could even consider reaching product-market fit, its founders had to overcome technological challenges, win over regulators and strike partnerships with a range of consumer-facing companies.</p>
<p>“Neither JZ nor I think of ourselves as classic entrepreneurs or that starting a company is something we had to do in our lives,” says co-founder Dave Ferguson. “It was much more the result of soul searching and trying to figure out what is the biggest possible impact that we could have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part 1: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-origin/">How Google’s self-driving car project accidentally spawned its robotic delivery rival</a></p>
<p>Part 2: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-regulations/">Why regulators love Nuro’s self-driving delivery vehicles</a></p>
<p>Part 3: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-partnerships/">How Nuro became the robotic face of Domino’s</a></p>
<p>Part 4: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-operations/">Here’s what the inevitable friendly neighborhood robot invasion looks like</a></p>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/tinder-will-soon-make-voluntary-id-verification-available-globally/"><strong>Soon everyone will be able to verify their Tinder date:</strong></a><strong> </strong>After initially rolling out in Japan back in 2019, Tinder intends to roll out ID verification for all of its users around the world in coming quarters. Frankly, this sounds like a good idea, and one that could improve the app’s overall safety. Our only question is how it took this long for Tinder to get to.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/cisco-beefing-up-app-monitoring-portfolio-with-acquisition-of-epsagon-for-500m/"><strong>Cisco buys Epsagon:</strong></a> U.S. tech company Cisco has plonked down around $500 million for Israeli app monitoring company Epsagon. Sure, Israel is best known for its cybersecurity work, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the country is one-note. The deal didn’t appear to move Cisco’s stock, which eased modestly during a generally lackluster day for technology shares. Still, we don’t see this size of deal as often as we once did, it feels, so we wanted to highlight it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/pearson-to-pay-1m-fine-for-misleading-investors-about-2018-data-breach/">Do you want more privacy breaches? This is how you get more privacy breaches.</a> </strong>That’s my takeaway from news that Pearson is paying a $1 million fine for a 2018 breach that leaked millions of student records, one that it failed to mention to investors. The SEC agreed to the settlement. Next they’ll fine Exxon $47.29 for lying about climate change.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After meeting an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/yik-yak-shuts-down-after-square-paid-1-million-for-its-engineers/">ignominious end in 2017</a>, the anonymous gossip app once popular with college students lives again. Yik Yak returned to the iOS App Store on Monday (sorry, Android users) under new ownership, inspiring a fresh round of interest in the long-dead social network.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>With a reputation for rampant cyber-bullying and harassment, moderation woes were central to the app&#8217;s failure. Once ubiquitous on many college campuses, Yik Yak <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/08/fading-anonymous-social-network-yik-yak-is-reportedly-laying-off-most-of-its-employees/">limped into 2016</a>, laying off most employees and struggling to keep users engaged. The app tried to pivot away from campus gossip and toward location-based social networking that same year, but it wasn&#8217;t enough and the once high-flying social network was sold for scrap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GVis4hJnsW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/yik-yak-shuts-down-after-square-paid-1-million-for-its-engineers/">Yik Yak shuts down after Square paid $1 million for its engineers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Yik Yak shuts down after Square paid $1 million for its engineers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/yik-yak-shuts-down-after-square-paid-1-million-for-its-engineers/embed/#?secret=GVis4hJnsW" data-secret="GVis4hJnsW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As co-founders Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington wound down the app in 2017, Square paid $1 million for several Yik Yak engineers and rights to some of the company&#8217;s intellectual property. The company had raised $73 million and was valued around $400 million in 2014, during its peak. TechCrunch contacted the company for information about its new ownership, which is apparently based in Nashville, but has yet to receive a response.</p>
<p>Though we&#8217;re still not sure who re-launched it, the new version of Yik Yak is well aware of the original app&#8217;s pitfalls. After providing a phone number to sign up, a short onboarding sequence warns users of a zero tolerance &#8220;one strike and you&#8217;re out&#8221; policy for bullying and threats.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re committed to combating bullying and hate speech on the Yik Yak platform by any means necessary,&#8221; the new Yik Yak team, which acquired the rights to develop the app in February, <a href="https://yikyak.com/the-yak-is-back">wrote on a relaunched website</a>.</p>
<p>Being aware of what issues will inevitably arise on a social network and being prepared to moderate those issues at scale are two very different propositions. Yik Yak is anonymous, but it&#8217;s also an app focused on what&#8217;s happening IRL nearby within a tight radius, two factors that could combine to pose even more of a moderation challenge.</p>
<p>Within the new app, a sidebar points users toward &#8220;stay safe&#8221; resources address and array of issues that could arise on the app, like ridesharing, bullying, sexual consent and COVID-19, though the app doesn&#8217;t yet include explicit misinformation policies.</p>
<p>Another section in the sidebar offers a list of mental health resources and encourages users to downvote and report any bullying on the app so it can be reviewed by the Yik Yak team. The company says that yaks with a negative ranking from five or more downvotes will be automatically removed from the app&#8217;s feed, though we&#8217;ve asked the company for more details about its content moderation plans, including if a team at Yik Yak is dedicated to the task.</p>
<p>The new Yik Yak is built around location-based sharing and users can share messages, called &#8220;yaks,&#8221; to anyone within a five-mile radius. If you&#8217;re in a rural area or otherwise quiet zone devoid of yaks, you can amuse yourself with the confessions that show up on a chart of popular national posts.</p>
<p>For now, many high-ranking posts are excited chatter about the app&#8217;s return from former Yik Yak devotees — mostly younger millennials who&#8217;ve since graduated from college. A smattering of popular posts warns that Gen Z-ers too young to have used Yik Yak during its heyday won&#8217;t know what hit them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this app now 100% 25-30 year olds?&#8221; one post reads. &#8220;The Zoomers aren&#8217;t ready for the return of the Yak,&#8221; another user wrote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">South Korea’s LG Energy Solution has entered into a six-year agreement with an Australian mining company for cobalt and nickel, securing a stable supply of key minerals to make electric vehicle batteries.</p>
<p>LG Energy, a subsidiary of LG Chem, will purchase 71,000 dry metric tons of nickel and 7,000 dry metric tons of cobalt from Australian Mines Limited starting from the end of 2024. That’s enough raw material to make batteries for 1.3 million EVs with a driving range of over 310 miles per charge.</p>
<p>“Securing key raw materials and a responsible battery supply chain has become a critical element in gaining a greater control within the industry, as the demand for electric vehicles worldwide heightened in recent years,” LG Energy Solution CEO Jong-hyun Kim said in a statement.</p>
<p>The materials will be sourced from Australian Mines’ $1.5 billion Sconi Project based in Queensland, which is currently under development. The site will use a “dry stacking method” to store filtered tailings, an alternative and more eco-friendly way to manage waste from a mining site. Instead of dumping tailings into local water sources or burying them in underground quarries, dry stacking removes the water from the waste, leaving a sand-like substance that can be securely stored in management facilities.</p>
<p>“Although more costly compared to the conventional method due to construction and maintenance expenses, the dry stacking method is deemed an environmentally friendly way to extract raw materials,” LG Energy said in a statement.</p>
<p>The sole condition to the agreement is that Australian Mines secure financing for the construction of the project before the end of June next year. If secured, the agreement would account for all of the anticipated output of the site.</p>
<p>The two companies have the option to extend the agreement by another five years by mutual agreement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LG Energy is a subsidiary of LG Chem, one of the world’s largest producers of batteries and battery materials. Last month, the company said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/lg-chem-will-invest-5-2b-in-battery-materials-through-2025/">it had earmarked</a> ₩6 trillion ($5.2 billion) in its battery businesses, specifically the production of anode materials, separation membranes and cathode binders. Earlier this summer, it also entered into an agreement with Queensland Pacific Metals valued at ₩12 billion ($10.3 million), for 7,000 tons of nickel and 700 tons of cobalt per year over a 10-year period.</p>
<p>LG Chem counts Volkswagen, General Motors and Tesla amongst its customers. It said it anticipates the global battery market only expanding in the coming years, from ₩39 trillion ($34 billion) in 2021 to ₩100 trillion ($87 billion) by 2026.</p>
<p>It isn’t the only major player vying to secure sources of raw materials. In a move to obtain its own battery source, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tesla-bhp-ink-supply-deal-for-nickel-ahead-of-demand-surge/">Tesla inked a deal</a> with commodity production giant BHP in July for nickel from its mines in Western Australian.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">T-Mobile has confirmed &#8220;unauthorized access&#8221; to its systems, days after a portion of customer data was listed for sale on a known cybercriminal forum.</p>
<p>The U.S. cell giant, which last year completed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/t-mobile-officially-completes-merger-with-sprint-ceo-john-legere-steps-down-ahead-of-schedule/">a $26 billion merger with Sprint</a>, confirmed an intrusion but that it has &#8220;not yet determined that there is any personal customer data involved.&#8221; The company said that its investigation will &#8220;take some time,&#8221; and no timeline was given.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are confident that the entry point used to gain access has been closed, and we are continuing our deep technical review of the situation across our systems to identify the nature of any data that was illegally accessed,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Vice reported <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg8wg/tmobile-investigating-customer-data-breach-100-million">this weekend</a> that T-Mobile was investigating a possible intrusion after a seller was claiming to be in possession of millions of records. The seller told Vice that they had 100 million records on T-Mobile customers, which included customer account names, phone numbers, the IMEI numbers of phones on the account, and Social Security number and driver&#8217;s license information — details that the company often collects to verify the identities of its customers.</p>
<p>Vice verified a sample of the records from the seller, suggesting the data is in at least partially valid.</p>
<p>The forum post, which TechCrunch has seen, asks for 6 bitcoin, or about $275,000, for a 30 million subset of customers&#8217; data. The data was allegedly obtained from a T-Mobile-run database server that was connected to the internet, according to a screenshot posted <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-claims-to-steal-data-of-100-million-t-mobile-customers/">by Bleeping Computer</a>, which also reported that the seller has the IMEI database &#8220;going back to 2004.&#8221; IMEI and ISMI numbers can be used to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/03/digital-violence-nso-group-spyware/">uniquely identify and locate</a> a cellphone user.</p>
<p>An earlier post seen by TechCrunch from the same seller and using the same sample of data claimed to have 124 million records, but still did not name T-Mobile as the source of the data. The post was deleted in the past few days.</p>
<p>This is by our count the fifth time that T-Mobile was hacked in recent years.</p>
<p>In January, T-Mobile said it had a data breach that saw cybercriminals steal about 200,000 call records and other subscriber data. Last year, T-Mobile had two incidents — it <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/t-mobile-says-hacker-gained-access-to-employee-email-accounts-user-data/">admitted a breach</a> on its email systems that saw hackers access some T-Mobile employee email accounts and access customer data; and a breach of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/22/more-than-1-million-t-mobile-customers-exposed-by-breach/">a million prepaid customers&#8217;</a> personal and billing information months later. In 2018, T-Mobile said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/24/t-mobile-says-hackers-stole-customer-data-in-data-breach/">as many as two million customers</a> may have had their personal information scraped.</p>

			It used to be that if you were a fintech startup or, for lack of a better term, a digitally native financial services business, you might be eyeing an acquisition from an incumbent in the industry.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But lately, fintech upstarts are the ones doing the acquiring. Over just the last year or so, we’ve seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>In February 2020, <a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/">LendingClub</a> announced plans to <a href="https://bank.lendingclub.com/lendingclub-announces-acquisition-of-radius-bank/">acquire Radius Bank</a> in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at $185 million. The deal <a href="https://bank.lendingclub.com/its-official-today-radius-joined-lendingclub/">closed in February 2021</a>, leading to a very quick and surprising <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/lendingclub-stock-jumps-40-after-surprise-q2-profit-11627505448?mod=article_inline">second-quarter profit</a>.</li>
<li>In March of this year, <a href="https://www.sofi.com/">SoFi</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/sofi-acquires-community-bank-golden-pacific-bancorp-to-speed-up-its-national-bank-charter-process/">agreed to acquire Golden Pacific Bancorp (GBP)</a> for about $22.3 million in a deal that was designed to accelerate its acquisition of a national bank charter.</li>
<li>Earlier this month, blockchain-based lender <a href="https://www.figure.com/">Figure Technologies</a> <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210803005925/en/Figure-Announces-Merger-With-Top-Mortgage-Lender-Homebridge-Financial-Services">agreed to merge</a> with mortgage firm Homebridge Financial Services, which has 180 retail branches and funded more than $25 billion in home loans in 2020.</li>
<li>And last fall, fintech startup and challenger bank Jiko <a href="https://finledger.com/2020/09/04/fintech-startup-jiko-completes-buy-of-nationally-regulated-u-s-bank/">acquired Wadena, Minnesota-based Mid-Central National Bank</a> in a deal that took years of due diligence and whose sales price fell in the range of a Series A round, according to the founder.</li>

<p>So what’s going on here? Why are fintechs now acquiring legacy financial services businesses, instead of the other way around?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter&#8217;s ambitious upstart decentralized social media working group &#8220;<a href="https://blueskyweb.org/">bluesky</a>&#8221; took an important step Monday as the social media company appointed a formal project lead who will direct how the protocol develops moving forward.</p>
<p>Crypto developer Jay Graber was tapped by Twitter to helm the initiative, which the company hopes will eventually create a decentralized social media protocol that a number of social networks including Twitter will operate on. The separate bluesky organization will operate independently but to date has been funded and managed largely by employees at Twitter.</p>
<p>Graber had already been working in a less formal role inside the bluesky team, with Twitter paying her to create a technical review of the decentralized social ecosystem for a working group of developers in the space. Graber previously worked on the developer team behind privacy focused cryptocurrency Zcash and built out her own decentralized social network called <a href="https://happening.net/">Happening</a>, designed to compete with Facebook Events. Graber eventually walked away from the effort after having issues bootstrapping a user base interested in the benefits of decentralization, something that has grown to be a near-insurmountable issue for most upstart networks in the space.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m excited to announce that I’ll be leading <a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bluesky</a>, an initiative started by <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Twitter</a> to decentralize social media. Follow updates on Twitter and at <a href="https://t.co/Sg4MxK1zwl">https://t.co/Sg4MxK1zwl</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jay Graber (@arcalinea) <a href="https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1427314482154414080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In an interview back in January, Graber told TechCrunch she saw a major opportunity in Twitter entering the decentralized social space due to the hefty user base on the Twitter platform, which will itself eventually migrate to the protocol, the company has said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The really powerful thing about Twitter doing a decentralized protocol move is that if you could design a protocol that works in an ideal way, you don&#8217;t have to go through the initial effort of finding the niche to bootstrap from because Twitter will bring so many users,&#8221; Graber told us.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In January, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/">TechCrunch profiled the initiative</a> as it gathered more attention following Twitter&#8217;s permanent ban of former President Donald Trump from its platform. Following Trump&#8217;s removal, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey highlighted the bluesky effort as one of the company&#8217;s ongoing initiatives to ensure that social media moderation could be less </span>decentralized<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in the future. A decentralized social media protocol would allow for individual networks to govern themselves without one company or organization exercising monolithic control over the sphere of online conversations. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think a huge focus for everyone involved has been thinking how do we enable better moderation, and not just coming from one source,&#8221; Graber told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The bluesky organization is still in its earliest stages. Graber&#8217;s next task is bulking up the team with its first hires, which include a protocol developer and web developer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford-owned micromobility company Spin has announced an integration with Google Maps. Now, users planning their trips in 84 cities, towns and campuses across the U.S., Canada, Germany and Spain will be able to view Spin&#8217;s electric scooters and bikes on the app while planning their trip.</p>
<p>Spin joins its top competition on the popular mapping app, Lime, which also recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/moovit-integrates-lime-electric-scooters-bikes-mopeds-into-transit-planning-app/">announced an integration with transit planning app Moovit</a>. We can expect to see further integrations of micromobility operators with mapping apps as shared mobility becomes part of the broader transit ecosystem.</p>
<p>A recent report from the <a href="https://nabsa.net/about/industry/">North American Bikeshare &amp; Scootershare Association</a> on the state of the micromobility industry found that 50% of riders reported using shared mobility to connect to transit, and 16% of all micromobility trips were for the purpose of connecting to transit.</p>
<p>Similar to Lime, the Spin icon will now show up under Google Map&#8217;s bike section when planning a journey &#8212; only in the mobile app, not on the desktop. A user will see the nearest available Spin vehicle, how long it will take to walk to it, what the estimated battery range is and the expected arrival time if using the vehicle. Choosing that option will direct users to the Spin app to pay for and unlock the vehicle.</p>
<p>“With this integration, Spin is making it easier for millions of Google Maps users to easily incorporate shared bikes and scooters into their daily trips,” Ben Bear, CEO of Spin, said in a statement. “Our goal is to make it as low friction as possible for consumers to plan multi-modal journeys. It needs to be just as easy, and even more convenient to get around with bikes, buses, trains and scooters as it is with a personal car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bear also said this collaboration with Google is Spin&#8217;s largest yet, and he teased &#8220;many more in the pipeline.&#8221; Spin is already integrated into platforms like Citymapper, Moovit, Transit and Kölner Verkehrs-Betriebe. This news comes not long after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy/">Spin announced it would be adding e-bikes to the mix</a> and trying to capture market share with exclusive or semi-exclusive city partnerships. A major app integration such as this one could be a vote of confidence for Spin looking to partner with more cities in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tinder announced this morning that in the &#8220;<a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-16-Tinder-Commits-to-ID-Verification-for-Members-Globally,-a-First-in-the-Dating-Category">coming quarters</a>,&#8221; users will be able to verify their ID on the app. This feature <a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041821872-Age-verify-to-chat-with-matches">was first rolled out in Japan</a> in 2019, where Tinder users must verify that they are at least 18 years old. Aside from places like Japan, where this is mandated by law, ID verification will &#8220;begin as voluntary,&#8221; Tinder wrote in a <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-16-Tinder-Commits-to-ID-Verification-for-Members-Globally,-a-First-in-the-Dating-Category">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>ID verification will be free for all users, similar to its <a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034941812-What-is-Photo-Verification-">photo verification</a> feature. According to a Tinder spokesperson, the company will also use ID verification to cross-reference data like the sex offender registry in regions where that information is accessible. Tinder already does this via credit card lookup when users sign up for a subscription. Per its <a href="https://policies.tinder.com/terms/us/en">terms of use</a>, Tinder requires that users &#8220;have never been convicted of or pled no contest to a felony, a sex crime, or any crime involving violence, and that you are not required to register as a sex offender with any state, federal or local sex offender registry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The existing photo verification feature adds a Twitter-like blue check to a user&#8217;s profile, while ID verification will yield another distinct badge. That way, users can tell whether or not a potential date has confirmed their identity via photo verification, ID verification, both or neither.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creating a truly equitable solution for ID Verification is a challenging, but critical safety project and we are looking to our communities as well as experts to help inform our approach,&#8221; the company <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-16-Tinder-Commits-to-ID-Verification-for-Members-Globally,-a-First-in-the-Dating-Category">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>While Tinder has made continued investments in safety features, free ID verification can only go so far &#8212; especially when voluntary, putting the onus on individual users to decide whether or not they feel comfortable meeting up with unverified users. But in March 2021, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Match Group, the parent company to Tinder, announced its </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/match-group-makes-seven-figure-investment-in-background-check-nonprofit-garbo/">seven-figure contribution</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to the nonprofit background check company Garbo. </span>Garbo&#8217;s background checks could help detect dating app users with a history of violence or abuse, but we have yet to see how that will be integrated into Tinder, and if users will be charged for access. Notably, Garbo conducts &#8220;equitable background&#8221; checks, meaning that it will exclude <a href="https://medium.com/garbo/update-to-garbos-database-policy-to-create-a-more-equitable-background-check-da94028ad715">drug possession charges and minor traffic incidents</a> on its platform, citing the way that these charges are disproportionately levied against vulnerable communities.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Though Tinder said it will not be using Garbo&#8217;s tech to power its ID verification tools, the company noted to TechCrunch that it will have more information to share about background checks via Garbo in the fall. Tinder didn&#8217;t share whether or not access to information from Garbo will be paywalled. At the time of the investment, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/match-group-makes-seven-figure-investment-in-background-check-nonprofit-garbo/">Match Group said</a> it would determine pricing &#8212; if it does choose to paywall this information &#8212; based on factors like user adoption, how many people want to use it and how many searches they want to perform.</span></p>
<p>Tinder&#8217;s investment in safety features is encouraging, but if left behind a paywall, impact may be limited. Match Group faced serious scrutiny in December 2019, when <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/tinder-lets-known-sex-offenders-use-the-app-its-not-the-only-one">an investigation</a> by Columbia Journalism Investigations (CJI) and ProPublica found that the company screened for sexual predators on Match, a paid service, but not on free apps like Tinder, OkCupid and PlentyofFish. At the time, a spokesperson for the company said, “There are definitely registered sex offenders on our free products.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In January 2020, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/subcommittee-chairman-krishnamoorthi-launches-investigation-into-user-safety">launched an investigation</a> into user safety policies on dating apps, sending letters to Match Group, The Meet Group, Bumble and Grindr. He wrote, &#8220;Protection from sexual predators should not be a luxury confined to paying customers.” The following month, U.S. Representatives Ann Kuster (D-NH) and Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) wrote a <a href="https://schakowsky.house.gov/media/press-releases/schakowsky-kuster-lead-letter-match-group-president-calling-improvements">letter to Match Group</a>, signed by nine other representatives, stating their concern that Match Group doesn&#8217;t cross-reference user responses with sex offender registries.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Around the same time, Match Group made several moves to invest more deeply in </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-02-25-The-Top-10-Safety-Focused-Features-on-Tinder">user safety</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; for example, it </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/match-group-invests-in-noonlight-to-power-new-safety-features-in-tinder-and-other-dating-apps/">acquired Noonlight</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in January 2020, which allows users in the U.S. to share who, when and where they&#8217;re meeting someone. In dangerous situations, users can discreetly trigger emergency services &#8212; Noonlight will first reach out to the user, then call 911 if necessary (Noonlight&#8217;s basic version is free, but some features like connecting to an Apple Watch, Google Home or Alexa are only available by upgrading to a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="http://help.noonlight.com/en/articles/3270559-how-much-does-noonlight-cost">$5 or $10 monthly plan</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">). Features like these can be controversial due to concerns about police intervention, but might help some users feel a sense of security. But blocking offenders prior to signup could lessen the need for such intervention in the first place.</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The past decade has seen several structural changes in know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations in Europe and globally. High-profile money laundering cases and the penetration of illicit funds into global markets have caught the attention of regulators and the public, and rightfully so.</p>
<p>The Wirecard scandal was a particularly salacious example, in which the investigation into widespread fraud <a href="https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2020/07/wirecard-a-scandal/">revealed a chain of shell companies involved in illegal distribution of narcotics and pornography</a>. Over at Danske Bank, some <a href="https://www.complianceweek.com/aml/how-danske-is-cleaning-up-after-a-200b-money-laundering-scandal/29595.article">$227 billion was laundered through an Estonian subsidiary</a>, going virtually unnoticed for nine years.</p>
<p>In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an action <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338">against Ripple Labs and two of its executives</a>, claiming they had raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering. That case is ongoing.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

			Traditional forms of regulation from the fiat world do not reciprocally apply to every aspect of crypto nor to the fundamental nature of blockchain technology.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As regulators and financial institutions improve their understanding of these criminal practices, AML requirements have likewise been improved. But these adjustments have been an overwhelmingly reactive, trial-by-fire process.</p>
<p>To address the challenges of the fast-evolving blockchain ecosystem, the European Union has begun to introduce more stringent financial regulations that further bolster the regulatory system in order to improve licensing models. Many member states now regulate crypto assets individually, and Germany is leading the way in being the first to regulate cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>These individual regulations clearly prescribe the pathway for crypto companies, outlining the requirements for obtaining and maintaining a financial license from the regulator. Compliance naturally boosts investor confidence and protection.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As these financial crimes and crypto itself evolves, so have regulatory bodies’ efforts to monitor, address and enforce restrictions. Internationally, the most prominent monitoring body is the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which outlines general guidance and determines best practices in anti-money-laundering practices and combating the financing of terrorism.</p>
<p>Although FATF is considered soft law, the task force sets the bar for workable regulations within crypto assets. Especially notable is FATF’s Recommendation 16, better known as the “travel rule,” which requires businesses to collect and store the personal data of participants in blockchain transactions. In theory, access to this data will enable authorities to have better oversight and enforcement of crypto market regulations. In other words, they’ll know exactly who is doing exactly what. Transparency is key.</p>
<h2>The travel rule conundrum</h2>
<p>FATF’s travel rule impacts two types of businesses: traditional financial institutions (banks, credit firms and so on) and crypto companies, otherwise known as <a href="https://sumsub.com/blog/latest-fatf-rules-jolt-crypto-businesses-what-are-the-new-realities-crypto-has-to-acknowledge-to-stay-afloat/">virtual asset service providers</a> (VASPs).</p>
<p>In its original incarnation, the travel rule only applied to banks, but was expanded to crypto companies in 2019. In 2021, many of the FATF member jurisdictions began to incorporate the travel rule into their local AML laws. This regulatory shift sent shockwaves through the crypto sector. The stakes of refusal are high: Failure to incorporate the travel rule results in a service provider being declared noncompliant, which is a major obstacle to doing business.</p>
<p>But, the travel rule is also a major hindrance that doesn’t take into account the novelty of crypto technology. It is problematic for crypto businesses to integrate due to the major amount of effort it poses when obtaining KYC data about the recipient and integrating it into day-to-day business.</p>
<p>In order for crypto businesses to obtain this information for outgoing payments, data would have to be provided by the client and would end up being virtually impossible to verify. This is highly disruptive to the crypto’s emblematic efficiency. Moreover, its implementation presents challenges regarding the accuracy of the data received by VASPs and banks. Also, it creates further data vulnerabilities due to additional data silos being created across the globe.</p>
<p>When it comes to international standardization measures rather than those isolated within certain communities, there is a wide gap between exclusively on-chain solutions (transactions that are recorded and verified on one specific blockchain) and cross-chain communication, which allows for interactions between different blockchains or for combining on-chain transactions with off-chain transactions that are conducted on other electronic systems, such as PayPal.</p>
<p>We must eventually find a halfway point between those with valid concerns about the anonymity crypto assets provide and those who see regulation as prohibitively restrictive on crypto. Both sides have a point, but crypto’s continued legitimacy and viability within the larger financial markets and industry is a net positive for all parties, making this negotiation nothing short of crucial.</p>
<h2>Not anti-regulation, just anti-unworkable regulations</h2>
<p>Ultimately, we need to regulate with efficacy, which necessitates legislation that is applicable specifically to digital assets and does not hinder the market without really solving any AML-related problems.</p>
<p>The already global nature of the traditional financial industry underscores the value of and need for FATF’s issuance of an international framework for regulatory oversight within crypto.</p>
<p>The criminal financial trade &#8212; money laundering, illegal weapons sales, human trafficking and so on &#8212; is also an international business. Thus, cracking down on it is, out of necessity, an international effort.</p>
<p>The decentralized nature of blockchain, which runs contrary to the central-server standard we know and use nearly everywhere, presents a formidable challenge here. Rules and regulations for traditional financial institutions are being implemented part and parcel onto crypto — a misstep and misunderstanding that ignores the innovation and novelty this economic ecosystem and its underlying technology entails.</p>
<p>Traditional forms of regulation from the fiat world do not reciprocally apply to every aspect of crypto nor to the fundamental nature of blockchain technology. However well intentioned they may be, because these imposed regulations are built on an old system, they must be adapted and modified.</p>
<p>The creation of fair restrictions on the technology’s use requires a fundamental understanding and cooperation within the limits and characteristics of those technologies. In traditional financial circles, the topic of blockchain is currently subject to more impassioned rhetoric than genuine understanding.</p>
<p>At the heart of the issue is the fundamental misunderstanding that blockchain transactions are anonymous or untraceable. Blockchain transactions are pseudo-anonymous and, in most circumstances, can offer more traceability and transparency than traditional banking. Illegal activity conducted on the blockchain will always be far more traceable than cash transactions, for example.</p>
<p>Technology with such immense potential should be made accessible, regulated and beneficial for everyone. Blockchain and digital assets are already revolutionizing the way we operate, and regulatory measures need to follow suit. The way forward cannot simply be delivering old-school directives, demanding obedience and doling out unfair punishments. There’s no reason a new way forward isn’t possible.</p>
<h2>The end of the outlaw era</h2>
<p>Activity can already be monitored through a collective database of users known to abide by international standards. This knowledge of approved users and vendors allows the industry to spot misconduct or malfeasance far sooner than usual, singling out and restricting illegitimate users.</p>
<p>By means of a well-thought-through tweaking of the suggested regulations, a verified network can collectively be built to ensure trust and properly leverage blockchain’s potential, while barring those bad actors intent on corrupting or manipulating the system. That would be a huge step forward in prosecuting international financial crimes and ensuring crypto’s legitimacy globally.</p>
<p>Crypto’s outlaw days are over, but it’s gained an unprecedented level of legitimacy that can only be preserved and bolstered by abiding with regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>That regulatory oversight can’t just be the old way of doing things copy-and-pasted onto blockchain transactions. Instead, it needs to be one that helps fight criminal activity, shores up investor confidence and throws a bone &#8212; not a wrench &#8212; to the very mechanics that make crypto a desirable financial investment.</p>
