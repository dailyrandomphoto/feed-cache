										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacquelle?originalSubdomain=ch">Jacquelle Amankonah Horton</a> left her role at Google after seven years, where she had been a product manager for Google Assistant and various YouTube products, she knew there was a white space in social. She built <a href="https://www.faveforfans.com/">Fave</a> to fill in that gap, and the company today announced the close of a $2.2 million seed round.</p>
<p>Female Founders Fund, HYBE, Sony Music, Warner Music, Concord Music, Quality Control, Right Hand Management, Techstars Music and Betaworks all participated in the round.</p>
<p>Fave is all about the relationship between fans and creators. As Horton describes it, creators and artists have a variety of ways they can reach out to their fans and share their lives, but for the super fans out there, there is no way to truly express their adoration beyond the flat experience of commenting on an Instagram post or liking a tweet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fave is broken down by fandoms (starting with Swifties/Taylor Swift), allowing allows fans to connect with one another, create content, and buy and sell fan-themed merchandise and artwork to one another. Fave&#8217;s go-to-market is focused on the fans themselves, though the hope is to also bring creators on to the platform, which ultimately gives them another revenue stream.</p>
<p>Creators and Fave alike can generate revenue through advertising or through a transaction fee on goods sold through the marketplace. When creators list their own merch, they get a 10 percent cut. Fave takes a 10 percent cut on all transactions, whether sold by the creator or a fan.</p>
<p>Alongside the announcement of the funding, Fave is also launching into public beta.</p>
<p>Horton explained to TechCrunch that one tactic for the company is to engage with the top influencers for each respective fandom. Across fan communities, there are people who are relatively well-known as the top fans, sharing content and often getting recognized by the creator.</p>
<p>Fave is onboarding these influencers early on in the creation of a fandom to attract the rest of the fans over to the platform. The startup is also looking to capitalize on some of the competitiveness involved in being a super fan, giving creators the ability to set up trivia tournaments and other competitions. Users that do well are rewarded with points that can be spent in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Horton said that she grew up as a super fan herself and can relate to the users.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was the girl in her bedroom who knew every lyric of every song, how many freckles they have, and fell asleep to the movie every single night just to hear the sound of his voice,&#8221; said Horton. &#8220;But I wasn&#8217;t able to go sit front row at a concert or spend $70 on a sweatshirt so the artists got nothing from me despite my deep passion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hope to give fans a place where they can truly let their fan flag fly, while giving artists a way to connect directly with fans. Though the startup only has one fandom open right now, they&#8217;re actively listening to users on the platform to determine which fandoms to build out next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of this morning&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/">announcement</a> of Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/">next-generation music service</a> featuring lossless audio and spatial audio with support for Dolby Atmos, Amazon is making a move likely aimed at retaining its own streaming music subscribers. The company says that going forward, its high-quality streaming tier, Amazon Music HD, will be made available to all eligible Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers at no extra cost.</p>
<p>Amazon first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/amazon-launches-amazon-music-hd-with-lossless-audio-streaming/">announced</a> Amazon Music HD in fall 2019 with access to over 50 million songs that would stream in what Amazon is calling HD, with a bit depth of 16 bits, and a sample rate of 44.1kHz (around CD-quality). It also promised &#8220;millions&#8221; more songs that would stream in Ultra HD, or 24-bit, with a sample rate of up to 192kHz (or better than CD quality).</p>
<p>Today, Amazon Music&#8217;s HD catalog has grown to over 70 million songs and there are over 7 million Ultra HD tracks available. Amazon Music HD customers can also access a growing catalog of songs remixed in 3D Audio formats such as Dolby Atmos and Sony 360RA, which can be played back on Amazon&#8217;s own high-fidelity speaker, the Echo Studio.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Music in 360RA can also be streamed via Amazon Music HD on Sony’s RA5000 and RA3000 speakers by using Alexa Cast, the company notes.</p>
<p>The launch of HD streaming was seen as a way to counteract the threat from the music streaming service Tidal, which had been catering to audiophiles with higher quality streams, as well as a way to differentiate its service from larger streaming rivals, like Apple and Spotify &#8212; the latter which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/"> recently announced a high-end subscription of its own</a>, Spotify HiFi, whose pricing and launch date is yet unknown.</p>
<p>Before today, Amazon Music HD was priced at $12.99 per month for Amazon Prime subscribers and $14.99 per month for anyone else. Now, Amazon says that new and existing subscribers to the Amazon Music Unlimited Individual Plan ($7.99/month for Prime members and $9.99/month otherwise) or the Family Plan ($14.99/month) can upgrade to Amazon Music HD at no additional cost &#8212; essentially a $5 per month savings.</p>
<p>The changes will kick in at the next billing cycle, and are supported in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Canada, France, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we first launched Amazon Music HD, our goal was to lead the industry by enabling music fans around the world to stream the best quality recording, the way artists intended their music to be heard,&#8221; said Steve Boom, VP of Amazon Music, in a statement about today&#8217;s news. &#8220;We’re thrilled now to make Amazon Music HD available to everyone at no extra cost. All music fans should have access to this quality of music, and now they do,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The move by Amazon to make its HD catalog a free upgrade follows this morning&#8217;s announcement from Apple that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/">it will add lossless audio to Apple Music at no additional cost,</a> starting next month. Apple touts over 75 million songs in lossless audio. The upgrade will also bring spatial audio with support for Dolby Atmos. Given the shift in the market, the pressure is on Spotify to make its HiFi music service competitively priced, as well.</p>
<p>Amazon Music Unlimited has been seen as the dark horse of music streaming, given its potential to grow to a larger size simply based on its ties with Amazon&#8217;s popular Prime subscription. The service had 55 million subscribers since early 2020, but Amazon declined to provide an updated figure today. For comparison, Apple Music <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/apple-music-surpasses-60-million-subscribers/">announced</a> 60 million subscribers in 2019 and was estimated to have grown to <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/apple-music-statistics/">72 million</a> by early 2020 and likely more than<a href="https://musically.com/2020/02/19/spotify-apple-how-many-users-big-music-streaming-services/"> 80 million</a> by now. Spotify, meanwhile, has <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-28/spotify-reports-first-quarter-2021-earnings/">158 million</a> paid subscribers.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>There was lots to get through today, so, in order, here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early-stage founders can still apply for the impending Disrupt Battlefield even. You can sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/deadline-extended-apply-to-startup-battlefield-at-tc-disrupt-2021/">here</a> if that&#8217;s you. It&#8217;s going to be a lot of fun tbh.</li>
<li>From the weekend: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/san-francisco-tech-companies-sitting-on-record-amounts-of-empty-space.html">San Francisco real estate is a mess</a>; Twitter Blue <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393541248049303555">is coming</a> and I am hype about it; Elon Musk roiled crypto markets by being himself, which doesn&#8217;t speak too highly of the asset class.</li>
<li>AT&amp;T is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/att-confirms-deal-to-combine-its-warnermedia-subsidiary-with-discovery-inc-in-pure-play-43b-deal/">getting out of the TV game to some degree</a>, selling media assets to help pay down debt. Just like Verizon did <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">by selling TechCrunch and family to Apollo</a>.</li>
<li>We also chatted about two Indian mega-rounds: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/merchant-commerce-platform-pine-labs-raises-285-million/">Pine Labs raising $285 million</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/indias-moglix-valued-at-1-billion-in-120-million-fundraise/">Moglix raising $120 million</a>.</li>
<li>From the early-stage front, two rounds this morning for your pleasure: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/sequoia-leads-5m-pre-seed-in-egypts-1-month-old-digital-bank-telda/">Telda&#8217;s super-cool pre-seed round</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/fresh-out-of-yc-houm-raises-8m-to-improve-the-home-rental-and-sales-market-in-latam/">recent Y Combinator-grad Houm&#8217;s latest investment</a>, which explains why the accelerator program is still so popular.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/">announced</a> that it is adding some new features to its music streaming service&nbsp;Apple Music. Starting next month, users will find some new options, such as spatial audio with support for Dolby Atmos as well as lossless audio files.</p>
<p>Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/">recently announced</a> a new high-end subscription tier with CD-quality, lossless audio files. But Spotify HiFi isn’t included in Spotify Premium by itself. You’ll have to pay a bit more money to stream lossless audio. Pricing hasn’t been disclosed yet.</p>
<p>Apple’s move is a bit different as lossless audio is going to be included in the basic Apple Music subscription tier. For $9.99 per month, you’ll be able to choose between various audio quality settings. By default, Apple and other streaming services compress audio files so that it doesn’t require a lot of bandwidth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can also choose CD-quality, lossless streaming — 16 bit at 44.1 kHz. In that case, you’ll receive lossless audio files. Behind the scenes, Apple uses its own lossless audio format (ALAC, Apple Lossless Audio Codec). But that shouldn’t have an impact as FLAC, WAV or ALAC files sound exactly the same — it’s lossless audio.</p>
<p>If you have a <em>truly</em> unlimited mobile plan, you can even choose 24 bit at 48 kHz or 24 bit at 192 kHz. In that case, the average weight of a song should be around 250MB — yep, that’s a lot of bytes. Apple says you have to use an external, USB digital-to-analog converter to take advantage of the hi-resolution lossless tier. Plugging a pair of headphones with your iPhone won’t cut it.</p>
<p>The entire Apple Music catalog of 75 million songs will support lossless audio. Music distributors already upload lossless audio files when they submit a song to streaming services. Adding lossless audio is all about surfacing those files to the end users.</p>
<p>As for spatial audio, it’ll be enabled by default on hardware that supports Dolby Atmos, such as AirPods and Beats headphones with an H1 or W1 chip. The most recent iPhone, iPad and Mac models also support Dolby Atmos. But it sounds like songs have to be remastered for Dolby Atmos specifically.</p>
<p>At first, only “thousands of songs” will support spatial audio. Artists include J Balvin, Gustavo Dudamel, Ariana Grande, Maroon 5, Kacey Musgraves and The Weeknd. You’ll be able to identify those tracks with a badge in the user interface.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As gaming platforms capitalize on pandemic-fueled traffic to their digital worlds, brands that drive culture in the physical world are fighting to ensure they don’t miss any new opportunities. A new partnership between Roblox and Gucci brings digital items from the fashion house into the platform’s metaverse alongside a new limited-run digital experience.</p>
<p>Guccis new experience teams a set of virtual spaces with a set of digital branded items in an effort to immerse Roblox users inside a world that feels unique to the Gucci brand and Roblox platform. The new space, called Gucci Garden, debuts today for a two-week run on the Roblox platform.</p>
<p>The environment takes advantage of recent advances in the game engine powering Roblox, bringing users a high-dynamic set of environments that they can traverse as blank mannequins, which evolve visually as users move through different spaces. Different rooms in the experience draw influence from different Gucci campaigns of the past several years. The digital event&#8217;s rollout accompanies a real-world multimedia event in Florence.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The rollout follows an early pilot with creator Rook Vanguard in releasing Gucci-branded digital items to the platform this past December.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2152720 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Come-as-You-Are-RSVP_Gucci-Garden-on-Roblox.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Come-as-You-Are-RSVP_Gucci-Garden-on-Roblox.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Come-as-You-Are-RSVP_Gucci-Garden-on-Roblox.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Come-as-You-Are-RSVP_Gucci-Garden-on-Roblox.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Come-as-You-Are-RSVP_Gucci-Garden-on-Roblox.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Come-as-You-Are-RSVP_Gucci-Garden-on-Roblox.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Come-as-You-Are-RSVP_Gucci-Garden-on-Roblox.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Come-as-You-Are-RSVP_Gucci-Garden-on-Roblox.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Gucci CMO Robert Triefus details how the luxury fashion brand has been redefining its approachability as it extends its reach to digital platforms like Roblox &#8212; which the company sees as an opportunity that&#8217;s growing too quickly to ignore.</p>
<p>“Hats off to Roblox, scale came quickly,” Triefus tells TechCrunch. “Gucci is scale, though it’s taken us 100 years, and it took Roblox about 100 days.”</p>
<p>For high-fashion brands, the digital sphere has presented plenty of challenges when it comes to preserving exclusivity on a medium that begs for mass adoption. Triefus says Gucci has aimed to lean into the access offered by digital platforms as a way of promoting a more inclusive brand.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s so much talk today about the metaverse,” Triefus says. “In the last 6 years, [Creative Director Alessandro Michele] has created a Gucci Metaverse but it&#8217;s not necessarily a digital manifestation, it&#8217;s a narrative.”</p>
<p>Luxury and authenticity have been some of the central sells of blockchain-based NFTs, something Triefus still sees opportunities for down the road. &#8220;It’s astonishing to me how fast the conversation around NFTs has exploded,” Triefus says. &#8220;We’ve been studying blockchain for a long time as you might imagine, authenticity of product and of experience is extremely important.”</p>
<p>In addition to experiments with Roblox, late last year Gucci partnered with startup Genies to outfit user avatars.</p>

<p>Virtual items from real world retailers have been relatively slow to pop up inside digital worlds, though as user perceptions of paying for digital goods have shifted, platforms are moving to capitalize.</p>
<p>“We don’t partner with very many brands,” Roblox exec Christina Wootton tells TechCrunch. “One thing that was very special when we started speaking with Gucci is that they took the time to understand our platform and what works well for designers and creators in our community.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another major telco in the US is making a big move away from being a full player in media services, and specifically content creation. Today AT&amp;T said that it is combining its WarnerMedia division with Discovery Inc.</p>
<p>The deal is being structured as a &#8220;Reverse Morris Trust&#8221; transaction that will give AT&amp;T $43 billion in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WarnerMedia’s retention of certain debt. The deal will see AT&amp;T shareholders receive stock representing 71% of the new company, while Discovery shareholders will have 21%, the companies <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/warnermedia_discovery.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in an announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav will lead the new, combined company. Not clear what role Jason Kilar, the CEO of WarnerMedia currently, will have, but his name is not mentioned in the press release&#8230; He is currently the CEO now of Warner Media, AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey confirmed in a press conference today..</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The deal confirms rumors <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-05-16/att-merge-media-assets-discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over the weekend</a>, and it comes weeks after Verizon Communications announced that it would be selling off its own non-telecoms interests, Verizon Media, in a deal with Apollo Management in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$5 billion deal</a>. (TechCrunch is a part of Verizon Media.) Zaslav said in a press conference with Stankey that the deal was hammered out in secret in &#8220;my Greenwich Village townhouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a press conference, executives from both firms said they expect the deal to be completed by mid-2022. They said they will be announcing a new name in due course, too.</p>
<p>At a time when streaming the name of the game in media &#8212; this is where consumers are watching, and they are watching in more ways than ever before such as phones and tablets, and that means not just classic media companies, but also a wide range of technology companies are also investing big here &#8212; this is creating nothing short of a content colossus.</p>
<p>It will include some 200,000 hours of iconic programming with more than 100 of the &#8220;most cherished, popular and trusted brands in the world&#8221;. These include HBO, Warner Bros., Discovery, DC Comics, CNN, Cartoon Network, HGTV, Food Network, the Turner Networks, TNT, TBS, Eurosport, Magnolia, TLC and Animal Planet. The companies confirmed that they plan to include news in the largely-entertainment focused group. They say it will have annual revenues of approximately $52 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $14 billion, and Free Cash Flow conversion rate of around 60% and &#8220;at least $3 billion in expected cost synergies.&#8221; (That will be a tough one to see play out&#8230; that is a lot of cuts.)</p>
<p>On the other side, it&#8217;s something of a retreat for AT&amp;T, which spent years building out (and fighting regulators own) its Warner empire, which had been intended to be the telco&#8217;s big play to not just provide the network for people to interact with services &#8212; be it voice, broadband or mobile &#8212; but the content itself.</p>
<p>Yes, AT&amp;T shareholders will still keep in 71% of the company, but this deal indicates that the company sees more value in building that body of content creation as its own entity independent of it. Not least, it will likely give those individual content companies significantly more empowerment for striking deals with other network providers without any vested interests in those deals. But in addition to that, it will free the media companies to explore which channels might be best for what they are producing, even when those channels might compete directly with AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>In media and communications, there was a time when all people could talk about was &#8220;triple play&#8221; (TV, broadband and voice) and then &#8220;quad play&#8221; (adding in mobile) as the ideal suite of services to capture consumers and their entertainment and information appetites (and by association their media/advertising appetites). That&#8217;s proven to be a much more complicated dream to realise, however, so it&#8217;s no surprise to see the companies today touting what a great &#8220;pure play&#8221; deal this is for everyone.</p>
<p>“This agreement unites two entertainment leaders with complementary content strengths and positions the new company to be one of the leading global direct-to-consumer streaming platforms,&#8221; said AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey in a statement. &#8220;It will support the fantastic growth and international launch of HBO Max with Discovery’s global footprint and create efficiencies which can be re-invested in producing more great content to give consumers what they want. For AT&amp;T shareholders, this is an opportunity to unlock value and be one of the best capitalized broadband companies, focused on investing in 5G and fiber to meet substantial, long-term demand for connectivity. AT&amp;T shareholders will retain their stake in our leading communications company that comes with an attractive dividend. Plus, they will get a stake in the new company, a global media leader that can build one of the top streaming platforms in the world.”</p>
<p>Zaslav and Discovery may have been a one-time competitor to the Warner empire but it&#8217;s a different tune now:</p>
<p>&#8220;During my many conversations with John, we always come back to the same simple and powerful strategic principle: these assets are better and more valuable together,&#8221; Zaslav said in a statement. &#8220;It is super exciting to combine such historic brands, world class journalism and iconic franchises under one roof and unlock so much value and opportunity. With a library of cherished IP, dynamite management teams and global expertise in every market in the world, we believe everyone wins&#8230;consumers with more diverse choices, talent and storytellers with more resources and compelling pathways to larger audiences, and shareholders with a globally scaled growth company committed to a strong balance sheet that is better positioned to compete with the world’s largest streamers. We will build a new chapter together with the creative and talented WarnerMedia team and these incredible assets built on a nearly 100-year legacy of the most wonderful storytelling in the world. That will be our singular mission: to focus on telling the most amazing stories and have a ton of fun doing it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buzzy face-swapping video app <a href="https://hey.reface.ai">Reface</a> is expanding its reality-shifting potential beyond selfies by letting users upload more of their own content for its AI to bring to life.</p>
<p>Users of its iOS and Android apps still can&#8217;t upload their own user generated video but the latest feature &#8212; which it calls Swap Animation &#8212; lets them upload images of humanoid stuff (monuments, memes, fine art portraits, or &#8212; indeed &#8212; photos of other people) which they want animated, choosing from a selection of in-app song snippets and poems for the AI-incarnate version to appear to speak/sing etc.</p>
<p>Reface&#8217;s freemium app has, thus far, taken a tightly curated approach to the content users can animate, only letting you face swap a selfie into a pre-set selection of movie and music video snippets (plus memes, GIFs, red carpet celeb shots, salon hair-dos and more).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the new feature &#8212; which similarly relies<span style="font-weight: 400;"> on </span>GAN (generative adversarial network) algorithms to work its reality-bending effects &#8212; expands the expressive potential of the app by letting users supply their own source material to face swap/animate.</p>
<p>Some rival apps do already offer this kind of functionality &#8212; so there&#8217;s an element of Reface catching up to apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/deep-fake-video-app-avatarify-which-process-on-phone-plans-digital-watermark-for-videos/">Avatarify</a>, Wombo and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/myheritage-now-lets-you-animate-old-family-photos-using-deepfakery/">Deep Nostalgia</a>.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also going further as users can also swap their own face into their chosen source content. So you could, for example, get to see yourself as a singing Venus de Milo, or watch your visage recite a poem from the middle of a pop-art painting like Andy Warhol&#8217;s <em>Marilyn</em>.</p>
<p>The Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup is still being cautious as it expands what users can do with its high tech face-shifting tool &#8212; saying it will be manually moderating all uploads from the new feature.</p>
<p>Rivals in the deepfake space are arguably pushing its hand to open up functionality faster, though, with apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/deep-fake-video-app-avatarify-which-process-on-phone-plans-digital-watermark-for-videos/">Avatarify</a> already letting users animate their own snaps. And &#8212; notably &#8212; a Reface spokeswoman told us it&#8217;s planning to make user generated video uploads available &#8220;in the near future&#8221;.</p>
<p>Pro users are getting a little taster &#8212; as they can upload their own GIFs to face swap into with this latest feature release too.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re really excited to see what Reface users do with swap-reenactment, which is a major technical milestone in terms of the machine learning technology inside of the app,&#8221; said CEO Dima Shvets in a statement. &#8220;Reface content creators have been clamoring for more tools for personalized content and self-expression &#8211; and this feature delivers, dramatically extending the opportunities for realizing their vision and creativity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The still young app has proved popular over its short run, garnering viral buzz via social media shares as users were keen to show off their funny face swaps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of March 2021 Reface said it had 100M installs some 14 months since going live. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a longtime real estate developer based in Chile, Benjamin Labra was able to spot gaps in the buying and renting markets in Latin America. To meet demands, he started <a href="https://houm.com/cl/">Houm</a>, an all-in-one platform that helps homeowners rent and sell their properties in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh out of Y Combinator’s W21 cohort, today Houm announced an $8 million seed round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think the concept sounds like Brazil’s unicorn, QuintoAndar, it’s because Houm is very similar. While QuintoAndar dominates the Brazilian market, Houm operates in Chile, Mexico and Colombia, and aims to capture the rest of Spanish-speaking LatAm.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of Houm as a homeowner-run Zillow meets TaskRabbit. The company offers a marketplace run by the property owners themselves and cuts out the realtor by employing 200 freelancers who prepare the property for sale or to manage it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Houmers, as they are called, go to the owner&#8217;s home, take photos and then help possible buyers or renters view the property. For their work, Houmers are compensated each time a home they worked on sells or gets rented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Houm’s selling proposition isn’t just the ease of use it provides; instead, it also serves as a guarantor in my ways, making the buying process more accessible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Colombia and Mexico, for someone to be your guarantor, they have to have a property that’s free of mortgage so it can be used as collateral,” Labra told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the flip side, the company also guarantees that renters will get paid every month, and if a tenant falters, Houm covers the cost. “You really have nothing to lose if you use Houm,” Labra said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can imagine that a company like Houm now has all sorts of data on the real estate market, especially around sales and rental prices. As a result, Houm uses this data in an algorithm that helps the homeowner determine a fair price for their property, but the listed price remains up to the owner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which was founded in 2018 and is based in Chile, now has about 200 full-time employees, in addition to their freelance team. While Labra declined to say how many active users it has, he said Houm is now showing a property every eight minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current funding round had no lead investor but includes Y Combinator, Goodwater Ventures, OneVC, Vast VC, Liquid2 and Myelin. The company plans to use the money to expand within the region, perfect its algorithm and generally speed up growth.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egypt has a population of over 100 million people. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country has a high mobile and internet penetration necessary for a young and tech-savvy population with 61% below 30</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite its youthful population, two out of every three individuals are currently unbanked in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s the same situation in MENA, where only 40% of the population have access to a bank account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital banks have enormous potential in the region. Today, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched one, <a href="https://telda.app/">Telda</a> is announcing a $5 million pre-seed round to digitize how Egyptians save, send, and spend money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago, we reported that Egyptian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/egyptian-startup-flextock-closes-3-25m-in-the-largest-pre-seed-yet-in-mena/">e-commerce fulfillment startup Flextock</a> had raised the largest pre-seed in MENA</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But that has changed today with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telda&#8217;s fundraise surpassing that record with a considerable margin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in both MENA and Africa (Autochek&#8217;s $3.4 million) for now</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telda </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month by CEO <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-sabbah-064726bb">Ahmed Sabbah</a> and CTO <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/youssefsholqamy">Youssef Sholqamy</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Telda, Sabbah was the co-founder and CTO of Egypt&#8217;s <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/telda-launch/">ride-hailing company Swvl</a>, and Sholqamy, a former senior engineer in Uber&#8217;s infrastructure team</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabbah said he and his co-founder had been looking at the fintech space at their former workplaces. However, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fter his experience using N26 while visiting a friend in Berlin in 2015, his eyes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">opened</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the possibilities of digital banking in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was fond of the idea, and it was coming from a huge pain of payments we had in Egypt and the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for me, I was kind of like waiting for this to happen in Egypt, or if not, I thought I&#8217;ll tap into the opportunity someday,&#8221; he told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Youcef and I have been like watching out the space for a while when the first digital bank started like six years ago, and watching how they grew in markets where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banking is more mature than this region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So imagine an opportunity in a region like Egypt where banking is even way, way less mature.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The North African country is one of the highest consumer spending markets in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its private consumption accounts <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/egypt/private-consumption--of-nominal-gdp#:~:text=Egypt%20Private%20Consumption%20accounted%20for,91.1%20%25%20in%20the%20previous%20quarter.">for </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 85% of its nominal GDP, and only <a href="https://www.amcham.org.eg/publications/business-monthly/issues/274/October-2018/3784/coming-soon-a-cashless-society">4% of its </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> GDP is cashless</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In essence, Egypt is heav</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cash reliant, and card usage in the country is very much in its infancy. Disheartened by the non-customer-centric banking experiences, Telda </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide an alternative.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152771" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152771" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2152771" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-145.png?w=680" alt="Telda" width="680" height="288" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-145.png 1329w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-145.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-145.png?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-145.png?resize=768,325 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-145.png?resize=680,288 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-145.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2152771" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Telda</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any digital bank globally, Telda enables customers to create a free account to send and receive money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And also a card to use online, in stores, make withdrawals and pay bills. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while the service is currently live, Telda cards are yet to be distributed to existing and new customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telda affirmed that it is the first company to receive a license from the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) under its new regulations to issue cards and onboard customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And by doing so, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he one-month-old company has made major progress in a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> short time, even though </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtaining that license took lengthy dialogue with regulators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;First movers will usually have to make all the effort with the regulators and with the bank and try to pave the way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this was one of the hardest parts &#8212; convincing regulators to trust and regulate our banking business and to provide payment financial services to our consumers,&#8221; the CEO said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But because Telda&#8217;s proposition aligns with the CBE&#8217;s vision of digitizing payments in the country, it had little choice but to grant them the license</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A different issue the company has faced was finding a partner bank to provide these services. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And to do that, Telda had to convince the bank that their services were complementary and wouldn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">entirely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overlap</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That means </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trying to be as much independent as possible from the infrastructure of the bank. This was quite crucial for us to be able to move right and as fast as a startup, not as slow and pretty much tied to the pace of the bank&#8217;s technology and operations,&#8221; he continued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the founders&#8217; experience in Swvl and Uber, the importance of building a great team cannot </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be overemphasized</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">barely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> any blueprint to look at in launching a digital bank in Egypt, so Telda is building how it knows best: hiring exceptional talent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CEO, the team comprises</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Egyptians who returned to the North African country to build Telda after working for corporations like Facebook, Microsoft, Uber, Noon, and McKinsey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MENA appears to be ripe for a digital banking experience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per GSMA Intelligence, 280 million people in the region are mobile internet users, and growth is not slowing down</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The frustration with traditional banks is particularly acute with the younger generation, who crave a simple, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">user-friendly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and transparent experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Telda has been able to onboard an impressive list of investors, including Sequoia Capital, for this reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The giant US VC firm led the pre-seed round as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berlin-based Global Founders Capital (GFC) and emerging markets-focused fund Class 5 Global participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Sequoia has made a few Sub-Saharan African investments in startups like Healthlane and OPay, Telda is its first venture into North Africa and the wider GCC region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight years ago, the VC giant led an <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/companies/nubank/">infamous seed investment</a> in Latin American digital bank Nubank before it began to go full throttle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now with more than 38 million customers, Nubank is the world&#8217;s largest digital bank with a valuation of $25 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sequoia will be looking for a similar success story in Telda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are many parallels between Brazil and Egypt. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both countries boast a large, young, talented, and tech-savvy population with a strong appetite to innovate,” said Sequoia Partner George Robson of the investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are delighted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to partner with Telda and earmark our first investment in the region.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telda intends to fast-track its card production and distribution with this new funding. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it currently has more than 30,000 signups already, with half of that already requesting cards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also plans to capitalize on Sequoia&#8217;s name for hiring and expansion, the CEO continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hiring is key for us. We want to scale the team into a world-class team that&#8217;s willing to tap into the opportunity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we aspire for is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growing in Egypt, start to deliver cards for the early adopters, and we see ourselves reaching close to a million cards in our first year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investments in Egypt have been growing in leaps and bounds over the past three years, accompanied by a growing, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">vibrant ecosystem. Egypt recorded the largest number of investment deals last year per Partech Africa. With 86 deals completed, the country contributed 24% to the total number of deals made on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GFC partner Roel Janssen referring to the budding ecosystem in his statement, said: “We are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> impressed by Sabbah and Sholqamy and love their vision for building the region’s leading digital banking app, and we are proud to be part of their journey</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is GFC’s first investment in Egypt, and we see that Egypt has the potential to become an important hub in the global tech ecosystem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After operating in the red for 14 years, JD.com&#8217;s logistics subsidiary is getting ready for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. JD Logistics will price its share between HK$39.36 and HK$43.36 apiece, which could see the firm raise up to about HK$26.4 billion or $3.4 billion, according to its <a href="https://staticpacific.blob.core.windows.net/press-releases-attachments/1310152/HKEX-EPS_20210517_9767993_0.PDF">new filing</a>.</p>
<p>JD.com, Alibaba&#8217;s e-commerce rival in China, began building its own logistics and transportation network from the ground up in 2007 and spun out the unit in 2017, following a pattern where major segments of the tech giant became independent, such as JD.com&#8217;s health and fintech units. JD.com is currently the largest shareholder of JD Logistics with an aggregate stake of 79%.</p>
<p>Unlike Alibaba, which relies on a network of third-party partners to fulfill orders, JD.com takes a heavy-asset approach like Amazon, building up warehouse centers and keeping its own army of courier staff. As of 2020, JD Logistics had over 246,800 employees working in delivery, warehouse operations among other customer services. Its total headcount was 258,700 last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A major strategic decision JD Logistics made once it became independent was opening its technologies to external customers beyond the scope of JD.com&#8217;s own demand, helping retailers like Skechers optimize their logistics operations. As a result, the share of its revenue from external customers rose from 29.9% in 2018 to 38.4% in 2019, and to 43.4% in the nine months ended September 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our growth strategy is partially based on the assumption that the trend toward outsourcing of supply chain services will continue,&#8221; the firm said in its prospectus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Third-party service providers like us are generally able to provide such services more efficiently than otherwise could be provided &#8216;in-house,&#8217; primarily as a result of our expertise, technology and lower and more flexible employee cost structure.&#8221;</p>
<p>But retailers may switch to in-house supply chain operations themselves if they see risks in relying on third-party providers, the company added.</p>
<p>The main selling point of JD Logistics is its same- or next-day delivery, thanks to warehouses it keeps close to end consumers. It said about 90% of the total orders it processed were delivered on the same or next day in 2020.</p>
<p>Such user experience comes at a substantial cost for JD Logistics, though losses are shrinking. The firm posted a net loss of 2.8 billion yuan, 2.2 billion yuan and 11.7 million yuan in 2018, 2019 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.</p>
<p>Its gross profit margin improved from 8.5% during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to 10.9% for the same period in 2020, primarily due to economies of scale, better operational efficiency, and government subsidies for reductions in social security funds contributed by employers and waivers of toll charges during COVID-19.</p>
<p>JD Logistics reached into instant delivery by partnering with Dada, a Chinese last-mile delivery service, to form JDDJ, short for &#8220;JD Arrives Home&#8221; in Chinese. JDDJ has been Walmart&#8217;s on-demand delivery service provider in China <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/20/walmart-in-china-is-now-testing-same-day-grocery-delivery-from-dada-via-wechat/">since 2016</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ride-hailing giant Gojek and marketplace Tokopedia, Indonesia&#8217;s two biggest startups, said on Monday they have combined their businesses to form GoTo Group, the largest technology group in the Southeast Asian nation, the fourth most populous country that is currently navigating to contain the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gotocompany.com">GoTo</a> will be preparing for a dual listing &#8212; in New York and Jakarta &#8212; later this year, executives said. Gojek’s Andre Soelistyo will lead the combined business as GoTo Group CEO, with Tokopedia’s Patrick Cao serving as GoTo Group President. Kevin Aluwi will continue as CEO of Gojek and William Tanuwijaya will remain CEO of Tokopedia, the two firms said in a joint announcement.</p>
<p>The combined entity is &#8220;a globally unique and highly complementary ecosystem,&#8221; the two firms said as they look to better compete with heavily funded super app Grab and e-commerce platform Shopee. GoTo executives claimed that the combined entity features:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>Total Group Gross Transaction Value (GTV) of over $22 billion in 2020</li>
<li>Over 1.8 billion transactions in 2020</li>
<li>Total registered driver fleet of over two million as of December 2020</li>
<li>Over 11 million merchant partners as of December 2020</li>
<li>Over 100 million monthly active users (MAU)</li>
<li>An ecosystem that encompasses 2% of Indonesia’s GDP</li>
</ul>
<p>The deal, which has been in the works for several months, comes after Gojek spent several quarters exploring a merger with Grab. Tokopedia, meanwhile, was in talks late last year to pursue a public listing this year. Gojek and Tokopedia began talking earlier this year and last month moved to seek approval from their respective investors. During their talks, the proposed valuation of GoTo was $18 billion.</p>
<p>The companies, which have together raised about $8.2 billion over the years (according to research firm Tracxn), didn&#8217;t comment on the final valuation Monday nor did they disclose any other financial terms of the deal.</p>
<p>The friendship of Gojek and Tokopedia founders may have helped close this deal. The two companies first began working together in 2015 to accelerate e-commerce deliveries using Gojek’s local network of drivers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The companies will continue to thrive and coexist as stand-alone brands within the strengthened ecosystem,&#8221; they said on Monday.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2152697 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/goto-gojek-tokopedia-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="829" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/goto-gojek-tokopedia-1.jpg 1584w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/goto-gojek-tokopedia-1.jpg?resize=150,121 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/goto-gojek-tokopedia-1.jpg?resize=300,243 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/goto-gojek-tokopedia-1.jpg?resize=768,622 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/goto-gojek-tokopedia-1.jpg?resize=680,550 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/goto-gojek-tokopedia-1.jpg?resize=1536,1243 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/goto-gojek-tokopedia-1.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In the meantime, Grab has since announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/grab-to-go-public-in-the-us-following-40-billion-spac-deal/">plans to go public in the U.S. via SPAC</a>, and is seeking a valuation of $40 billion, which if materializes at the current terms, would be the biggest-ever deal of its kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today is a truly historic day as we mark the beginning of GoTo and the next phase of growth for Gojek, Tokopedia and GoTo Financial. Gojek drivers will deliver even more Tokopedia packages, merchant partners of all sizes will benefit from strengthened business solutions and we will use our combined scale to increase financial inclusion in an emerging region with untapped growth potential. For the consumer, GoTo Group will continue to reduce frictions and provide best in class delivery of goods and services. This is the next step of an exciting journey and I am humbled and proud to lead the GoTo movement,” said Andre Soelistyo, CEO of GoTo Group, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Moglix, an industrial business-to-business marketplace in India, said on Monday it has raised $120 million in a new financing round at $1 billion valuation, becoming the 13th firm from the world&#8217;s second largest market to attain the unicorn status this year.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s Series E financing round was led by Falcon Edge Capital and Harvard Management Company (HMC). Existing investors, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India and Venture Highway also participated in the round, which brings <a href="https://www.moglix.com/">Moglix</a>&#8216;s to-date raise to about $220 million. TechCrunch reported earlier this year that Tiger Global was in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">talks to invest in Moglix at $1 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p>“We started six years ago with a firm belief in the untapped potential of the Indian manufacturing sector. We had the trust of stalwarts like Ratan Tata, and a mission to enable the creation of a $1 trillion manufacturing economy in India. Today, as we enter the next stage of our evolution, we feel this financing milestone is a testimony to our journey of innovation and disruption,&#8221; said Rahul Garg, founder and chief executive of Moglix, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Six-year-old Moglix &#8212; founded by IIT Kanpur and ISB alumnus Rahul Garg &#8212; serves over 500,000 small, medium-sized business and enterprises. It has established 3,000 manufacturing plants across India, Singapore, the UK and the UAE and counts manufacturing giants such as Hero MotoCorp, Vedanta, Tata Steel, Unilever and Air India and NTPC as its customers.</p>
<p>Moglix runs a supply chain network of 16,000 suppliers, over 35 warehouses and logistics infrastructure. With close to 500,000+ SKUs on its platform, the startup claims to be the largest e-commerce platform of industrial goods in India.</p>
<p>Moglix, Zetwerk, and Infra.Market have built business-to-business e-commerce platforms for niche categories in the South Asian nation in recent years, illustrating wider adoption of e-commerce in India.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moglix’s distinctive customer value proposition and ROI are visible in its outstanding customer and revenue retention numbers. We believe Moglix is now well poised to scale and we are thrilled to back the Company in the next phase of its growth,&#8221; said Navroz D. Udwadia, Co-Founder of Falcon Edge Capital, in a statement. He said the investment firm studied and tracked Moglix for years before writing its check.</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s announcement follows nearly two-dozen large-sized investments secured by Indian startups in recent months. Earlier on Monday, Pine Labs said it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/merchant-commerce-platform-pine-labs-raises-285-million/">raising $285 million at $3 billion valuation</a>, up from $1 billion in early 2020. KKR said it had invested $95 million in Lenskart.</p>
<p>Social commerce Meesho, subscription platform Chargebee, social network ShareChat, messaging platform Gupshup, and fintech firm CRED are among some of the Indian startups that have become unicorns in recent weeks. Most of these rounds have been led by Tiger Global or Falcon Edge Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pine Labs, a startup that offers merchants payments terminals, invoicing tools and working capital, said on Monday it has completed the first close of a $285 million funding as the nearly two-decade-old firm looks to expand its offerings and build and scale an online payments gateway.</p>
<p>Baron Capital Group, Duro Capital, Marshall Wace, Moore Strategic Ventures and Ward Ferry Management financed the new funding round, while existing investors Temasek, Lone Pine Capital and Sunley House Capital also participated in it, the Indian startup said.</p>
<p>The new round valued <a href="https://www.pinelabs.com/">Pine Labs</a> at $3 billion, up from about $2 billion in a December round last year and $1 billion in early 2020. Pine Labs operates in several Southeast Asian markets as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>B. Amrish Rau, chief executive of Pine Labs, told TechCrunch in an interview that the new financing round enabled secondary transactions for its founder, employees and early investors including Sequoia Capital. The round may also be extended, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled to welcome marquee investors like Marshall Wace, Baron Capital Group, Ward Ferry Management, Duro Capital and Moore Strategic Ventures to the already pristine cap table of Pine Labs. This is an exciting phase in our journey as we enter newer markets,&#8221; said Rau in a statement.</p>
<p>The startup, which also counts PayPal among its investors, serves over 140,000 merchants. Its payments terminal &#8212; also known as point-of-sale machines &#8212; are connected to the cloud, and offer a range of additional services such as working capital &#8212; to the merchants.</p>
<p>Pine Labs&#8217;s payments terminal has integration with over two dozen banks and financial and technology partners. This differentiates Pine Labs from the competition, whose terminals typically have integration with just one bank. Each time a rival firm strikes a new partnership with a bank, they need to deploy new machines into the market. This makes the whole deployment expensive for both the fintech and the bank. (This is why you also often see a restaurant has multiple terminals at the check out.)</p>
<p>Rau said Pine Labs, which has deployed about 600,000 payment terminals, has been able to assemble such a wide integration with the banking ecosystem because of its years-long relationship and expertise.</p>
<p>Pine Labs runs an analytics app on debit card base of banks it tied up to determine the extent of credit to be made available to every cardholder. Pine Labs then converts large payments into EMIs (equated monthly instalment) using its Pine Pay Later application. mid the pandemic late last year, the startup was onboarding over 10,000 new businesses to the platform each month.</p>
<p>Pine Labs is the market leader in many categories. The startup &#8212; which acquired Qwikcilver in 2019 &#8212; assumed over 95% of the market share in gift cards in the financial year that ended in March 2020. Its point-of-sale machines are some of the most widely used in the industry.</p>

<p>“We are very excited to be a part of the technological transformation that Pine Labs is driving on the ground in payments and the multiple interlinkages and efficiencies it is able to create by providing faster, cost effective consumer access to a broader range of financial products such as BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later), where it is driving a pioneering effort on behalf of the financial system. We are also excited about an Indian business being able to drive regional and potentially global adoption of its Intellectual Property and this represents significant optionality for the future,” said Amit Rajpal, CEO and Portfolio Manager of Marshall Wace Asia, in a statement.</p>
<p>Rau said the startup will deploy the fresh capital to build and expand an online payments gateway and engage with hospitals, pharmacies, governments and other entities as its first set of clients. The startup also plans to make offers of Fave, a Southeast Asian startup it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/pine-labs-acquires-southeast-asian-startup-fave-for-45-million/">acquired last month</a>, available to merchants in India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello friends, and welcome back to Week in Review!</p>
<p>Last week, I wrote about Facebook&#8217;s never-ending Trump problem. This week, I&#8217;m looking at Elon Musk&#8217;s wild week of whipping crypto markets.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this on the TechCrunch site, you can get this in your inbox from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><span class="s1">newsletter page</span></a>, and follow my tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny"><span class="s1">@lucasmtny</span></a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The big thing</h2>
<p>This week, Elon Musk may have crashed the crypto markets with a few tweets.</p>
<p>Musk has always been anything but predictable but retail and institutional investors are also anything but dismissive of his ability to pump up markets &#8212; especially if there&#8217;s a good joke to tell in the meantime. A few days after he crashed Dogecoin because of his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he called the currency a &#8220;hustle,&#8221; he drove the price of Bitcoin &#8212; a cryptocurrency with a $1 trillion market cap &#8211;down as much as 17% with a tweet basically noting that he now believes Bitcoin is bad for the environment and that Tesla will not be accepting Bitcoin payments for its cars after all.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QXoi803mKC"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-technoking-of-tesla-orders-a-halt-to-bitcoin-car-payments/">Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla, orders a halt to bitcoin car payments </a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla, orders a halt to bitcoin car payments &#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-technoking-of-tesla-orders-a-halt-to-bitcoin-car-payments/embed/#?secret=QXoi803mKC" data-secret="QXoi803mKC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The impact was immediate. Crypto investors flooded into his mentions pleading for mercy and complaining to each other in public and private that he shouldn&#8217;t have been so rash. Unrelated coins across the cryptosphere dipped as investors worried whether the tweet, shipped at a tenuous moment for this bull run would drag the space down to earth. A later tweet that he was working with Dogecoin developers directly on improving its efficiency sent the joke coin (worth billions of dollars) surging and supplied crypto investors with a worrying insight that perhaps this is all just a joke to Musk.</p>
<p>Days later, Bitcoin has erased months of gains &#8212; though Dogecoin isn&#8217;t doing too poorly.</p>
<p>Musk has had his own dealings with the SEC in recent years, but his market moving tweets have seemed dubious at times but have generally seemed to be just another case of him trolling. Tesla&#8217;s investment in Bitcoin has complicated this somewhat, and while it&#8217;s not known whether he actually has holdings of Dogecoin, he&#8217;s certainly put himself in a less flexible legal arena when his company has a billion dollar stake in the fortunes of Bitcoin which he seems to lord control of over with his Twitter.</p>
<p>Retail investors aren&#8217;t used to blowing up a billionaire&#8217;s mentions and eliciting a response and there&#8217;s a certain irresistible power that comes with that especially for pumping nascent bets like Dogecoin, but I suspect that there&#8217;s going to be some reticence among a certain class of investor to invite Musk&#8217;s brand of randomized volatility into their wallets.</p>

<p><em>Here are the TechCrunch news stories that especially caught my eye this week:</em></p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/uber-lyft-to-give-free-rides-to-covid-19-vaccine-sites-in-deal-with-white-house/">Uber and Lyft supplying free rides to vaccine appointments</a><br />
</b>In an effort to get more Americans vaccinated, the Biden White House has partnered with Uber and Lyft allowing riders to get free rides to and from vaccination sites, covering up to $15 each way.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/facebook-instagram-for-kids-state-attorneys-general-letter/"><b>State attorneys tell Facebook to nix Instagram for Kids app</b></a><br />
Attorneys General representing some 44 U.S. states and territories signed a letter pressuring Facebook to abandon its plans to create a version of Instagram designed specifically for kids.</p>

The Covid-19 pandemic has taken yet another year of Burning Man away from attendees. The festival in the Nevada desert has been a favorite of high-profile tech executives, but this year they&#8217;ll have to settle for a wholly virtual experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/vitalik-buterin-donates-1-billion-worth-of-meme-coins-to-india-covid-relief-fund/"><b>Ethereum creator donates $1 billion to India Covid recovery</b></a><br />
One of the wildest story of the weeks involves the creator of Ethereum dumping billions of dogecoin copy cats that were unceremoniously gifted to his account, donating them to a host of charities. He donated some $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies in total.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/"><b>Amazon nukes accounts of some major Chinese sellers</b></a><br />
Alleging fake reviews and behaviors that violated its store policies, Amazon took the nuclear option on a number of massive Chinese sellers on its platform that were responsible for billions in merchandise value. Those account holders aren&#8217;t too happy and Amazon isn&#8217;t too repentant.</p>

<p><em>Some of my favorite reads from our Extra Crunch subscription service this week:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/"><b>The Expensify EC-1</b></a><br />
&#8220;Let&#8217;s make it clear from the outset that this story is about an expense management SaaS business called <strong>Expensify</strong>. As you’d expect, yes, this is about the expense management market and how Expensify has grown, its technology and all of that. Normally, that would make us change the channel. But this is also a story about pirates; peer-to-peer hackers who asked, “Why not work from Thailand and dozens of countries across the globe?” and actually did it using P2P hacker culture as a model for consensus-driven decision-making — all with pre-Uber Travis Kalanick in a guest-starring role..&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/is-there-a-creed-in-venture-capital/"><b>Is there a creed in venture capital</b></a><br />
&#8220;Entrepreneurs and investors should recognize that contracts are worth very little without the ongoing relationship management that keeps all parties aligned. Enforcement is so unusual in the world of startups that I consider it a mostly dead-end path. In my experience, good communication is the only reliable remedy. <em>This</em> is the way.<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/5-ways-to-raise-your-startups-pr-game/"><b>5 ways to raise your startups PR game</b></a><br />
&#8220;I get emails every week from companies coming out of stealth mode, wanting to make a splash. Or from a Series B company that’s been around for a while and hopes to improve their branding/messaging/positioning so that a new upstart doesn’t eat their lunch. How do you make a splash? How do you stay relevant?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This week&#8217;s episode of Found features Courtne Smith, <a href="https://newnew.co">founder of NewNew</a>, a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/newnew/id1327683895">social app</a> where people pay to vote on your decisions. The platform takes the concept of social polling to the next level, essentially allowing everyone to monetize their choices by turning them into a kind of social stock market where others can purchase shares to accumulate more or less decision power based on what they&#8217;re willing to spend.</p>
<p>Courtne&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/in-a-startup-reprise-courtne-smith-launches-newnew-a-social-network-based-on-shared-content/"> path to NewNew</a> was immediately preceded by the creation of Surprize, a social trivia and prize-giving app that leveraged crowdsourcing to pick and award its prizes. But long before that, the Toronto native made a bold decision — encouraged by, of all people, her pastor father — to drop out of school and go work for Drake the very outset of his career as his personal assistant.</p>
<p>We talked to Courtne about making that risky deviation from a relatively traditional and safe path, and about how she eventually moved on from many years of working with Drake during his rise to global success: Another counterintuitive decision to go from something that was already working out well, to pursue something unknown. Courtne tells us about her overall entrepreneurial drive, which has always stemmed from a desire to create something game-changing, and about how when it came time to attract investors for her ventures, she opted not to leverage her deep-pocketed connections and instead sought capital on the merits of her ideas alone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We had a great time chatting with Courtne, and we hope you have just as much fun listening. And of course, we’d love if you can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Voice social network Clubhouse said on Sunday it will expand its Android app worldwide in a week, days after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/clubhouse-android-app-launch/">launching a beta version of its service on Google-owned mobile operating system</a> for users in the U.S.</p>
<p>The startup &#8212; backed by A16z, Tiger Global and DST Global and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/">valued at about $4 billion</a> &#8212; said it will roll out the Android app to Japan, Brazil, and Russia on Tuesday; Nigeria and India three days later, and rest of the world by Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Clubhouse originally launched as an iPhone-only app last year. The app quickly gained popularity last year, attracting several high-profile celebrities, politicians, investors and entrepreneurs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup began developing the Android app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/clubhouse-says-its-android-launch-will-take-a-couple-of-months/">early this year</a> and started to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/clubhouse-begins-externally-testing-its-android-app/">test the beta version</a> externally this month. In a town hall earlier this month, the startup said availability on Android has been the most requested product feature.</p>
<p>Clubhouse’s global rollout on Android comes at a time when scores of technology firm including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/facebooks-clubhouse-rival-looks-a-lot-like-clubhouse-right-now/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spotify-is-getting-into-live-audio-because-of-course-it-is/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">Reddit</a> and Microsoft’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">LinkedIn</a>, have either launched their similar offerings — or announced plans to do so.</p>
<p>Twitter’s clone of Clubhouse, called Spaces, has emerged as one of the biggest competitors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152628" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152628" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2152628 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-download-ios-appmagic.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="381" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-download-ios-appmagic.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-download-ios-appmagic.jpg?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-download-ios-appmagic.jpg?resize=300,112 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-download-ios-appmagic.jpg?resize=768,286 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-download-ios-appmagic.jpg?resize=680,253 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-download-ios-appmagic.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2152628" class="wp-caption-text">Clubhouse iPhone app&#8217;s download estimates by mobile insight firm AppMagic.</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Clubhouse has struggled to maintain its growth pace in recent months &#8212; based on download figure estimates by several mobile insight firms. The Android app could potentially help the startup court more users.</p>
<p>The startup continues to maintain an invitation system for onboarding new users, saying that this is part of its effort to “keep the growth measured.”</p>
<p>The Android app of Clubhouse currently lacks a number of features. At the time of launch last week, users couldn&#8217;t follow a topic, create or manage a club, link their social profiles, make payments, or change their profile name of user name. The startup said it is working to bring iOS features to the Android app.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As the price of bitcoin hits record highs and cryptocurrencies become increasingly mainstream, the industry’s expanding carbon footprint becomes harder to ignore.</p>
<p>Just <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">last week</a>, Elon Musk announced that Tesla is suspending vehicle purchases using bitcoin due to the environmental impact of fossil fuels used in bitcoin mining. We applaud this decision, and it brings to light the severity of the situation &#8212; the industry needs to address crypto sustainability now or risk hindering crypto innovation and progress.</p>
<p>The market cap of bitcoin today is a whopping <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/377382/bitcoin-market-capitalization/">$1 trillion.</a> As companies like PayPal, Visa and Square collectively invest billions in crypto, market participants need to lead in dramatically reducing the industry’s collective environmental impact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			As the price of bitcoin hits record highs and cryptocurrencies become increasingly mainstream, the industry’s expanding carbon footprint becomes harder to ignore.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The increasing demand for crypto means intensifying competition and higher energy use among mining operators. For example, during the second half of February, we saw the electricity consumption of<a href="https://cbeci.org/"> BTC increase by more than 163%</a> &#8212; from 265 TWh to 433 TWh &#8212; as the price skyrocketed.</p>
<p>Sustainability has become a topic of concern on the agendas of global and local leaders. The Biden administration<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-rejoins-paris-climate-accord-and-who-revokes-muslim-ban-2021-1"> rejoining</a> the Paris climate accord was the first indication of this, and recently we’ve seen several federal and state agencies make statements that show how much of a priority it will be to address the global climate crisis.</p>
<p>A proposed <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/103703/ny-bill-ban-crypto-mining-environmental-impact">New York bill</a> aims to prohibit crypto mining centers from operating until the state can assess their full environmental impact. Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission put out a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-climate-change-disclosures">call</a> for public comment on climate disclosures as shareholders increasingly want information on what companies are doing in this regard, while Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that the amount of energy consumed in processing bitcoin is “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/yellen-sounds-warning-about-extremely-inefficient-bitcoin.html">staggering</a>.” The United Kingdom announced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-sets-ambitious-new-climate-target-ahead-of-un-summit">plans</a> to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% by 2030, and the prime minister launched an ambitious <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ten-point-plan-for-a-green-industrial-revolution">plan</a> last year for a green industrial revolution.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What Square&#8217;s smashing earnings tell us about consumer bitcoin demand&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/what-squares-smashing-earnings-tell-us-about-consumer-bitcoin-demand/embed/#?secret=KBJQeH5Ama" data-secret="KBJQeH5Ama" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Crypto is here to stay &#8212; this point is no longer up for debate. It is creating real-world benefits for businesses and consumers alike &#8212; benefits like faster, more reliable and cheaper transactions with greater transparency than ever before. But as the industry matures, sustainability must be at the center. It’s easier to build a more sustainable ecosystem now than to “reverse engineer” it at a later growth stage. Those in the cryptocurrency markets should consider the auto industry a canary: Carmakers are now retrofitting lower-carbon and carbon-neutral solutions at great cost and inconvenience.</p>
<p>Market participants need to actively work together to realize a low-emissions future powered by clean, renewable energy. Last month, the <a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/accord/">Crypto Climate Accord</a> (CCA) launched with over 40 supporters &#8212; including Ripple, World Economic Forum, Energy Web Foundation, Rocky Mountain Institute and ConsenSys &#8212; and the goal to enable all of the world’s blockchains to be powered by 100% renewables by 2025.</p>
<p>Some industry participants are exploring renewable energy solutions, but the larger industry still has a long way to go. While 76% of hashers <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/does-cryptocurrency-really-run-on-clean-energy-1029646352">claim</a> they are using renewable energy to power their activities, only 39% of hashing’s total energy consumption comes from renewables.</p>
<p>To make a meaningful impact, the industry needs to come up with a standard that’s open and transparent to measure the use of renewables and make renewable energy accessible and cheap for miners. The CCA is already working on such a standard. In addition, companies can pay for high-quality carbon offsets for remaining emissions &#8212; and perhaps even historical ones.</p>
<p>While the industry works to become more sustainable long term, there are green choices that can be made now, and some industry players are jumping on board. Fintechs like Stripe have created carbon renewal programs to encourage its customers and partners to be more sustainable.</p>
<p>Companies can partner with organizations, like Energy Web Foundation and the Renewable Energy Business Alliance, to decarbonize <em>any</em> blockchain. There are<a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/"> resources</a> for those who want to access renewable energy sources and high-quality carbon offsets. Other options include using inherently low-carbon technologies, like the XRP Ledger, that don’t rely on proof-of-work (which involves mining) to help significantly reduce emissions for blockchains and cryptofinance.</p>
<p>The XRP Ledger is carbon-neutral and uses a validation and security algorithm called Federated Consensus that is approximately 120,000 times more energy-efficient than proof-of-work. Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain, is transitioning off proof-of-work to a much less energy-intensive validation mechanism called proof-of-stake. Proof-of-work systems are inefficient by design and, as such, will always require more energy to maintain forward progress.</p>
<p>The devastating impact of climate change is moving at an alarming speed. Making aspirational commitments to sustainability &#8212; or worse, denying the problem &#8212; isn’t enough. As with the Paris agreement, the industry needs real targets, collective action, innovation and shared accountability.</p>
<p>The good news? Solutions can be practical, market-driven and create value and growth for all. Together with climate advocates, clean tech industry leaders and global finance decision-makers, crypto can unite to position blockchain as the most sustainable path forward in creating a green, digital financial future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I feel hungover. No, not in the traditional sense, but in the dizzying way you feel when half of your world is celebrating double vaccinations and no masks, and the other half, across the world, is mourning death and not a shred of light at the end of the tunnel. The privilege of watching this unfold is like playing the worst game of musical chairs, except some seats are clouds and others are simply rows of knives.</p>
<p>For tech, the questions that we will be debating are bigger than if “that conference will be virtual or in-person.” Instead, we’re now trying to figure out what the future of work and education are for the second time in a year. The United States is reopening and that means a lot of the culture of how we work will be rewritten. Shifting from an individual mindset to a collective, more distributed world is going to be harder than taking a mask off and popping an aspirin.</p>
<p>Startup founders new and old are about to start making decisions on how to lead in this changed world. They will have to consider things far more consequential than if free lunches come back. More serious questions abound: How do you give flexibility along with accountability? How do you repair the universal toll on mental health? How do you offer opportunity equally between remote employees and in-person employees? What happens when half of your workforce can go to happy hours while the other half is in a city under lockdown?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/najjmahal">Naj Austin</a>, the founder and CEO of Somewhere Good and Ethel’s Club, spoke to me about intention this week. She explained how repainting something is easier than reinventing the entire process, but the latter has the opportunity to disrupt far more than the former. It made me think about the return to offices, and how the frictionless option might not be the best option long term.</p>
<p>I’ve learned that the best founders embody this ethos and pick the harder bucket. It stands out when you are intentional about recruitment, the return and potential relief that comes with optionality.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll get into stock market volatility, Expensify’s origin story, and what one founder learned after getting rejected by YC 13 times. As always, you can support me by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=natasham">subscribing to Extra Crunch</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_"> following me on Twitter. </a></p>

<p>The edtech public market is on<em> that kind </em>of fire this week, with many stocks slashing share prices nearly in half compared to 52-week highs.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Alex and I wrote about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/edtech-stocks-are-getting-hammered-but-vcs-keep-writing-checks/?tpcc=ECTW2020">how the carnage in the public markets </a>is expected in edtech, a sector filled with pandemic bumps. We predicted that bullish VCs will remain bullish, and the correction in the market is upon us.</p>
<blockquote><p>In September 2020, Larry Illg, CEO of Prosus Ventures, told us that edtech was filled with “tourists” and “faddish money,” making it a hard time to assess companies and find accountable bets.</p>
<p>“It’s quite dangerous,” he said. “We’ve seen over the years in geographic context at different points in time that people are attracted to India or are attracted to Brazil and they start pumping money in and then two or three years later, they exit with their tail between their legs.”</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Plus, two SPACs, two IPO updates and SoftBank:</em></p>

<p>Expensify has managed to become a leader in the expense management market, with 10 million users, only 130 employees, and of course, an upcoming IPO. For these reasons, and many more, it’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/">the latest company in our EC-1 series.</a> The first installment, penned by Anna Heim, went live this week.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>While managing finances feels like a pretty clearcut business, Expensify’s origin was far more chaotic. Think P2P hacker culture, consensus-driven decision-making, and, as always, an Uber angle. The origin story explores <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">how a motley crew created a unique expense management system.</a></p>

<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p>Hello friends, I was out yesterday with what I’m calling Moderna Syndrome. Basically I got <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1392791860364595204">whacked</a> by my second vaccine dose, and instead of enjoying a day off eating candy and spoiling my dogs I spent the entire day <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1392905370637684741">on the couch unable to move</a>. All that’s to say that I missed Coinbase and DoorDash earnings when they came out.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Catching us up, Coinbase met its forecasts that it had previously released (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/">more here</a>), and today its stock is flat. DoorDash, in contrast, beat market expectations and is currently up just over 25% as I write to you.</p>
<p>But despite huge quarters from each, both companies are far below their recently set all-time highs. Coinbase is worth around $265 per share today, off from an all-time high of $429.54, which it set recently. And DoorDash is worth $145 this afternoon, far below its $256.09 52-week high.</p>
<p>They are not alone amongst recent public offerings that have lost steam. Many SPAC-led combinations are tanking. But while Coinbase and DoorDash are still richly valued at current levels and worth far more than they were as private companies, some startups that took SPAC money to float are not doing well, let alone as well.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ev-startups-lose-over-40-100000517.html">Bloomberg notes</a>, five electric vehicle companies that SPAC’d their way to the public markets were worth $60 billion at one point. Now the collection of mostly revenue-free public EV companies have shed “more than $40 billion of market capitalization combined from their respective peaks.” Youch.</p>
<p>And SPAC hype-man and general investing bon vivant Chamath Palihapitiya is <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/boardroomalpha/spac/chamath-spac-pitchforks">taking some stick</a> for his deal’s returns as well. It’s all a bit messy. Which, to be fair, is pretty much what we’ve expected all along.</p>
<p>Not that there aren’t some SPAC-combinations that make sense. There are. But mostly it’s been more speculative hype than business substance. Perhaps that’s why Coinbase and DoorDash didn’t need to lean on crutches to get public. Sure, the market is still figuring out what they are actually worth, but that doesn’t mean that they are in any real trouble. But consider, for a moment, the companies that have agreed to go public via a SPAC before the correction and are still waiting for their deal to complete.</p>
<h2>TFW ur forecast is conservative</h2>
<p>The Exchange has been on the horn recently with a few public company CEOs after their earnings report. After those conversations, we have to talk a bit about guidance. Why? Because it’s a game that I find slightly annoying.</p>
<p>Some public companies simply don’t provide forecasts. Cool. Root doesn’t, for example, provide quarterly guidance. Fine. Other companies provide guidance, but only in a super-conservative format. This is in effect no guidance at all, in my view. Not that we’re being rude to companies per se, but they often wind up in a weird dance between telling the market <em>something</em> and telling it something useful.</p>
<p>Picking on Appian’s CEO as he’s someone I like, when discussing his own company’s forecasts Matt Calkins said that its guidance is “unfailingly conservative” — so much so that he said it was nearly frustrating. But he went on to argue that Appian is not short-run focused (good), and that if a company puts up big estimates it is more judged on the <em>expectation</em> of those results versus the realization of said results. That line of thinking immediately makes ultra-prudent guidance seem reasonable.</p>
<p>This is a philosophical argument more than anything, as Wall Street comes up with its own expectations. The financial rubber hits the road when companies guide <em>under </em>Wall Street’s own expectations or deliver results that don’t match those of external bettors. So guidance matters some, just not as much as people think.</p>
<p>BigCommerce’s CEO Brent Bellm helped provide some more guidance as to why public companies can guide a bit more conservatively than we might expect during our recent call. It helps them not overspend. He noted that if BigCommerce &#8212; which had a <a href="https://investors.bigcommerce.com/static-files/e3d327da-3a9c-47da-a5ed-7b41d8926ffb">super solid quarter</a>, by the by &#8212; is conservative in its planning (the font from which guidance flows, to some degree) it can’t deploy too much near-term capital.</p>
<p>In the case of BigCommerce, Bellm continued, he wants the company to overperform on revenue, but not adjusted profits. So, if revenue comes in ahead of expectations, it can spend more, but won’t work to maximize their near-term profitability. And he said that he’s told analysts just that. So keeping guidance low means that it won’t overspend and blast its adjusted profitability, while any upside allows for more aggressive spend?</p>
<p>Harumph, is my general take on all of the above. It’s very fine to have public company CEOs play the public game well, but what I’d greatly prefer is if they did something more akin to what startups do. High-growth tech companies often have a board-approved plan and an internal plan that is more aggressive. For public companies this would be akin to a base case and a stretch case. Let’s have both, please? I am tired of parsing sandbagged numbers for the truth.</p>
<p>Sure, by reporting a guidance <em>range</em>, public companies are doing <em>some</em> of that. But not nearly enough. I hate coyness for coyness&#8217;s sake!</p>
<p>That’s enough of a rant for today, more on BigCommerce earnings next week if we can fit it in. You can read more from The Exchange on Appian and the larger low-code movement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dont-hate-on-low-code-and-no-code/">here</a>, if that’s your jam.</p>
<h2>Never going back</h2>
<p>We’re running a bit long today, so let me demount with some predictions.</p>
<p>Nearly every startup I’ve spoken to in the last year that had 20 or fewer staff at the time of the chat is a remote-first team. That’s due to their often being born during the pandemic, but also because many very early-stage startups are simply finding it easier to recruit globally because often the talent they need, can afford or can attract, is not in their immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>Startups are simply finding it critical to have relaxed work <em>location</em> rules to snag and, we presume, retain the talent that they need. And they are not alone. Big Tech is in similar straits. As <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/under-pressure-from-employees-tech-companies-relax-remote-work-policies">The Information reported recently</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An internal Google employee message board lit up last Wednesday morning as news of what many staff perceived as a more relaxed policy for working remotely circulated. One meme shared on the board showed a person crying, labeled “Facebook recruiters.” Another showed a sad person labeled “San Francisco landlords.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If you aren’t laughing, maybe you have a life. But I do this for a living, and I am <em>dying</em> at that quote.</p>
<p>Look, it’s clear that lots of people can do lots of work outside of an office, and even though labor purchasers (employers) want to run 1984-style operations on their employees (labor sellers) to ensure that they are Doing Precisely Enough, the actual denizens writing code are like, naw. And that’s just too much for Big Tech to handle as they are literally just cash flows held up by people who type for a living.</p>
<p>What this means is that tech is not going back to 100% in-office work or anything close to. At least not at companies that want to actually ensure that they have top-tier talent.</p>
<p>It’s a bit like when you see a company comprising only white men; you know that it doesn’t have nearly the best team that it could. Firms that enforce full-office policies are going to overindex on a particular demographic. And it won’t be to their benefit.</p>
