										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to building a successful startup, biotech and hardware happen to be two of the most difficult verticals in the tech industry. But Oura is doing it anyway.</p>
<p>The health and fitness tracking ring has been used in a number of studies around COVID-19, and been worn by NBA and WNBA players to help prevent outbreaks in the league. Oura has raised nearly $50 million from investors including Lifeline Ventures, Bold Capital Partners, and Forerunner.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re thrilled to have Forerunner&#8217;s Eurie Kim and Oura CEO Harpreet Rai join us on a forthcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-forerunner-and-oura">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kim is herself a former entrepreneur and joined Forerunner in 2012. She sits on the boards of companies like The Farmer’s Dog, Curology, Attabotics, Oura Ring, Eclipse, Juni, among others, and found herself on the Midas Brink List in 2020.</p>
<p>Rai, for his part, is CEO at Oura, where he leads a team of over 150 employees. Before Oura, Rai was a portfolio manager at Eminence Capital for nine years.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-forerunner-and-oura">Extra Crunch Live</a>, the duo will talk about how Oura went about raising its $28 million Series B round and why Kim took a bet on the startup. We&#8217;ll also ask about tactical advice for founders looking to fundraise and grow their businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple was questioned on its inability to rein in subscription scammers on its App Store during yesterday&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">Senate antitrust hearing</a>. The tech giant has argued that one of the reasons it requires developers to pay App Store commissions is to help Apple fight marketplace fraud and protect consumers. But developers claim Apple is doing very little to stop obvious scams that are now raking in millions and impacting consumer trust in the overall subscription economy, as well as in their own legitimate, subscription-based businesses.</p>
<p>One developer in particular, Kosta Eleftheriou, has made it his mission to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou">highlight some of the most egregious scams</a> on the App Store. Functioning as a one-man bunco squad, Eleftheriou regularly tweets out examples of apps that are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/">leveraging fake reviews to promote their harmful businesses</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the more notable scams he&#8217;s uncovered as of late include a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/30/trezor-scam-bitcoin-1-million/">crypto wallet app that scammed</a> a user out of his life savings (~$600,000) in bitcoin; a kids game that actually <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/15/app-store-scam-is-a-kids-game-with-a-hidden-online-casino/">contained a hidden online casino</a>; and a VPN app <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/another-ios-vpn-app-scam-is-uncovered_id131487">scamming users out of $5 million</a> per year. And, of course, there&#8217;s the scam that lit the fire in the first place: A competitor to Eleftheriou&#8217;s own Apple Watch app that he alleges <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011069395755009">scammed users out of $2 million per year,</a> after stealing his marketing materials, cloning his app and buying fake reviews to make the scammer&#8217;s look like the better choice.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eleftheriou&#8217;s tweets have caught the attention of the larger app developer community, who now email him other examples of scams they&#8217;ve uncovered. Eleftheriou more recently took his crusade a step further by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">filing a lawsuit against Apple</a> over the revenue he&#8217;s lost to App Store scammers.</p>
<p>Though Eleftheriou wasn&#8217;t name-checked in yesterday&#8217;s antitrust hearing, his work certainly was.</p>
<p>In a line of questioning from Georgia&#8217;s Senator Jon Ossoff, Apple&#8217;s Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer was asked why Apple was not able to locate scams, given that these fraudulent apps are, as Ossoff put it, &#8220;trivially easy to identify as scams.&#8221;</p>
<p>He asked why do we have rely upon &#8220;open-source reporting and journalists&#8221; to find the app scams &#8212; a reference that likely, at least in part, referred to Eleftheriou&#8217;s recent activities.</p>
<p>Eleftheriou himself <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou">has said</a> there&#8217;s not much to his efforts. You simply find the apps generating most revenues and then check them for suspicious user reviews and high subscription prices. When you find both, you&#8217;ve probably uncovered a scam.</p>
<p>Andeer demurred, responding to Ossoff&#8217;s questions by saying that Apple has invested &#8220;tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars&#8221; in hardening and improving the security of its App Store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, security and fraud is a cat-and-mouse game. Any retailer will tell you that. And so we&#8217;re constantly working to improve,&#8221; Andeer said. He also claimed Apple was investing in more resources and technologies to catch wrong-doers and noted that the App Store rejected thousands of apps every year for posing a risk to consumers.</p>
<p>The exec then warned that if Apple wasn&#8217;t the intermediary, the problem would be even worse.</p>
<p>&#8221; … No one is perfect, but I think what we&#8217;ve shown over and over again that we do a better job than others. I think the real risks of opening up the iPhone to sideloading or third-party app stores is that this problem will only multiply. If we look at other app stores out there, we look at other distribution platforms, it scares us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ossoff pressed on, noting the sideloading questions could wait and inquired again about the scam apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple is making a cut on those abusive billing practices, are you not?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Andeer said he didn&#8217;t believe that was the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we find fraud &#8212; if we find a problem, we&#8217;re able to rectify that very quickly. And we do each and every day,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But to what extent Apple was profiting from the App Store scams was less clear. Ossoff wanted to know if Apple refunded &#8220;all&#8221; of its revenues derived from the scam billing practices &#8212; in other words, if every customer who ever subscribed got their money back when a scam was identified.</p>
<p>Andeer&#8217;s answer was a little vague, however, as it could be interpreted to mean Apple refunds customers who report the scam or file a complaint &#8212; procedures it already has in place today. Instead of saying that Apple refunds &#8220;all customers&#8221; when scams are identified, he carefully worded his response to say Apple worked to make sure &#8220;the customer&#8221; is made whole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Senator, that&#8217;s my understanding. There&#8217;s obviously a dedicated team here at Apple who works this each and every day. But my understanding is that we work hard to make sure the customer is in a whole position. That&#8217;s our focus at the end of the day. If we lose the trust of our customers, that&#8217;s going to hurt us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, Eleftheriou wasn&#8217;t buying it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple&#8217;s non-answers to Senator Ossoff&#8217;s great questions in yesterday&#8217;s hearing should anger all of us. They did not offer any explanation for why it&#8217;s so easy for people like me to keep finding multimillion-dollar scams that have been going on unchecked on the App Store for years. They also gave no clear answer to whether they&#8217;re responsible for fraudulent activity in their store,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple appears to profit from these scams, instead of refunding all associated revenues back to affected users when they belatedly take some of these down. We’ve been letting Apple grade their own homework for over a decade. I urge the committee to get to the bottom of these questions, including Apple&#8217;s baffling decision years ago to remove the ability for users to flag suspicious apps on the App Store,&#8221; Eleftheriou added.</p>
<p>Apple did not provide a comment.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When the world flipped upside down last year, nearly every company in every industry was forced to implement a remote workforce in just a matter of days — they had to scramble to ensure employees had the right tools in place and customers felt little to no impact. While companies initially adopted solutions for employee safety, rapid response and short-term air cover, they are now shifting their focus to long-term, strategic investments that empower growth and streamline operations.</p>
<p>As a result, categories that make up productivity infrastructure — cloud communications services, API platforms, low-code development tools, business process automation and AI software development kits — grew exponentially in 2020. This growth was boosted by an increasing number of companies prioritizing tools that support communication, collaboration, transparency and a seamless end-to-end workflow.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Productivity infrastructure is on the rise and will continue to be front and center as companies evaluate what their future of work entails and how to maintain productivity, rapid software development and innovation with distributed teams.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever"> McKinsey &amp; Company,</a> the pandemic accelerated the share of digitally enabled products by <em>seven years, </em>and “the digitization of customer and supply-chain interactions and of internal operations by three to four years.” As demand continues to grow, companies are taking advantage of the benefits productivity infrastructure brings to their organization both internally and externally, especially as many determine the future of their work.</p>
<h2>Automate workflows and mitigate risk</h2>
<p>Developers rely on platforms throughout the software development process to connect data, process it, increase their go-to-market velocity and stay ahead of the competition with new and existing products. They have enormous amounts of end-user data on hand, and productivity infrastructure can remove barriers to access, integrate and leverage this data to automate the workflow.</p>
<p>Access to rich interaction data combined with pre-trained ML models, automated workflows and configurable front-end components enables developers to drastically shorten development cycles. Through enhanced data protection and compliance, productivity infrastructure safeguards critical data and mitigates risk while reducing time to ROI.</p>
<p>As the post-pandemic workplace begins to take shape, how can productivity infrastructure support enterprises where they are now and where they need to go next?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Xuezhao Lan first formed <a href="https://www.basisset.ventures/">Basis Set Ventures</a>, the goal was to leverage technology to give venture capital investing super powers.</p>
<p>From the earliest days, when Lan hired former TechCrunch reporter John Mannes, and then built out the team with the data scientist, Rachel Wong, former Upfront Ventures partner, Chang Xu, and former vice president of growth, Sheila Vashee, the focus was as much on technology products as it was on dollar investments and advisory services.</p>
<p>Together with Niniane Wang, a former advisor who now serves as the firm&#8217;s chief technology officer, Basis Set grounded its decisions in the technical bona fides of Lan&#8217;s firm. And product development isn&#8217;t something that the firm simply pays lip service about. Basis Set ships about three different updates to a massive suite of internal and external products every week, according to the partnership.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That product development is one reason why the firm has managed to stay relatively lean and why it was two times oversubscribed when it went out to raise its second fund, a $165 million vehicle, which closed recently.</p>
<p>The fund isn&#8217;t that much larger than the $136 million Basis Set had previously raised, but Lan thinks its the right size for her goals, which are to return massive amounts of capital to her limited partners.</p>
<p>Internal technology programs like the company&#8217;s Pascal system have allowed Basis Set to review roughly 9,000 different software deals developing tech in the company&#8217;s core thesis, which is artificial intelligence-enabled software as a service and business-to-business deals.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1773691" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1773691" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1773691" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-950523108.jpg" alt="Robotic arm carrying a mechanical part" width="1024" height="672" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-950523108.jpg 1936w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-950523108.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-950523108.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-950523108.jpg?resize=768,504 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-950523108.jpg?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-950523108.jpg?resize=1536,1008 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-950523108.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1773691" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Over the next year, those technology services are going to start paying dividends, according to Lan, in the form of a couple of initial public offerings that will soon make their way to market.</p>
<p>And Basis Set doesn&#8217;t limit itself geographically, thanks to the coverage support that its software provides. &#8220;Pascal is a major asset for finding companies outside of the Bay Area,&#8221; said Lan.</p>
<p>Once those companies are identified and in the portfolio, the startups have access to a tool called <a href="https://www.basisset.ventures/hypergrowth-network">HyperGrowth</a>, which links tech companies with mentors from the Bay Area to help those companies scale. It&#8217;s another example of Basis Set&#8217;s product-driven approach, said Lan.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I started BSV, we’re a pretty technical team and technical people. Every single person came back to us to ask how to grow, how to do sales, how to do tech, how to make the first hires, introductions to customers, introductions to advisors. The number one need for companies is go to market,&#8221; said Lan. &#8220;Over time we started scaling that efforts. Introductions manually, and then holding events, and then bringing in a growth partner, Sheila. We built this tool where hundreds of advisors would opt in to be connected to a portfolio company.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Currently Basis Set has at least three different programs all aimed to recruit and nurture talent that typical Bay Area firms haven&#8217;t traditionally focused on. The first is its <a href="https://www.basisset.ventures/persistence">Persistence</a> platform, which is designed to help women developers and founders network and nurture connections and foster ideas. The firm also has a service that it calls <a href="https://www.basisset.ventures/founder-superpowers">Founder Superpowers</a>, to help entrepreneurs identify and develop areas of strength while looking for additional tools to augment their capabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We had a data science team very early and we already started automating a bunch of things. These are the ones that made it to the end of the finish line. Because of the way we operate we are constantly iterating,&#8221; said Lan. </span></p>
<p>Another key factor for the company is trying to find a more diverse set of founders with different background from the typical Silicon Valley biography, Mannes said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We talk a lot about how to find founders outside of the Bay Area… the entrepreneurs who aren’t hanging out at Blue Bottle 24-7,&#8221; said Mannes. The Persistence platform, the Founder Superpowers tool, and the work that Basis Set does with <a href="https://blog.devcolor.org/learning-how-to-learn-the-most-important-developer-skill-d3a9fa4fe100">Dev Color</a>, an organization designed to support under-represented members of the tech community are all manifestations of that, Mannes and Lan both said. </span></p>

<p>Companies in the firm&#8217;s current portfolio include: <a href="https://www.ergeon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ergeon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which helps simplify the process of staffing for the construction industry; the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/farmwise-plans-to-add-autonomous-crop-dusting-to-its-suite-of-robotic-services/">autonomous weed picking and crop dusting agtech startup</a>, Farmwise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and <a href="https://www.onequince.com/">Quince</a>, which Basis Set has dubbed the anti-Amazon for its factory direct sales model. </span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, companies like the conversational machine learning company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/rasa-raises-26m-led-by-a16z-for-its-open-source-conversational-ai-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rasa; </span></a>the privacy and compliance automation toolkit developer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/datagrail-snares-30m-series-b-to-help-deal-with-privacy-regulations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DataGrail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; the workflow automation software developer for deskless workers, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/workstream-a-platform-for-deskless-work-raises-10-million-to-serve-local-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workstream</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/assembled-an-operating-system-for-support-teams-raises-16-6m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assembled</span></a>, which provides tech infrastructure support for teams, have all raised significant follow-on funding.</p>
<p>All of these investments are undergirded by the technical team&#8217;s work and the collaboration with investors, the firm stressed.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re in lock sink about what we need to build and we’re literally shipping every day,&#8221; said Vashee. &#8220;That’s what best in class looks like and that’s what we try to achieve&#8230; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the iron man suit. That’s what we’re looking to build with products here.  Our goal is to automate every part of the process that we can while building the empathy with our founders.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the increase of digital transacting over the past year, cybercriminals have been having a field day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, complaints of suspected internet crime surged by 61%, to 791,790, according to the FBI’s </span><a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Internet Crime Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those crimes &#8212; ranging from personal and corporate data breaches to credit card fraud, phishing and identity theft &#8212; cost victims more than $4.2 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For companies like Sift &#8212; which aims to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">predict and prevent fraud online even more quickly than cybercriminals adopt new tactics &#8212; that increase in crime also led to an increase in business.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the San Francisco-based company assessed risk on more than $250 billion in transactions, double from what it did in 2019. The company has over several hundred customers, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter, Airbnb, Twilio, DoorDash, Wayfair and McDonald’s, as well a global data network of 70 billion events per month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet the surge in demand, Sift said today it has raised $50 million in a funding round that values the company at over $1 billion. Insight Partners led the financing, which included participation from Union Square Ventures and Stripes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company would not reveal hard revenue figures, President and CEO Marc Olesen said that business has tripled since he joined the company in June 2018. Sift was founded out of Y Combinator in 2011, and has raised a total of $157 million over its lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s “Digital Trust &amp; Safety” platform aims to help merchants not only fight all types of internet fraud and abuse, but to also “reduce friction” for legitimate customers. There’s a fine line apparently between looking out for a merchant and upsetting a customer who is legitimately trying to conduct a transaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sift uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to automatically surmise whether an attempted transaction or interaction with a business online is authentic or potentially problematic.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2142332" style="width: 664px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142332" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2142332" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Content-Integrity.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="654" height="373" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Content-Integrity.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Content-Integrity.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Content-Integrity.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Content-Integrity.jpg?resize=768,438 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Content-Integrity.jpg?resize=680,388 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Content-Integrity.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2142332" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: Sift</strong></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things the company has discovered is that fraudsters are often not working alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fraud vectors are no longer siloed. They are highly innovative and often working in concert,” Olesen said. “We’ve uncovered a number of fraud rings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olesen shared a couple of examples of how the company thwarted fraud incidents last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One recently involved money laundering through donation sites where fraudsters tested stolen debit and credit cards through fake donation sites at guest checkout.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;12 top cybersecurity VCs discuss investing, valuations and no-go zones&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/cybersecurity-vc-survey-investing-valuations/embed/#?secret=yU8h6Bdxrw" data-secret="yU8h6Bdxrw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By making small donations to themselves, they laundered that money and at the same tested the validity of the stolen cards so they could use it on another site with significantly higher purchases,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another case, the company uncovered fraudsters using </span><a href="https://blog.sift.com/2021/telegram-fraud-scheme/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a social media site, to make services available, such as food delivery, with stolen credentials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data that Sift has accumulated since its inception helps the company “act as the central nervous system for fraud teams.” Sift says that its models become more intelligent with every customer that it integrates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insight Partners Managing Director Jeff Lieberman, who is a Sift board member, said his firm initially invested in Sift in 2016 because even at that time, it was clear that online fraud was “rapidly growing.” It was growing not just in dollar amounts, he said, but in the number of methods cybercriminals used to steal from consumers and businesses.</span></p>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sift has a novel approach to fighting fraud that combines massive data sets with machine learning, and it has a track record of proving its value for hundreds of online businesses,” he wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Olesen and the Sift team started the recent process of fundraising, Insight actually approached them before they started talking to outside investors “because both the product and business fundamentals are so strong, and the growth opportunity is massive,” Lieberman added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With more businesses heavily investing in online channels, nearly every one of them needs a solution that can intelligently weed out fraud while ensuring a seamless experience for the 99% of transactions or actions that are legitimate,” he wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital primarily to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expand its product portfolio and to scale its product, engineering and sales teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sift also recently tapped Eu-Gene Sung &#8212; who has worked in financial leadership roles at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integral Ad Science, BSE Global and McCann &#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to serve as its CFO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As to whether or not that meant an IPO is in Sift’s future, Olesen said that Sung’s experience of taking companies through a growth phase such as what Sift is experiencing would be valuable. The company is also for the first time looking to potentially do some M&amp;A.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we think about expanding our portfolio, it’s really a buy/build partner approach,” Olesen said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fi.google.com/">Google Fi</a>, Google&#8217;s cell network, is turning six today and to celebrate, the team is launching a new pricing plan, dubbed &#8220;Simply Unlimited&#8221; starting at $60 per month for a single line (down to $30 per line for three lines or more). The new plan features unlimited calls and texts in the U.S., plus unlimited data and texting in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2142425" style="width: 355px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-093358.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142425" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2142425" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-093358.png?w=455" alt="" width="345" height="377" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-093358.png 455w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-093358.png?resize=137,150 137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-093358.png?resize=275,300 275w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-093358.png?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2142425" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>You may recall that Fi&#8217;s original promise was a single, affordable pay-as-you-go plan where you would pay a fixed price per month for the basic call and texting service and then pay an extra $10 per GB of data you used per billing cycle, capped at $80 per month. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/google-fi-gets-an-unlimited-plan/">In 2019</a>, Google then turned this into what is essentially an unlimited plan, dubbed Fi Unlimited, starting at $70 per month for a single line, with discounts for additional lines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new &#8220;Simply Unlimited&#8221; plan is a pared-down version of the original Unlimited plan, which is now called the Unlimited Plus plan (yeah, that&#8217;s a lot of names). Now, that plan has still a lot of extra features that power users aren&#8217;t likely willing to give up for a slightly lower price. In addition to everything in the new Simply Unlimited plan, this plan still features free international calls to more than 50 countries and international data in more than 200 destinations, plus full-speed hotspot tethering and 100 GB of Google One cloud storage.</p>
<p>The Flexible plan is also still an option, with its base fee of $20 per month for texting and calling for a single line (down to $17 per month for three lines) and $10 per GB of data, no matter whether you use if abroad or at home &#8212; or for hotspot tethering. Google says that&#8217;s the plan to choose if you&#8217;re mostly on WiFi &#8212; as most of us are right now.</p>
<p>Basically, if you&#8217;re not planning to use your phone outside of North America, the new Simply Unlimited plan looks like a good deal that, depending on your use case, compares favorably with similarly priced plans from other carriers &#8212; especially if international data is important to you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A university student is suing exam proctoring software maker Proctorio to &#8220;quash a campaign of harassment&#8221; against critics of the company, including an accusation that the company misused copyright laws to remove his tweets that were critical of the software.</p>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-sues-proctorio-behalf-student-it-falsely-accused-copyright-infringement-get">filed the lawsuit</a> this week on behalf of Miami University student Erik Johnson, who also does security research on the side, accused Proctorio of having &#8220;exploited the DMCA to undermine Johnson’s commentary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter hid three of Johnson&#8217;s tweets after Proctorio filed a copyright takedown notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, alleging that <a href="https://twitter.com/ejohnson99/status/1303121786637373443">three of Johnson&#8217;s tweets</a> violated the company&#8217;s copyright.</p>
<p>Schools and universities have increasingly leaned on proctoring software during the pandemic to invigilate student exams, albeit virtually. Students must install the school&#8217;s choice of proctoring software to grant access to the student&#8217;s microphone and webcam to spot potential cheating. But students of color have complained that the software <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gxg3/proctorio-is-using-racist-algorithms-to-detect-faces">fails to recognize</a> nonwhite faces and that the software also requires high-speed internet access, which many low-income houses don&#8217;t have. If a student fails these checks, the student can end up failing the exam.</p>
<p>Despite this, Vice <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3an98j/students-are-easily-cheating-state-of-the-art-test-proctoring-tech">reported</a> last month that some students are easily cheating on exams that are monitored by Proctorio. Several schools have banned or discontinued using Proctorio and other proctoring software, citing privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Proctorio&#8217;s monitoring software is a Chrome extension, which unlike most desktop software can be easily downloaded and the source code examined for bugs and flaws. Johnson examined the code and tweeted what he found — including under what circumstances a student&#8217;s test would be terminated if the software detected signs of potential cheating, and how the software monitors for suspicious eye movements and abnormal mouse clicking.</p>
<p>Johnson&#8217;s tweets also contained links to snippets of the Chrome extension&#8217;s source code on Pastebin.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cjlC62YuIC"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/proctorio-dmca-copyright-critical-tweets/">Proctorio used DMCA to take down a student&#8217;s critical tweets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Proctorio used DMCA to take down a student&#8217;s critical tweets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/proctorio-dmca-copyright-critical-tweets/embed/#?secret=cjlC62YuIC" data-secret="cjlC62YuIC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Proctorio claimed at the time, via its crisis communications firm Edelman, that Johnson violated the company&#8217;s rights &#8220;by copying and posting extracts from Proctorio’s software code on his Twitter account.&#8221; But Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/proctorio-dmca-copyright-critical-tweets/">reinstated Johnson&#8217;s tweets</a> after finding Proctorio&#8217;s takedown notice &#8220;incomplete.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Software companies don’t get to abuse copyright law to undermine their critics,&#8221; said Cara Gagliano, a staff attorney at the EFF. &#8220;Using pieces [of] code to explain your research or support critical commentary is no different from quoting a book in a book review.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/johnson-v-proctorio-complaint">complaint</a> argues that Proctorio&#8217;s &#8220;pattern of baseless DMCA notices&#8221; had a chilling effect on Johnson&#8217;s security research work, amid fears that &#8220;reporting on his findings will elicit more harassment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Copyright holders should be held liable when they falsely accuse their critics of copyright infringement, especially when the goal is plainly to intimidate and undermine them,&#8221; said Gagliano. &#8220;We’re asking the court for a declaratory judgment that there is no infringement to prevent further legal threats and takedown attempts against Johnson for using code excerpts and screenshots to support his comments.&#8221;</p>
<p>The EFF alleges that this is part of a wider pattern that Proctorio uses to respond to criticism. Last year Olsen posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/hhbowl/proctorio_ceo_mike_olsen_under_fire_for_releasing/">a student&#8217;s private chat logs</a> on Reddit without their permission. Olsen later set his Twitter account to private following the incident. Proctorio is also suing Ian Linkletter, a learning technology specialist at the University of British Columbia, after posting tweets critical of the company’s proctoring software.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is filed in Arizona, where Proctorio is headquartered. Proctorio CEO Mike Olson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) issued a<a href="https://www.nscai.gov/"> report</a> last month delivering an uncomfortable public message: <em>America is not prepared to defend or compete in the AI era</em>. It leads to two key questions that demand our immediate response: Will the U.S. continue to be a global superpower if it falls behind in AI development and deployment? And what can we do to change this trajectory?</p>
<p>Left unchecked, seemingly neutral artificial intelligence (AI) tools can and will perpetuate inequalities and, in effect, automate discrimination. Tech-enabled harms have already surfaced in credit decisions, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/senators-protest-health-algorithm-biased-against-black-people/?redirectURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fstory%2Fsenators-protest-health-algorithm-biased-against-black-people%2F">health care services</a> and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/09/1022217/facebook-ad-algorithm-sex-discrimination/">advertising</a>.</p>
<p>To prevent this recurrence and growth at scale, the Biden administration must clarify current laws pertaining to AI and machine learning models — both in terms of how we will evaluate use by private actors and how we will govern AI usage within our government systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Left unchecked, seemingly neutral artificial intelligence (AI) tools can and will perpetuate inequalities and, in effect, automate discrimination.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The administration has put a strong foot forward, from key appointments in the tech space to issuing an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/">executive order</a> on the first day in office that established an Equitable Data Working Group. This has comforted skeptics concerned both about the U.S. commitment to AI development and to ensuring equity in the digital space.</p>
<p>But that will be fleeting unless the administration shows strong resolve in making AI funding a reality and establishing leaders and structures necessary to safeguard its development and use.</p>
<h2>Need for clarity on priorities</h2>
<p>There has been a seismic shift at the federal level in AI policy and in stated commitments to equality in tech. A number of high profile appointments by the Biden administration — from Dr. Alondra Nelson as deputy of OSTP, to Tim Wu at the NEC, to (our former senior advisor) Kurt Campbell at the NSC — signal that significant attention will be paid to inclusive AI development by experts on the inside.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nscai.gov/2021-final-report/">NSCAI final report</a> includes recommendations that could prove critical to enabling better foundations for inclusive AI development, such as creating new talent pipelines through a <a href="https://www.nscai.gov/2021/03/08/u-s-panel-calls-for-new-digital-service-academy-to-bolster-federal-workforce-science-magazine/">U.S. Digital Service Academy</a> to train current and future employees.</p>
<p>The report also recommends establishing a new <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-u-s-in-the-ai-era-the-national-8471075/">Technology Competitiveness Council</a> led by the vice president. This could prove essential in ensuring that the nation’s commitment to AI leadership remains a priority at the highest levels. It makes good sense to have the administration’s leadership on AI spearheaded by Vice President Harris in light of her strategic partnership with the president, her <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/08/11/what-kamala-harris-record-says-about-major-ai-policy-issues/">tech policy savvy</a> and her focus on civil rights.</p>
<h2>The U.S. needs to lead by example<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>We know AI is powerful in its ability to create efficiencies, such as plowing through thousands of resumes to identify potentially suitable candidates. But it can also scale discrimination, such as the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G">Amazon hiring tool</a> that prioritized male candidates or &#8220;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20210112a.htm">digital redlining</a>&#8221; of credit based on race.</p>
<p>The Biden administration should issue an executive order to agencies inviting ideation on ways AI can improve government operations. The order should also mandate checks on AI used by the USG to ensure it’s not spreading discriminatory outcomes unintentionally.</p>
<p>For instance, there must be a routine schedule in place where AI systems are evaluated to ensure embedded, harmful biases are not resulting in recommendations that are discriminatory or inconsistent with our democratic, inclusive values — and reevaluated routinely given that AI is constantly iterating and learning new patterns.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Biased AI perpetuates racial injustice&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/biased-ai-perpetuates-racial-injustice/embed/#?secret=IEIEeefNJu" data-secret="IEIEeefNJu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Putting a responsible AI governance system in place is particularly critical in the U.S. Government, which is required to offer <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-5/">due</a> <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xiv">process</a> protection when denying certain benefits. For instance, when AI is used to determine allocation of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17144260/healthcare-medicaid-algorithm-arkansas-cerebral-palsy">Medicaid benefits</a>, and such benefits are modified or denied based on an algorithm, the government must be able to explain that outcome, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1012360">aptly termed technological due process</a>.</p>
<p>If decisions are delegated to automated systems without<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00794.pdf)"> explainability</a>, guidelines and human oversight, we find ourselves in the untenable situation where this basic constitutional right is being denied.</p>
<p>Likewise, the administration has immense power to ensure that AI safeguards by key corporate players are in place through its procurement power. Federal contract spending was expected to<a href="https://www.govexec.com/management/2020/06/federal-contract-spending-reaches-its-highest-level-ever-fiscal-2019-marking-4-straight-years-growth/166484/"> exceed $600 billion</a> in fiscal 2020, even before including pandemic economic stimulus funds. The USG could effectuate tremendous impact by issuing a checklist for federal procurement of AI systems — this would ensure the government’s process is both rigorous and universally applied, including relevant civil rights considerations.</p>
<h2>Protection from discrimination stemming from AI systems<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>The government holds another powerful lever to protect us from AI harms: its investigative and prosecutorial authority. An executive order instructing agencies to clarify applicability of current laws and regulations (e.g., ADA, Fair Housing, Fair Lending, Civil Rights Act, etc.) when determinations are reliant on AI-powered systems could result in a global reckoning. Companies operating in the U.S. would have unquestionable motivation to check their AI systems for harms against protected classes.</p>
<p>Low-income individuals are disproportionately vulnerable to many of the negative effects of AI. This is especially apparent with regard to <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/459455-making-equitable-access-to-credit-a-reality-in-the-age-of">credit</a> and loan creation, because they are less likely to have access to traditional financial products or the ability to obtain high scores based on traditional frameworks. This then becomes the data used to create AI systems that automate such decisions.</p>
<p>The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) can play a pivotal role in holding financial institutions accountable for discriminatory lending processes that result from reliance on discriminatory AI systems. The mandate of an EO would be a forcing function for statements on how AI-enabled systems will be evaluated, putting companies on notice and better protecting the public with clear expectations on AI use.</p>
<p>There is a clear path to liability when an individual acts in a discriminatory way and<a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/interpretation/amendment-xiv/clauses/701"> a due process</a> violation when a public benefit is denied arbitrarily, without explanation. Theoretically, these liabilities and rights would transfer with ease when an AI system is involved, but a review of agency action and legal precedent (or rather, the lack thereof) indicates otherwise.</p>
<p>The administration is off to a good start, such as rolling back a<a href="https://www.axios.com/proposed-hud-rule-on-ai-could-allow-for-housing-discrimination-3d778ea7-8230-4f21-935b-b6b7f384a310.html"> proposed HUD rule</a> that would have made legal challenges against discriminatory AI essentially unattainable. Next, federal agencies with investigative or prosecutorial authority should clarify which AI practices would fall under their review and current laws would be applicable — for instance, HUD for illegal housing discrimination; CFPB on AI used in credit lending; and the Department of Labor on AI used in determinations made in hiring, evaluations and terminations.</p>
<p>Such action would have the added benefit of establishing a<a href="https://www.rootandrebound.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Connecticut-Fair-Housing-Center.pdf"> useful precedent</a> for plaintiff actions in complaints.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has taken encouraging first steps signaling its intent to ensure inclusive, less discriminatory AI. However, it must put its own house in order by directing that federal agencies require the development, acquisition and use of AI — internally and by those it does business with — is done in a manner that protects privacy, civil rights, civil liberties and American values.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When should you consider outsourcing customer care, and what should you look for? Here's an overview on how startups are leveraging customer care as a service (CCaaS).]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Your clients might not demand 24/7 customer service yet, but they&#8217;re certainly hoping for it. But how can a startup with a lean staff provide round-the-clock customer care? There are several options available, but more than ever, outsourcing is one of them.</p>
<p>When should your startup consider outsourcing its customer care? And what should you look for in a provider? Here are some insights on what customer care as a service (CCaaS) can do for you, and how fast-growing startups have been leveraging this new class of partners to boost customer satisfaction.</p>
<h2>Addressing customer care challenges</h2>
<p>Customer care as a service can address several pain points, such as the need to provide support outside of business hours.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If you find the right partner, outsourcing customer service can help you save time over options such as finding and managing your own freelancers, or hiring in-house, which might burden you with fixed costs.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Since online shoppers didn&#8217;t have to wait for stores to open during lockdowns, they have increasingly been making purchases on evenings and weekends, and often tend to abandon their carts if nobody is around to answer their doubts. New clients aside, existing customers also hope to get responses outside of typical business hours.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 crisis has significantly increased the share of e-commerce in total retail in recent months, and these new purchasing habits are likely to stick, the OECD pointed out <a href="https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/e-commerce-in-the-time-of-covid-19-3a2b78e8/">in a report</a> last year. This led many small retailers to discover a reality that e-commerce startups already know well: When you are an online business, working hours aren&#8217;t really a thing.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just e-commerce — from SaaS to mobility services, there is a growing range of startups for which always-on customer service no longer a luxury. French CCaaS provider <a href="https://onepilot.co/">Onepilot</a> learned this firsthand: During its beta program, its &#8220;support heroes&#8221; were available from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m., but it is now moving to 24/7 coverage due to greater demand from clients, co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierre-latscha-8956a6a5">Pierre Latscha</a> told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>French micromobility startup <a href="https://getapony.com/en">Pony</a>, one of Onepilot&#8217;s clients, needed reliable customer care for its dockless bike and scooter fleets in several cities, but couldn&#8217;t justify the expense of an in-house hire: &#8220;We didn&#8217;t have enough demand to have someone take care of customer service full time,&#8221; Pony <a href="https://business.lesechos.fr/entrepreneurs/financer-sa-creation/0610794561195-onepilot-leve-2-5-millions-d-euros-pour-externaliser-le-support-client-343121.php ">explained to French newspaper Les Échos</a> (translation ours).</p>
<p>In such situations, outsourcing to a partner like Onepilot can save costs when demand isn&#8217;t high enough or constant, which is often the case when the business is seasonal or growing faster than the startup can address it.</p>
<p>The latter was the case for <a href="https://wespring.com/">SPRiNG</a>, a French subscription service for eco-friendly laundry detergent and cleaning products that has partnered with Onepilot. The startup launched in the summer of 2020, and thanks to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/spring-collective">€2.1 million in seed funding</a>, its team tripled, but with &#8220;tens of thousands of clients,&#8221; it soon felt the need for more support to handle the growing volume of requests, co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-guerville-a487453/">Ben Guerville</a> told us via email.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.aftership.com/">AfterShip</a> launched in 2012 to help online sellers track packages across different carriers, but since then it has built a suite of data analytics tools covering almost every step of the shopping experience, from email marketing to customer retention. The Hong Kong-headquartered startup announced today it has raised a $66 million Series B led by Tiger Global, with participation from Hillhouse Capital’s GL Ventures.</p>
<p>AfterShip’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/20/aftership-lands-1m-from-idg-accel-to-make-tracking-packages-less-nightmarish/">last round of funding was a $1 million Series A in 2014</a>. Co-founder Andrew Chan told TechCrunch that the company has been profitable since its launch and grew mainly through word-of-mouth referrals and partnerships, like a Shopify integration, that boosted its profile. But the company recently added a sales team and will use its latest capital on international hiring for sales and customer support. It also plans to launch new products and expand further in the United States, where about 70% of AfterShip’s customers are located.</p>

<p>The company’s software enables sellers to track shipments made through more than 740 carriers and handles more than 6 billion shipments each year. AfterShip’s partners with about 10,000 companies, including some of the biggest names in e-commerce: Shopify (where it is used by 50,000 merchants), Magento, Squarespace, Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Groupon, Rakuten, Wish and retail brands like Dyson and Inditex.</p>

<p>AfterShip’s core product is its shipment tracking platform, but it also makes apps for shoppers, including self-service returns and package tracking, and sales and marketing tools for merchants that let them get more use out of data from shipments. Chan explained that package tracking is also a user engagement tool for sellers that lets them show more product recommendations and promotions to shoppers. AfterShip’s tools enables merchants to create their own branded tracking pages and notifications. Other features allow them to track the performance of different carriers, create email marketing campaigns and increase customer retention.</p>
<p>Its CRM capabilities help AfterShip differentiate from other shipment tracking aggregator providers.</p>
<p>“When we think of our vision, we look at what Salesforce is doing, but is there an e-commerce Salesforce that can cover more topics for sales people to use,” Chan said.</p>
<p>In press statement, Pengfei Wang, global partner at Tiger Global, said, “AfterShip leads the charge in making the shipping process more transparent and reliable for consumers and companies alike. As growth in e-commerce spirals ever upward, we are excited to partner with AfterShip and its leadership team as they continue to advance technology in this critical and expanding industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/anthos/whats-new-in-anthos">announced</a> a sizable update to its Anthos multicloud platform that lets you build, deploy and manage containerized applications anywhere, including <a href="https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/aws">on Amazon&#8217;s AWS</a> and (in preview) on Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>Version 1.7 includes new features like improved <a href="https://cloud.google.com/logging">metrics and logging</a> for Anthos on AWS, a new Connect gateway to interact with any cluster right from Google Cloud and a preview of Google&#8217;s managed control plane for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/anthos/service-mesh">Anthos Service Mesh</a>. Other new features include Windows container support for environments that use VMware&#8217;s vSphere platform and new tools for developers to make it easier for them to deploy their applications to any Anthos cluster.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s update comes almost exactly two years after Google CEO Sundar Pichai originally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/googles-anthos-hybrid-cloud-platform-is-coming-to-aws-and-azure/">announced</a> Anthos at its Cloud Next event in 2019 (before that, Google called this project the &#8220;Google Cloud Services Platform,&#8221; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/google-cloud-goes-all-in-on-hybrid-with-its-new-cloud-services-platform/">launched three years ago</a>). Hybrid and multicloud, it&#8217;s fair to say, takes a key role in the Google Cloud roadmap &#8212; and maybe more so for Google than for any of its competitors. Recently, Google brought on industry veteran <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreed4/">Jeff Reed</a> to <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/google-cloud-nabs-former-cisco-security-leader-jeff-reed">become</a> the VP of Product Management in charge of Anthos.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reed told me that he believes that there are a lot of factors right now that are putting Anthos in a good position. &#8220;The wind is at our back. We bet on Kubernetes, bet on containers &#8212; those were good decisions,&#8221; he said. Increasingly, customers are also now scaling out their use of Kubernetes and have to figure out how to best scale out their clusters and deploy them in different environments &#8212; and to do so, they need a consistent platform across these environments. He also noted that when it comes to bringing on new Anthos customers, it&#8217;s really those factors that determine whether a company will look into Anthos or not.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that there are other players in this market, but he argues that Google Cloud&#8217;s take on this is also quite different. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I think we&#8217;re pretty unique in the sense that we&#8217;re from the cloud, cloud-native is our core approach,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A lot of what we talk about in [Anthos] 1.7 is about how we leverage the power of the cloud and use what we call &#8220;an anchor in the cloud&#8221; to make your life much easier. We&#8217;re more like a cloud vendor there, but because we support on-prem, we see some of those other folks.&#8221; Those other folks being IBM/Red Hat&#8217;s OpenShift and VMware&#8217;s Tanzu, for example. </span></p>
<p>The addition of support for Windows containers in vSphere environments also points to the fact that a lot of Anthos customers are classical enterprises that are trying to modernize their infrastructure, yet still rely on a lot of legacy applications that they are now trying to bring to the cloud.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, one thing we&#8217;ll likely see is more integrations with a wider range of Google Cloud products into Anthos. And indeed, as Reed noted, inside of Google Cloud, more teams are now building their products on top of Anthos themselves. In turn, that then makes it easier to bring those services to an Anthos-managed environment anywhere. One of the first of these internal services that run on top of Anthos is Apigee. &#8220;Your Apigee deployment essentially has Anthos underneath the covers. So Apigee gets all the benefits of a container environment, scalability and all those pieces &#8212; and we&#8217;ve made it really simple for that whole environment to run kind of as a stack,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>I guess we can expect to hear more about this in the near future &#8212; or at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/announcing-google-cloud-next21">Google Cloud Next 2021</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly exactly one month ago, digital real estate platform </span><a href="https://www.loft.com.br/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loft</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced it had closed on $425 million in Series D funding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by New York-based D1 Capital Partners. The round included participation from a mix of new and existing investors such as DST, Tiger Global, Andreessen Horowitz, Fifth Wall and QED, among many others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Loft was valued at $2.2 billion, a huge jump from its being just near unicorn territory in January 2020. The round marked one of the largest ever for a Brazilian startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, today, São Paulo-based Loft has announced an extension to that round with the closing of $100 million in additional funding that values the company at $2.9 billion. This means that the 3-year-old startup has increased its valuation by $700 million in a matter of weeks.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baillie Gifford led the Series D-2 round, which also included participation from Tarsadia, Flight Deck, Caffeinated and others. Individuals also put money in the extension, including the founders of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/mortgage-is-suddenly-sexy-as-softbank-pumps-500m-in-better-com-at-6b-valuation/">Better</a> (Zach Frenkel), GoPuff, Instacart, Kavak and Sweetgreen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loft has seen great success in its efforts to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">serve as a “one-stop shop” for Brazilians to help them manage the home buying and selling process. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128715" style="width: 552px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128715" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2128715" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Loft-product-image.png?w=300" alt="" width="542" height="524" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Loft-product-image.png 1033w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Loft-product-image.png?resize=150,145 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Loft-product-image.png?resize=300,290 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Loft-product-image.png?resize=768,743 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Loft-product-image.png?resize=680,658 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Loft-product-image.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Loft-product-image.png?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128715" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Loft</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Loft saw the number of listings on its site increase “10 to 15 times,” according to co-founder and co-CEO Mate Pencz. Today, the company actively maintains more than 13,000 property listings in approximately 130 regions across São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, partnering with more than 30,000 brokers. Not only are more people open to transacting digitally, more people are looking to buy versus rent in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We did more than 6x YoY growth with many thousands of transactions over the course of 2020,” Pencz told TechCrunch at the time of the company’s last raise. “We’re now growing into the many tens of thousands, and soon hundreds of thousands, of active listings.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Real estate platform Loft raises $425M at a $2.2B valuation in one of Brazil&#8217;s largest venture rounds&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/real-estate-platform-loft-raises-425m-at-a-2-2b-valuation-in-one-of-brazils-largest-venture-rounds/embed/#?secret=Y0REdyBsL5" data-secret="Y0REdyBsL5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decision to raise more capital so soon was due to a variety of factors. For one, Loft has received “overwhelming investor interest” even after “a very, very oversubscribed main round,” Pencz said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have seen a continued acceleration in our market share growth, especially in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the two markets we currently operate in,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he added. “We saw an opportunity to grow even faster with additional capital.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pencz also pointed out that Baillie Gifford has relatively large minimum check size requirements, which led to the extension being conducted at a higher price and increased the total round size “by quite a bit to be able to accommodate them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company was less forthcoming about its financials as of late, it told me last year that it had notched “over $150 million in annualized revenues in its first full year of operation” via more than 1,000 transactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s revenues and GMV (gross merchandise value) “increased significantly” in 2020, according to Pencz, who declined to provide more specifics. He did say those figures are “multiples higher from where they were,” and that Loft has “a very clear horizon to profitability.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pencz and Florian Hagenbuch founded Loft in early 2018 and today serve as its co-CEOs. The aim of the platform, in the company’s words, is “bringing Latin American real estate into the e-commerce age by developing online alternatives to analogue legacy processes and leveraging data to create transparency in highly opaque markets.” The U.S. real estate tech company with the closest model to Loft’s is probably Zillow, according to Pencz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United States, prospective buyers and sellers have the benefit of MLSs, which in the words of the National Association of Realtors, are private databases that are created, maintained and paid for by real estate professionals to help their clients buy and sell property. Loft itself spent years and many dollars in creating its own such databases for the Brazilian market. Besides helping people buy and sell homes, it offers services around insurance, renovations and rentals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Loft also entered the mortgage business by acquiring one of the largest mortgage brokerage businesses in Brazil. The startup now ranks among the top-three mortgage originators in the country, according to Pencz. When it comes to helping people apply for mortgages, he likened Loft to U.S.-based Better.com.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">This latest financing brings Loft’s total funding raised to an impressive $800 million. Other backers include Brazil’s Canary and a group of high-profile angel investors such as Max Levchin of Affirm and PayPal, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger and David Vélez, CEO and founder of Brazilian fintech Nubank. In addition, Loft has also raised more than $100 million in debt financing through a series of publicly listed real estate funds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Loft plans to use its new capital in part to expand across Brazil and eventually in Latin America and beyond. The company is also planning to explore more M&amp;A opportunities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The race to decarbonize aviation got a boost this Earth Day with the announcement of a $20.5 million Series A round by <a href="https://www.hydrogen.aero/">Universal Hydrogen</a>, a Los Angeles-based startup aiming to develop hydrogen storage solutions and conversion kits for commercial aircraft.</p>
<p>“Hydrogen is the only viable path for aviation to reach Paris Agreement targets and help limit global warming,” said founder and CEO Paul Eremenko in an interview with TechCrunch. “We are going to build an end-to-end hydrogen value chain for aviation by 2025.”</p>
<p>The round was led by Playground Global, with an investor syndicate including Fortescue Future Industries, Coatue, Global Founders Capital, Plug Power, Airbus Ventures, Toyota AI Ventures, Sojitz Corporation and Future Shape.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2141963,2141959,2141962"]</p>
<p>The company’s first product will be lightweight modular capsules to transport “green hydrogen,” produced using renewable power to aircraft equipped with hydrogen fuel cells. The capsules will ultimately be available in different sizes for aircraft ranging from VTOL air taxis to long-distance, single-aisle planes.</p>
<p>“We want them to be interchangeable within each class of aircraft, a bit like consumer batteries today,” says Eremenko.</p>
<p>To help kickstart the market for its capsules, Universal Hydrogen is developing one such plane itself, a modified 40-60-seat turboprop capable of regional flights of up to 700 miles. The effort is a collaboration with seed investor Plug Power, which will supply the hydrogen and fuel cells, and magniX, which develops motors for electric aircraft.</p>
<p>Eremenko hopes to have the plane flying paying passengers in a larger, 50-plus seater aircraft by 2025 and ultimately to produce kits for regional airlines to retrofit their own aircraft.</p>

<p>“We want to have a couple of years of service to de-risk hydrogen certification and passenger acceptance before Boeing and Airbus decide on the airplanes they are going to build in the early 2030s,” says Eremenko. “It&#8217;s imperative that at least one of them build a hydrogen airplane or aviation is not going to hit its climate goals.”</p>
<p>Universal Hydrogen is not alone in betting on hydrogen. ZeroAvia in the U.K. is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/zeroavias-hydrogen-fuel-cell-plane-ambitions-clouded-by-technical-challenges/">developing its own regional fuel cell aircraft</a> on an even more ambitious timeline, and Airbus in particular has been working on hydrogen aircraft concepts.</p>
<p>Eremenko hopes that producing a simple and safe hydrogen logistics network will soon attract new entrants.</p>
<p>“It’s like the Nespresso system. We have to make the first coffee maker or nobody cares about our capsule technology, but we don&#8217;t want to be in the coffee maker business. We want other people to build coffee with our capsules.”</p>
<p>Universal Hydrogen will use the Series A funds to grow its current 12-person team to around 40 and accelerate its technology development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The burgeoning climate-focused portfolio from early-stage investor <a href="https://sosv.com/">SOSV Investments</a> has managed to raise nearly $2 billion in follow-on financing since the startup companies graduated from the investment firm&#8217;s various accelerator programs. Taken together those companies have a collective market capitalization of nearly $6 billion.</p>
<p>Ahead of Earth Day this year, the early-stage investor responsible for a series of accelerators including HAX, IndieBio, Chinaccelerator and Food Labs, tallied up the results of the $89 million the firm has committed to these companies and the results were impressive &#8212; especially considering the average age of a company in the portfolio is only four years old.</p>
<p data-v-7ff52b10="">SOSV tallied the companies into the <a href="https://sosv.com/SOSV-climate-tech-100-list">Climate Tech 100</a> and divided them into categories that included startups developing technologies and services that have a direct impact on the planet and those that are adjacent to carbon removal &#8212; a further bucket was a group of startups that developed marketplaces for low-carbon goods and services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p data-v-7ff52b10="">&#8220;This all starts from trying to do meaningful things and purposeful things. We are trying to invest in these unstoppable forces and unstoppable trends and there has never been a more unstoppable force than climate change,&#8221; said SOSV Investments founder Sean O&#8217;Sullivan. &#8220;W<span style="font-weight: 400;">e discovered we were in the right place at the right time in the climate.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In the six years since the firm launched IndieBio with Arvind Gupta (now at the Mayfield Fund), SOSV&#8217;s life sciences accelerator had a dual focus on human and planetary health. By pursuing both areas, the firm was able to see the wave of climate tech applications in life sciences begin to rise and crest &#8212; and that&#8217;s led to early investments in companies like Perfect Day, Memphis Meats, Geltor and MycoWorks, which are all companies using biological materials to replace traditional animal products.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Planetary health is very much our thesis here. Arvind didn’t have to talk Sean into putting $100 million at the time,&#8221; said IndieBio&#8217;s new head Po Bronson (a longtime business writer who co-authored &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Decoding-World-Questioner-Po-Bronson/dp/1538734311">Decoding the World</a>&#8221; with Gupta and partnered with him at IndieBio).</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_1817449" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1817449" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1817449 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SOSV-people.001.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SOSV-people.001.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SOSV-people.001.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SOSV-people.001.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SOSV-people.001.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SOSV-people.001.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SOSV-people.001.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SOSV-people.001.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1817449" class="wp-caption-text">SOSV Investments founder Sean O&#8217;Sullivan. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> SOSV</p></div></p>
<p>The emphasis on food, Bronson said, was because it was an area where consumers were putting pressure on companies by changing their own habits and looking for alternatives. The decision to move to plant-based products is one consumer choice that can make a significant difference in planetary health &#8212; as well as their own individual health. Other systems are much harder to change without legislation or industrial support, said Bronson.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the hardware group in HAX Shenzhen run by Duncan Turner is beginning to see industrial companies embrace the demands for more sustainable manufacturing practices. Indeed, the 3D-printing company Formlabs is another startup that&#8217;s brought in big dollars with a process that directly impacts the carbon footprint of manufacturing.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How we make things used to be invisible before. Every publicly traded company has to do some sort of accounting in this space,&#8221; said Bronson. &#8220;The entire manufacturing sector is being interrogated on this front. It’s coming through and it’s driving adoption.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Looking ahead, Bronson sees opportunities in green chemistry to move the needle beyond life sciences applications in the food space. Those new technologies include services on offer from startups like Zymochem that is making a biorecyclable material for diapers that&#8217;s better for the planet, or Pili, which is making biologically based dyes and pigments. Bronson is also looking for biological solutions that can create massive, passive systems to sequester greenhouse gases in oceans or in soil.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Turner is hoping to find companies like Socure, which removes the need for a chemical separation agent for oil separation; or DivyGas, which has a method for manufacturing green hydrogen.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not only are the opportunities available, but this is a way people can make money,&#8221; said O&#8217;Sullivan. &#8220;Our net IRR is in the 30% plus range. You can make money in climate tech. So don’t be afraid to invest in these companies.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brazilian mobile payments app PicPay filed an F-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an IPO valued at up to $100 million on Wednesday. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol PICS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PicPay operates largely as a financial services platform that includes a credit card; a digital wallet similar to that of Apple Pay; a Venmo-style P2P payments element; e-commerce, and social networking features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to transform the way people and companies interact, make transactions, and communicate in an intelligent, connected, and simple experience,&#8221; said José Antonio Batista, CEO of PicPay, in a statement.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company is based in Sao Paulo now and operates across Brazil, PicPay originally launched in Vitoria in 2012, a coastal city north of Rio. In 2015 the company was acquired by the group J&amp;F Investimentos SA, a holding company owned by Brazilian billionaire brothers Wesley and Joesley Batista, which also own the gigantic meatpacker JBS SA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company’s registration statement, J&amp;F was involved in the biggest corruption scandal in Brazil’s history known as The Car Wash, and in 2017 entered into a plea deal with the Brazilian Federal Prosecutor. In December 2020 the company agreed to pay a fine of $1.5 billion and contribute an extra $442.6 million to social projects in Brazil. That being said, J&amp;F continues to be a powerful conglomerate in the country, positioning itself as a strong backer for PicPay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 was an explosive year for PicPay as the company saw its active userbase grow from 28.4 million to 36 million as of March 2021. According to the company’s 2020 financial report, which PicPay shared with TechCrunch, the company’s revenues also grew drastically from $15.5 million in 2019, to $71 million in 2020. The company is not yet profitable, however, and PicPay shelled out $146 million in 2020 to fuel its growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that the growth of our base and user engagement in our ecosystem demonstrates the scalability of our business model and reveals a great opportunity to generate more value for these customers,” Batista added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech is one of the most popular sectors in Brazil today, because there&#8217;s a lot of room for improvement in the region. The country has traditionally been controlled by four major banks, which have been slow to adapt to technology and also charge very high fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PicPay&#8217;s IPO is being led by Banco Bradesco BBI, Banco BTG Pactual, Santander Investment Securities Inc., and Barclays Capital Inc. </span></p>
<p><em>*The Brazilian Real was valued at 5.50 to $1 USD on the date of publication.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the spring comes color from Apple. The new iMacs are offered in seven different shades including a nice deep purple. As a refresh to the lineup, Apple has also released an iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini in a purple hue as well. I have a preview unit in hand to look at and so look at it I did. The color is great, closer to a violet on the sides and a lilac on the back.</p>
<p>This is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>great</em></span> color. In my opinion probably the best color of iPhone 12 released so far. Apple releasing this new purple shade also, to me, says to the people that love the mini: Don’t worry this will still be available for a while. But, conversely, it could be a sign that this version of the mini might be the only one we get for a while. Maybe I&#8217;m reading into it too much and this is a &#8220;because we could&#8221; thematic tie-in that offers a new option for spring buyers. Either way, it&#8217;s a really nice-looking phone that ties into the &#8220;<a href="https://blog.sampleboard.com/color-trends-2021-millennial-purple-interior-obsession/">millenial purple&#8221;</a> (read: lilac) trend that is booming in design and fashion right now. Apple&#8217;s color theory team is always pretty well on trend, so no change here.</p>
<p>Apple has also released a nice purple silicone case that complements it well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you want a deep dive on the seriously capable offering that the iPhone 12 mini is, feel free to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/iphone-12-mini-review-tiny-package-big-bang/">reference our review</a> from late last year.</p>
<p>Here are some nice pictures of the purple iPhone 12 mini for you to look at:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli startup <a href="https://whizzco.com/">WhizzCo</a> says it&#8217;s time for publishers to adopt the programmatic, auction-based approach when it comes to the ads in content recommendation widgets like Outbrain and Taboola.</p>
<p>After all, publishers regular employ this approach for most of their other digital ad units. But co-founder and CEO Alon Rosenthal said that when trying to monetize his own websites, he discovered for himself that it was &#8220;impossible&#8221; to maximize the revenue from those widgets in the same way.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was our real pain,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So with WhizzCo, Rosenthal and his team have built what they call a Content Recommendation Yield Platform, pulling native advertising from more than 40 different content recommendation providers, predicting which one will deliver the highest revenue for a given impression (whether that&#8217;s measured in CPM, CPC or CPA) and then delivering the ad from that provider.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 VCs say interactivity, regulation and independent creators will reshape digital media in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/9-vcs-say-interactivity-regulation-and-independent-creators-will-reshape-digital-media-in-2021/embed/#?secret=GyN3uxO11H" data-secret="GyN3uxO11H" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Rosenthal added that WhizzCo works with publishers to ensure that the recommendation widgets and ads look like they&#8217;re a native part of a page, and that their appearance doesn&#8217;t change regardless of where the ad comes from. He also said the publishers implement WhizzCo&#8217;s JavaScript on &#8220;not in the header, but on the actual code of the site — by doing that, we eliminate any loading problems whatsoever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although WhizzCo is coming out of stealth now, it was actually founded in 2017 and has already worked with a number of publishers, including Penske Media Corporation&#8217;s She Media. In a statement, She Media Senior Vice President of Operations Ryan Nathanson said, &#8220;WhizzCo&#8217;s platform allowed us to create a competitive ecosystem, which has enabled tighter customization, competition and editorial guideline control, yielding a 75% increase in content recommendation CPM.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Rosenthal said that on average, WhizzCo customers see a 37.7% lift in content recommendation revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our motto is that no one delivers 100% performance, 100% of the time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No matter who you are, even if you’re Google [or any of the other big ad companies,] you cannot perform best at all times. That’s where we come in with our technology.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global venture capital market had a cracking start to the year. Coming off a 2020 high, VC totals <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/inside-the-us-epic-first-quarter-venture-capital-results/">in the United States</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/european-vc-soars-in-q1/">in Europe,</a> and among competitive verticals <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/insurtech-startups-are-leveraging-rapid-growth-to-raise-big-money/">like insurtech</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/expect-an-even-hotter-ai-venture-capital-market-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-nuance-deal/">and AI</a> are on pace to set new records in 2021.</p>
<p>The rapid-fire deal-making and trend of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/fintech-vc-keeps-getting-later-larger-and-more-expensive/">larger venture checks at higher valuations</a> that The Exchange has tracked for some time require private-market investors to make decisions faster than ever. For venture capitalists, the timeline for reaching conviction around a startup’s thesis and executing due diligence has become compressed.</p>
<p>Some venture capitalists are turning to data to move more quickly. Some are spending more time preparing to be vetted themselves. And some investors are simply doing the work beforehand.</p>

<hr />
<p>We were tipped off to the concept of pre-diligence during the reporting process for a look into recent fundraising trends in the AI/ML space. <a href="https://sapphireventures.com/">Sapphire</a> investor <a href="https://twitter.com/jai_das">Jai Das</a>, when asked about how he was handling a competitive and swiftly moving market for AI startup investments, said that &#8220;most firms are completing their due diligence way before the financing actually happens.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>How does that work in practice? Per Das, startups that raise quick Series A and B rounds are &#8220;tracked by [early-stage] investors as soon as they raise their seed financings. So there is no need to do any due diligence during the financing and hence most of these financings are pre-emptive.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Venture capital: Now more about sales than ever before!</em></p>
<p>This morning, The Exchange is digging into the question of how VCs are handling diligence in a world where the most attractive deals can open and close faster than ever, and old models of deep diligence and paced deal-making are outmoded.</p>
<h2>Getting to yes</h2>
<p>One way that investors are betting on themselves in a bid to speed their diligence and decision-making is by investing in their own tech. That may sound obvious, given that venture capital dollars often land in the accounts of tech-focused companies, but in a business that was previously known for its relationship focus &#8212; more on that shortly &#8212; the trend is worth considering.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://congruentvc.com/">Congruent Ventures</a>, the early-stage investment firm focused on technologies and services designed to avert the current climate emergency, has raised $175 million in financing for its latest fund.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The firm, which now has $300 million in assets under management, is focused on investing in pre-seed, seed and Series A rounds and was founded by Abe Yokell and Joshua Posamentier, two longtime investors in the climate space with over 20 years of experience investing in the sector.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the dawn of a new administration dedicated to infrastructure [and] climate and a long-overdue influx of capital toward pressing global issues surrounding climate change, we cover the gamut with a portfolio of over three dozen companies working in transportation, energy transition, food and agriculture to sustainable production and consumption,&#8221; Yokell wrote in an email.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Companies in the portfolio include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/i-cant-believe-its-not-meat/">the mycelium meat producer Meati</a>; Milk Run, a farm-to-table food marketplace; PicoMES, which develops software for efficient manufacturing; Parallel Systems, a developer of electrified, autonomous rail cars; Alloy Enterprises, which is an additive manufacturer for aluminum; Hippo Harvest, which provides autonomous greenhouse growing systems; and Amp Robotics, a provider of recycling robots to improve efficiencies among hard-pressed waste recycling organizations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The firm counts some high-profile limited partners like Microsoft&#8217;s Climate Innovation Fund, affiliates of Prelude Ventures; the Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Turst and Surdna Foundation, along with UC Investments.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Until very recently, there was a total dearth of early-stage capital focused on climate and sustainability,” said Joshua Posamentier, managing partner and co-founder, Congruent Ventures. “We invest at the earliest stages where we can help entrepreneurs avoid a myriad of pitfalls, help them build strong companies, raise additional capital, and as a result, tackle the world’s most pressing environmental problems in some of the world’s largest sectors.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One-third of Congruent&#8217;s companies are working directly with energy or civil infrastructure and could<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/startups-have-about-1-trillion-worth-of-reasons-to-love-the-biden-infrastructure-plan/"> stand to gain tremendously from any infrastructure spending bill that could come from Washington</a>. Beyond that, the firm&#8217;s limited partners include infrastructure investors with over $700 billion of assets under management that are all potential customers for the technologies developed by the firm&#8217;s portfolio companies, the firm said in a statement.</p>
