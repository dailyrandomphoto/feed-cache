										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just a few months after launching <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/spotifys-podcasts-subscriptions-service-is-now-open-to-all-u-s-creators/">support for podcast subscriptions</a> to U.S. creators, Spotify today is making the service available to creators in global markets. The company says the service, which allows creators to mark episodes as &#8220;subscriber-only&#8221; content, will now become available in 33 new markets worldwide.</p>
<p>When podcast subscriptions publicly launched in the U.S., Spotify had introduced a couple of key changes to how the service worked. Before, creators had only been able to choose from one of three price points for their paid shows. But Spotify heard from creators they wanted more pricing flexibility, so it revamped pricing with the introduction of 20 price point options for creators to choose from, starting as low as $0.49 and increasing to as much as $150.</p>
<p>The company also launched a feature that would allow creators to download a list of their subscribers&#8217; contact information, so they could further develop their direct relationship with their audience.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235784" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the service rolls out globally, Spotify isn&#8217;t introducing any new features, it says. Instead, the expansion is just about bringing podcast subscriptions to more people.</p>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s podcast subscription platform isn&#8217;t the only one on the market. Apple offers its version of subscriptions, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">takes</a> a <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/878-subscriptions">30% cut</a> of creator revenue, which drops to 15% in year two &#8212; similar to other subscription apps. Spotify, meanwhile, is hoping to grow its service by waiving its commissions for the first two years. When the free period ends, it then plans to take a much lower commission of just 5%.</p>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s subscription podcasts service is offered via its podcast creation platform Anchor, which notes the subscriptions available today on both iOS and Android to 29 markets. The remaining four markets will roll out next week.</p>
<p>Included in the global rollout are Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Next week, Canada, Germany, Austria, andÂ  France will be supported.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other podcast news, Spotify additionally announced a multi-year exclusive agreement with Bad Robot Audio, a new audio-focused division of Bad Robot, the production company formed by J.J. Abrams in 2001.</p>
<p>Bad Robot is behind shows like &#8220;Lost,&#8221; &#8220;Alias,&#8221; &#8220;Fringe,&#8221; &#8220;Person of Interest,&#8221; &#8220;Castle Rock,&#8221; &#8220;Westworld,&#8221; and others, as well as films like &#8220;Super 8,&#8221; &#8220;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&#8221; and &#8220;Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker,&#8221; and the &#8220;Star Trek,&#8221; &#8220;Mission: Impossible&#8221; and &#8220;Cloverfield&#8221; franchises.</p>
<p>The new division is being led by former Audible and <span class="il">Spotify</span> award-winning executive, Christina Choi, who joins as Head of Podcasts at Bad Robot. The company isn&#8217;t yet detailing what shows it may offer on Spotify, but notes that they&#8217;ll include both &#8220;narrative non-fiction and fiction podcast productions.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every marketplace or platform startup has to decide how much they should charge for transactions on their platform, known as the &#8220;take rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>While there is no formula set in stone, Iâve analyzed the take rates of over 25 private and public marketplaces below. Iâll use these to help shed light on some considerations for founders to guide their decision.</p>
<p>Note that the definition of &#8220;take rate&#8221; used in this piece will be a percentage, which is calculated by dividing the revenue made on the transaction by the platform by the total value of the transaction.</p>
<h2>Maximizing take rate isnât the goal</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s important for founders to remember that maximizing the take rate of the platform is not the goal.</p>
<p>A higher take rate typically leads to lower transaction volume, and depending on the stage a company is in, it may be advantageous to charge a lower take rate than what you can sustain to gain a strategic advantage.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235651" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235651" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2235651 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/take-rate.001.jpeg" alt="platform take rates" width="2000" height="1000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/take-rate.001.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/take-rate.001.jpeg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/take-rate.001.jpeg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/take-rate.001.jpeg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/take-rate.001.jpeg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/take-rate.001.jpeg?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/take-rate.001.jpeg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235651" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tanay Jaipuria</p></div></p>
<p>You can see startups do this when they are going after relatively nascent markets that they are trying to grow. A great example of this is OpenSea, which charges a 2.5% fee on transactions, which is quite low compared to other marketplaces. However, given that NFTs were relatively nascent, their low fees helped reduce friction to trading and grow the size of the market.</p>
<p>This also happens in markets that are extremely competitive and have some winner-take-all dynamics of economies of scale. Here, a marketplace could start with lower take rates to try to grab share or achieve scale.</p>
<p>A general rule of thumb to remember is that the goal is to maximize long-term profit: (take rate x average transaction value &#8211; variable cost) x (number of transactions).</p>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The take rate and number of transactions will often trade-off with each other.</li>
<li>A lower take rate in the short term can lead to better outcomes in the long term.</li>
<li>Charging lower take rates than what you can &#8220;get away with&#8221; may lead to higher retention and value creation in the long run.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Understand the nature of your market</h2>
<p>Referring to the chart above, itâs clear that take rates are extremely variable, even within industries. However, certain market-driven factors play a role in determining the ranges in which you can operate.</p>
<p>For instance, certain companies such as Uber have to charge very different take rates in delivery (~10%) vs ridesharing (~20%).</p>
<p>When trying to understand the nature of the market, founders should consider:</p>
<h3>Is the product being sold digital or physical, and how much margin is available?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. government, along with counterparts in Australia and the U.K, have warned that Iranian state-backed hackers are targeting U.S. organizations in critical infrastructure sectors â in some cases with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a>.</p>
<p>The rare warning linking Iran with ransomware landed in a <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-321a">joint advisory</a> Wednesday, issued by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), and the U.K&#8217;s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).</p>
<p>The advisory said that Iran-backed attackers have been exploiting Fortinet vulnerabilities since at least March and a Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell vulnerability since October to gain access to U.S. critical infrastructure organizations in the transport and public health sectors, as well as organizations in Australia. The aim of the hackers is ultimately to leverage this access for follow-on operations such as data exfiltration, extortion and ransomware deployment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235748" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In May this year, for example, the hackers abused Fortigate gear to access a web server hosting the domain for a U.S. municipal government. The following month, CISA and the FBI observed the hackers exploiting Fortinet vulnerabilities to access the networks of a U.S.-based hospital specializing in healthcare for children.</p>
<p>The joint advisory has been released alongside a separate report from Microsoft on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/11/16/evolving-trends-in-iranian-threat-actor-activity-mstic-presentation-at-cyberwarcon-2021/">the evolution of Iranian APTs, </a>which are &#8220;increasingly utilizing ransomware to either collect funds or disrupt their targets.&#8221;Â In the report, Microsoft said it has been tracking six Iranian threat groups that have been deploying ransomware and exfiltrating data in attacks that started in September 2020.</p>
<p>Microsoft singles out one particularly âaggressiveâ group it calls Phosphorus, also known as APT35, which the company has been tracking for the past two years. While it previously used <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/microsoft-sues-phosphorus/">spear-phishing emails</a> to lure victims, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/04/microsoft-iran-phosphorous-attack/">presidential candidates</a> during the 2020 U.S. election, Microsoft says the group is now employing social engineering tactics to build rapport with their victims before using BitLocker, a full-disk encryption feature built into Windows, to encrypt their files.</p>
<p>CISA and the FBI are urging organizations to take a series of actions to mitigate the threats posed by the Iranian attackers, including updating operating systems, implementing network segmentation, andÂ using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a> and strong passwords.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.overwolf.com/">Overwolf</a>, a platform that enables creators to build, share, and monetize items inside games, has raised a $75 million Series D funding round, led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Previous investors including Griffin Gaming Partners, Insight Partners, Intel Capital, Liberty Technology Venture Capital, and Marker also participated. The funding will be pumped into Overwolfâs CurseForge Core, a solution that enables game studios, IP owners, and in-game creators to build user-generated content inside games.</p>
<p>The world where âgoldâ and in-game mods were bought and sold has moved on considerably. Players are now being enticed by the ability to build and share experiences inside games, creating a whole new sector for creators and hame-owners alike.</p>
<p>Based in Tel Aviv, Overwolf has raised over $150 million to date from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Atreides Management, Griffin Gaming Partners, Insight, Marker, Intel Capital, Liberty Technology Venture Capital, Market, and Ubisoft.<br />
Â <br />
CurseForge Core is a white-label solution that allows publishers to easily integrate mods into their existing and new games.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235776" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As well as being a technical solution, Overwolf offers game developers a full-service UGC platform that will cover content moderation, IP, and various other aspects.</p>
<p>Uri Marchand, Overwolf Co-Founder, and CEO, said âNo single game studio can compete with the speed of execution and sheer creativity of a passionate community. Instead of resisting community creations, we have seen a shift in perception with leading game studios starting to embrace the value that these creators bring to the community and to the studio itself.â</p>
<p>Overwolf says it has amassed some 87,000 in-game creators, while more than 20 million gamers use Overwolfâs products monthly. It predicts it will pay out $29M to in-game creators, nearly three times last yearâs number. Itâs also launching the Overwolf Creators Fund, a $50 million fund to support in-game app creators, mod authors, as well as game studios who plan to integrate mods into new titles.</p>
<p>Jonathan Lai, a partner at a16z, said: âThe biggest social platforms today, including TikTok, Youtube, Instagram, are heavily driven by creators who generate content for friends, family, and the community. As games continue to evolve into social networks, creators and user-generated content will play an equally important role. Overwolf&#8217;s platform makes it possible for any player to become a co-creator of their favorite game thanks to a robust development engine, an app store for distribution, and monetization tools for creators to earn a living from their work.â</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to me over a call, I asked Marchand if Overwolf could conceivably become a sort of âbuilding blockâ for a proposed Metaverse-style environment?</p>
<p>âIf we&#8217;re talking about consistent experiences across games, then we can potentially create that and bridge the gap in a way that&#8217;s aligned with the IP owners,â he told me.</p>
<p>âIt could be a sword, or it could be a narrative, it could be a lot of those things. I think a big part of the metaverse apart from people being able to talk and switch between experiences and create ownership is creation &#8211; and we&#8217;re a company that&#8217;s focused on the creation elements,â he added.</p>
<p>A competitor to overworld is Mod.io, which recently $26 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was going to be a big couple of years for agricultural robotics well before COVID-19 was on our collective radar. Population growth and environmental concerns have been big drivers for those working to figure out how to feed people in the future. The pandemic, meanwhile, has only accelerated concerns, as many farmers have struggled to staff field-hand positions.</p>
<p>Fieldin &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/22/tel-aviv-meetup-winners/">made its first appearance</a> on these pages as a Tel Aviv pitch-off winner back in 2016 &#8212; today announced plans to acquire Midnight Robotics. Itâs certainly a good match on its face. California-based (by way of Israel and Australia) Fieldin works to help farmers accelerate data collection and automation. Midnight, meanwhile, retrofits tractors and other farming equipment with lidar-based sensing technologies.</p>
<p>Fieldin says its technology takes around a day to get up and running. As with many of these services, the company sends a technician to the farm to help on-board farmers. On the face of it, at least, itâs an easier life than many of the existing technologies that require famers to purchase brand new technology &#8212; something thatâs cost-prohibitive for those on a tight budget.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235699" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We&#8217;re launching a robotics newsletter! Please sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">to get Actuator in your inbox</a> as soon as the first issue hits! For free!</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The acquisition will integrate Midnightâs technology into Fieldinâs existing solution.</p>
<p>âOver the past eight years weâve digitized hundreds of farms and over 10,000 tractors and pieces of farming equipment â more than anyone else in the high-value crop world â and amassed a trove of invaluable data that can offer insights into best practices in farm management,â Fieldin co-founder and CEO Boaz Bachar said in a release. âBy acquiring Midnight Robotics, weâre helping farmers close the loop from insight to autonomous action, so they know exactly what they need to do and execute it autonomously, all through the same platform.â</p>
<p>Midnight co-founders Yonatan Horovitz and Edo Reshef will join Fieldin as chief autonomy office and chief technology officer, respectively. They will also both be listed as Fieldin co-founders, per the deal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the best parts of being a journalist is getting to pepper experts with whatever questions you have in mind, allowing you to learn lots, often quickly, about much. The downside to that upside is that you often wind up knowing just enough to be dangerous as a journalist, but not enough to <em>not</em> worry that you are making a modest ass of yourself on the internet.</p>
<p>With that caveat in mind, let&#8217;s talk about the <a href="https://anoma.foundation/">Anoma Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://anoma.network/">Anoma protocol</a>Â <a href="https://heliax.dev/">and Heliax</a>. Bear with me here.</p>
<p>Unlike the Delaware C-corp standard that we see from many startups that raise capital these days, the Anoma project is set up a little differently. The Anoma Foundation is based in Switzerland and has just raised $26 million. It, in turn, is using its raised funds to pay Heliax, a developer group, to work on the Anoma protocol.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235678" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Polychain Capital led the funding event, with other names like Maven Capital and Electric Capital also contributing.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianbrink/">Adrian Brink</a>, a founder at both the larger Anoma project and Heliax, the setup of a Swiss foundation and separate development shop was proven through the development <a href="https://polkadot.network/about/">of Polkadot</a>, which was, in turn, the <a href="https://polkadot.network/about/">work of the Web3 Foundation</a>, also based in Switzerland.</p>
<p>If you want to be lazy, just know that the larger Anoma project has just raised a stack of new funds. It did so, per Brink, via a SAFT. You are actually more familiar with that term than you think: Recall that a SAFE is a <em>simple agreement for future equity</em>, a method of fundraising that allows a startup to raise funds without setting a formal price at the time. SAFEs come in a host of flavors, with some featuring a &#8220;cap,&#8221; or upper limit on the price that invested dollars in the mechanism can convert to shares. They can also include discounts or a pre-determined, lower-cost conversion rate into shares at a future valuation mark. Some have both caps and discounts.</p>
<p>Regardless, a <em>SAFT</em>, as you have already guessed, is aÂ <em>simple agreement for future tokens</em>, or a SAFE fit for the crypto world. Neat!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>So, what will the Anoma protocol do?</h2>
<p>According to Brink, Anoma wants to undefine money in the long term. His team thinks that money is becoming a lackluster form of abstraction, given that folks may not want to have a currency middle layer between their ability to swap digital assets.</p>
<p>Enter Anoma, an asset-agnostic blockchain project that will allow users to barter digital goods. Notably, Anoma won&#8217;t be a price-determining entity. Instead, Brink explained, Anoma will be a <em>coordination</em> system when it launches, one that can be used for trading digital assets.</p>
<p>There are some controls planned that users will like, including setting intent to trade something for another thing, and a mechanism akin to limit pricing to avoid under-bartering, if that&#8217;s a phrase.</p>
<p>Underlying the larger Anoma perspective is the idea that there will be many major blockchains, or level one (L1) protocols, out there. That would mean that digital assets won&#8217;t be on a single chain in the future, implying a need to be able to swap from one blockchain to another. Doing so without the required use of money could prove useful.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll know more about the project&#8217;s &#8212; company&#8217;s? &#8212; hypothesis when Anoma launches, perhaps, per Brink, in Q4 2022 or Q1 2023.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s about as simple as I can make the Anoma round for you. But I wanted to bring it up all the same &#8212; too much of today&#8217;s crypto chatter is about silly NFT prices and which shitcoin is currently mooning. Whatever. Anoma is, instead, using blockchain tech to put something together that actually feels new and interesting. It&#8217;s more old-school crypto, if you will, a push to make a new future of value where we aren&#8217;t constrained to traditional methods or their thinly digitized equivalents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s data protection watchdog has written to Apple and Google seeking details of how they assess apps to determine the age ratings they apply following concerns raised by an online child safety charity.</p>
<p>The move follows the coming into force of the UK&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code/">Age Appropriate Design Code</a> this September &#8212; which puts requirements on digital services that are likely to be accessed by children to prioritize protecting their privacy and safety.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/11/letter-to-5rights-foundation/">statement</a> today the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said her office is currently conducting an &#8220;evidence gathering process to identify conformance with the code, and thus compliance with the underlying data protection law&#8221;.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235671" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The information commissioner was responding to <a href="https://5rightsfoundation.com/uploads/Letter_5RightsFoundation-BreachesoftheAgeAppropriateDesignCode.pdf">a letter</a> from the <a href="https://5rightsfoundation.com/in-action/letter-to-the-ico-breaches-of-the-age-appropriate-design-code.html">5Rights Foundation</a> &#8212; a digital child safety charity which conducted research over the summer to investigate compliance with the Code; and says it found 12 &#8220;systemic&#8221; breaches, including insufficient age assurance; mis-advertisment of minimum ages for games on app stores; the use of dark patterns and nudges; data-driven recommendations that create risks for children; a routine failure to enforce community standards; low default privacy settings; and plenty more besides.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this process, the ICO is taking a systemic approach; we are focusing our interventions on operators of online services where there is information which indicates potential poor compliance with privacy requirements, and where there is a high risk of potential harm to children,&#8221; Denham also wrote in reply to the 5Rights Foundation, adding that as part of this work the ICO has contacted Apple and Google &#8212; &#8220;to enquire about the extent to which the risks associated with the processing of personal data are a factor when determining the age rating for an app&#8221;.</p>
<p>The tech giants have been contacted for comment on the development.</p>
<p>Both operate app stores which apply age ratings to apps that are made available for download &#8212; potentially by children &#8212; meaning their platforms come under the scope of the Code.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ICO is not singling out Apple and Google, however &#8212; saying today that it&#8217;s written to a total of 40 organizations across the three tech sectors it considers highest risk for kids &#8212; namely social media/messaging; gaming; and video/music streaming &#8212; &#8220;to determine their standards of conformance individually&#8221;.</p>
<p>It adds that it will write to a further nine companies following the charity highlighting a raft of concerns &#8212; bringing the total number of digital services under regulatory review to almost 50.</p>
<p>The ICO has not published the full list of tech companies it has targeted for Code compliance questions.</p>
<p>Nor does the 5Rights Foundation appear to have published the list of companies it&#8217;s raising concerns about (but it has passed their names to the regulator).</p>
<p>Its correspondence to the ICO also refers directly to Facebook whistleblower, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">Frances Haugen&#8217;s recent testimony to lawmakers</a>, which includes warnings over the toxicity of platforms like Instagram for teens&#8217; developing brains &#8212; suggesting the social media giant (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">now known as Meta</a>) is likely on its list.</p>
<p>The charity&#8217;s chair, Baroness Kidron, was instrumental in pushing for the Code&#8217;s set of headline standards to be established by the ICO in the first place, as part of the UK&#8217;s existing data protection legislation.</p>
<p>Although the Code only came into force at the start of September the standards were published at the start of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/uk-watchdog-sets-out-age-appropriate-design-code-for-online-services-to-keep-kids-privacy-safe/">last year</a> &#8212; with the ICO opting to give business a long grace period to come into compliance.</p>
<p>So, in one sense, it&#8217;ll be difficult for established businesses to argue that they haven&#8217;t had enough time to make the necessary changes.</p>
<p>Moreover, while the ICO doesn&#8217;t exactly have a reputation as a pro-active enforcer of digital rights, child safety groups like the 5Rights Foundation don&#8217;t look like they&#8217;ll be content to let enforcement sit still for long.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a danger that the Code is being interpreted as introducing a handful of safety measures, rather than a requiring a holistic re-design of the systems and processes of services to ensure their data collection practices are in the best interests of children,&#8221; the 5Rights Foundation warns in its letter. &#8220;If the Code is to have real value in protecting childrenâs safety and rights in the digital environment, the ICO must make sure that it is respected in practice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kidron also suggests that the &#8220;systemic&#8221; nature of the problems the 5Rights Foundation&#8217;s research unearthed suggests that while the issues were identified ahead of the Code coming into force this fall, &#8220;many&#8221; will likely persist &#8212; hence it&#8217;s urging the ICO to investigate &#8220;apparent breaches&#8221; and publish guidance.</p>
<p>In her response, Denham suggests a timeline of next spring for the ICO to take some sort of action, writing: &#8220;In terms of timescales, we need to take the time to understand what the information gathered is telling us systemically and individually. Our regulatory options will be based on that careful understanding and as such I expect that we will progress to next steps in spring 2022.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s notable that she has written &#8220;next steps&#8221; &#8212; rather than actual enforcement.</p>
<p>This suggests there may be a far longer dance of the ICO trying to &#8216;encourage&#8217; improvements from the tech industry vs muscular enforcement on platform giants &#8212; as we&#8217;ve seen in the case of systemic breaches of data protection law by the adtech industry (which the ICO has been &#8216;investigating&#8217; for years, just without taking any enforcement action).</p>
<p>See, for example, the discussion later in Denham&#8217;s letter to Kidron of &#8220;stakeholder roundtable events&#8221; where she says it&#8217;s planning to gather evidence about the use of age assurance tech, specifically, that will be &#8220;used to inform the scope of any further regulatory action in relation to age assurance&#8221;.</p>
<p>On age assurance &#8212; aka, technologies and techniques used to try to determine the age of a user to figure out if they are underage/a minor &#8212; the 5Rights Foundation&#8217;s research found &#8220;many&#8221; services with age restrictions that it said can, nonetheless, &#8220;be easily accessed by children under the minimum age of use, including adult-only services&#8221;.</p>
<p>It also reports finding some services stating that they do not collect any personal data from children &#8212; yet says &#8220;many&#8221; of these lacked age assurance or else used age assurance that can be easily bypassed (such as asking children to input a birth date, which they can just lie about).</p>
<p>&#8220;If these services do not identify child users, it is unclear how they are upholding their own privacy policies or are able to implement the Code,&#8221; the charity goes on to warn in the letter.</p>
<p>However the question of how platforms can comply with elements of the cCode like &#8216;age assurance&#8217; requirements is not exactly a straightforward one.</p>
<p>Last month the ICO put out a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/ico-and-stakeholder-consultations/call-for-evidence-on-the-use-of-age-assurance/">call for evidence on age assurance</a>. And in an opinion on the topic, published simultaneously, the regulator offered some tentative guidance for digital service providers &#8212; recommending a risk-based approach and suggesting those platforms and apps that pose a &#8220;high&#8221; risk to children should either apply all relevant code standards to all users to ensure risks are &#8220;mitigated&#8221;; or introduce age assurance measures that &#8220;give the highest possible level of certainty on age of users&#8221; (likely to mean age verification rather than age estimation).</p>
<p>For low or medium risk services, the ICO suggested either applying all relevant code standards to all users to ensure risks are &#8220;low&#8221;; or &#8220;introduce age assurance measures that give a level of certainty on the age of child users that is proportionate to the potential risks to children&#8221;.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s inherent subjectivity in how platforms assess risks and choose which mitigating measures to apply.</p>
<p>The opinion also highlighted the challenge for digital services in balancing the requirement to protect privacy with applying (potentially) intrusive age assurance techniques, with the ICO writing: &#8220;While the Commissioner appreciates the developments in age assurance techniques, technology and policy, more needs to be done to ensure these respect and comply with data protection law.&#8221;</p>
<p>The regulator also committed to revisiting the opinion in line with a planned review of the Code in 2022 &#8212; &#8220;due to the rapidly evolving state of the age assurance market, wider legislative proposals and developing policy landscape&#8221;.</p>
<p>Expecting muscular enforcement to rain down in an area where privacy and safety intersect &#8212; and even collide &#8212; and where there is no simple one-size-fits all solution that will be appropriate everywhere, for every type of service and user &#8212; seems, well, unlikely.</p>
<p>Denham&#8217;s lengthy letter is not only packed with caveats and qualifications it begins by managing expectations &#8212; framing the Code as seeking to drive &#8220;proportionate protections that enhance societyâs engagement with the digital world&#8221; &#8212; all of which suggests her office will favor a more pragmatic, tweak-by-tweak, approach to compliance with the Code than some child safety charities (and age assurance tech providers) might prefer.</p>
<p>The UK government is also in the process of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">consulting on &#8216;reforming&#8217; the domestic data protection regime</a> &#8212; potentially interfering with the independence of the ICO in favor of prioritizing data-fuelled &#8216;innovation&#8217;. So the ICO may get defanged and domestic privacy rights gutted in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>Time will tell how this one plays out. But the UK&#8217;s child safety campaigners may end up finding themselves feeling as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/">frustrated as UK privacy advocates</a> &#8212; who continue to whistle for regulatory enforcement against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">systemic breaches (that the ICO has itself identified</a>) <em>years</em> after the country updated its data protection regime to add (at least on paper) a set of teeth&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will recognise that as a regulator, the ICO will always face tough choices on how to deploy our limited resources,&#8221; Denham cautions Kidron. &#8220;As such, this is why our initial focus is on those cases of greatest potential harm with non-conformance across multiple standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also warns that the ICO will be staying in its lane &#8212; such as by not applying the Code&#8217;s standards retrospectively.</p>
<p>Denham&#8217;s letter is also careful to emphasize that the regulator cannot tackle certain concerns raised by the charity as they don&#8217;t fall under its remit or else fall outside the scope of the Code (such as child accessing adult-only websites) &#8212; pointing instead to the forthcoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">Online Safety Act</a> as the appropriate legislation for that; a content-focused regulation that will be overseen by Ofcom, not the ICO.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ICO will continue to work with DCMS [the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport], Ofcom as the intended online safety regulator, and others to ensure that where we can act under current regulation, we do try to prevent underage access. However the solution to the problem is not one that sits squarely within the code or within data protection so is not one the ICO can commit to address entirely,&#8221; she adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Machina Labs today announced a $14 million Series A for its robotics and AI-based manufacturing. The round, led by Endeavors and featuring Congruent Ventures and Embark Ventures, brings the Los Angeles firmâs total funding to $16.3 million to date.</p>
<p>The news also finds the company effectively coming out of stealth, following pilots with NASA and the United States Air Force. Government contracts (DoD specifically) have long played an important part of the early stages of robotics platforms, and Machina Labs doesnât appear unique in that respect.</p>

<hr />
<p>It is, however, beginning to accept commercial partners, as it looks toward more growth with this new funding. The timing is certainly right, with U.S.-based manufacturing only further hamstrung amid a pandemic that has ground much of the global supply chain to a screeching halt.</p>

<p>Machinaâs initial play is focused, in part, on sheet metal manipulation, which it has used to design tank parts, while exploring the potential for in-space manufacturing for NASA &#8212; though, for obvious reasons, that bit is a ways off. Meantime, the company is currently offering on-demand manufacturing-as-a-service at the factory in its native Los Angeles.</p>
<p>âManufacturing must be reinvented to keep up with the pace of change in this highly competitive market,â co-founder and CEO Edward Mehr said in a statement. âWeâre excited to finally reveal Machina Labsâ manufacturing platform, which combines the latest advances in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) to democratize access to rapid manufacturing so that anyone with a great idea can manufacture parts quickly, efficiently and cost-effectively. These software-defined, robotic facilities are the factories of the future, and weâre thrilled to have our investors on board to help us get there.â</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This fresh round of funding will go toward increasing the companyâs headcount in LA and additional R&amp;D for its platform.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Waymo Via, the delivery division of Alphabet&#8217;s self-driving arm, is expanding its existing partnership with UPS to carry freight via autonomous Class 8 trucks.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Waymo Via, the delivery division of Alphabet&#8217;s self-driving arm, is expanding its existing partnership with UPS to carry freight via autonomous Class 8 trucks. The six-week pilot, which kicked off last week and will continue until the end of the year to support the holiday season, takes place in Texas between Houston and Dallas-Forth Worth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Waymo is not sharing the specific number of trucks it will use for the pilot, but it did say &#8220;multiple trucks&#8221; from its test fleet of Peterbilts that are equipped with its fifth-generation Driver will be delivering goods for UPS&#8217;s North American Air Freight (NAAF) unit. The trucks will have two autonomous specialists onboard &#8212; one driver with a commercial driver&#8217;s license and one software technician &#8212; who will monitor Driver&#8217;s operations while in autonomous mode. The trucks will be self-driving only on highways, and will switch back to manual mode for surface street portions, a spokesperson for Waymo told TechCrunch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Back in January 2020, Waymo began delivering smaller parcels for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/self-driving-company-waymo-teams-up-with-ups-for-package-delivery/">UPS in its autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans in Phoenix, Arizona</a>. The goal of that initial pilot, which wrapped earlier this year, was to develop a long-term plan for how the companies can work together, so this latest extension makes good on that intention.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235283" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The first UPS pilot, &#8220;brought incredible learnings for us on things like hailing the vehicle, loading/unloading parcels and more,&#8221; said a Waymo spokesperson. &#8220;While this trucking pilot wonât be related to our local delivery pilots or have any local delivery components, weâll be building on our initial learnings and working with the UPS team for these trial runs.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the trucking pilot goes well, Waymo might pose a threat to companies like TuSimple that have been partnering with UPS and its NAAF division since 2019. During <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/tusimple-aims-to-test-self-driving-trucks-on-public-roads-without-human-safety-operator-by-eoy/">TuSimple&#8217;s Q3 earnings call,</a> the AV startup said it&#8217;s expanding its autonomous freight network from Arizona to the east coast ahead of schedule so that it can reach NAAF terminals in Orlando and Charlotte. TuSimple says it has already completed 160,000 miles of freight hauls for NAAF.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;These Class 8 trial runs will build on all of the learnings and success weâve had testing with UPS over the years, as well as our previous Class 8 trial runs with other carriers across unique verticals, including J.B. Hunt,&#8221; Waymo wrote in a blog post announcing the partnership.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In June, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/waymo-and-jb-hunt-partner-to-bring-autonomous-trucks-to-texas-in-new-pilot/">Waymo announced a freight hauling partnership with J.B. Hunt</a> along the busy Interstate 45 between Houston and Forth Worth. A couple of months later, the company announced it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/waymo-via-is-scaling-up-autonomous-trucking-operations-in-texas-arizona-california/">build a dedicated trucking hub in Dallas</a> and partner with Ryder for fleet management services in a move to scale up autonomous trucking operations in Texas, Arizona and California. The Ryder relationship has already begun at a temporary Dallas facility, but the hub won&#8217;t open until the first half of next year, says Waymo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a> announced a multiyear partnership with <a href="http://cohere.ai">Cohere</a>, an early-stage startup that is building a natural language processing platform to make it easier for developers to build natural language processing models into applications. The solution requires a fair amount of infrastructure resources to pull off, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is going to provide them under the terms of this deal.</p>
<p>The two companies are also planning a go-to-market effort together, giving Cohere a big lift as a startup to help jumpstart usage and sales with the power of the GCP sales team.</p>
<p>Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said that Cohere offers a great use case for Google Cloud Tensor Processing Unit (TPUs) chips that builds on work Google has been doing in-house.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235669" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;First of all, this is a perfect example of a technology that we built at Google for our own use, these high-scale TPUs. We&#8217;re now making them available in the cloud to other platform companies,&#8221; Kurian told me. &#8220;But here is an example [with Cohere] where they find that the ability to use and build models and train them on TPUs provides them very differentiated capability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aidan Gomez, co-founder and CEO at Cohere, who previously worked at <a href="https://research.google/teams/brain/">Google Brain</a>, said his company is trying to build an NLP solution that makes all of this advanced technology available to any developer. &#8220;We scrape the data to train these big models, we train them on massive TPU pods, and we optimize them because they&#8217;re extremely large, and want them to fit the latency tolerances of pretty much any production system,&#8221; Gomez explained.</p>
<p>He said that by optimizing the workloads, Cohere can open up access to all of this advanced technology, enabling developers to access the models and start building NLP-based solutions based on the models that Cohere is providing. Kurian said that he is starting to see this shift from the text-based UI to one that&#8217;s more driven by natural language interactions, and Cohere is a good example of how to make this happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at the state of the art, the way that the vast majority of people use computers is through graphical user interfaces or screens. I don&#8217;t think that people want to experience computers through just one sense, which is the sense of sight,&#8221; Kurian said. &#8220;They want to interact with computers in more ways and they want to interact in more natural ways. So language is the next big phase of evolution of the way that people interact with systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not every day that you see the CEO of one of the big three cloud platforms get on a call to discuss a partnership with a startup, but Kurian believes this is a particularly compelling and creative example of TPU usage. &#8220;If you actually use the Cohere technology, you will find that it works very elegantly because of the combination of the software that Aidan&#8217;s team has built and the computational infrastructure that TPUs provide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cohere was founded in 2019 by Gomez, Nick Frosst and Ivan Zhang in Toronto. The company has raised $40 million from Index Ventures, Radical Ventures, Section 32, and a who&#8217;s who of industry AI angels including Geoffrey Hinton and Fei-Fei Li, among others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following a COVID-driven boost, the popular <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AllTrails</a> resource for hikers, bikers, climbers and anyone else who enjoys the outdoors, announced today it&#8217;s raised $150 million from the growth fund of global private equity firm Permira to further accelerate its business. Prior investor Spectrum Equity will continue to be the company&#8217;s largest shareholder, following this transaction.</p>
<p>Like many companies, AllTrails benefitted from how the pandemic impacted consumer behavior. Amid lockdowns and social distancing measures, many people rekindled their interest in exploring the outdoors and connecting with nature &#8212; and they turned to AllTrails&#8217; extensive collection of over 300,000 hiking, running and mountain biking trails to find where to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;COVID was an accelerant of a trend that weâve been seeing for years,&#8221; explains AllTrails CEO Ron Schneidermann. &#8220;Even pre-pandemic, nearly a third of the global population regularly participated in some sort of outdoor recreation. And in almost every country in the world walking for recreation or exercise is by far the most popular activity. When you add in trail running, mountain biking, camping and backpacking, those numbers only go up,&#8221; he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235653" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The past 18 months drew more users to the AllTrails mobile app, which now has more than 40 million downloads and 30 million registered users across 190 countries. During the past 12 months, over 100 million users also visited AllTrails.com to find a trail. While the company doesn&#8217;t typically disclose its revenue or paid subscribers on an ongoing basis, it did celebrate crossing the 1 million paid subscriber <a href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prnewswire.com%2Fnews-releases%2Falltrails-celebrates-1-million-paid-subscribers-301214556.html%23%3A~%3Atext%3DSAN%2520FRANCISCO%252C%2520Jan.%2Cits%2520premium%2520service%252C%2520AllTrails%2520Pro.&amp;data=04%7C01%7CCSmalling%40sardverb.com%7C5a7309adb53a473fa6a608d9a897375c%7Cdfc7827b9c274ffbb94f96d3b0b06aa1%7C0%7C0%7C637726189717844625%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=zPQWse5x664uTTzOZ1tOuVS%2BGeZjcaicEytJXxzx%2BqQ%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">milestone</a> back in January.</p>
<p>Although COVID lockdowns (for now) have largely ended, demand for AllTrails hasn&#8217;t subsided, the company says.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the world opens back up, weâre seeing the staying power of this connection to the outdoors,&#8221; says Schneidermann. &#8220;This stickiness is manifesting itself in terms of app usage and frequency, and across the board improvements in sign-up rates, user-generated content contribution rates, freemium conversion rates and subscriber retention rates,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>AllTrails didn&#8217;t need to raise capital, however &#8212; it&#8217;s been profitable since 2017. Rather, the company chose to bring in new funding to help it accelerate its existing momentum. The funds will be used for product development, to build out the AllTrails team and to expand its community internationally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, about two-thirds of AllTrails&#8217; users are in North America, but it&#8217;s seeing some of its highest rates of growth across Europe, Asia and Latin America.</p>
<p>Schneidermann says this is also the third year in a row where the company will be doubling headcount, primarily driven by investments in R&amp;D and product development. Currently, it&#8217;s <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/alltrails" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring in roles</a> across engineering, design, finance, operations, product and more.</p>

<p>The AllTrails app &#8212; which today offers search, discovery, reviews and a wide range of maps that work offline &#8212; will get an upgrade in 2022.</p>
<p>At present, the app is more utilitarian than it is social, despite the user-generated content in the form of trail reviews and photos. People contribute to this resource so others like them can benefit from their tips &#8212; like if a trail gets muddy after a rain, if it&#8217;s too steep for families hiking with little kids, if it&#8217;s crowded on weekends and so on. Meanwhile, the trail photos help people get a sense of what a trail is like and what sort of scenic views they may have in store. But many AllTrails users still turn to other networks &#8212; like Facebook Groups &#8212; for inspiration about where to go hike or bike.</p>
<p>With the new funding, AllTrails plans to invest in its product, and has a range of new features coming in the year ahead for both free and paid users alike &#8212; including those that aim to help the community better connect.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think that thereâs a big opportunity in improving the search and discovery experience via personalization, elevating the on-trail navigation experience, expanding access to more users around the world by supporting additional languages and creating more ways for our community to interact, share their experiences, and inspire each other,&#8221; Schneidermann says.</p>
<p>The company believes Permira &#8212; which has backed Klarna, Minted, Zwift and others, and recently helped to <a href="https://www.permira.com/media-centre/news/mcafee-to-be-acquired-by-an-investor-group-for-over-14-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquire</a> McAfee &#8212; will be particularly helpful in expanding AllTrails&#8217; global footprint.</p>
<p>&#8220;Continued international expansion is a huge priority for us, so weâre especially excited to tap into the global resources that Permira brings to the table,&#8221; notes.</p>
<p>With the transaction, Bruce Chizen, senior advisor to Permira and former CEO of Adobe, and Gretchen Howard, COO of Robinhood, will join the company&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p>The company had previously raised $75 million from Spectrum Equity in October 2018.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Priti Choksi, partner at Norwest Venture Partners, has a portfolio that includes Bright, Lumosity, Citcon, UPSIDE Foods and Birdies. But before she ever entered the world of VC, she was an operator at companies like Facebook and Google. She managed business development teams and ran M&amp;A and has vast experience in the world of growing and scaling companies.</p>
<p>So, it should go without saying, we&#8217;re absolutely amped to have Choksi join us on <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-live-with-norwest-venture-partners-and-birdies?utm_source=TC%20Post&amp;utm_campaign=post" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 17 at 12 p.m. PST/3 p.m. EST for an episode of TechCrunch Live</a>. Choksi will be joined by founder Bianca Gates of <a href="https://birdies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Birdies</a>.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is all about helping founders build better venture-backed businesses. The first step in that, usually, is getting some funding. We&#8217;ll talk to Choksi and Gates about how they first met, what drew Choksi to invest in Birdies and how they&#8217;ve worked together since. We&#8217;ll also take a look through Birdies&#8217; early pitch deck and hear what really sang for NVP and other investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232075" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founders, this is a great opportunity to learn what makes VCs tick and refine your fundraising process accordingly.</p>
<p>This episode of TechCrunch Live will also feature the TCL pitch-off, where founders in the audience can come on our virtual stage and pitch their products to our esteemed guests, who will give their live feedback.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is accessible to anyone who is available on Wednesdays at noon PST/3 p.m. EST, but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">full library of on-demand TechCrunch Live content</a> is reserved exclusively for TechCrunch+ members.

					<description><![CDATA[Braze pricedÂ aboveÂ its IPO range, while UserTesting priced underneath its range. Why?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Braze and UserTesting will begin to trade this morning, kicking off their lives as public companies.</p>
<p>But while it would seem we could simply lump the two companies into a bucket and call the day a win for tech upstarts and their venture capital backers, we can&#8217;t. Why? Because the two companies had very different final pricing results. And that means we have questions.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Braze pricedÂ <em>aboveÂ </em>its IPO range, while UserTesting priced <em>underneath</em> its range. Why? (You can read our initial notes on Braze <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/braze-set-to-put-points-on-the-board-for-new-yorks-startup-scene-in-impending-ipo/">here</a>, if you&#8217;d like.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s parse the numbers, chat through what the two companies are worth at their IPO prices, and discuss what we can learn from the information to better understand the present-day exit market for software companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220370 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We always care about software IPOs because they help us understand the market for software startups &#8212; how much public markets are willing to pay for a software company&#8217;s shares helps price startup funding rounds, for example. But we also have Nubank and Paytm heading out soon, two mega-IPOs that have us up at night wondering how they will be valued. So we&#8217;re collecting all the data that we can in advance.</p>
<p>That in mind, let&#8217;s figure out why Braze had a much better pricing result than UserTesting.</p>
<h2>Two prices, two sagas</h2>
<p>Braze <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001676238/000119312521322227/d40379ds1a.htm">targeted</a> a $55 to $60 per-share IPO price range. It sold stock at $65 per share. In valuation terms, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/88338/Customer-engagement-platform-Braze-sets-terms-for-$460-million-IPO">Renaissance Capital estimated</a> that at the midpoint of its range ($57.5 per share), the company would be worth $5.9 billion on a fully diluted basis. That gives the company an estimated valuation at $65 per share of $6.7 billion</p>
<p>UserTesting <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001557127/000162828021022100/usertestingincs-1a2.htm">targeted</a> a $15 to $17 per-share IPO price range. It sold stock at $14 per share. In valuation terms, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/88336/Usability-testing-platform-UserTesting-sets-terms-for-$227-million-IPO">Renaissance Capital estimated</a> that at midpoint of its range ($16 per share), the company would be worth $2.7 billion. That gives the company an estimated valuation at $14 per share of $2.4 billion.</p>
<p>Never cry for a company that goes out at a valuation of over a billion dollars. But, still, why the divergence? Here are their growth rates, with a bit more time under the belt for UserTesting because we have more recent data from it given a quirk in how Braze handles its fiscal calendar. (The Braze data compares the six months concluding July 31 of 2020 and 2021.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Braze YoY growth Q1-Q2 2020 v. 2021: 52.5%</li>
<li>UserTesting YoY growth Q1-Q3 2020 v. 2021: 45.4%</li>
</ul>
<p>Those figures are closer than I anticipated, frankly, and therefore do not answer our question.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Historically, the main actors in venture capital have been a specialized set of tech investors who themselves came from the technology industry. They understood it well because they were the ones who built foundational technologies or sold hardware, software and systems into businesses.</p>
<p>And so, generally, the people who invested in tech companies â the traditional venture investors â could tap their extended talent networks and apply their knowledge to bring talented people into startups, or at least coach the founders on how to select the right talent to scale and grow.</p>
<p>To be a good venture capitalist, you must understand what we call âventure risks.â What are the technology risks? What are the market risks? What are the people risks? What are the execution risks that remain? How do we manage hypergrowth when it happens?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235118" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Almost all the returns in venture occur when you have a company with lightning in a bottle. And then if that does happen, can the founders, investors and extended talent network bring it all together in such a way thatâll spur growth and achieve the kind of outlier successes that account for most of the returns in venture capital?</p>
<p>But over the past few years, the momentum for the sources of capital has swung dramatically from these traditional, specialized venture investors to a much more diverse universe of investors. These new venture investors are deploying a lot of capital, believing that they will be able to generate outsized returns. And in some cases, they have had early success, at least with returns on paper.</p>
<p>That said, unlike the traditional venture investors who stayed close to their investments through a stake in the company, a seat on the board and other special terms, these new, nontraditional investors are, for the most part, playing an asset deployment game.</p>
<p>These investors are working under the assumption that the founders, or the existing early investors in the company combined with the founders, should have all the skills and resources it takes to build the company to its full potential. The new entrants are therefore bringing only money to the table with the hope that it can punch through all the remaining problems the company faces and things will work out.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So, where does this put you &#8212; the startup founder, entrepreneur or company executive?</p>
<h2>Itâs a great time to be a founder</h2>
<p>If youâre committed to building an enduring company and you want to, as Steve Jobs put it, âmake a dent in the universe,â then this is the best time ever to be a founder. Weâre currently living in a capital-surplus environment, which means that there are many options available to you and almost every interesting idea is getting its due. Thatâs an ideal situation from a founder perspective, and the possibilities are intoxicating.</p>
<p>If youâre a founder whoâs trying to decide whether to pursue venture capital or nontraditional investors, ask yourself these questions: What do you need at your stage of development? Have you punched through all the possible failure modes? What risks remain in the business? Given that perspective, how much money should you raise and at what valuation?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a founder and you are completely confident you know everything needed to build a durable company, and all you need from investors is money, then taking money from an asset manager may be the right path for you.</p>
<p>But if you understand there are risks that happen in the lifetime of a company &#8212; things that can go wrong that money alone wonât solve &#8212; then pairing up with a venture investor who knows your business might be the best approach. A pure asset play can buy you a little bit more time, but fundamentally you need to have talent in the management team, and a VC firm can help you there.</p>
<p>If you believe youâve punched through all the risks and points of failure, then just take the money at the highest possible valuation and be happy. Why waste your time with people who want to take board seats and more? If, however, you still have a lot of risks to work through, a lot of building left to be done and lots of scenarios to play out, then I would be thoughtful about how much money you take from whom, and at what valuation.</p>
<p>People experienced in venture help diagnose and make sure you donât fall through the inevitable trap doors.</p>
<p>As I explain in my book, â<a href="https://anticipatefailure.com/">Anticipate Failure</a>,â there are many potential sources of failure, including people, product, technology, business model and more. Because while much has changed in the venture industry over the years, the fundamentals of business-building remain the same. And as long as there are founders who need more than just cash to ensure their startups succeed and grow, there will always be a place for the unique skills and networks that the best venture capital investors and firms bring to the table.</p>
<p>How many venture investors truly live up to their promise to add value is a separate discussion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seven-year-old venture firm <a href="https://www.fortross.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fort Ross Ventures</a> just raised its fourth fund. The firm focuses on fintech, cloud technologies, AI/machine learning, business process automation services, edtech, foodtech and tech enabled businesses. The firm has also made a number of SaaS enterprise investments. To date, the firm has mostly invested in Israeli and U.S. companies, but that is about to change.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have raised over 200 [million USD],&#8221; Victor Orlovski, founder and managing partner at Fort Ross Ventures,Â told me. &#8220;We keep raising, and we aim to raise at least 300 [million], which is absolutely doable. Our typical check size is between 10 and 30 million; I think the average is around 20. We haven&#8217;t yet made any investments in Europe. We have just started building our European presence, and that is the reason I moved to Europe for a short while.&#8221;</p>
<p>The firm is planning to continue its core investment strategy with around 60% of its deals in the U.S., 20-30% of investments in Israel, and the remaining in the U.K. and broader Europe. Orlovski told me the firm leads about a third of the deals it participates in, and partners with other venture firms on the remaining investments. The fundâs ongoing investment priorities include fintech, cloud technologies, AI/machine learning, business process automation services, edtech, food tech and tech-enabled businesses. As a general rule, the company focuses on backing companies that have raised at least $50 million in equity capital and are valued at $500 million or more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235057" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are operating four funds. Our first fund got some really exciting results &#8212; something like 50% IRR cash to cash &#8212; $7 on each dollar invested. The company that brought the entire return on that fund is eToro,&#8221; Orlovski said, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/trading-platform-etoro-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-10b-deal/">referring to the $10 billion SPAC merger we covered earlier this year</a>. &#8220;We raised our second fund in 2018, which was a $250 million fund. We subsequently closed two more funds. One fund we are operating from is an early-stage fund for SEA founders.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the first close for the fourth fund, Fort Ross Venturesâ Late-Stage Fund has deployed its first check, investing in <a href="https://www.ladderlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ladder</a>, the digital life insurance company. The company offers flexible term coverage in minutes. As Ingrid covered here on TechCrunch, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/ladder-raises-100m-on-a-900m-valuation-for-a-platform-selling-flexible-term-life-insurance/">recently announced its $100 million Series D</a>. At the time, it didn&#8217;t disclose the other investors in the round.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that Ladder is a great company, and we are bullish on them. They are one of the leaders in a life insurance business,&#8221; said Orlovski. &#8220;We have chosen this company out of many companies we looked at in fintech worlds &#8212; we are quite bullish on the insurance sector overall. We are targeting companies which want to go global early in their lifetime. We are helping companies to build their relationship and presence in the SEA region, and also helping companies to grab a lot of talent out of the SEA region.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it was announced back in late-September, Amazon mentioned an end of year release date for the Echo Show 15. Looks like the company will be hitting that window. Heck, you could even say it hit a holiday release, depending on which holidays you happen to celebrate. The massive wall-mounted smart screen is officially up for presale starting today, and is set to start shipping December 9.</p>
<p>The product differentiates itself from the army of smart displays by being big. Really big. Like almost cartoonishly so. Itâs built around a 15.6-inch 1080p screen and designed to be mounted to a wall, like a large digital picture frame. The $250 device features Visual ID, a new facial recognition feature (also arriving on the Astro robot) that delivers a custom content experience by identifying the user standing in front of it.</p>
<p>The massive amount of screen real estate means, naturally, that you can fit a lot on the thing at once, including feeds for smart home products like security cameras and doorbells, coupled with various widgets that let the screen serve up calendar events, to-do items and the like. The system can also be used as a big kitchen TV, streaming services like Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu and Sling TV.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235206" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Countertop stands and cabinet mounts are sold separately.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand grocery platform Instacart is rolling out new safety features for its delivery workers. The company has launched a new &#8220;Shopper Safety Alert&#8221; feature that will notify its delivery providers of local critical incidents. The feature leverages law enforcement, social media and local news to create automated alerts.</p>
<p>Instacart delivery workers who are within the area of an incident will see the alert in the Shopper app so they can assess the situation and potentially avoid the area. If a delivery worker is in the middle of an order, the app will automatically pause the order. Instacart says it will assess incidents and may pause operations altogether in specific regions if they pose a risk to its workers.</p>
<p>The company is also enhancing its in-app emergency calling feature that launched in May 2020. The feature allows delivery workers to contact emergency services directly within the app. The company has now partnered with emergency response data platform RapidSOS to give Instacart delivery workers the ability to share their geolocation and other information for faster emergency response. The feature is currently available in the U.S. and Canada. It&#8217;s worth noting that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/doordash-rolls-out-safedash-an-in-app-security-toolkit-for-delivery-people-on-the-platform/">DoorDash recently partnered with ADT</a> to launch a similar feature that allows its delivery workers to seek emergency assistance.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235115" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2235217" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235217" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2235217" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Instacart-Shopper-Safety-Alerts.png" alt="" width="1024" height="686" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Instacart-Shopper-Safety-Alerts.png 1532w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Instacart-Shopper-Safety-Alerts.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Instacart-Shopper-Safety-Alerts.png?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Instacart-Shopper-Safety-Alerts.png?resize=768,514 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Instacart-Shopper-Safety-Alerts.png?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Instacart-Shopper-Safety-Alerts.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235217" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Instacart</p></div></p>
<p>Instacart has also launched new optional safety lessons that provide delivery workers with information on best practices regarding shopping, driving and delivering. The lessons include an overview of Instacartâs shopper and community guidelines and information on how to report an incident in the Shopper app.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s new safety features come a few days after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instacart-rolls-out-reduced-and-free-delivery-option-in-select-markets-deals-tab-and-more/">rolled out</a> a new delivery option, which will reduce or waive the delivery fee on orders placed more than 24 hours ahead of the scheduled delivery. It also introduced a new deals tab and a dollar store hub.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s clear that Instacart has been focused on enhancing its platform with new features, the company&#8217;s recent acquisitions also signal its plans to branch out into retail technology as well. Last month, Instacart <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/instacart-acquires-caper-ai-a-smart-cart-and-instant-checkout-startup-for-350m-as-it-moves-deeper-into-physical-retail-tech/">acquired Caper AI</a>, a smart cart and instant checkout startup, for $350 million, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/instacart-is-acquiring-catering-software-company-foodstorm/">Â FoodStorm</a>, a SaaS order management system (OMS), for an undisclosed amount.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Wednesday episode when we niche down to a single topic, looking to expand our understanding of one particular technology trend or another. This week, we spoke about iBuying, a business operation that makes money through flipping homes. Our central question, given Zillow&#8217;s departure from the business and Opendoor&#8217;s impressive earnings, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/zillow-ibuying-exit-opendoor-offerpad/">was if the iBuying model can work</a> &#8212; and who in the world is proving it?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235003" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zillow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/opendoor-open-for-business/">made a decision</a> to get out of the iBuying market, with huge costs hanging over its head and a grip of layoffs to manage. <a href="http://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> were curious what went wrong.</li>
</ul>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Y6XaU8WfNU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/opendoor-open-for-business/">Zillow may be pulling up the welcome mat, but rival Opendoor is expanding into new markets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zillow may be pulling up the welcome mat, but rival Opendoor is expanding into new markets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/opendoor-open-for-business/embed/#?secret=Y6XaU8WfNU" data-secret="Y6XaU8WfNU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<ul>
<li>So we brought along <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanlawler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan Lawler</a>, one of TechCrunch+&#8217;s reporting team, who has covered the space. Ryan helped us use Opendoor earnings as a comparison point &#8212; it turns out that the iBuying model <em>can</em> work, even if Zillow itself struggled with the model. (Opendoor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/a-quick-peek-into-opendoors-financial-results/">went public via a SPAC</a>, recall.)</li>
<li>We also talked about what the situation could mean for startups in the real estate market more broadly. It turns out that merely having data is not enough to make money in the housing space.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat announced earlier this year that it would add <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-brings-partner-centric-layers-to-its-social-map-used-by-250-million-people/">Layers</a> to Snap Map, making the social product more interactive. Today, the app is launching its first two layers: Memories and Explore.</p>
<p>The Snap Map has been used to show people where their friends are currently located (if they opt-in to location sharing), interesting places to visit, and what areas are most popular among Snapchatters. Now, the Memories layer will show you old Snapchats that you sent from particular places &#8212; so, if you browse your map and zoom in on Central Park, you might find a picture you took last year of a cute dog in the park. Memories are private and only available to the individual user &#8212; you can&#8217;t see friends&#8217; memories.</p>
<p>The Explore layer reimagines the heat map, which shows activity by relative volume on the Snap Map. You can tap on highlighted regions to see public photos and videos submitted by Snapchat users around the world.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235313" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2235662" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235662" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2235662" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Memories-Layer.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="345" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Memories-Layer.png 1694w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Memories-Layer.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Memories-Layer.png?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Memories-Layer.png?resize=768,390 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Memories-Layer.png?resize=680,345 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Memories-Layer.png?resize=1536,780 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Memories-Layer.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235662" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snapchat</p></div></p>
<p>These layers are designed to make it easier for users to find what they&#8217;re looking for, rather than crowding a ton of information into one map. Snap&#8217;s partners like Ticketmaster and The Infatuation are also developing layers, which would show users where nearby events are happening, or what restaurants are most popular among Snapchatters. The app also added a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/snapchat-adds-my-places-feature-to-snap-map-connecting-users-to-businesses/">My Places</a> feature this summer, which recommended users places to visit based on where they&#8217;ve been, where their friends have been and what places other Snapchat users visit most.</p>
<p>To access layers, users can navigate to the Snap Map and tap the button for a layers menu in the upper right corner of the map. Then, they can toggle between various layers to access what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>These features are available now for Snapchat users on iOS and Android.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SOSV, the venture capital firm known for its vertical-focused accelerators like HAX, is expanding its footprint to Bangladesh. SOSV&#8217;s Asia-focused accelerator called MOX, SBK Tech Ventures, an early-stage fund in Bangladesh, and Miaki, a Bangladesh-based digital services provider, are setting up the SMÂ² accelerator to invest in seed-stage startups in the country.</p>
<p>Bangladesh, with a nascent internet industry but an expanding online population, has emerged as an attractive destination for venture capitalists in recent years. Sequoia made its first deal in the country last year through Sequoia Capital India; it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/shopup-raises-22-5-million-to-digitize-millions-of-mom-and-pop-shops-in-bangladesh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> co-led a $22.5 million round in ShopUp</a>, a startup that helps mom and pop shops come online. Another notable deal has been grocery delivery service Chaldal&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/chaldal-bangladeshs-largest-grocery-delivery-platform-raises-10m-series-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $10 million raise</a> this year. Indonesian ride-sharing giant Go-Jek is an investor in its own counterpart for the country, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/27/bangladeshs-version-of-go-jek-raises-over-10m-in-a-round-led-by-go-jek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathao</a>.</p>
<p>SMÂ² injects around $100,000 into each startup through a convertible note, with room for follow-ons, TechCrunch learned from Sonia Bashir Kabir, founder of SBK. The accelerator has already picked three startups for its inaugural batch that is starting in November.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235532" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Funding for the accelerator comes from all three partners, while SBK will also provide on-the-ground support for the portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Like many investors around the world, SMÂ² recognizes how COVID-19 has accelerated people&#8217;s need for digital tools in their everyday life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology has always enabled people and companies to be more productive but post COVID the world witnessed how technology played an instrumental role in becoming the great equalizer,&#8221; said Kabir. &#8220;I am bullish about Bangladeshi tech startups which aim to solve problems of the masses.&#8221;</p>
