										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The art of pitching is perhaps the most important art that a founder learns on their journey to unicorn status and beyond. And like any art, it helps to get some critical feedback along the way from the judges on the other side of the table.</p>
<p>That’s why every Disrupt, we host Pitch Deck Teardown, a panel of VCs who read and critique several pitch decks in a row to offer feedback on everything from the overarching narrative and story to the mundane details of format, typography and colors.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 next week, I’m excited to be hosting Maren Bannon of January Ventures, Bling Capital’s Ben Ling and Vanessa Larco of NEA for our next iteration of this popular workshopping panel.</p>
<p>If you’re a founder and want to submit your deck for consideration, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6unxbSjKe2dVQxoDyNs95En1R3mzPc6I5D5Gdi7YhgDJPnA/viewform"><strong>head on over to this trusty Google Form</strong></a> and upload a copy of your pitch deck in PDF format. Remember that this will be presented publicly, so make sure it’s appropriate for a live studio audience. We’ll be selecting roughly six of them for inclusion in the event, and we’ll notify the founders selected by email.</p>
<p>Come join us next week! And if you need tickets to Disrupt, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=rightrail">we still have some available</a> for all the virtual excitement across two stages and dozens of fireside chats and panels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://fiberplane.dev">Fiberplane</a>, an Amsterdam-based early stage startup that is building collaborative notebooks for SREs (site reliability engineers)  to collaborate around an incident in a similar manner to group editing in a Google Doc, announced a ​​€ 7.5M (approximately $8.8 million USD) seed round today.</p>
<p>The round was co-led by Crane Venture Partners and Notion Capital with participation from Northzone, System.One and Basecase Capital.</p>
<p>Micha Hernandez van Leuffen (known as Mies) is founder and CEO at Fiberplane. When his previous startup, Werker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/17/developer-tools-startup-wrecker-has-been-acquired-by-oracle/">was sold to Oracle</a> in 2017, Hernandez van Leuffen became part of a much larger company where he saw people struggling to deal with outages (which happen at every company).</p>
<p>&#8220;We were always going back and forth between metrics, logs and traces, what I always call this sort of treasure hunt, and figuring out what was the underlying root cause of an outage or downtime,&#8221; Hernandez van Leuffen told me.</p>
<p>He said that this experience led to a couple of key insights about incident response: First, you needed a centralized place to pull all the incident data together, and secondly that as a distributed team managing a distributed system you needed to collaborate in real time, often across different time zones.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2j6uuBnH6n"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/31/how-you-react-when-your-systems-fail-may-define-your-business/">How you react when your systems fail may define your business</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How you react when your systems fail may define your business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/31/how-you-react-when-your-systems-fail-may-define-your-business/embed/#?secret=2j6uuBnH6n" data-secret="2j6uuBnH6n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When he left Oracle in August 2020, he began thinking about the idea of giving DevOps teams and SREs the same kind of group editing capabilities that other teams inside an organization have with tools like Google Docs or Notion and an idea for his new company began to take shape.</p>
<p>What he created with Fiberplane is a collaborative notebook for SRE&#8217;s to pull in the various data types and begin to work together to resolve the incident, while having a natural audit trail of what happened and how they resolved the issue. Different people can participate in this notebook, just as multiple people can edit a Google Doc, fulfilling that original vision.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203799" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203799" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2203799" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Fiberplane incident response notebook with various types of data about the incident." width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203799" class="wp-caption-text">Fiberplane collaborative notebook example with multiple people involved. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> Fiberplane</p></div></p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t plan to stop there though. The longer term vision is an operational platform for SREs and DevOps teams to deal with every aspect of an outage. &#8220;This is our starting point, but we are planning to expand from there as more I would say an SRE workbench, where you&#8217;re also able to command and control your infrastructure,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Today the company has 13 employees and is growing, and as they do, they are exploring ways to make sure they are building a diverse company, looking at concrete strategies to find more diverse candidates.</p>
<p>&#8220;To hire diversely, we’re re-examining our top of the funnel processes. Our efforts include posting our jobs in communities of underrepresented people, running our job descriptions through a gender decoder and facilitating a larger time frame for jobs to remain open,&#8221; Elena Boroda, marketing manager at Fiberplane said.</p>
<p>While Hernandez van Leuffen is based in Amsterdam, the company has been hiring people in the UK, Berlin, Copenhagen and the US, he said. The plan is to have Amsterdam as a central hub when offices reopen as the majority of employees are located there.</p>

More than 10,000 people will attend to learn about the latest tech and investment trends from iconic leaders, founders and VCs. They’ll network and connect to build game-changing startups.</p>
<p><strong>Time to get on board:</strong> It costs less than $100 to attend TechCrunch Disrupt until this Monday. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">Purchase your pass</a> now to save yourself some money. You can check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">the Disrupt agenda</a> here and then go grab your ticket.</p>
<p>The heart of every Disrupt — even our virtual incarnations — is Startup Alley. It’s where hundreds of innovative startups exhibit their products, platforms and services. It’s where investors look for portfolio potential, founders find new customers, tech journalists hunt for stories, and everyone finds inspiration.</p>
<p>We’ve created a special series of events to focus on the wide range of talent in Startup Alley. It’s the Startup Alley Crawl — think pub crawl without the remorse. We group exhibitors in Startup Alley by business category, and each business category will have its own dedicated, hour-long crawl.</p>
<p>You might even see some of these exhibitors interviewed live during a Disrupt Desk segment. Sit back in the comfort of your secure, undisclosed location and tune in to learn more about what these companies have to offer.</p>
<p>All Startup Alley exhibitors have their own virtual booth where you can check out their pitch deck, strike up a conversation, schedule a product demo or connect with them via CrunchMatch to set up 1:1 video meetings.</p>
<p>Here’s what Jessica McLean, the director of marketing and communications for Infinite-Compute, a Startup Alley exhibitor at Disrupt 2020, had to say about networking during a virtual conference.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>“The virtual platform made networking easy. We sent quick introductions, scheduled meetings with investors and other smart people who could add value to our company. A person we connected with at Disrupt is currently helping us with marketing, which is fantastic.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">APIs are the grease turning the gears and wheels for many organizations&#8217; IT systems today, but as APIs grow in number and use, tracking how they work (or don&#8217;t work) together can become complex and potentially critical if something goes awry. Now, a startup that has built an innovative way to help with this is announcing some funding after getting traction with big enterprises adopting its approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://tyk.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyk</a>, which has built a way for users to access and manage multiple internal enterprise APIs through a universal interface by way of GraphQL, has picked up $35 million, an investment that it will be using both for hiring and to continue enhancing and expanding the tools that it provides to users. Tyk has coined a term describing its approach to managing APIs and the data they produce &#8212; &#8220;<a href="https://tyk.io/docs/universal-data-graph/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universal data graph</a>&#8221; &#8212; and today its tools are being used to manage APIs by some 10,000 businesses, including large enterprises like Starbucks, Societe Generale, and Domino’s.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sep.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s4">Scottish Equity Partners</span></a> led the round, with participation also from <a href="https://mmc.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MMC Ventures</a> &#8212; its sole previous investor from a round in 2019 after boostrapping for its first five years. The startup is based out of London but works in a very distributed way &#8212; one of the co-founders is living in New Zealand currently &#8212; and it will be hiring and growing based on that principle, too. It has raised just over $40 million to date.</p>
<p>Tyk (pronounced like &#8220;tyke&#8221;, meaning small/lively child) got its start as an open source side project first for co-founder Martin Buhr, who is now the company&#8217;s CEO, while he was working elsewhere, as a &#8220;load testing thing,&#8221; in his words.</p>
<p>The shifts in IT towards service-oriented architectures, and building and using APIs to connect internal apps, led him to rethink the code and consider how it could be used to control APIs. Added to that was the fact that as far as Buhr could see, the API management platforms that were in the market at the time &#8212; some of the big names today include Kong, Apigee (now a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/08/google-will-acquire-apigee-for-625-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of Google</a>), 3scale (now a <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-acquire-api-management-leader-3scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of RedHat</a> and thus IBM), MuleSoft (now a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/salesforce-is-buying-mulesoft-at-enterprise-value-of-6-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of Salesforce</a>) &#8212; were not as flexible as his needs were. &#8220;So I built my own,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It was built as an open source tool, and some engineers at other companies started to use it. As it got more attention, some of the bigger companies interested in using it started to ask why he wasn&#8217;t charging for anything &#8212; a sure sign as any that there was probably a business to be built here, and more credibility to come if he charged for the it.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we made the gateway open source, and the management part went into a licensing model,&#8221; he said. And Tyk was born as a startup co-founded with James Hirst, who is now the COO, who worked with Buhr at a digital agency some years before.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The key motivation behind building Tyk has stayed as its unique selling point for customers working in increasingly complex environments.</p>
<p>&#8220;What sparked interest in Tyk was that companies were unhappy with API management as it exists today,&#8221; Buhr noted, citing architectures using multiple clouds and multiple containers, creating more complexity that needed better management. &#8220;It was just the right time when containerization, Kubernetes and microservices were on the rise&#8230; The way we approach the multi-data and multi-vendor cloud model is super flexible and resilient to partitions, in a way that others have not been able to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You engage developers and deliver real value and it’s up to them to make the choice,&#8221; added Hirst. &#8220;We are responding to a clear shift in the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the next frontiers that Tyk will tackle will be what happens within the management layer, specifically when there are potential conflicts with APIs.</p>
<p class="p9">&#8220;When a team using a microservice makes a breaking change, we want to bring that up and report that to the system,&#8221; Buhr said. &#8220;The plan is to flag the issue and test against it, and be able to say that a schema won&#8217;t work, and to identify why.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even before that is rolled out, though, Tyk&#8217;s customer list and its grow speak to a business on the cusp of a lot more.</p>
<p>“Martin and James have built a world-class team and the addition of this new capital will enable Tyk to accelerate the growth of its API management platform, particularly around the GraphQL focused Universal Data Graph product that launched earlier this year,&#8221; said Martin Brennan, a director at SEP, in a statement. &#8220;We are pleased to be supporting the team to achieve their global ambitions.”</p>
<p>Keith Davidson, a partner at SEP, is joining the Tyk board as a non-executive director with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Tuesday, Tiger Global led not one but two big funding rounds, announcing its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/logistics-robotics-startup-ambi-raises-26m/">role in a $26 million Series A for Ambi</a> and an additional <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/locus-robotics-just-raised-another-50m/">$50 million for Locus Robotics</a>. The firm has been so active in investing of late, that neither one of these companies cracked Alex’s coveted “Today’s Tiger round” in our daily newsletter (that honor went to a $150 million round for Indonesian fintech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/indonesian-fintech-xendit-is-now-a-unicorn-with-150m-in-fresh-funding-led-by-tiger-global/">Xendit</a>).</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that Tiger is bullish about robotics as a category. Other rounds in recent months include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/rapid-robotics-raises-another-36-7m/">$36.7 million for Rapid Robotics</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/path-robotics-raises-another-100m/">$100 million for Path</a> &#8212; both Series B. All of the rounds are head-turning in the robotics world, and they represent a broad scope under the larger robotics umbrella. Ambi and Locus both operate (though address different problems) in the logistics/fulfillment spaces, while Path and Rapid deal with construction and manufacturing, respectively.</p>

<p>Certainly that last bit speaks to how diversified interest has been in the category. All of the above industries no doubt saw enough impact during the pandemic to significantly accelerate interest in automation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114223" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114223" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2114223" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114223" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Locus Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>It’s also telling that the warehouse/fulfillment side of things gets a bit of extra love. In addition to the general strains of the pandemic, there’s the fact that everyone is looking for a way to compete with Amazon. The retailer already has a massive stranglehold on these categories and gave itself a big head start in terms of automation through a series of acquisitions. It’s an industry where any competitive advantage means a lot, and companies like Locus are hoping to crack that code.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In February, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/locus-robotics-has-raised-a-150m-series-e/">company raised a hefty $150 million</a>, with Tiger on as co-lead. And this week, the firm returned with another $50 million. Locus’ approach to the category offers more flexibility than those companies that require a kind of ground-up rebuild. It’s an appealing option in terms of pricing and time frame, and makes a lot more sense for organizations looking for seasonable robotic help &#8212; ditto for the company’s robotics-as-a-service pricing model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Way back in 2015 we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/16/atmotube-is-a-tiny-pollution-sensor-that-clears-up-whats-in-the-air-you-breathe/">covered</a> the launch of the Atmotube, a small, innovative, portable air quality monitor which went on to receive a number of awards, post its CES debut.</p>
<p>Since rebranding as <a href="https://atmotube.com">ATMO</a>, the company, co-founded by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/vera-kozyr">Vera Kozyr</a>, is now launching the <a href="https://atmotube.com/pages/atmocube">Atmocube</a>, an indoor air quality monitoring system for businesses and enterprises. This new product is positioned far more for the Post-COVID era, where air quality inside offices is going to be vital, and this time, instead of being small and portable (although that earlier product is still sold), the Atmocube will be prominent and visible in order to give office workers peace of mind that their air quality is good.</p>
<p>The key to this is measuring CO2 levels which the Atmocube displays on its screen along with other metrics.</p>
<p>The device has up to 14 sensors measuring various environmental parameters such as CO2, formaldehyde NO2, PM1 (small airborne particles), PM2.5, ozone, and others, and other environmental parameters such as relative humidity, temperature, atmospheric pressure, ambient noise, light levels, and color temperature.</p>
<p>The company says this new device also calculates the Airborne Virus Transmission Score — based on the levels of particulate matter, humidity, and CO2, and says it comes up with a “score” that estimates the probability of transferring virus diseases in closed spaces. Obviously, that’s probably something that would need independent testing to verify, but it is the case that the WHO <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted">advises</a> that COVID-19 can be transmitted in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings.</p>
<p>Kozyr said: “Air pollution is dangerous because it can affect you and your health even if you don’t notice it. We aim to help people know what they’re breathing and make changes as a result. As businesses return to the office, they need a tool to make information about indoor air quality transparent and accessible to their employees. Most air quality monitors are designed to be hidden away, so we set out to create a device with a more transparent interface that would highlight HVAC performance safety and create trust between occupants and building owners”.</p>
<p>ATMO is by no means the only player in the space of course, as it’s joined by <a href="https://www.airthings.com/en/">AirThings</a>, <a href="https://uk.getawair.com/">Awair Omni</a> and <a href="https://www.kaiterra.com/en/index/">Kaiterra</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in 2018 we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/19/open-mineral-plans-to-disrupt-commodities-trading-with-blockchain/">covered</a> how <a href="https://openmineral.com/">Open Mineral</a> (OM), a startup aiming to leverage greater transparency in commodities trading, had raised $2.25 million. Well, they’ve come a long way and now the Zug, Switzerland-based, company has raised a $33 million Series C funding round led by <a href="https://www.mubadala.com/">Mubadala Investment Company</a>. Existing investors Xploration Capital and Emerald Technology Ventures were joined by new investors Statkraft and Lingfeng Capital.</p>
<p>The company says it will use the capital to solidify its physical supply chain merchant activities. The commodities trading market is worth $200 billion and even today there’s still a lot of paper flying around, so digitization is continuing apace.</p>
<p>Open Mineral says its platform has registered over 900 metals and mining companies across the world, using its pricing algorithms across the commodity supply chain. </p>
<p>As well as digitizing aspects of the industry, OM says it’s also working with third-party providers to incorporate ‘green’ ESG metrics across the sell-side and buy-side.</p>
<p>It also claims to have developed automated blending/smelter material optimization solutions “enabling more efficient, informed, and profitable trade of physical metal raw commodities.” These have an impact on transitioning to a lower carbon footprint, says the company,</p>
<p>Boris Eykher, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Open Mineral said in a statement: “The metal trading industry’s future is in digital data and analytics, enabling market participants to communicate faster and make quicker, and more data-driven decisions. Just as eBay revolutionized retail purchasing by bringing more choices to buyers and sellers, we aim to do the same for physical commodity producers in a curated, trusted environment of the Open Mineral platform.”</p>
<p>Faris Al Mazrui, Head of Russia and CIS Investments at Mubadala, said: “Open Mineral is disrupting the commodity trading business by leveraging data analytics technology. Buyers and sellers of base metal commodities can tap into a unique and proprietary data hub to trade more efficiently and capture upside.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Similar to how certain macroeconomic conditions have provided a long-term boost, a reversal of those conditions could do the opposite.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve spent so long staring at record venture capital results around the world from Q2 that it’s nearly Q3.</p>
<p>We’ve seen record results from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bostons-startup-market-is-more-than-setting-records-in-scorching-start-to-year/">cities</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">countries</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/the-european-vc-market-is-so-hot-it-may-skip-its-summer-holiday/">regions</a>. There’s so much money sloshing around the venture capital and startup worlds that it’s hard to recall what they were like in leaner times. We’ve been in a bull market for tech upstarts for so long that it feels like the only possible state of affairs.</p>
<p>It’s not.</p>
<p>Digging back through our notes from the last few months from data sources, investors, and founders, it’s clear that there are macroeconomic factors bolstering the startup economy. And there are changes to the economy that are providing additional lift. Secular tailwinds, if you will.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But as the market giveth, it can also taketh away.</p>
<p>What might slow the startup boom? Similar to how certain macroeconomic conditions have provided a long-term boost, a reversal of those conditions could do the opposite. The secular trends powering startups — often on the demand side due to more-rapid digitalization of global business — may be unconnected to the larger economy, a view underscored by software’s outsized performance during COVID-19 induced economic mess of mid-2020.</p>

Because no bull market lasts forever.</p>
<h2>Driving forces</h2>
<p>Prominent among the macroeconomic conditions that have helped startups’ fundraising totals rise are globally low interest rates. Money is cheap around the world at the moment.</p>
<p>It doesn’t cost much to borrow money today, compared to historical norms. The result of that dynamic is that lending money doesn’t earn as much either. Bank yields are negative in real terms, and bond yields aren’t impressive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.readmargins.com/p/zirp-explains-the-world">Money always skates towards yield</a>, so the low interest rate environment has led to lots of capital moving towards more lucrative investing options. This dynamic is partially responsible for the seemingly ever-rising stock market, for example. It’s also a partial explanation of why there is so much capital flowing into venture capital funds and other vehicles that push money into high-growth private companies. The money is looking for yield.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.avax.network">Avalanche</a>, a relatively new blockchain with a focus on speed and low transactions costs, has completed a $230 million private sale of AVAX tokens to some well known crypto funds. Polychain and Three Arrows Capital are leading the investment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.avalabs.org">Avalanche Foundation</a> completed the private sale back in June 2021 and is disclosing it today. Other participants in the private sale include R/Crypto Fund, Dragonfly, CMS Holdings, Collab+Currency and Lvna Capital.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the private sale will be used to support the Avalanche ecosystem, which is relatively nascent when you compare it to the Ethereum blockchain for instance. Among other things, the foundation plans to support DeFi (decentralized finance) projects as well as enterprise applications through grants, token purchases and other forms of investments.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://solana.com">Solana</a> and other newer blockchains, Avalanche wants to solve the scalability issues that older blockchains face. For instance, if you’ve recently tried to buy an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain, you probably paid $50 or $100 in transaction fees, or gas fees.</p>
<p>The Avalanche Foundation positions its blockchain as a solid alternative to Ethereum. You can run Dapps (decentralized apps) for a fraction of the costs with a much faster time-to-finality. Avalanche supports smart contracts, which is a key feature to enable DeFi projects.</p>
<p>Here’s what Avalanche’s official website says about its blockchain performance:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203737" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203737" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="668" class="size-full wp-image-2203737" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png 2434w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png?resize=768,501 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png?resize=680,444 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png?resize=1536,1002 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png?resize=2048,1336 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203737" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Avalanche</p></div></p>
<p>Having better performance is just part of the problem when you’re competing with Ethereum and other blockchains. Avalanche also needs to attract developers and build a strong developer community so that it becomes the infrastructure of other crypto projects.</p>
<p>That’s why Avalanche wants to make it as easy as possible to port your Ethereum Dapp to Avalanche. Avalanche’s smart contract chain executes Ethereum Virtual Machine contracts, which means that you can reuse part of your codebase if you’re already active on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Similarly, applications that query the Ethereum network can be adapted to support Avalanche by changing API endpoints and adding support for a new network. The Avalanche team has also been working on <a href="https://medium.com/avalancheavax/new-avalanche-bridge-builds-on-intel-sgx-technology-in-breakthrough-for-cross-chain-8f854e0e72e0">a bridge</a> to transfer Ethereum assets to the Avalanche blockchain. The equivalent of $1.3 billion in crypto assets have been transferred using this bridge.</p>
<p>Those are technical incentives. As for financial incentives, private sales and grants could help bootstrap developer interest. The Avalanche Foundation says that 225 projects currently support the platform, including popular crypto projects that already run on other blockchains, such as Tether, SushiSwap, Chainlink, Circle and The Graph. <a href="https://toppsnfts.com">Topps</a>, an NFT-based game with partnerships with the MLB and Bundesliga, is also using Avalanche.</p>
<p>Avalanche and its underlying token AVAX is currently the 14th cryptocurrency by total market capitalization according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com">CoinMarketCap</a>. With a current market cap of $13 billion, Avalanche is ahead of Algorand or Polygon, but behind Polkadot and Solana. Solana also suffered from a <a href="https://decrypt.co/80917/solana-down-for-hours-resource-exhaustion">major outage</a> earlier this week, raising questions about Solana&#8217;s ability to scale. It’s going to be interesting to see whether one of these blockchains can catch up with Ethereum or even surpass Ethereum in usage and value.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company’s technical assessment technology is a “flight simulator for developers,” that gives candidates a score based on a simulated evaluation of their skills.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In less than a year after raising <a href="https://codesignal.com/blog/codesignal-news/codesignal-announces-25m-series-b-funding/">$25 million in Series B funding</a>, technical assessment company <a href="https://codesignal.com/">CodeSignal</a> announced a $50 million in Series C funding to offer new features for its platform that helps companies make data-driven hiring decisions to find and test engineering talent.</p>
<p>Similar to attracting a big investor lead for its B round — Menlo Ventures — it has partnered with Index Ventures to lead the C round. Menlo participated again and was joined by Headline and A Capital. This round brings CodeSignal’s total fundraising to $87.5 million.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Tigran Sloyan got the idea for the company from an experience his co-founder and friend Aram Shatakhtsyan had while trying to find an engineering job. Both from Armenia, the two went in different paths for college, with Shatakhtsyan staying in Armenia and Sloyan coming to the U.S. to study at MIT. He then went on to work at Google.</p>
<p>“As companies were recruiting myself and my classmates, Aram was trying to get his resume picked up, but wasn’t getting attention because of where he went to college, even though he was the greatest programmer I had ever known,” Sloyan told TechCrunch. “Hiring talent is the No. 1 problem companies say they have, but here was the best engineer, and no one would bring him in.”</p>
<p>They, along with Sophia Baik, started CodeSignal in 2015 to act as a self-driving interview platform that directly measures skills regardless of a person’s background. Like people needing to take a driver’s test in order to get a license, Sloyan calls the company’s technical assessment technology a “flight simulator for developers,” that gives candidates a simulated evaluation of their skills and comes back with a score and highlighted strengths.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The need by companies to hire engineers has led to CodeSignal growing 3.5 times in revenue year over year and to gather a customer list that includes Brex, Databricks, Facebook, Instacart, Robinhood, Upwork and Zoom.</p>
<p>Sloyan said the company has not yet touched the money it received in its Series B, but wanted to jump at the opportunity to work with Nina Achadjian, partner at Index Ventures, whom he had known for many years since their time together at Google. To work together and for Achadjian to join the company’s board was something “I couldn’t pass up,” Sloyan said.</p>
<p>When Achadjian moved over to venture capital, she helped Sloyan connect to mentors and angel investors while keeping an eye on the company. Hiring engineers is “mission critical” for technology companies, but what became more obvious to her was that engineering functions have become necessary for all companies, Achadjian explained.</p>
<p>While performing due diligence on the space, she saw traditional engineering cultures utilizing CodeSignal, but then would also see nontraditional companies like banks and insurance companies.</p>
<p>“Their traction was undeniable, and many of our portfolio companies were using CodeSignal,” she added. “It is rare to see a company accelerate growth at the stage they are at.”</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Labor statistics estimate there is already a <a href="https://www.daxx.com/blog/development-trends/software-developer-shortage-us#The%20US%20Tech%20Talent%20Shortage%20Statistics%20in%202020">global talent labor shortage of 40 million workers</a>, and that number will grow to over 85 million by 2030. Achadjian says engineering jobs are also expected to increase during that time, and with all of those roles and applicants, vetting candidates will be more important than ever, as will the ability for candidates to apply from wherever they are.</p>
<p>The new funding enabled the company to launch its Integrated Development Environment for candidates to interact with relevant assessment experiences like codes, files and a terminal on a machine that is familiar with them, so that they can showcase their skills, while also being able to preview their application. At the same time, employers are able to assign each candidate the same coding task based on the open position.</p>
<p>In addition, Sloyan intends to triple the company’s headcount over the next couple of months and expand into other use cases for skills assessment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following entries into the newsletter market from tech companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/twitter-is-testing-a-feature-that-puts-users-revue-newsletters-on-their-profiles/">Twitter</a>, Google is now experimenting with newsletters, too. The company&#8217;s internal R&amp;D division, Area 120, has a new project called <a href="https://museletter.area120.google.com/">Museletter</a>, which allows anyone to publish a Google Drive file as a blog or newsletter to their Museletter public profile or to an email list.</p>
<p>The effort would essentially repurpose Google&#8217;s existing document-creation tools as a means of competing with other newsletter platforms, like Substack, Ghost, Revue, and others, which are today attracting a <a href="https://whatsnewinpublishing.com/one-of-the-most-important-tools-available-to-publishers-email-newsletters-are-resurging-says-reuters-institute/">growing</a> audience.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s experiment was spotted this week by sites including <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/14/google-area-120-museletter/">9to5Google</a> and <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/15/googles-latest-area-120-experiment-wants-to-help-you-start-a-newsletter/">Android Police</a>.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, an Area 120 spokesperson declined to share further details about Museletter, saying only that it was &#8220;one of the many experiments&#8221; within the R&amp;D group and that &#8220;it&#8217;s still very early.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the Museletter website, however, there is already much that can be learned about the project. The site explains how Google Drive could be monetized by creators in a way that would allow Google&#8217;s newsletter project to differentiate itself from the competition. Not only could newsletters be written in a Google Doc, other productivity apps could also be used to share information with readers. For example, a newsletter creator could offer a paid subscription plan that would allow readers to access their Google Slides. A creator who writes about finance could publish helpful spreadsheets to Google Sheets, which would be available to their subscribers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203725" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203725" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2203725" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/museletter2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203725" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>To make this possible, Museletter publishers would create a public profile on their Google Drive, then publish any Google Drive file directly to it. This provides them with a landing page where they can market their subscriptions and showcase how many different Drive files they&#8217;ve made publically available across Docs, Sheets, and Slides.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Creators can also optionally publish to an email list &#8212; including a list brought in from other platforms. The newsletter subscriptions can be free or paid, depending on the creator&#8217;s preferences, but using Museletter itself will be free. Instead, the project aims to monetize with premium features like custom domains, welcome emails, and more.</p>
<p>The platform also promises tools and analytics to engage audiences and track the newsletter&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>While the site doesn&#8217;t mention any plans for advertising, a success in this space could provide Google with a new<a href="https://thefix.media/2021/04/06/newsletters-help-grow-subscriptions-generate-ad-revenue-and-gear-up-for-a-cookie-less-world/"> ad revenue</a> stream &#8212; and one that arrives at a time when the tech giant&#8217;s multi-billion dollar advertising market has a new challenger in the form of Amazon, whose own ad business could <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90631969/amazon-ad-business-growth">eventually challenge</a> the Facebook-Google duopoly.</p>
<p>Google didn&#8217;t say when it plans to launch Museletter, but the website is offering <a href="https://museletter.area120.google.com/signup">a link to a form</a> where users can request early access.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ftc/">FTC</a>) has warned apps and devices that collect personal health information must notify consumers if their data is breached or shared with third parties without their permission.</p>
<p>In a 3-2 vote on Wednesday, the FTC agreed on a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/ftc-warns-health-apps-connected-device-companies-comply-health">new policy statement</a> to clarify a decade-old 2009 Health Breach Notification Rule, which requires companies handling health records to notify consumers if their data is accessed without permission, such as the result of a breach. This has now been extended to apply to health apps and devices — specifically calling out apps that track fertility data, fitness, and blood glucose — which “too often fail to invest in adequate privacy and data security,” according to FTC chair Lina Khan.</p>
<p>“Digital apps are routinely caught playing fast and loose with user data, leaving users&#8217; sensitive health information susceptible to hacks and breaches,&#8221; said Khan in a statement, pointing to a study published this year in the British Medical Journal that found health apps suffer from “serious problems” ranging from the insecure transmission of user data to the unauthorized sharing of data with advertisers.</p>
<p>There have also been a number of recent high-profile breaches involving health apps in recent years. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/babylon-health/">Babylon Health</a>, a U.K. AI chatbot and telehealth startup, last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/babylon-health-admits-software-error-led-to-patient-data-breach/">suffered a data breach</a> after a “software error” allowed users to access other patients’ video consultations, while period tracking app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/flo-gets-ftc-slap-for-sharing-user-data-when-it-promised-privacy/">Flo was recently found to be sharing users’ health data</a> with third-party analytics and marketing services.</p>
<p>Under the new rule, any company offering health apps or connected fitness devices that collect personal health data must notify consumers if their data has been compromised. However, the rule doesn&#8217;t define a &#8220;data breach&#8221; as just a cybersecurity intrusion; unauthorized access to personal data, including the sharing of information without an individual&#8217;s permission, can also trigger notification obligations.</p>
<p>&#8220;While this rule imposes some measure of accountability on tech firms that abuse our personal information, a more fundamental problem is the commodification of sensitive health information, where companies can use this data to feed behavioral ads or power user analytics,” Khan said.</p>
<p>If companies don&#8217;t comply with the rule, the FTC said it will &#8220;vigorously&#8221; enforce fines of $43,792 per violation per day.</p>
<p>The FTC has been cracking down on privacy violations in recent weeks. Earlier this month, the agency <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/spyfone-ftc-stalkerware/">unanimously voted to ban spyware maker SpyFone</a> and its chief executive Scott Zuckerman from the surveillance industry for harvesting mobile data on thousands of people and leaving it on the open internet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lucid Group, the all-electric automaker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/lucid-motors-strikes-spac-deal-to-go-public-with-24-billion-valuation/">slated to go public</a> this year, said Thursday that one variant of its upcoming luxury Air sedan has an EPA range of more than 520 miles. The official rating of the Lucid Air Dream Edition Range variant pushes Lucid past Tesla, a company that has long dominated in this category.</p>
<p>The official EPA range of the Lucid Air — and its many editions — have been expected to be as high or higher than some of Tesla&#8217;s models. This announcement not only gives Lucid bragging rights, it reveals a bit about the company&#8217;s strategy to offer a variety of versions of the Air sedan with prices ranging between $169,000 and $77,400.</p>
<p>Lucid initially planned to sell one version of Lucid Air Dream Edition, essentially its first and flagship model of the sedan. There are now two versions: the Lucid AirDream Edition Range, which has 520 miles of range when equipped with 19-inch tires and 933 horsepower, and the Lucid Air Dream Edition Performance, a more powerful version with 1,111 horsepower that can travel 471 miles on a single charge when equipped with 19-inch tires. The range on the Dream Edition Range drops to 481 and the Dream Edition Performance to 451 miles when the vehicles have 21 inch tires.</p>
<p>Lucid Group CTO and CEO Peter Rawlinson credits the range figure on a combination of its 900V battery and battery management system, smaller drive units and its electric drive train technology. Rawlinson noted that he believed this is a new record for any EV.</p>
<p>Lucid plans to produce and sell other variants of the Air, including a Grand Touring version that received a 516-mile EPA range rating. The Grand Touring variant has a starting price of $139,000, while the longest range Dream Edition has a base price of $169,000. The automaker plans to sell two other, less expensive versions: the Air Touring that starts at $95,000 and the Air Pure with a $77,400 base price.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SOSV this morning announced work on a $50 million HAX facility in Newark, New Jersey focused on growing industrial, healthcare and climate startups. The five-year development plan utilizes $25 million from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.</p>
<p>The facility is set to open in June of 2022, with an eye on early-stage U.S. companies working toward their seed round. SOSV notes that, while HAX&#8217;s earliest focus was on wearables, in more recent years, the accelerator has largely shifted to industrial and healthcare, which currently comprise 70- and 20% of its portfolio, respectively.</p>
<p>“Since 2015, HAX started investing in more industrial &amp; health startups and today make up 90% of our new investments,” HAX Partner Garrett Winther told TechCrunch. “These hard tech startups, at their earliest stages, tend to rely on more deep science R&amp;D, high precision prototyping, and only require one to two of their first product before raising funding. These companies also take up a lot of space, easily filling a room with their equipment and prototypes.”</p>
<p>Newark was chosen for myriad reasons, including proximity to New York City and universities like Princeton and Rutgers. It also, frankly, has more space than, say, Manhattan – which is a clear necessity for industrial startups. That’s a big part of the reason companies like AeroFarms and Bowery have looked toward to the area to host their massive vertical farming facilities.</p>
<p>The fact that the state was willing to put up around half the cost of the project likely didn’t hurt, either. New Jersey no doubt has a vested interest in welcoming hardware startups with open arms. It will be interesting to see what sort of incentives the local governments can offer to help keep them there to avoid the allure of nearby NYC.</p>
<p>“Growing New Jersey’s innovation economy both creates high-quality jobs today and generates opportunities for exponential returns in the future,” NJEDA CEO Tim Sullivan said in a release. “As startups become successful and scale-up in New Jersey, they build buildings, hire more employees, and become anchors for vibrant communities and small-business supply-chains.”</p>
<p>SOSV says the Newark location will effectively operate as a U.S. equivalent to its offices in Shenzhen, China, which afford easy access to the global supply chain. HAX also operates satellites in San Francisco, Tokyo and New York.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">REvil is a solid choice for a villain’s name: R Evil. Revil. Evil and yet fun. I could imagine Black Widow, Hulk and Spider-Man teaming up to topple the leadership of REvil Incorporated.</p>
<p>The criminal gang using the name <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/fujifilm-becomes-the-latest-victim-of-a-network-crippling-ransomware-attack/">REvil may have enabled ransomware attacks</a> on thousands of small businesses worldwide this summer — but the ransomware problem is bigger than REvil, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-big-ransomware-threat-just-disappeared-now-another-one-has-jumped-up-to-fill-the-gap/">LockBit</a> or <a href="https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/2fb2081fc86c334c9155bb205141404f911383a0?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxbusiness.com%2Ftechnology%2Finfamous-darkside-ransomware-reborn-new-cyber-threat&amp;userId=4761224&amp;signature=a4710d264bc941e5">DarkSide</a>. REvil has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57826851">disappeared</a> from the internet, but the ransomware problem persists.</p>
<p>REvil is a symptom, not the cause. I advise Tony Stark and his fellow Avengers to look past any one criminal organization — because there is no evil mastermind. Ransomware is just the latest in the 50,000-year evolution of petty criminals discovering get-rich-quick schemes.</p>
<p>The massive boom in the number of ransomware occurrences arises from the lack of centralized control. More than <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sonicwall-record-304-7-million-ransomware-attacks-eclipse-2020-global-total-in-just-6-months-301343916.html">304 million</a> ransomware attacks hit global businesses last year, with costs surpassing <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/issues/ransomware-attacks?utm_source=GNOM&amp;utm_medium=PressRelease&amp;utm_code=sfzmdz&amp;utm_campaign=1543286+-+Ransomware+Attacks+up+10%2c000+Percent+in+Late+2020&amp;utm_exec=jamu273prd">$178,000 per event</a>. Technology has created a market where countless petty criminals can make good money fast. The best way to fight this kind of threat is with a market-based approach.</p>
<p>The spike in global ransomware attacks reflects a massive “dumbing down” of criminal activity. People looking to make an illicit buck have many more options available to them today than they did even two years ago. Without technical chops, people can steal your data, hold it for ransom and coerce you to pay to get it back. Law enforcement has not yet responded to combat this form of cybercrime, and large, sophisticated criminal networks have likewise not yet figured out how to control the encroaching upstarts.</p>
<p>The spike in ransomware attacks is attributable to the “as a service” economy. In this case, we’re talking about RaaS, or ransomware as a service. This works because each task in the ransomware chain benefits from the improved sophistication enabled by the division of labor and specialization.</p>
<p>Someone finds a vulnerable target. Someone provides bulletproof infrastructure outside of the jurisdiction of responsible law enforcement. Someone provides the malicious code. The players all come together without knowing each other&#8217;s names. No need to meet in person as Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange because the ability to coordinate tasks has become simple. The rapid pace of technological innovation created a decentralized market, enabling amateurs to engage in high-dollar crimes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There’s a gig economy for the underworld just like there is for the legal business world. I’ve built two successful software companies, even though I’m an economist. I use open source software and rent infrastructure via cloud technologies. I operated my first software company for six years before I sought outside capital, and I used that money for marketing and sales more than technology.</p>
<p>This tech advancement is both good and bad. The global economy did better than expected during a global pandemic because technology enabled many people to work from anywhere.</p>
<p>But the illicit markets of crime also benefited. REvil provided a service — a piece of a larger network — and earned a share of proceeds from ransomware attacks committed by others — like Jeff Bezos and Amazon get a share of my company’s revenues for the services they provide to me.</p>
<p>To fight ransomware attacks, appreciate the economics — the markets that enable ransomware — and change the market dynamics. Specifically, do three things:</p>
<h2>1. Analyze the market like a business executive</h2>
<p>Any competitive business thinks about what’s allowing competitors to succeed and how they can outcompete. The person behind a ransomware strike is an entrepreneur or a worker in a firm engaged in cybercrime, so start with good business analytics using data and smart business questions.</p>
<p>Can the crypto technologies that enable the crime also be used to enable entity resolution and deny anonymity/pseudonymity? Can technology undermine a criminal’s ability to recruit, coordinate or move, store and spend the proceeds from criminal activities?</p>
<h2>2. Define victory in market terms</h2>
<p>Doing the analytics to understand competing firms allows one to more clearly see the market for ransomware. Eliminating one “firm” often creates a power vacuum that will be filled by another, provided the market remains the same.</p>
<p>REvil disappeared, but ransomware attacks persist. Victory in market terms means creating markets in which criminals choose not to engage in the activity in the first place. The goal is not to catch criminals, but to deter the crime. Victory against ransomware happens when arrests drop because attempted attacks drop to near zero.</p>
<h2>3. Combat RaaS as an entrepreneur in a competitive market</h2>
<p>To prevent ransomware is to fight against criminal entrepreneurs, so the task requires one to think and fight crime like an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Crime-fighting entrepreneurs require collaboration — networks of government officials, banking professionals and technologists in the private sector across the globe must come together.</p>
<p>Through artificial intelligence and machine learning, the capability to securely share data, information and knowledge while preserving privacy exists. The tools of crime become the tools to combat crime.</p>
<p>No evil mastermind sits in their lair laughing at the chaos inflicted on the economy. Instead, growing numbers of amateurs are finding ways to make money quickly. Tackling the ransomware industry requires the same coordinated focus on the market that enabled amateurs to enter cybercrime in the first place. Iron Man would certainly agree.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During the darkest hours of the pandemic, millions upon millions of people turned to online gaming as a way to pass time in lockdown and connect with friends they couldn&#8217;t see in person. But a social, cooperative, fun <em>and</em> cross-platform gaming experience is remarkably hard to find — and Elodie Games is here to change that.</p>
<p>Elodie&#8217;s co-founders, Christina Norman and David Banks, are gaming industry vets who both worked on global hit League of Legends at Riot Games. The pair — also partners — left in 2019 to form their own company, announcing their intention in 2020 to build games focusing on co-op, crossplay, and &#8220;endlessly engaging experiences,&#8221; which suggests more open-ended, sandbox play.</p>
<p>The team already numbers 30 (and they&#8217;re hiring), and the game they&#8217;re working on is still something of a mystery; the images on its site are just general ideas, nothing from development. But what they showed behind closed doors was clearly enough to secure a $32.5 million Series A from Galaxy Interactive and a16z, with Brian Cho of Patron and Chris Ovitz from Electric Ant participating as well. The company last raised $5M in 2020 to get the ball rolling and clearly they&#8217;ve put that money to good use.</p>
<p>Norman explained that the main idea is to remove the barriers many gamers have come to accept as inevitable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;At the simplest level, we’re designing our game so players have these great experiences more easily, and more frequently,&#8221; she told TechCrunch. &#8220;This starts with removing friction that stops you from playing with friends in the first place. Most social multiplayer gamers are segmented by platform, time investment, purchases or skill in a way that limits who you can play with, and how you can play with them. While there are examples of how to overcome these limitations individually (Among Us is doing some great stuff for example) progress overall here has been slow and we are excited to speed it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly I can speak personally to even the slightest amount of friction stopping a nascent play session in its tracks as one person had to update their app or OS, or another couldn&#8217;t get the lobby to load, an Android-iOS conflict emerged, and so on. We ended up playing the rather poor games built into video chat apps simply because they worked every time. Even then it depended on the feel of the gathering, and being able to decide collectively what sounds like fun is another aspect of the Elodie ambition.</p>
<p>Making a game cross-platform isn&#8217;t as difficult as it used to be thanks to shared architectures like Unreal and Unity, but it&#8217;s still no cake walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, modern engine tech helps immensely with making cross-play possible, but it doesn’t make it fun. Traditional approaches to cross-platform development are slow, expensive and repetitive,&#8221; said Banks. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we are building Elodie’s development practices to achieve exceptional cross-play and focusing on what we call the true cross-play experience from day one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True&#8221; cross-play, one presumes, is a step above the elementary &#8220;Xbox players can play with PC players,&#8221; to the point where the game is actually equally desirable to play on platform. Whether that can really be achieved is a matter of debate, but the proof of the pudding is in the taste, so we&#8217;ll find out when Elodie puts its game out into the wild.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GoPro today announced a new flagship action camera for its lineup, the <a href="https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero10-black/CHDHX-101-master.html">HERO10 Black</a>. The main update for the camera is a brand new processor inside, called the GP2, which enables big improvements to image quality and video captures, including recording at 5.3K revolution at up to 60 frames per second, 4K video capture bumped to a max of 120 FPS, and 2.7K video at 240 FPS which enables awesome slow-mo capabilities.</p>
<p>The new HERO10 Black also offers better still images, with 23.6 megapixel captures, and better performance in low light. That improved low-light capture applies to video, too, with 3D noise reduction applied so that even nighttime scenes have a lot less grain. The improved processing capabilities of the GP2 chip also mean that using the GoPro interface and software on the camera is generally much snappier, too.</p>
<p>Another new feature made possible by the improved processor is the 4.0 version of HyperSmooth, which is GoPro&#8217;s tech for offering gimbal-like stabilization via software. HyperSmooth was already impressive, and based on our initial testing (a full review will follow soon), it&#8217;s fantastic on this new generation of camera. HERO10 also packs an upgraded horizon levelling system, which locks the horizon even when the camera is tilted up to 45 degrees in either direction.</p>

<p>The GoPro HERO10 includes a front-facing screen as well as a rear touch screen, with better frame rates on the front selfie screen. The new lens cover has a hydrophobic treatment to improve its ability to get wet and shed water, and it works with the existing Media Mod, Display Mod and Light Mod for GoPro cameras. It works as a webcam out of the box, has fast-charging support, and now offers wired content transfers to your smartphone or device in addition to cloud uploading and wireless transfer.</p>
<p>Also returning is GoPro&#8217;s SuperView lens, which offers an even wider angle capture, and which will be available in new 5.3K 30/25/24 FPS capture modes when a firmware update arrives on November 16. That will also delivers support for GoPro&#8217;s Max Lens Mods, as well as the following additional capture modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>5K 4:3 24fps</li>
<li>4K 4:3 30/25/24fps</li>
<li>5.3K 24fps</li>
<li>1080 24fps</li>
</ul>
<p>GoPro&#8217;s HERO10 is available now, priced at $399.98 with a bundled one-year GoPro subscription or for existing subscribers, or you&#8217;ll pay $499.99 without the recurring sub, which will cost $49.99 annually or $4.99 per month after the trial. There&#8217;s a HERO10 Black bundle that includes a Shorty tripod mount, a magnetic swivel clip, an additional battery and a 32GB microSD card for $549 without subscription, or $449 with one. GoPro subscribers can also upgrade to the bundle from their existing camera for a further discounted $399.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company will continue to offer both the GoPro HERO9 Black and the HERO8 Black alongside the HERO10, at lower price points, as well as its MAX 360 action camera.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Americans spend more than 90% of each day indoors on average. However, approximately 82% of American homeowners are more interested in renovating their outdoor living spaces than they were prior to the pandemic, based on a recent survey, Outer co-founder and CEO Jiake Liu told TechCrunch.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, about 54% of homeowners have made at least one home improvement in the backyard since the outbreak of COVID-19, while millennials, the largest house-buying group now, are willing to take less square feet inside, or even give up a bedroom, to get a little bit of outdoor space, Liu said.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 caused a “flight from density” across the U.S., meaning millions of Americans fled from big cities to suburbs to escape the coronavirus pandemic. This trend has led to more market opportunities in the outdoor entertainment industry. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A Santa Monica-based direct-to-consumers (D2C) outdoor furniture startup company, <a href="https://liveouter.com/">Outer</a>, announced today its $50 million Series B funding to help more people around the globe to bring their lives back outside. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The company was founded by CEO Liu and Chief Design Officer Terry Lin in 2019. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Series B round was led by Capital Today’s founder Kathy Xu, with participation from Tribe Capital, C Ventures and Upfront Ventures. Existing investors, including Sequoia Capital China, Mucker Capital, Mantis VC and Reimagined Ventures, also joined in the round.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This fundraising, which comes about eight months after Outer’s $10.5 million Series A round in January, brings its total funding to $65 million.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Minneapolis-based Yardbird raised $4.4 million for furniture made from recycled ocean-bound plastic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/minneapolis-based-yardbird-raised-4-4-million-for-furniture-made-from-recycled-ocean-bound-plastic/embed/#?secret=C9qlTvFJN2" data-secret="C9qlTvFJN2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The fresh funding will be used to cement its position in the outdoor living industry as they develop new sustainable materials, build an eco-friendly supply chain and expand their product offering and community, Liu said. Outer is currently hiring a variety of roles to enter global market this year and will announce a strategic international launch in October, Liu told TechCrunch.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We are working on new, eco-friendly fabrics, plastics and concrete to replace the industry standards that currently pollute our environment,” Liu said. The company’s effort in sustainable materials isn’t stopping at recycled plastics but working towards carbon neutrality, and has set its goal of becoming carbon negative in the future, he explained.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Since the beginning, the Outer team has insisted on prioritizing sustainability. Terry and his team have pioneered new fabrics and eco-friendly designs to ensure durability doesn’t come at the expense of environmental responsibility. The team is developing sustainable fabrics, plastics and concrete that will become the new industry gold standard,” said Capital Today’s founder Kathy Xu.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Its unique feature is its <a href="https://liveouter.com/showrooms">Neighborhood Showroom program</a>, allowing shoppers to visit the homes of nearby Outer customers to experience Outer products in more than 1,000 locations in 49 states as of today, which has grown from 50 locations in 13 states in 2019. Outer&#8217;s direct-to-consumers (D2C) business does not require middlemen like distributors, retailers or brick-and-mortar showrooms.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The global furniture market was approximately $17.8 billion in 2018 and is projected to grow to $26.6 billion 2027, Liu said. The U.S. outdoor living market is estimated at $33.4 billion in 2021, based on <a href="https://www.freedoniagroup.com/Outdoor-Living.html">a report by Freedonia</a>.</p>
<p>Outer recently launched the <a href="https://liveouter.com/explore/teak">Teak Collection</a>, <a href="https://liveouter.com/explore/aluminum">Aluminum Collection</a> and <a href="https://liveouter.com/explore/bug-shield-blankets">Bug Shield Blankets</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Outdoor products have long been an afterthought and their poor design has been a serious barrier to time spent outside. Outer’s thoughtful and sustainable products are already changing the way consumers interact with their outdoor spaces,” Xu said, adding that Outer is tackling real consumer problems, from dirty, wet outdoor cushions to pesky mosquito bites, with its solutions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Jiake and his team have taken a product-focused approach to establish Outer as a go-to premium furniture brand &#8212; driving rapid growth and attractive unit economics,” said Tribe Capital partner Sri Pangulur.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.mynd.co"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mynd</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that aims to make it easier for people to buy and manage single-family rental properties, announced today it has raised $57.3 million in funding from QED Investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing values the Oakland, California-based company at $807 million, and brings the company’s total raised to $174.9 million since its 2016 inception. Invesco Real Estate led its previous round, a $40 million raise, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/invesco-backs-mynd-to-spend-5-billion-on-single-family-rentals">committed $5 billion</a> to purchase and rent 20,000 single-family homes through Mynd over the next three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doug Brien and Colin Wiel started Mynd with the goal of making real estate investing more accessible. The pair has built a platform for investors to find, finance, purchase and manage single-family rental properties &#8212; 100% remotely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t outsource to partners. We do that all in-house,” Brien told TechCrunch. “We remove the geographical barriers to real estate investment, making it possible to invest in 25 cities from anywhere in the country &#8212; all from the comfort of home through our desktop interface and/or mobile apps.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Mynd manages over 9,000 rental units <a href="https://www.mynd.co/about-us#:~:text=Mynd%20Property%20Management%20provides%20full,San%20Antonio%2C%20Houston%20and%20Tampa.">in 25 markets</a> across the country. The startup plans to expand to 15 additional markets over the next three years including, Indianapolis, Indiana and Memphis, Tennessee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mynd’s tech product is complemented by &#8220;boots on the ground&#8221; people in local markets, improving the speed and clarity of communications that the company can provide to Mynd residents, Brien said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Plus it provides total visibility and transparency for our owners around the health of their investments,” he said “Unlike other companies we have our own purpose-built system called OTTO. It’s almost like a ‘Snowflake meets Zendesk’ &#8212; but custom-built for real estate investing and property management.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203492" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203492" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2203492 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mynd.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="403" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mynd.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mynd.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mynd.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mynd.jpg?resize=768,455 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mynd.jpg?resize=680,403 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mynd.jpg?resize=1536,911 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mynd.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203492" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mynd</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Mynd added 1,846 homes to the platform. This year, it’s on track to add roughly 8,500 across both retail and institutional — enough to nearly double the total homes managed by Mynd year over year, according to Brien. Invesco is its largest institutional client. On the retail side of its business, it has roughly 4,000 investors using Mynd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that investing in the single-family residential asset class is the best path for building long-term, generational wealth,” he told TechCrunch. “Mynd is committed to democratizing real estate &#8212; making it accessible to a whole new crop of investors who were previously too intimidated and/or were constrained by geography.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic underscored the urgency of what the company was building, he said, as people sought more space to live and work. Renting also became more common as more people wanted increased flexibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mynd plans to use its new capital to continue upgrading its digital platform, which it says is powered by “an extensive proprietary data set.” It also plans to enhance its automated workflow engine, underwriting, mobile applications and omnichannel communications. The startup also plans to keep hiring and expanding into new markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently, Mynd has 568 employees, up from 366 a year ago today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QED partner Chuckie Reddy said the Mynd team was “one of the best” his firm had seen in the single-family rental market with a “purpose-built” tech stack designed specifically for such properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have a customized offering that is superior to anything else on the market today,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, QED believes the single-family rental asset class is one of the fastest-growing in the country, “because of how big the housing market is, the need and desire for the product and the tremendous amount of capital formation we have seen since the last financial crisis,” according to Reddy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is a shortage of quality, affordable single-family rental housing, and Mynd has technology to manage this asset class,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.self.inc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self Financial,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a fintech company that aims to help consumers build credit and savings at the same time, announced today it has raised $50 million in Series E funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altos Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led the financing, which also included participation from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meritech Capital</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conductive Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and brings the Austin-based startup’s total raised to $127 million since its 2015 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, as many fintechs these days, aims to make building credit and savings more accessible, regardless of a person&#8217;s financial history. It requires no hard credit check to get started. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been focused on delivering high-quality, low-cost products that help with mainstream credit access,” said Self founder and CEO James Garvey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Self Financial has 200 employees, up from about 80 at the beginning of this year. The startup, which was initially founded in California but relocated to Austin after participating in the Techstars program in the city, plans to do more hiring with its new capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garvey declined to reveal hard revenue figures, saying only that Self is going to do “nine figures” of revenue this year, about 2x compared to 2020. Self’s active customer base has more than doubled in the past 12 months to about 1 million today. Over time, it has served more than 2 million customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech&#8217;s flagship product, he said, is basically secured installment loans, or small-dollar loans with a deposit account that has a CD (certificate of deposit) connected to it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After using that product successfully customers can then get access to Self’s Visa credit card.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203473" style="width: 396px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203473" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2203473 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Self-1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="386" height="309" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Self-1.jpg 597w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Self-1.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Self-1.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Self-1.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203473" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Self Financial</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self’s Credit Builder products are issued via its three bank partners. But the company has built its own proprietary core technology platform that Garvey says “powers everything behind the scenes.” The company&#8217;s products are available via iOS and Android, as well as through a desktop application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning this month, Self will allow people </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ho hold an H-1B or L 1 work visa or student visa to open Credit Builder accounts, a move Garvey said “opens the door for more people to participate who are new to the U.S. credit system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe everyone should have the opportunity to improve their financial future,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of Self’s longer-term goals include entering the insurance market, as well as the planned launch of another product designed to help give its customers access to credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Credit score is used for a lot of things, and in many states it’s an important factor in determining the cost of auto insurance,” he said. “We’re going to be helping our customers to get access to auto insurance as one of the benefits of a higher credit score.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to hire about 50 to 100 people over the next 12 months, Garvey said. Recently it named Kathleen Leonik to serve as its chief compliance officer. She has previously held leadership positions at Juniper Bank, Barclaycard and, most recently, Mercury Financial. She also worked in compliance at First USA, Bank One and Chase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altos Ventures Managing Director Anthony Lee described Self as a pioneer in the increasingly crowded space. This week, TomoCredit, which has the similar goal of helping underrepresented consumers build a credit history, announced it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/kapor-capital-square-co-founder-sam-wen-back-tomocredit-in-its-10m-series-a-funding-round/">raised $10 million</a>. And last week, Varo Bank &#8212; the first  U.S. neobank to be granted a national bank charter &#8212; raised a massive $510 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/varo-bank-raises-510m-at-a-2-5b-valuation/">a Series E funding round</a> at a $2.5 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“James and his team at Self have had a clear mission from day one: to build credit and savings for millions of Americans who are marginalized by the mainstream financial system,” said Lee. “It’s a mission that is going to take decades to realize and we are happy to be there for the journey.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Silverton Partners’ Managing Director Morgan Flager, who participated in Self’s Series A-D rounds, Garvey’s passion has been key to its repeated investments in the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have a founder with a clear and noble vision for solving a critical problem this massive, it is hard to say no as an investor,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm was also drawn to Self’s mission to “lift up” subprime consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many of the offers that target subprime consumers are expensive and restrictive,” he said. “Self Financial is unique in that it intends to break this cycle, rather than just profit from it in a different way.”</span></p>
