										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If the pandemic achieved anything good, it was putting health front and center in the minds of the general public, elected officials, investors and innovators. Cityblock has been working on solutions for bringing together the healthcare industry and communities since long before now, but it raised a total of $372 million spanning December through March, so it&#8217;s definitely seeing the impact of the visibility of its mission in light of a worldwide healthcare crisis.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-maverick-ventures-and-cityblock-health?ref=f959abde89a4">June 30 at noon PT/3PM ET</a>, Cityblock co-founder and CEO Iyah Romm will join us for an episode of Extra Crunch Live, along with Cityblock investor and Maverick Ventures managing partner Ambar Bhattacharyya. We&#8217;ll talk about the process of fundraising for this critical area in urgent need of innovation, and what it&#8217;s like trying to manage that process when the business you&#8217;re in is experiencing one of its busiest and most fraught times ever. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-maverick-ventures-and-cityblock-health?ref=f959abde89a4">Register here for free</a>.</p>
<p>Romm and Bhattacharyya will also be providing live feedback to participants in our weekly Extra Crunch Live pitch-off, which you can apply to join live during the event.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But we&#8217;ve talked about Cityblock a bit, let&#8217;s take a step back and look at our guests.</p>
<p>Iyah Romm co-founded Cityblock in 2017 and has been its chief executive ever since. Before that, he was entrepreneur in residence at Sidewalk Labs, from which Cityblock spun out. He has a long history in public health and private care, including as Chief Transformation Officer at Commonwealth Care Alliance, and stint at the Health Policy Commission and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>Bhattacharyya has spent more than a decade in VC, including at Bessemer and Bain as well as in his current role at Maverick Ventures. His track record includes investments in companies that have had a total of 11 exists via IPO and acquisition, including four public market unicorns. His specific focus has been on early and growth stage healthcare companies, so it&#8217;s a space he knows very well.</p>
<p>Maverick participated in Cityblock&#8217;s Series A, as well as its Series B and both the C and C extension rounds from this past year.</p>
<p>The episode goes down at noon PT/3pm ET on June 30 and is free to all who want to check it out live. On-demand access to the content is reserved for Extra Crunch members only. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-maverick-ventures-and-cityblock-health?ref=f959abde89a4">Register to come hang out with us here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Listen up, all you budget-conscious early-stage founders. That sound you hear is the countdown clock for serious savings to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=5reasonspost&amp;display=true">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing &amp; Fundraising</a> on July 8-9. You have just two days left to score early-bird savings and keep $100 in your wallet. Want loads of opportunity for less money? Beat the deadline and <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#tickets">register here</a> before Friday, June 11 at 11:59 p.m. (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>We’ve packed this two-day virtual event with more than a dozen (and counting) presentations by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#3e01330b-4bf1-4206-b038-769db50898a0">leading startup experts</a> holding forth on a range of topics every startup founder needs to master — or at least understand enough to outsource wisely. We’re talking essentials like product-market fit, paid marketing strategies and, every founder’s favorite topic, fundraising.</p>
<p>But this isn’t a one-way situation. Nope, these are highly interactive sessions, and you’ll have plenty of time to get answers to your most pressing questions. Check <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">the event agenda</a> and start planning your schedule.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s just a taste of the topics on tap.</p>
<p><strong>How to Line Up Your Growth with Your Goals:</strong> Unlike giant brands, startups need to use their marketing spend wisely and efficiently. Sound Ventures’ Susan Su is a growth marketing expert and will share how to define growth based on your startup’s goals, and how to take a framework-based approach to growth, rather than relying on old playbooks that aren’t relevant.</p>
<p><strong>How to Navigate the Ever-Changing World of Early-Stage VC:</strong> With over 25 personal investments, AngelList Venture CEO Avlok Kohli knows a thing or two about early-stage fundraising. At Early Stage, Kohli will explain the landscape of the early-stage fundraising market and how to take advantage of the changes in the VC world over the past year.</p>
<p><strong>Nail the Narrative:</strong> Storytelling is a critical skill for startups. Coatue Management partner Caryn Marooney, formerly head of comms for Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus, will share how to frame the narrative for a startup depending on the audience and ensure that when you’re talking about your company, people are not only listening, but they want to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Your pass includes access to video-on-demand. With VOD flexibility, you can watch sessions you missed and/or review sessions you attended to absorb the details on a cellular level.</p>
<p>Still on the fence? Here’s what Ashley Barrington, founder of MarketPearl, told us about her experience at Early Stage 2020:</p>
<blockquote><p>I recommend going to Early Stage. The virtual aspect helps in terms of scheduling, it offers community-building through networking, and it gives early-stage founders a framework for navigating the startup ecosystem. This is the stage where founders need more support, especially if they haven’t done this before.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New regulations are making it easier to invest in alternative assets via </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/gumroad-wants-to-make-equity-crowdfunding-mainstream/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crowdfunding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the recent explosion of crypto and NFTs means that investors are more diversified than ever. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping up with such a variety of investments may prove difficult to those who want to handle managing their investment portfolios </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/99percent-of-americans-dont-use-a-financial-advisor-heres-why.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on their own</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://www.moneyminx.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money Minx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new San Diego-based startup co-founded by husband and wife team Hussein and Jessica Yahfoufi, wants to help with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Money Minx aims to build a &#8220;Personal Finance OS&#8221; for every household. The platform is designed to help people track all of their investments &#8212; yes, including crypto and NFTs &#8212; in one place, in whatever currency. The company claims that its AI can also go a step further, and help people spot opportunities in their portfolio as well as catch potential risks.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We built Money Minx to help people cover all their bases, better understand their personal balance sheet and grow their net worth,” Hussein said. “No financial advisor needed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money Minx also aims to provide people with easy-to-use tools to create dashboards and reports. In its &#8220;soft launch&#8221; phase, the startup has been growing rapidly &#8212; from $15 million in assets tracked at the end of March to $107 million by mid-May. Its user base is growing by 40% month over month.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many founders do, Hussein says he and Jessica developed the platform to meet a need of their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We built this because we needed it as ‘do it yourself investors,’ said Hussein, who previously started crowdfunding site </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/03/appsplit-is-crowdfunding-for-apps/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appsplit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and works as a CTO at a San Diego-based fintech company. “I didn’t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">want to hire a financial advisor and spend 1% of my portfolio every year for them to tell me what to do. So I started to do it on my own on a spreadsheet and then started building this tool last year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hussein talked to other investors and realized that many were also managing their own finances and had also moved into investing outside the stock market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everyday investors are preferring to invest more in crowdfunding sites and </span><a href="https://www.preqin.com/insights/research/reports/alternatives-in-2021"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alternative assets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than the traditional stock market,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This shift has created a gap in the market for an easy way to track investments across multiple platforms, the Yahfoufis believe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money Minx operates as a SaaS business and charges a monthly subscription fee across three different plans ranging from $10 to $30 a month. Looking ahead, Hussein is considering building out a white-glove service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Money Minx has been approached by interested VCs, Hussein says the company prefers to stay bootstrapped &#8212; for now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, VCs are pouring money into the space. Just last week, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal finance startup Truebill announced it had raised </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/truebill-raises-45-million-for-its-personal-finance-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $45 million Series D funding round </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">led by Accel.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve ever bought a subscription inside an iOS app and later decided you wanted to cancel, upgrade or downgrade, or ask for a refund, you may have had trouble figuring out how to go about making that request or change. Some people today still believe that they can stop their subscription charges simply by deleting an app from their iPhone. Others may dig around unsuccessfully inside their iPhone&#8217;s Settings or on the App Store to try to find out how to ask for a refund. With the updates Apple announced in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/storekit/">StoreKit 2</a> during its Worldwide Developers Conference this week, things may start to get a little easier for app customers.</p>
<p>StoreKit is Apple&#8217;s developer framework for managing in-app purchases &#8212; an area that&#8217;s become more complex in recent years, as apps have transitioned from offering one-time purchases to ongoing subscriptions with different tiers, lengths, and feature sets.</p>

<p>Currently, users who want to manage or <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039">cancel subscriptions</a> can do so from the App Store or their iPhone Settings. But some don&#8217;t realize the path to this section from Settings starts by tapping on your Apple ID (your name and profile photo at the top of the screen). They may also get frustrated if they&#8217;re not familiar with how to navigate their Settings or the App Store.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are a <a href="https://www.imore.com/how-to-get-refund-itunes-app-store">variety of ways</a> users can request refunds on their in-app subscriptions. They can dig in their inbox for their receipt from Apple, then click the &#8220;Report a Problem&#8221; link it includes to request a refund when something went wrong. This could be useful in scenarios where you&#8217;ve bought a subscription by mistake (or your kid has!), or where the promised features didn&#8217;t work as intended.</p>
<p>Apple also<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084"> provides</a> a <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com/?s=6">dedicated website</a> where users can directly request refunds for apps or content. (When you Google for something like &#8220;request a refund apple&#8221; or similar queries, a page that explains the process typically comes up at the top of the search results.)</p>
<p>Still, many users aren&#8217;t technically savvy. For them, the easiest way to manage subscriptions or ask for refunds would be to do so from within the app itself. For this reason, many conscientious app developers tend to include links to point customers to Apple&#8217;s pages for subscription management or refunds inside their apps.</p>
<p>But StoreKit 2 is introducing new tools that will allow developers to implement these sort of features more easily.</p>
<p>One new tool is a Manage subscriptions API, which lets an app developer display the manage subscriptions page for their customer directly inside their app &#8212; without redirecting the customer to the App Store. Optionally, developers can choose to display a &#8220;Save Offer&#8221; screen to present the customer with a discount of some kind to keep them from cancelling, or it could display an exit survey so you can ask the customer why they decided to end their subscription.</p>
<p>When implemented, the customer will be able to view a screen inside the app that looks just like the one they&#8217;d visit in the App Store to cancel or change a subscription. After cancelling, they&#8217;ll be shown a confirmation screen with the cancellation details and the service expiration date.</p>
<p>If the customer wants to request a refund, a new Refund request API will allow the customer to begin their refund request directly in the app itself &#8212; again, without being redirected to the App Store or other website. On the screen that displays, the customer can select which item they want refund and check the reason why they&#8217;re making the request. Apple handles the refund process and will send either an approval or refund declined notification back to the developer&#8217;s server.</p>
<p>However, some developers argue that the changes don&#8217;t go far enough. They want to be in charge of managing customer subscriptions and handling refunds themselves, through programmatic means. Plus, Apple can <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210904">take up to 48 hours</a> for the customer to receive an update on their refund request, which can be confusing.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve made the process a bit smoother, but developers still can&#8217;t initiate refunds or cancellations themselves,&#8221; notes <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/">RevenueCat</a> CEO Jacob Eiting, whose company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/revenuecat-raises-40m-series-b-for-its-in-app-subscription-platform/">provides tools</a> to app developers to manage their in-app purchases. &#8220;It&#8217;s a step in the right direction, but could actually lead to more confusion between developers and consumers about who is responsible for issuing refunds.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, because the forms are now going to be more accessible from inside the app, the customer may believe the developer is handling the refund process when, really, Apple continues to do so.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">People could write in after uninstalling the app. Or have subscribed on a device they no longer have. There are so many cases that this ignores.</p>
<p>This is only a marginal improvement over opening the manage subscriptions URL.</p>
<p>&mdash; Jacob Eiting (@jeiting) <a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting/status/1402232229196140551?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Some developers pointed out that there are other scenarios this process doesn&#8217;t address. For example, if the customer has already uninstalled the app or no longer has the device in question, they&#8217;ll still need to be directed to other means of asking for refunds, just as before.</p>
<p>For consumers, though, subscription management tools like this mean more developers may begin to put buttons to manage subscriptions and ask for refunds directly inside their app, which is a better experience. In time, as customers learn they can more easily use the app and manage subscriptions, app developers may see better customer retention, higher engagement, and better App Store reviews, notes Apple.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The new additions to SwiftUI, been wanting Pull to Refresh and to improve accessibility. Then surprisingly StoreKit 2, especially for users requesting refunds and managaging subscriptions seamlessly (also great for Buffer).</p>
<p>&mdash; Andrew Yates (@ay8s) <a href="https://twitter.com/ay8s/status/1402263554514952213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The StoreKit 2 changes weren&#8217;t limited to APIs for managing subscriptions and refunds.</p>
<p>Developers will also gain access to a new Invoice Lookup API that allows them to look up the in-app purchases for the customer, validate their invoice and identify any problems with the purchase &#8212; for example, if there were any refunds already provided by the App Store.</p>
<p>A new Refunded Purchases API will allow developers to look up all the refunds for the customer.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sounds like StoreKit can validate receipts on device and allow users to request refunds. Didn’t have those on my bingo card but wow those are some nice quality-of-life updates!</p>
<p>&mdash; Conrad Stoll (@conradstoll) <a href="https://twitter.com/conradstoll/status/1402006616438820874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>And a new Renewal Extension API will allow developers to extend the renewal data for paid, active subscriptions in the case of an outage &#8212; like when dealing with customer support issues when a streaming service went down, for example. This API lets developers extend the subscription up to twice per calendar year, each up to 90 days in the future.</p>
<p>Another change will help customers when they reinstall apps or download them on new devices. Before, users would have to manually &#8220;restore purchases&#8221; to sync the status of the completed transactions back to that newly downloaded or reinstalled app. Now, that information will be automatically fetched by StoreKit 2 so the apps are immediately up-to-date with whatever it is the user paid for.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Very interesting changes to StoreKit. Apps will now be able to automatically restore and sync purchases, so users won&#39;t need to restore when the app is reinstalled or downloaded on a new device! <a href="https://t.co/WSs6L9rTvK">https://t.co/WSs6L9rTvK</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Marcos Tanaka (@mactanaka) <a href="https://twitter.com/mactanaka/status/1402328794430590985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>While, overall, the changes make for a significant update to the StoreKit framework, Apple&#8217;s hesitancy to allow developers more control over their own subscription-based customers speaks, in part, to how much it wants to control in-app purchases. This is perhaps because it got burned in the past when it tried allowing developers to manage their own refunds.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423410/apple-hulu-subscription-in-app-purchase-tweet">The Verge noted last month</a> while the Epic Games-Apple antitrust trial was underway, Apple had once provided Hulu will access to a subscription API, then discovered Hulu had been offering a way to automatically cancel subscriptions made through the App Store when customers wanted to upgrade to higher-priced subscription plans. Apple realized it needed to take action to protect against this misuse of the API, and Hulu later lost access. It has not since made that API more broadly available.</p>
<p>On the flip side, having Apple, not the developers, in charge of subscription management and refunds means Apple takes on the responsibilities around preventing fraud &#8212; including fraud perpetrated by both customers and developers alike. Customers may also prefer that there&#8217;s one single place to go for managing their subscription billing: Apple. They may not want to have to deal with each developer individually, as their experience would end up being inconsistent.</p>
<p>These changes matter because subscription revenue contributes to a sizable amount of Apple&#8217;s lucrative App Store business. Ahead of WWDC 21, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/apples-app-store-facilitated-643-billion-in-commerce-up-24-from-last-year/">reported</a> the sale of digital goods and services on the App Store grew to $86 billion in 2020, up 40% over the the year prior. Earlier this year, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/01/apple-services-entertain-inform-and-connect-the-world-in-unprecedented-year/">said it paid out more than $200 billion</a> to developers since the App Store launched in 2008.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As I’m typing this, I’ve just finished my second panel for our big <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">TC Sessions: Mobility event</a>. The write-ups will be ready in time for next week’s roundup, but a couple of things worth thinking about in the meantime.</p>
<p>The first is partnerships with big companies like Walmart. I get the sense that Walmart really loves to play the field when it comes to partnering with small tech startups. And honestly, why not, right?</p>
<p>There’s a lot of upside and relatively little downside. At the end of the day, a company like Walmart is looking for a competitive advantage against Amazon, the galactic emperor of competitive advantages. Amazon, of course, has invested a ton in robotics, including acquisitions and first-party development.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2069046" style="width: 826px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2069046" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2069046" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bossa-nova-veanne-cao.png" alt="bossa nova-robots veanne cao" width="816" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bossa-nova-veanne-cao.png 816w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bossa-nova-veanne-cao.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bossa-nova-veanne-cao.png?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bossa-nova-veanne-cao.png?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bossa-nova-veanne-cao.png?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bossa-nova-veanne-cao.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2069046" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Veanne Cao/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>For startups, there’s tremendous up and downside here. It’s hard not to see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/walmart-reportedly-ends-contract-with-inventory-robotics-startup-bossa-nova/">a company like Bossa Nova</a> as a kind of cautionary tale on that front. The promising inventory scanning startup took a massive hit when Walmart backed out of a deal the company had invested large resources into. It left Bossa Nova shaken, to say the least.</p>
<p>There’s no easy math on this one. When a company like Walmart knocks on your door with a big contract, you want to jump in with both feet. But how do you avoid putting all of your eggs in that one basket. When it comes to emerging tech, companies like Walmart like to play the field.</p>
<p>Another subject I’ve been thinking a lot about of late is whether universities are doing enough to foster innovation in their own backyard. There are plenty of good and bad examples of this, but as someone who writes about robots, I keep coming back to Carnegie Mellon. Other big robotics schools like MIT and Stanford haven’t had to concern themselves with talent drain, in large part due to location.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164169" style="width: 863px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164169" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2164169" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jahanian_853x480-min-1.jpeg" alt="" width="853" height="480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jahanian_853x480-min-1.jpeg 853w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jahanian_853x480-min-1.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jahanian_853x480-min-1.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jahanian_853x480-min-1.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jahanian_853x480-min-1.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jahanian_853x480-min-1.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164169" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Carnegie Mellon University</p></div></p>
<p>So, how does a school like CMU both help budding entrepreneurs transition from laboratory to startup and keep that talent in its own backyard? The good news is I’ll be able to take that question directly to the source. I’ll be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/carnegie-mellon-university-president-farnam-jahanian-is-speaking-at-techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburgh/">interviewing CMU President Farnam Jahanian</a> at TC’s upcoming virtual Pittsburgh event on June 29. Here&#8217;s a quote from Jahanian to whet your appetite:</p>
<blockquote><p>Carnegie Mellon’s decades-long leadership in research and education in AI and robotics has catalyzed an innovation ecosystem in the Pittsburgh region where entrepreneurship, creativity and placemaking intersect. These emerging technologies are changing the way we farm, enabling millions to learn a new language, leading the race to develop self-driving vehicles, and even going to the moon. We are committed to empowering citizens across Pittsburgh to take part in the economic benefits of these innovations as they continue to transform our world.</p></blockquote>

<p>As we head into summer, the investments in the category aren’t coming quite as fast and furiously as they were earlier in the year. But I have it on good authority that we’ll be seeing some more robotics funding announcements in the not too distant future. Of course, for all of the reasons I’ve alluded to before, the warehouse space continues to be hot. And this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/croatias-gideon-brothers-raises-31m-for-its-%E2%80%A83d-vision-enabled-autonomous-warehouse-robots/">a Croatian firm named Gideon Brothers</a> announced a $31 million raise. From a recent piece by Mike, here’s CEO Matija Kopić:</p>
<blockquote><p>The pandemic has greatly accelerated the adoption of smart automation, and we are ready to meet the unprecedented market demand. The best way to do it is by marrying our proprietary solutions with the largest, most demanding customers out there. Our strategic partners have real challenges that our robots are already solving, and, with us, they’re seizing the incredible opportunity right now to effect robotic-powered change to some of the world’s most innovative organizations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kopić and team should clearly all consider changing their last name to Gideon and doing a whole Ramones thing. Of course, they’re the ones who just raised $31 million, so maybe they’re doing something right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A mobile security startup has found seven security flaws in Samsung&#8217;s pre-installed mobile apps, which it says if abused could have allowed attackers broad access to a victim&#8217;s personal data.</p>
<p>Oversecured said the vulnerabilities were found in several apps and components bundled with Samsung phones and tablets. Oversecured founder Sergey Toshin told TechCrunch that the vulnerabilities were verified on a Samsung Galaxy S10+ but that all Samsung devices could be potentially affected because the baked-in apps are responsible for system functionality.</p>
<p>Toshin said the vulnerabilities could have allowed a malicious app on the same device to steal a victim&#8217;s photos, videos, contacts, call records and messages, and change settings &#8220;without any user consent or notice&#8221; by hijacking the permissions from Samsung&#8217;s stock apps.</p>
<p>One of the flaws could have allowed the theft of data by exploiting a vulnerability in Samsung&#8217;s Secure Folder app, which has a &#8220;large set&#8221; of rights across the device. In a proof-of-concept, Toshin showed the bug could be used to steal contacts data. Another bug in Samsung&#8217;s Knox security software could have been abused to install other malicious apps, while a bug in Samsung Dex could have been used to scrape data from user notifications from apps, email inboxes and messages.</p>
<p>Oversecured <a href="https://blog.oversecured.com/Two-weeks-of-securing-Samsung-devices-Part-1/">published technical details</a> of the vulnerabilities in a blog post, and said it reported the bugs to Samsung, which fixed the flaws.</p>
<p>Samsung confirmed the flaws affected &#8220;selected&#8221; Galaxy devices but would not provide a list of specific devices. &#8220;There have been no known reported issues globally and users should be assured that their sensitive information was not at risk,&#8221; but provided no evidence for this claim. &#8220;We addressed the potential vulnerability by developing and issuing security patches via software update in April and May, 2021 as soon as we identified this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup, which launched earlier this year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/oversecured-mobile-app-security-bug-bounty/">self-funding $1 million</a> in bug bounty payouts, uses automation to search for vulnerabilities in Android code. Toshin has found similar security flaws <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/tiktok-android-bugs-account-hijack/">in TikTok</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/android-bug-apps-data/">Android&#8217;s Google Play app</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When companies are considering buying a particular software service, they typically want to test it in their own environments, a process that can be surprisingly challenging. <a href="https://www.testbox.com/">TestBox</a>, a new startup, wants to change that by providing a fully working package with pre-populated data to give the team a way to test and collaborate on the product before making a buying decision.</p>
<p>Today the company announced it was making the product widely available and a $2.7 million seed round from SignalFire and Firstminute Capital along with several other investors and industry angels.</p>
<p>Company co-founder Sam Senior says he and his co-founder Peter Holland recognized that it was challenging for companies buying software to test it in a realistic way. &#8220;So TestBox is the very first time that companies are going to be able to test drive multiple pieces of enterprise software with an insanely easy-to-use live environment that&#8217;s uniquely configured to them with guided walk-throughs to make it really easy for them to get up to speed,&#8221; Senior explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that up until now, even with free versions or free testing periods, it was hard to test and collaborate in that kind of environment with key stakeholders in the company. TestBox comes pre-populated with data generated by GPT-3 OpenAI to test how the software behaves and lets participants grade different features on a simple star rating system and provide comments as needed. All the feedback is recorded in a &#8220;notebook,&#8221; giving the company a central place to gather all the data.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Freemium isn’t a trend &#8212; it’s the future of SaaS&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/freemium-isnt-a-trend-its-the-future-of-saas/embed/#?secret=74CIXg6nWM" data-secret="74CIXg6nWM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>What&#8217;s more, it puts the company buying the software more in control of the process instead of being driven by the vendor, which is typically the case. &#8220;Actually, now [the customer gets to] be the one who defines the experience, making them lead the process, while making it collaborative, and giving them more confidence [in their decision],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For now, the company plans to concentrate on customer support software and is working with Zendesk, Hubspot and Freshdesk, but has plans to expand and add additional partners over time. It has been talking with Salesforce about adding Service Cloud and hopes to have them in some form on the platform later this year. It also plans to expand into other verticals over time like CRM, Martech and IT help desks.</p>
<p>Senior is a former Bain consultant who worked with companies buying enterprise software, and saw the issues first-hand that they faced when it came to testing software before buying. He quit his job last summer, and began by talking to 70 customers, vendors and experts to get a real sense of what they were looking for in a solution.</p>
<p>He then teamed up with Holland and built the first version of the software before raising their seed money last October. The company began hiring in February and has 8 employees to this point, but he wants to keep it pretty lean through the early stage of the company&#8217;s development.</p>
<p>Even at this early stage, the company is already taking a diverse approach to hiring. &#8220;Already when we have been working with recruiting firms, we&#8217;ve been saying that they need to split the pipeline as much as they can, and that&#8217;s been something we have spent a long, long time on. [&#8230;] We spent actually six months with an open role on the front end because we are looking to build more diversity in our team as quickly as possible,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He reports that the company has a fairly equitable gender and ethnic split to this point, and holds monthly events to raise awareness internally about different groups, letting employees lead the way when it makes sense.</p>
<p>At least for now, he&#8217;s planning on running the company in a distributed manner, but acknowledges that as it gets bigger, he may have to look at having a centralized office as a home base, at least.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.infosum.com">InfoSum</a>, a startup which takes a federated approach to third party data enrichment, has launched a new product (called InfoSum Bridge) that it says significantly expands the customer identity linking capabilities of its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;InfoSum Bridge incorporates multiple identity providers across every identity type &#8212; both online and offline, in any technical framework &#8212; including deterministic, probabilistic, and cohort-level matches,&#8221; it writes in a press release.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also disclosing some early adopters of the product &#8212; naming data-for-ads and data-aggregator giants Merkle, MMA and Experian as dipping in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Idea being they can continue to enrich (first party) data by being able to make linkages, via InfoSum&#8217;s layer, with other &#8216;trusted partners&#8217; who may have gleaned more tidbits of info on those self-same users.</p>
<p>InfoSum says it has 50 enterprise customers using InfoSum Bridge at this point. The three companies it&#8217;s named in the release all play in the digital marketing space.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The 2016-founded startup (then called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/09/cognitivelogic-raises-3m-to-help-enterprises-pool-big-data-while-keeping-privacy-intact/">CognitiveLogic</a>) sells customers a promise of &#8216;privacy-safe&#8217; data enrichment run via a technical architecture that allows queries to be run &#8212; and insights gleaned &#8212; across multiple databases yet maintains each pot as a separate silo. This means the raw data isn&#8217;t being passed around between interested entities. </span></p>
<p>Why is that important? Third party data collection is drying up, after one (thousand) too many privacy scandals in recent years &#8212; combing with the legal risk attached to background trading of people&#8217;s data as a result of data protection regimes like Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>That puts the spotlight squarely on first party data. However businesses whose models have been dependent on access to big data about people &#8212; i.e. being able to make scores of connections by joining up information on people from different databases/sources (aka profiling) &#8212; are unlikely to be content with relying purely on what they&#8217;ve been able to learn by themselves.</p>
<p>This is where InfoSum comes in, billing itself as a &#8220;neutral data collaboration platform&#8221;.</p>
<p>Companies that may have been accustomed to getting their hands on lashings of personal data in years past, as a result of rampant, industry-wide third party data collection (via technologies like tracking cookies) combined with (<em>ehem</em>) lax data governance &#8212; are having to cast around for alternatives. And that appears to be stoking InfoSum&#8217;s growth.</p>
<p>And on the marketing front, remember, third party cookies are in the process of going away <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">as Google tightens that screw</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are growing faster than Slack (at equivalent stage e.g. Series A-&gt;B) because we are the one solution that is replacing the old way of doing things,&#8221; founder Nick Halstead tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Experian, Liveramp, Axciom, TransUnion, they all offer solutions to take your data. InfoSum is offering the equivalent of the &#8216;Cisco router for customer data&#8217; &#8212; we don&#8217;t own the data we are just selling boxes to make it all connect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The announcement today &#8212; &#8216;InfoSum Bridge&#8217; &#8212; is the next generation of building the ultimate network to &#8216;Bridge the industry chasm&#8217; it has right now of 100&#8217;s of competing ID&#8217;s, technical solutions and identity types, bringing a infrastructure approach,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>We took a deep dive into InfoSum&#8217;s first product <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/09/infosums-first-product-touts-decentralized-big-data-insights/">back in 2018 </a>&#8212; when it was just offering early adopters a glimpse of the &#8220;art of the possible&#8221;, as it put it then.</p>
<p>Three+ years on it&#8217;s touting a significantly expansion of its pipeline, having baked in support for multiple ID vendors/types, as well as adding probabilistic capabilities (to do matching on users where there is no ID).</p>
<p>Per a spokesman: &#8220;InfoSum Bridge is an extension of our existing and previous infrastructure. It enables a significant expansion of both our customer identity linking, and the limits of what is possible for data collaboration in a secure and privacy-focused manner. This is a combination of new product enhancements and announcement of partnerships. We’ve built capabilities to support across all ID vendors and types but also probabilistic and support for those publishers with unauthenticated audiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>InfoSum bills its platform as &#8220;the future of identity connectivity&#8221;. Although, as Halstead notes, there is now growing competition for that concept, as the adtech industry scrambles to build out alternative tracking systems and ID services ahead of Google crushing their cookies for good.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s essentially making a play to be the trusted, independent layer that can link them all.</p>
<p>Exactly what this technical wizardry means for Internet users&#8217; privacy is difficult to say. If, for example, it continues to enable manipulative microtargeting that&#8217;s hardly going to sum to progress.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cambridge Analytica&#8217;s Nix said it licensed &#8216;millions of data points&#8217; from Acxiom, Experian, Infogroup to target US voters&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/06/cambridge-analyticas-nix-said-it-licensed-millions-of-data-points-from-axciom-experian-infogroup-to-target-us-voters/embed/#?secret=9eFN3qN57n" data-secret="9eFN3qN57n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>InfoSum has previously told us its approach is designed to avoid individuals being linked and identified via the matching &#8212; with, for exmaple, limits placed on the bin sizes. Although its platform is also configurable (which puts privacy levers in its customers hands). Plus there could be edge cases where overlapped datasets result in a 100% match for an individual. So a lot is unclear.</p>
<p>The security story looks cleaner, though.</p>
<p>If the data is properly managed by InfoSum (and it touts &#8220;comprehensive independent audits&#8221;, as well as pointing to the decentralized architecture as an advantage) that&#8217;s a big improvement on &#8212; at least &#8212; one alternative scenario of whole databases being passed around between businesses which may be (to put it politely) disinterested in securing people&#8217;s data themselves.</p>
<p>InfoSum&#8217;s PR includes the three canned quotes (below) from the trio of marketing industry users it&#8217;s disclosing today.</p>
<p>All of whom sound very happy indeed that they&#8217;ve found a way to keep their &#8220;data-driven&#8221; marketing alive while simultaneously getting to claim it&#8217;s &#8220;privacy-safe&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">John Lee, Global Chief Strategy Officer, Merkle: &#8220;The conversation around identity is continuing to be top of mind for marketers across the industry, and as the landscape rapidly changes, it&#8217;s essential that brands have avenues to work together using first-party identity and data in a privacy-safe way. The InfoSum Bridge solution provides our clients and partners a way to collaborate using their first-party data, resolved to Merkury IDs and data, with even greater freedom and confidence than with traditional clean room or safe haven approaches.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lou Paskalis, Chairman, MMA Global Media and Data Board: “As marketers struggle to better leverage their first-party data in the transition from the cookie era to the consent era, I would have expected more innovative solutions to emerge.  One bright spot is InfoSum, which offers a proprietary technology to connect data, yet never share that data. This is the most customer-friendly and compliant technology that I’ve seen that enables marketers to fully realize the true potential of their first party data. What InfoSum has devised is an elegant way to respect consumers’ privacy choices while enabling marketers to realize the full benefit of their first party data.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Colin Grieves, Managing Director Experian: “At Experian we are committed to a culture of customer-centric data innovation, helping develop more meaningful and seamless connections between brands and their audiences. InfoSum Bridge gives us a scalable environment for secure, data connectivity and collaboration. Bridge is at the core of the Experian Match offering, which allows brands and publishers alike the ability to understand and engage the right consumers in the digital arena at scale, whilst safeguarding consumer data and privacy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thing is, clever technical architecture that enables big data fuelled modelling and profiling of people to continue, via pattern matching to identify &#8216;lookalike&#8217; customers who can (for example) be bucketed and targeted with ads, doesn&#8217;t actually sum to privacy as most people would understand it&#8230; But, for sure, impressive tech architecture guys.</p>
<p>The same issue attaches to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/">FloCs</a>, Google&#8217;s proposed replacement for tracking cookies &#8212; which also relies on federation (and which the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea">EFF</a> has branded a &#8220;terrible idea&#8221;, warning that such an approach actually risks <em>amplifying</em> predatory targeting).</p>
<p>The tenacity with which the marketing industry <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/">seeks to cling to microtargeting</a> does at least underline why rights-focused regulatory oversight of adtech is going to be essential if we&#8217;re to stamp out systematic societal horrors like ads that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/us-privacy-consumer-competition-and-civil-rights-groups-urge-ban-on-surveillance-advertising/">scale bias</a> by discriminating against protected groups, or the anti-democratic manipulation of voters that&#8217;s enabled by opaque targeting and hyper-targeted messaging, circumventing the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/legislators-from-ten-parliaments-put-the-squeeze-on-facebook/">necessary public scrutiny</a>.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: Privacy is not just important for the individual. It&#8217;s a collective good. And keeping that collective commons safe from those who would seek to exploit it &#8212; for a quick buck or worse &#8212; is going to require a whole other type of oversight architecture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investors placing capital in earlier and earlier tech deals has been a historical trend for the last few years, but this strategy was generally reserved for the traditional, &#8216;high-growth&#8217; VC arena. VCs needed to snag earlier ad earlier deals otherwise they would be diluted at a later stage. But with startups coming up with models which can book revenues faster, they have increasingly less need for the VC deal which typically leaves founders with less control and less equity than the newly-ensconced VC on their board. That said, capital at this early stage for &#8216;growth-based&#8217; startups was often hard to come by. Thus, the ‘early growth fund’ has been invented to address this issue.</p>
<p>Now, the latest arrival in this arena is Balderton, one of the Europe’s top VC funds, with may uicorns uder its belt.</p>
<p>Balderton has now launched a $680M ‘early growth’ fund to invest in high-potential tech companies, targeting around 15 companies at the early-growth stage, sector agostic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It plans to invest between $25m and $50m per company through both primary and secondary investments. The fund will be lead by Bernard Liautaud, David Thévenon, and Rana Yared.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2000, Balderton has raised $4bn to invest in European startups and backed more than 230 companies, primarily at the Series A stage. Its investments include Depop, GoCardless, Infarm, Revolut, THG, Vestiaire Collective, and Zego. The firm’s &#8216;Liquidity I&#8217; portfolio also includes Darktrace, Flywire, Graphcore, and Truecaller.</p>
<p>Bernard Liautaud, Managing Partner said: “I’ve been an investor at Balderton since 2008, and it has been incredible to see the increasing number of ambitious European founders, and to be able to support them financially through those critical first three to five years with our early stage funds. With this Growth Fund, we can now support them as they scale to become global industry leaders. We predict a $50 billion growth opportunity in Europe in the next three years alone, and we want to be the first choice for those ambitious founders.” </p>
<p>Rana Yared, General Partner, added: “Our approach for this fund will be ‘one of few’. This means personalised attention from the entire partnership, plus access to Balderton’s leading platform team. We’re looking for fifteen or so really exceptional companies that have the potential to be sector leaders and disrupt global industries.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[To catch up on this busy IPO week, Marqeta, Monday.com, Zeta Global and 1stDibs are on the docket. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re digging into the final IPO prices set by fintech unicorn Marqeta and enterprise productivity unicorn Monday.com this morning. Briefly, it&#8217;s good news.</p>
<p>A small programming note: The Exchange is off next week. I am taking some time to do nothing other than eat, read books and lose at lawn games. Regular service will resume the week after.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>To catch up on this busy IPO week, Marqeta, Monday.com and two other IPOs are on the docket. The final pair are Zeta Global and 1stDibs, debuts that matter, if a bit less so for our purposes than the others.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1995212" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We&#8217;ll unpack the final price of each, comparing it to its IPO valuation range and drawing a few conclusions about where we stand in the larger unicorn liquidity cycle.</p>
<p>This is familiar ground for us, but given the sheer flow of IPOs we cannot sit back and presume that our knowledge is current; things are happening with enough speed that regular revisions of our market views are key.</p>
<p>And we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/as-monday-com-targets-6b-ipo-valuation-zoom-and-salesforce-commit-150m/">may have been too conservative before</a>, so we have a bit of clean-up ahead of us.</p>
<h2>Strong pricing</h2>
<p>Why do we care about IPO pricing? After all, the DoorDash and Airbnb IPOs showed that the value at which a company opens life as a public entity can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">wildly differ</a> from where bankers estimated it should be valued.</p>
<p>Two quick things: First, IPO pricing sets the terms for the floating company&#8217;s fundraise; IPOs are fundraising events that often take the place of one last private round, so their price matters from a dilution perspective. And a lot of the hottest IPOs from the last six months have given back some of their early gains, making their official IPO price relevant.</p>
<p>DoorDash, for example, priced at $102 before soaring as high as $256 per share after its debut. Today, the company is worth $135.50 in pre-market trading. That&#8217;s a lot closer to its IPO price than we might have anticipated after watching its first days as a floating stock.</p>
<p>So, this stuff really does matter, and the numbers that we see below will help private companies price their next venture rounds. Furthermore, strong public market pricing could help keep alive the current game of wealthy private groups like Tiger hunting ever-earlier-stage startups with promising &#8212; if nascent &#8212; growth rates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo will be moving freight for a major customer of transportation logistics company J.B. Hunt Transport Services under what the two companies are calling a “test run” that will take place in one of the country’s busiest trade corridors.</p>
<p>Waymo Via, the company’s trucking and cargo transportation service, will transport goods along Interstate 45 between Houston and Fort Worth, Texas. The trucks will be powered by the Waymo Driver autonomous platform, though a Waymo “autonomous specialists,” a commercially-licensed truck driver and a software technician will be riding in each truck to monitor the operations.</p>
<p>This is not the first time J.B. Hunt and Waymo, an Alphabet subsidiary, have worked together. It seems the companies have been preparing for a trial deployment of autonomous trucks for some time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’ve also worked closely with J.B. Hunt for some time now on operational and market studies and will continue to do so as we roll out autonomous driving technology,” Waymo said in a blog post. “We’ve explored topics such as best practices for regular maintenance, what future facility layouts will look like, and which lanes are best suited for autonomous driving technology, to help ensure long-term preparedness on both sides.”</p>
<p>Waymo declined to share with TechCrunch the specific number of trucks that will be used for the test run, but a spokesperson said that it will be a limited duration pilot “with the goal of jointly developing a long term plan for how our companies can work together.”</p>
<p>Waymo Driver is a Level 4 platform, meaning that it could theoretically operate without a human safety driver behind the wheel, but only under certain conditions (like clear weather).</p>
<p>The autonomous driving company has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/daimler-trucks-partners-with-waymo-to-build-self-driving-semi-trucks/">partnered with Daimler Trucks</a> to equip Daimler freightliners with the Waymo Driver. That’s in addition to partnerships <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/waymo-volvo-partner-to-develop-electric-robotaxis/">with Volvo</a> to develop electric robotaxis, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/waymo-and-fiat-chrysler-expand-partnership-to-develop-self-driving-ram-vans/">Fiat Chrysler Automobiles</a> for autonomous cargo vans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fixed-term-funds (FTFs) have historically been a bank-to-bank market. FTF products allow for investing into some of the safest assets including, UK Government bonds, US Government bonds and highly-rated corporations. They allow holders of large amounts of cash (such as charities, private funds, family offices etc) to reduce and diversify their risk, but also increasing returns.</p>
<p>TreasurySpring is a fintech startup that is aiming to opening up access to this area of financial markets, by creating a Fixed-Term Fund platform. It&#8217;s now raised a $10 million Series A investment round co-led by MMC Ventures and Anthemis Group. Existing investors, including ETFS Capital, participated, taking the total its raised to $15 million.</p>
<p>TreasurySpring says its FTF platform gives holders of large cash balances online access to a menu of proprietary cash investments on a daily basis. This gives them access to an asset class that is usually only available to major financial institutions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2016 by Kevin Cook (CEO), Matthew Longhurst and James Skillen, Cook said in a statement: “Following a break-out 12 months in which we increased AUM by 10x, we wanted to bring in the best possible investment partners to support our ambitious growth plans. We have long admired both Anthemis Group and MMC, so I am delighted that they co-led the round and we are excited to work with Sean, Ollie and their respective teams, as we move into the next phase of our journey to redefine cash investment and front-office treasury.”</p>
<p>Given the current low and negative interest rates and an uncertain global financial outlook, TreasurySpring says its platform is likely to appeal as an alternative to traditional bank deposits and money market funds. It says it&#8217;s now issued more than $9B of FTFs to a client base which includes FTSE 100 and other listed companies, fund managers, large private companies, charities, and family offices.</p>
<p>Yann Ranchere, partner at Anthemis Group said: &#8220;With its ambitious and mission-driven team, TreaurySpring is opening the traditional money market industry to a whole new pool of participants.”</p>
<p>Oliver Richards, partner at MMC Ventures added: “Having worked with the team at TreasurySpring for the last two years, we have absolute confidence in their ability to deliver on their unique vision to level the playing field in cash investing and short-term funding, through a platform that not only brings value to its clients and issuers but also enhances the diversification and systemic stability of the money markets as a whole.”</p>
<p>Does TreasurySpring have any direct competitors? The compay sdays not. That said, bank deposits and money market funds are still the only tools available to most holders of large cash balances, so the banks and asset managers that offer these products are competitors, &#8220;to an extent&#8221; admits the firm. Howeverr, they are also &#8220;collaborators in many instances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cook said: &#8220;Adoption of the platform is being driven by a realisation that the risks and returns of the traditional [deposit and MMF] options are becoming ever less attractive, whilst building out the infrastructure to do anything else is complex, cumbersome, time consuming and expensive.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[RSA Security has spun out its fraud and risk intelligence business into a standalone company called Outseer that will double down on payment security tools amid an &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; rise in fraudulent transactions. Led by CEO Reed Taussig, who was appointed head of RSA&#8217;s Anti-Fraud Business Unit last year after previously serving as CEO of ThreatMetrix, [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/rsa-security/">RSA Security</a> has spun out its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fraud/">fraud</a> and risk intelligence business into a standalone company called Outseer that will double down on payment security tools amid an &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; rise in fraudulent transactions.</p>
<p>Led by CEO Reed Taussig, who was appointed head of RSA&#8217;s Anti-Fraud Business Unit last year after previously serving as CEO of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/threatmetrix/">ThreatMetrix</a>, the new company will focus solely on fraud detection and management and payments authentication services.</p>
<p>Outseer will continue to operate under the RSA umbrella and will inherit three core services, which are already used by more than 6,000 financial institutions, from the company: Outseer Fraud Manager (formerly RSA Adaptive Authentication), a risk-based account monitoring service; 3-D Secure (formerly Adaptive Authentication for eCommerce), a card-not-present and digital payment authentication mapping service; and FraudAction, which detects and takes down <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a> sites, dodgy apps and fraudulent social media pages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Outseer says its product portfolio is supported by deep investments in data and science, including a global network of verified fraud and transaction data, and a risk engine that the company claims delivers 95% fraud detection rates.</p>
<p>Commenting on the spinout, Taussig said: “Outseer is the culmination of decades of science-driven innovation in anti-fraud and payments authentication solutions. As the digital economy continues to deepen, the Outseer mission to liberate the world from transactional fraud is essential. Our role as a revenue enabler for the global economy will only strengthen as every digital business continues to scale.”</p>
<p>RSA, meanwhile, will continue to focus on integrated risk management and security products, including Archer for risk management, NetWitness for threat detection and response, and SecureID for identity and access management (IAM) capabilities.</p>
<p>The spinout comes less than a year after private equity firm Symphony Technology Group (STG), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fireeye-to-sell-products-unit-for-1-2b-to-symphony-led-group/">which recently bought FireEye’s product business for $1.2 billion</a>, acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/dell-sells-rsa-to-consortium-led-by-symphony-technology-group-for-over-2b/">RSA Security from Dell Technologies for more than $2 billion</a>. Dell had previously acquired RSA as part of its purchase of EMC in 2016.</p>
<p>It also comes amid a huge rise in online fraud fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Trade Commission said in March that more than 217,000 Americans had filed a coronavirus-related fraud report since January 2020, with losses to COVID-linked fraud totaling $382 million.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Similarly, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fielded 542,300 fraud complaints in 2020, a 54% increase over 2019.</p>
<p>RSA said that with the COVID-19 pandemic having fueled “unprecedented” growth in fraudulent transactions, Outseer will focus its innovation on payments authentication, mapping to the EMV 3-D Secure 2.x payment standard, and incorporating new technology integrations across the payments and commerce ecosystem.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Outseer’s reason for being isn’t just focused on eliminating payments and account fraud,” Taussig added. “These fraudulent transactions are often the pretext for more sinister drug and human trafficking, terrorism, and other nefarious behavior. Outseer has the ability to help make the world a safer place.”</p>
<p>Valuation information for Outseer was not disclosed, nor were headcount figures mentioned in the spinout announcement. Outseer didn&#8217;t immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for more information.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One clear outcome of the pandemic was pushing more people to do their shopping online, and that was as true for B2B as it was for B2C. Knowing which of your B2B customers are most likely to convert puts any sales team ahead of the game. <a href="https://www.slintel.com/">Slintel</a>, a startup providing that kind of data, announced a $20 million Series A today.</p>
<p>The company has attracted some big-name investors with GGV leading the round and Accel, Sequoia and Stellaris also participating. The investment brings the total raised to over $24 million including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/slintel-grabs-4-2m-seed-to-expand-sales-intelligence-platform/">a $4.2 million seed round</a> from last November.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a quick turnaround from seed to A, and company founder and CEO Deepak Anchala, says that while he had plenty of runway left from the seed round, the demand was such that it seemed prudent to take the A money sooner than he had planned. &#8220;So we had enough cash in the bank, but investors came to us and we got a pretty good valuation compared to the previous round, so we decided to take it and use that money to go faster,&#8221; Anchala said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Certainly the market dynamics were working in Slintel&#8217;s favor. Without giving revenue details, Anchala said that revenue grew 5x last year in the middle of the worst of the pandemic. He says that meant buyers were spending less time with sales and marketing folks to understand products and more time online researching on their own.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Gong going gangbusters, grabs $250M Series E on $7.25B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/gong-going-gangbusters-grabs-250m-series-e-on-7-25b-valuation/embed/#?secret=TQCSY7jHBh" data-secret="TQCSY7jHBh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;So what Slintel does as a product is we mine buyer insights. We understand where the buyers are in their journey, what their pain points are, what products they use, what they need and when they need it. So we understand all of this to create a 360 degree view of the buyer that you provide these insights to sales and marketing teams to help them sell better,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>After growing at such a rapid clip last year, the company expected more modest growth this year at perhaps 3x, but with the added investment, he expects to grow faster again. &#8220;With the funding we&#8217;re actually looking at much bigger numbers. We&#8217;re looking at 5x in our revenue this year, and also trying for 4x revenue next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says that the money gives him the opportunity to improve the product and put more investment into marketing, which he believes will contribute to additional sales. Since the round closed 6 weeks ago, he says that he has increased his advertising budget and is also hopes to attract customers via SEO, free tools on the company website and events.</p>
<p>The company had 45 employees at the time of its seed round in November and has more than doubled that number in the interim to 100 spread out across 10 cities. He expects to double again by this time next year as the company is growing quickly. As a global company with some employees in India and some in the U.S., he intends to be remote first even after offices begin to reopen in different areas. He says that he plans to have company gatherings each quarter to let people gather in person on occasion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In June of last year, <a href="https://twitter.com/kn0thing?lang=en">Alexis Ohanian</a> announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/alexis-ohanian-reddit-co-founder-is-leaving-initialized-capital/">he was leaving Initialized Capital</a>, the venture firm he co-founded alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/garrytan">Garry Tan</a> in 2011. Nearly a year later, he&#8217;s announcing that his new venture firm, <a href="https://sevensevensix.com/">Seven Seven Six</a>, has raised $150 million for its first fund.</p>
<p>Seven Seven Six is named for the year of the first Olympics, when a cook from nearby village ended up winning the Stadion race. Ohanian&#8217;s idea with the name stems from the fact that the cook was likely a fantastic athlete, but not necessarily the <em>best </em>athlete out there; many people were excluded from the first Olympic games, from athletes outside of Greece to those who didn&#8217;t have the means to show up to women, who weren&#8217;t even allowed to watch the games.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I thought about that track record, and all the things that I&#8217;ve been proud of as an entrepreneur and investor, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel like I was celebrating the cook,&#8221; said Ohanian. &#8220;I&#8217;m still very proud of that track record, but I know that I could have done better. I want the idea that we&#8217;re always on the first starting line trying to do better in pursuit of greater returns.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He added that this pursuit, to leave no entrepreneurial rock unturned, is not necessarily something he wants to do because he enjoys it and it feels good, but because &#8220;it will make more money, it&#8217;s more successful and more effective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Equity and inclusion, then, is built into the DNA of Seven Seven Six. Half of the firm&#8217;s limited partners are women, and 15 percent are black or indigenous people.</p>
<p>Alongside Ohanian, Katelin Holloway and Lissie Garvin are taking founding positions at Seven Seven Six. Both worked with Ohanian at Initialized and Reddit.</p>
<p>One other unique piece of Seven Seven Six is that it is introducing a 2% &#8220;Growth and Caregiving Commitment.&#8221; Ohanian explained that, when he was going through Y Combinator, he was going through a rough time in his personal life. His mother was suffering from an illness, and his girlfriend (at the time) had been in an accident abroad.</p>
<p>So, as he was establishing a business, he was also traveling to see the people he loved who needed him. The financial burden added even more complexity to his life, and an incalculable level of stress.</p>
<p>The 2% commitment sets aside an extra two percent of an investment Seven Seven Six makes into a particular company, to offer financial support to founders for whatever they might need, from childcare to travel to surfing lessons, if that&#8217;s what it takes to help a founder perform in a healthy, balanced way.</p>
<p>Transparency is also a key part of Seven Seven Six&#8217;s philosophy. The firm plans to report on the spending out of this 2% commitment, as well as the diversity and inclusion breakdown of its investments each year.</p>
<p>Thus far, the VC firm has made 17 investments. From the release:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Threat intelligence company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/recorded-future/">Recorded Future</a> is launching a $20 million fund for early-stage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startups/">startups</a> developing novel data intelligence tools.</p>
<p>The Intelligence Fund will provide seed and Series A funding to startups that already have venture capital funding, Recorded Future says, as well as equip them with resources to help with the development and integration of intelligence applications in order to accelerate their go-to-market strategy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Recorded Future, which provides customers with information to help them better understand the external cyber threats they are facing, will invest in startups that aim to tackle significant problems that require novel approaches using datasets and collection platforms, which the company says could be anything from technical internet sensors to satellites. It’s also keen to invest in startups building intelligence analysis toolsets that make use of technologies such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a> and machine learning, as well as intelligence-driven applications that can be integrated into its own Intelligence Platform and ecosystem.</p>
<p>Recorded Future co-founder and chief executive Christopher Ahlberg said: “In a world of aggressive uncertainty, intelligence is the only equalizer. With the launch of the Intelligence Fund, we are investing in the next generation of entrepreneurs who share our vision for securing the world with intelligence.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>So far, the Intelligence Fund has invested in two companies, the first being SecurityTrails, which provides customers with a comprehensive overview of current and historical domain and IP address data. The second investment went to Gemini Advisory, a fraud intelligence platform specializing in finding compromised data on the dark web, which Recorded Future went on <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/recorded-future-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-gemini-advisory-301248485.html">to acquire</a> earlier this year for $52 million in a bid to bolster its own threat intelligence capabilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Recorded Future told TechCrunch that future investments could also be made with an eye to acquiring, but added that funding could also be given purely on the basis that the startup would make a good business or technology partner. Recorded Future was itself acquired by<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/insight-partners-bags-threat-intel-company-recorded-future-for-780m/"> private equity firm Insight Partners back in 2019 for $780 million</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The acquisition effectively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/insight-partners-bags-threat-intel-company-recorded-future-for-780m/">bought out the company&#8217;s earlier investors</a>, including Google&#8217;s venture arm GV, and In-Q-Tel, the non-profit venture arm of the U.S. intelligence community.</span></p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of the fund, Michael Triplett, managing partner at Insight Partners, said: “Cyberattacks continue to impact global enterprises across the globe, and we’re excited to see Recorded Future invest in intelligence startups tackling the business-critical issues that organizations face today.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The Intelligence Fund will provide the resources needed by entrepreneurs to build applications with data and mathematics at the core.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the pandemic hit last year, <a href="http://punchbowl.com">Punchbowl</a>, an online party planning service was left in the lurch with gatherings all but shut down, but instead of lamenting the situation, founder and CEO Matt Douglas went to work to rethink the company&#8217;s approach. He started by expanding the company&#8217;s online greeting card business, which until that point had been a small part of the revenue mix. Then he began talking to investors about a cash influx with an eye toward adding video to the platform.</p>
<p>That all culminated in a slew of announcements today. For starters, the company pulled in $5 million from SG Credit Partners. Douglas then turned around and bought online video production service <a href="http://vidhug.com">VidHug</a> and rebranded it for his platform as <a href="https://www.memento.com/">Memento</a>. Finally, he invested in a couple of apps designed to draw new parents to the service early in their children&#8217;s lives. More on those shortly.</p>
<p>When the government made the no-gatherings rule official, Punchbowl needed a plan. &#8220;So we took our team and we put our energy towards a product that was less than 10% of our business prior to the pandemic and that is greeting cards,&#8221; Douglas said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He made the greeting cards more personalized by adding a video component. His team got that going pretty fast, putting it together by Mother&#8217;s Day 2020 to include a visual message at a time when people couldn&#8217;t get together in person. But he wanted something more than that, and he dove into researching the video montage market. That ultimately led to him connecting with the founders of VidHug and making an offer to buy the Canadian startup.</p>
<p>Memento helps you make and collect video clips, pull them together into a video and choose music and backgrounds in a friendly interface, putting basic video production within reach of of just about any user.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Enter new markets and embrace a distributed workforce to grow during a pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/enter-new-markets-and-embrace-a-distributed-workforce-to-grow-during-a-pandemic/embed/#?secret=k31TX0Hlr8" data-secret="k31TX0Hlr8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Douglas sees adding video as more than a consumer play though. He believes with Memento, he can also attract business customers to use video &#8212; for example, as a way to welcome new employees, especially in distributed organizations, or to make a good-bye video for a long-time employee leaving the company, and in this way begin to expand the platform to include not only consumer customers, but businesses too.</p>
<p>While he was at it, he invested in some apps directed at new parents, particularly moms, including <a href="https://www.qeepsake.co/">Qeepsake</a> and <a href="https://www.pumpspotting.com/">pumpspotting</a>. Qeepsake is an app that prompts parents with a text to collect different memories of their children&#8217;s lives and then print them in a keep-sake book. It&#8217;s aimed at parents who never got around to making that baby book. Pumpspotting helps support breastfeeding moms, whether they are at home or work, and it also provides resources for their employers to support nursing moms as well.</p>
<p>He believes that by attracting parents at the earliest time in their childrens&#8217; lives, he can get them to use other Punchbowl services to plan birthday parties and other events, add video memories, and build long-term brand loyalty along the way.</p>
<p>Douglas has been at this since 2007 when he conceived and launched Punchbowl, and while he says he has had offers over the years to be acquired, he never wanted to sell. Although 2020 might have been the toughest year ever for his party planning business, he used the crisis to rethink it, and in the process may have built something that can survive and thrive longer term with a wider variety of services and revenue streams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just over three months after its last funding round, European fintech giant </span><a href="http://klarna.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klarna</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is announcing today that it has raised another $639 million at a staggering post-money valuation of $45.6 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rumors swirled in recent weeks that Klarna had raised more money at a valuation north of $40 billion. But the Swedish </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">buy now, pay later behemoth and upstart bank </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined to comment until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 led the latest round, which also included participation from existing investors Adit</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ventures, Honeycomb Asset Management and WestCap Group. The new valuation represents a 47.3% increase over Klarna’s post-money valuation of $31 billion</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/invest-now-sell-later/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in early March</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it raised $1 billion, and a 330% increase over its $10.6 billion valuation at the time of its $650 million raise </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/klarna-raises-650-million-at-a-10-6-billion-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Previous backers include Sequoia Capital, SilverLake, Dragoneer and Ant Group, among others.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest financing cements 16-year-old Klarna’s position as the highest-valued private fintech in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Klarna CEO and founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski said the company has seen explosive growth in the U.S. and plans to use its new capital in part to continue to grow there and globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, over the past year, the fintech has seen &#8220;massive momentum&#8221; in the country, with more than 18 million American consumers now using Klarna, he said. That’s up from 10 million at the end of last year’s third quarter, and up 118% year over year. Klarna is now live with 24 of the top 100 U.S. retailers, which it says is “more than any of its competitors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Klarna is live in 20 markets, has more than</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 90 million global active users and more than 2 million transactions a day conducted on its platform. The company’s momentum can be seen in its impressive financial results. In the first quarter, Klarna notched $18.1 billion in volume compared to $9.9 billion in the prior year first quarter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all of 2020, it processed $53 billion in volume. To put that into context; Affirm’s financial report in May projected it would process $8.04 billion in volume for the entire fiscal year of 2021 and Afterpay is projecting $16 billion in volume for its entire fiscal year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 2021 also represented a record month for global shopping volume with $6.9 billion of purchases made through the Klarna platform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in 2020, Klarna hit over a billion in revenue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company was profitable for its first 14 years of life, it has not been profitable the last two, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siemiatkowski, and that’s been by design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve scaled up so massively in investments in our growth and technology, but running on a loss is very odd for us,” he told TechCrunch. “We will get back to profitability soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klarna has entered six new markets this year alone, including New Zealand and France, where it just launched this week. It is planning to expand into a number of new markets this year. The company has about 4,000 employees with several hundred in the U.S. in markets such as New York and Los Angeles. It also has offices in Stockholm, London, Manchester, Berlin, Madrid and Amsterdam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Klarna is partnered with over 250,000 retailers around the world (including Macy’s, Ikea, Nike, Saks), its buy now, pay later feature is also available direct to consumers via its shopping app. This means that consumers can use Klarna’s app to pay immediately or later, as well as manage spending and view available balances. They can also do things like initiate refunds, track deliveries and get price-drop notifications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our shopping browser allows users to use Klarna everywhere,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siemiatkowski said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one else is offering that, and are rather limited to integrating with merchants.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other things the company plans to do with its new capital is focus on acquisitions, particularly acqui-hires, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siemiatkowski. According to </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/acquisitions/field/organizations/num_acquisitions/klarna"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company has made nine known acquisitions over time &#8212; most recently picking up Los Gatos-based content creation services provider Toplooks.ai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re the market leader in this space and we want to find new partners that want to support us in this,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siemiatkowski told TechCrunch. “That </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gives us better prerequisites to be successful going forward. Now we have more cash and money available to invest further in the long term.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klarna has long been rumored to be going public via a direct listing. Siemiatkowski said that the company in many ways already acts like a public company in that it offers stock to all its employees, and reports financials &#8212; giving the impression that the company is not in a hurry to go the public route.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We report quarterly to national authorities and are a fully regulated bank so do all the things you expect to see from public companies such as risk control and compliance,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re reaching a point for it to be a natural evolution for the company to IPO. But we’re not preparing to IPO anytime soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of its last funding round, Klarna announced </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GiveOne</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">initiative to support planet health. With this round, the company is again giving 1% of the equity raised back to the planet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, its investors are bullish on what the company is doing and its market position. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yanni Pipilis, managing partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers, said the company’s growth</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">founded on a deep understanding of how the purchasing behaviors of consumers are</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">changing,” an evolution SoftBank believes is only accelerating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric Munson, founder and CIO of Adit Ventures, said his firm believes the “best is yet to come as Klarna multiplies their addressable market through global expansion.”</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siemiatkowski, what Klarna is trying to achieve is to compete with the $1 trillion-plus credit card industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We really see right now all the signs are there. True competition is coming to this space, this decade,” he said. “This is an opportunity to genuinely disrupt the retail banking space.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft will soon launch a dedicated device for game streaming, the company announced today. It&#8217;s also working with a number of TV manufacturers to build the Xbox experience right into their internet-connected screens and Microsoft plans to bring build cloud gaming to the PC Xbox app later this year, too, with a focus on play-before-you-buy scenarios.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what these new game streaming devices will look like. Microsoft didn&#8217;t provide any further details. But chances are, we&#8217;re talking about either a Chromecast-like streaming stick or a small Apple TV-like box. So far, we also don&#8217;t know which TV manufacturers it will partner with.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Microsoft is bullish about cloud gaming. With Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, it&#8217;s already making it possible for its subscribers to play more than 100 console games on Android, streamed from the Azure cloud, for example. In a few weeks, it&#8217;ll open cloud gaming in the browser on Edge, Chrome and Safari, to all Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers (it&#8217;s currently in limited beta). And it is bringing Game Pass Ultimate to Australia, Brazil, Mexico and Japan later this year, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In many ways, Microsoft is unbundling gaming from the hardware &#8212; similar to what Google is trying with Stadia (an effort that, so far, has fallen flat for Google) and Amazon with Luna. The major advantage Microsoft has here is a large library of popular games, something that&#8217;s mostly missing on competing services, with the exception of Nvidia&#8217;s GeForce Now platform &#8212; though that one has a different business model since its focus is not on a subscription but on allowing you to play the games you buy in third-party stores like Steam or the Epic store.</p>
<p>What Microsoft clearly wants to do is expand the overall Xbox ecosystem, even if that means it sells fewer dedicated high-powered consoles. The company likens this to the music industry&#8217;s transition to cloud-powered services backed by all-you-can-eat subscription models.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that games, that interactive entertainment, aren’t really about hardware and software. It’s not about pixels. It’s about people. Games bring people together,&#8221;<br />
said Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox head Phil Spencer. &#8220;Games build bridges and forge bonds, generating mutual empathy among people all over the world. Joy and community -that’s why we’re here.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Microsoft says it&#8217;s not doing away with dedicated hardware, though, and is already working on the next generation of its console hardware &#8212; but don&#8217;t expect a new Xbox console anytime soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world seems to move faster every year, and yet, nothing feels slower than the speed by which paychecks get distributed. In the United States, work conducted the day after a pay period will take two weeks just to process, with a check or direct deposit coming another week or two later. For the tens of millions of employees who live paycheck-to-paycheck, that multi-week delay can be the difference of making a rent check — or not.</p>
<p>A variety of startups have approached this problem with different solutions, and one of the newest and most compelling offerings is Clair.</p>
<p>Using its own base of capital, New York City-based <a href="https://getclair.com">Clair</a> offers instant — and most importantly — free earned wage advances to workers by integrating into existing HR technology platforms. It works with both full-time employees and also gig workers, and it offers a suite of online and mobile apps for workers to make sense of their finances and ask for an earned wage advance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was founded in late 2019 by CEO Nico Simko, COO Alex Kostecki and CPO Erich Nussbaumer, and today, the company announced that it raised $15 million in Series A funding led by Kareem Zaki of Thrive Capital, who will join the company’s board of directors. Just a few months ago, Clair had announced a $4.5 million seed round led by Upfront Ventures, bringing its total funding to $19.5 million.</p>
<p>“Pay advance” or “earned wage advance” (there is a slight distinction) have been the Silicon Valley euphemism for payday loan, an industry that has been plagued with allegations of fraud, deceit and rapacious greed that have bilked workers out of their hard-earned paychecks through usurious interest rates.</p>
<p>What sets Clair apart is that its offering is free to workers. Since it connects directly into HR systems, the startup takes on significantly less financial risk than traditional payday lenders, who don’t have access to the payroll data that Clair is able to analyze.</p>
<p>For Simko, one of his goals is simply to see the elimination of the traditional industry entirely. “I have a payday lender just in front of my apartment in Brooklyn and there is a long line on the 25th of every month, and I am not going to stop until that line disappears,” he said. “Success for us is just to become the winner in earned wage access.”</p>
<p>He is Argentine-Swiss, and came to the States to attend Harvard, where he met Nussbaumer. He ended up working at J.P. Morgan focused on the payments market. He stayed in touch with Kostecki, whose families are good friends, and the Swiss trio decided to go after this problem, partly inspired by Uber’s instant pay feature that it introduced in 2016 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/05/ubers-instant-pay-has-cashed-out-1-3b-to-drivers-in-just-one-year/">which proved wildly successful</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of making money on interest rates, fees, or tips, Clair instead wants to be the bank and financial service provider of choice for workers. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/coatue-direct-deposits-20m-into-pinwheel-a-payroll-api-for-neobanks/">As I noted last week about Pinwheel</a>, an API platform for payroll, owning the direct deposit relationship with a worker all but guarantees they will conduct the vast majority of their financial transactions through that particular bank account.</p>
<p>Clair offers free instant pay advances as a gateway to its other offerings, which include spending and savings accounts, a debit card, a virtual in-app debit card, and financial planning tools. Simko said, “Our business model is to give earned wage access free for people and then sign them up automatically for a digital bank, and then we make money the same way Chime makes money, which is interchange fees.”</p>
<p>In fact, he and the company believe in that model so much, it will actually pay human capital technology platforms like workforce management and payroll systems to integrate with Clair as an inducement. It offers a recurring revenue fee stream for HR tools based on the number of users who join Clair, regardless of how much those workers use the software. We are “really going down the thesis of embedded fintech,” Simko said. “Employees start spending money on their Clair card, and we distribute that back to our [HR tech] partners.”</p>
<p>Clair joins a number of other companies in this space, which is becoming ever more heated as the perceived opportunity in financial services remains high among investors. Last year, payroll platform Gusto announced that it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/gusto-is-expanding-from-payroll-into-a-full-suite-financial-wellness-platform/">expand from purely payroll to a financial wellness platform</a>, which is partially based on its instant earned wage advances or what it dubs Cashout. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/19/even-raises-40m-to-transform-the-working-class-to-the-savings-class/">We’ve covered Even</a>, which is one of the originals in this space with a major partnership with Walmart, as well as neobank Dave, which offers pay advance features with a tipping revenue model. Dave just <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/mark-cuban-backed-banking-app-dave-going-public-via-4-billion-spac.html">announced a $4 billion valued SPAC with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings III</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Clair’s angle is differentiated as the race to lock in every person globally with new financial services heats up. Simko says he sees a gargantuan opportunity to be the “Alipay” of the United States, noting that unlike China with Alipay, Nubank in Brazil and increasingly Latin America, and N26 and Revolut in Europe, there is still an opportunity for a comprehensive neobank to take over the U.S. market.</p>
<p>With the new funding, the company will continue to expand its product offerings, exploring areas like health care and debt repayment. “I can give APR not based on their credit score but on their employer’s credit score, which is the multi-billion dollar idea here,” Simko said. The team is nominally hubbed in New York with roughly half of the 25 or so person team.</p>
