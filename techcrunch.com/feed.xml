										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">True to its word, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon-web-services" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon-web-services">Amazon Web Services <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (AWS) suspended services to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the right-wing-focused social network that proved a welcoming home for pro-Trump users whose calls for violence at the nation&#8217;s Capitol and beyond. The service suspension went into effect overnight after a 24-hour warning from AWS, which means that if you now go to Parler&#8217;s web address you&#8217;re greeted with a message saying the requested domain can&#8217;t be reached.</p>
<p>Parler&#8217;s community had been surging after the permanent<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/"> suspension of Trump&#8217;s official accounts from Twitter and Facebook last week</a>, which also saw a number of accounts tweeting similar invective and encouragement of violence aligned with Trump&#8217;s sentiments removed from those platforms. Apple and Google then removed Parler from their respective app stores for violations of their own terms of service, and AWS follows suit with its own suspension notice.</p>

<p>The company has suggested that it will rebuild its <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/aws-cuts-off-parler-ceo-aims-to-rebuild-infrastructure/">own infrastructure</a> from scratch in order to contend with the various suspensions, but meanwhile other alternative social media sites that continue to exist, and that have typically catered to a more right-wing audience, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-jumps-to-no-1-on-app-store-after-facebook-and-twitter-bans/">like Gab</a>, are seeing the benefits of Parler&#8217;s deplatforming. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gab-online" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gab-online">Gab <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has previously seen its hosting revoked, and been removed from Google Play for issues around hate speech dissemination.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Telecom company <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/orange" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="orange">Orange <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is making some changes to its venture capital arm. <a href="https://ventures.orange.com">Orange Ventures</a> is becoming a separate legal entity and Orange itself is allocating $430 million (€350 million).</p>
<p>With this new corporate structure, Orange could attract third-party investors in its fund. Other telecom companies have made some headlines with their venture funds in the past, such as SoftBank’s Vision Fund and Reliance Jio.</p>
<p>Separating Orange Ventures from Orange is also going to boost confidence when it comes to confidentiality and conflicts of interest between a startup and the telecom company. There’s a more visible firewall between Orange and Orange Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But if you want to partner with Orange, there are some opportunities on the table — the company says those synergies are “flexible and optional”.</p>
<p>Orange Ventures focuses on investments in companies that operate more or less in the same space as Orange. It includes many verticals, such as connectivity, cybersecurity, fintech and e-health. Previous investments <a href="https://ventures.orange.com/portfolio/">include</a> Monzo, Luko, Raisin, YouVerify and WeaveWorks.</p>
<p>Orange Ventures currently has offices in Paris and Dakar and tends to invest in startups from seed stage up to Series A or B. The firm says it can invest as much as €20 million in a single round. It is screening startups in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the U.S. There are around 20 people working for Orange Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Your startup&#8217;s pitch deck could be the difference between getting funded or getting ignored. It&#8217;s often the first point of contact between a company and venture investors, but it&#8217;s also a bit of a black box.</p>
<p>How do these investors consume this content? Are they speed-flipping through the slides or taking their time? Do they prefer more information on the team or context on the industry? More numbers or more words? How many slides is the right number of slides?</p>
<p>There are too many questions to count, and often very few answers. But we&#8217;re popping the lid off of that black box with the Pitch Deck Teardown. We&#8217;ve done Pitch Deck Teardowns at events like Disrupt and Early Stage 2020, and this year we&#8217;re cranking it up a notch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a part of Extra Crunch Live, our weekly event series that connects investors and founders, we&#8217;ll be offering EC members the chance to get live feedback on their pitch decks from our guests. You heard that right. Every single week, VCs and big-name tech founders will look through pitch decks from the Extra Crunch community and offer their two cents.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where you come in. We&#8217;re asking EC members to <strong><a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">submit their pitch decks right here!</a></strong></p>
<p>Only EC members will have the chance to get their pitch deck looked at, so please use the same email attached to your Extra Crunch account when you submit.</p>
<p>Last week, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/extra-crunch-live-is-back-in-2021-connecting-founders-with-tech-giants-and-each-other/">shared what you can expect from Extra Crunch Live in 2021</a>. Here&#8217;s a refresher:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Series A</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Learn how others have fundraised! We’ll have a segment dedicated to hearing from founder/investor duos who walk us through the Series A pitch deck that led to investment. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Pitch Deck Teardowns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Extra Crunch members will have the opportunity to submit their pitch deck and get feedback from our guests, which will include VCs and founders (</span><a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EC members can submit their pitch decks right here!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Live Pitch-offs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Audience members can raise their hand to practice their elevator pitch in front of the audience and get real-time feedback from VCs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Networking!!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; The Extra Crunch membership is a community. ECL will be an opportunity to meet your fellow audience members, even in a virtual environment. Who knows? Maybe you’ll meet your next co-founder or investor! </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Consistency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; ECL will always be at </span><b>12pm PT/3pm ET on Wednesdays</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When it comes to your calendar, set it and forget it. </span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/redwood-materials-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="redwood-materials-3">Redwood Materials, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the recycling startup founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, has quietly opened up its enterprise to everyday consumers and all of the old electronics sitting in their junk drawers.</p>
<p>The move expands upon the Carson City, Nevada-based company&#8217;s existing and primary strategy to recycle scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics for corporate customers like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/panasonic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="panasonic">Panasonic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Amazon.</p>
<p>The startup has posted a <a href="https://www.redwoodmaterials.com/recyclewithus">&#8220;recycle with us&#8221;</a> tab on its website, which states &#8220;Have lithium ion batteries or e-waste? We’ll recycle your phones, tablets, power tools and any other device with a lithium-ion battery.&#8221; There isn&#8217;t anymore information on the website beyond an address, where consumers can send their e-waste, and a &#8220;contact us&#8221; button.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Straubel told TechCrunch in October that its business model could someday evolve to include consumers because they had received so many inquiries from people. It seems that Redwood has decided to take the leap.</p>
<p>Redwood Materials isn&#8217;t setting strict parameters on what consumers can send, a spokesperson said, who confirmed the company is even taking cables. Redwood told TechCrunch it wants to hear from consumers and will determine over time how it might expand the program. For instance, the company said it might formalize the consumer program and add shipping boxes and labels to make the process easier.</p>
<p>For now, Redwood is going to open it up and see what happens.</p>
<p>The majority of lithium-ion batteries used in smartphones and other consumer electronics are not recycled and instead either sit forgotten in the owner’s junk drawer or enter the waste stream and end up in a landfill.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Redwood Material is aiming to change that by creating a circular supply chain. Redwood collects scrap from Panasonic&#8217;s battery cell production and as well as consumer electronics such as cell phone batteries, laptop computers and power tools from other corporations. The company then processes the discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and supplies those back to Panasonic and other customers.</span></p>
<p>Eventually, Straubel wants Redwood to be part of the end-of-life solution for electric vehicle batteries as well. The CEO has aspirations to set up facilities in strategic regional locations around the world to meet this need. For now, most of the items recycled and processed at Redwood&#8217;s two facilities in Carson City are for Panasonic and other unnamed consumer electronics-related companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/37bcb256-d90d-4e36-a59e-7443d09623d8?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <a <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a> —and don&#8217;t forget to check out the extra episode we dropped on Saturday, as there was just too much to talk about last week.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s on the docket for today? A great host of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">broadly deplatformed</a>, which is controversial not only amongst his political allies and acolytes, but also amongst those worried that fringe-yet-not-wrong views could suffer in the future.</li>
<li>Parler, a Twitter clone that tried to claim the mantle of free speech &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-reportedly-removed-posts-by-trump-affiliate-lin-wood-calling-for-execution-of-vp-mike-pence/">despite having posting rules</a> &#8212; was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">cut off by major tech companies</a> over its inability to censor calls for violence. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-jumps-to-no-1-on-app-store-after-facebook-and-twitter-bans/">It had recently hit #1 in the App Store</a>.</li>
<li>Bitcoin and other cryptos are in correction, as the stock market preps to give back some recent gains. All this while the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/baidu-electric-car-making/">electric car market keeps getting hotter and hotter</a> as Chinese tech companies link up with auto makers to get their own vehicles into the market.</li>
<li>On the funding round front, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/indonesian-investment-platform-ajaib-gets-25-million-series-a-led-by-horizons-venture-and-alpha-jwc/">Ajaib Group raised $25 million</a> as the low-cost trading boom grows around the world. And, Keep, a Chinese fitness app, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/vision-fund-keep-360-million-funding/">raised a megaround</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Closing, I am befuddled by how dissonant the global economy feels, with seemingly two different eras going on at once. It&#8217;s not clear if I have finally become the softy I have always threatened to become, or merely that the inequality of outcomes in the 2020-2021 economy are merely as heartbreaking as I imagine them to be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the last couple of years, Samsung’s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> press conferences have featured a parade of futuristic home robots. They&#8217;re are smart, dexterous and impressive (and reasonably adorable). But home robots are hard. Like, really, really hard. There’s a reason the robotic vacuum continues to be one real viable home robot nearly 20 years after the Roomba&#8217;s introduction.</p>
<p>It’s the same reason the JetBot 90 AI+ Vacuum seems to be the one really viable bit of home robotics from the event. The company also showed off updates to the Bot Handy it introduced at last year&#8217;s show. That, coupled with the new Bot Care, is far more in line with the kind of humanoid designs science fiction has led us believe we’ll be getting in the next few years.</p>
<p>And science fiction seems to still be an operative descriptor here. At last years show, the robots put on a kind of Chuck E. Cheese-style presentation, running through choreographed tasks on stage, with limited human interaction. Understandably – there’s a lot that goes into this sort of thing, and for the moment, the technology feels like proof of concept more than anything.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2094451" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094451" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2094451" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Recording-2021-01-11-at-9.50.06-AM.2021-01-11-09_51_21.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="547" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094451" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>
<p>The company mentioned the “not too distant future” in reference to the tech, while the small print at the corner of the screen said “This robot is undergoing research and development, and is not yet for sale.” That seems to be putting it mildly, as the wheeled Bot Care reminds its owner of a meeting and pops up a screen for a conference call.</p>
<p>I don’t think anyone has an illusions that we’ll be seeing any of this tech during the current epidemic, though I suppose there’s an argument to be made that this is the “new normal” the company is prepping us for. The Bot Handy moving dishes from the sink to dishwasher seems roughly as realistic.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094455" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094455" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2094455" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg 2416w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JetBot-90-AI_02.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094455" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>
<p>I’m happy to be wrong, but I don’t think any of us are holding our breath for a viable version of this tech in the near term. We can, however, appreciate the JetBot 90 AI+ Vacuum. That, after all, has a rough date, arriving in the U.S. at some point in the first half of this year.</p>
<p>The robot vacuum features an on-board LiDAR sensor, coupled with an object detection algorithm that helps it build an ideal path around the user’s home. Interestingly, the camera can also be viewed remotely by the user, doubling as a kind of security cam (though Samsung seems to avoid actually using the word) and a pet monitor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According to the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics">National Cancer Institute</a>, some 1.8 million people are diagnosed with cancer each year in the U.S. alone. Factor in the friends, family and loved ones of those patients, and the number of people affected by this disease can boggle the mind.</p>
<p>Liya Shuster-Bier understands this struggle all too well. After her mother was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer, she herself was diagnosed with a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, transitioning from caregiver to patient to survivor. Her experience led her to start <a href="https://myalula.com/">Alula</a>, a platform for those fighting cancer, that launches officially today.</p>
<p>Alongside its launch, Alula is also announcing that it closed a $2.2 million seed round from BBG Ventures, Metrodora Ventures, Thrive Capital, Village Global, Homebrew, Shrug Capital, Basement Ventures, Company Ventures, K5 Global, K50 Ventures, and several angels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite the sheer number of people affected by cancer and cancer treatment, there aren&#8217;t many resources out there to help them understand what to expect.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people are researching scattered parts of the internet for various elements of product recommendations, ways to communicate ways to raise money for your treatment, ways to understand how to tell people or to announce to your boss that you have treatment,&#8221; said Shuster-Bier. &#8220;It is not in a singular place, it is not organized in a radically honest way. It&#8217;s hard to understand who to trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alula is a multi-pillared platform that, in the words of Shuster-Bier, takes a radically honest approach to preparing its users for everything they&#8217;ll go through during their treatment. That includes products they&#8217;ll need to deal with the treatment process, communication tools to help coordinate support, and content to encourage and support patients on their journey.</p>
<p>Shuster-Bier explained that her oncologists and doctors prepared her for some of the after effects of her treatment, like losing her hair, but couldn&#8217;t recommend a good place to purchase a wig, for example. So Alula has built out a marketplace with products that have been recommended by patients, and guided by an advisory board of medical experts. It includes personalized registries and &#8216;cancer survival kits&#8217; that are categorized by the type of treatment a patient is going through.</p>
<p>Alula also provides communication tools to users. Many people use email to share the news of their cancer diagnosis with their friends and family. It&#8217;s often the most difficult email a person has ever had to write, says the company, and Alula guides them through that process with customizable templates. Alula also provides shareable treatment calendars to help coordinate a ride to treatment or organizing people to sit with patients at treatment, etc.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094447" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094447" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alula_findingthewords.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="638" class="size-large wp-image-2094447" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alula_findingthewords.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alula_findingthewords.png?resize=150,141 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alula_findingthewords.png?resize=300,281 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alula_findingthewords.png?resize=768,721 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alula_findingthewords.png?resize=680,638 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alula_findingthewords.png?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094447" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alula</p></div></p>
<p>The truth is that the cancer journey is never really over. There is always something new to be prepared for and understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am continuously surprised how the after effects persist and are new,&#8221; explained Shuster-Bier. &#8220;I&#8217;m currently struggling with medically induced menopause, at the tender age of 32. I just recently got diagnosed with radiation fibrosis in my chest and back, which is the stiffening of my muscles from my radiation, and I am seeing a cardiologist because one of the chemo drugs that I needed was cardiotoxic.&#8221;</p>
<p>To address this, the company is also building out a library of content to help patients and caregivers navigate the difficult process. This type of information is usually only found through conversations with other cancer patients during treatment, and Alula is looking to centralize and organize that content for its users.</p>
<p>Right now, the business model is focused on affiliate fees that come from the marketplace, but Shuster-Bier explained that Alula is looking to start buying products wholesale that it can retail.</p>
<p>Today, Shuster-Bier is not only celebrating the launch of Alula, but of her three-year cancerversary and nearly two years of being in remission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LG spent a good chunk of its <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> press conference talking about its lineup of TVs for 2021. You can expect bigger, slimmer and brighter TVs. I’m not going to list the specifications of new models. But there are a few new features that are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>LG doesn’t use Android TV for the operating system. Instead, the company has its own operating system called webOS. App developers have to release specific versions of their apps for LG’s smart TVs. And the company announced that Google Stadia and Nvidia GeForce Now are coming to LG 2021 TVs.</p>
<p>Google’s cloud gaming service will arrive first in the coming months. It won’t be available everywhere as Stadia is only available in a handful of countries. But if you live in a country where Stadia is available, you will be able to unplug your Chromecast to access Stadia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stadia works a bit like a console that runs in the cloud. You can buy games and run them in a data center near you. The video feed is streamed directly to your screen and your gamepad controls are relayed to the server.</p>
<p>As for Nvidia’s cloud gaming service, it is coming later this year. This service is a bit different as you can take advantage of your Steam, Epic Games, GOG or Ubisoft Connect libraries.</p>
<p>Nvidia has favored its own set-top box in the past with a GeForce Now app on the Nvidia Shield TV. Recently, the Android app has been updated with support for more devices, and it looks like it’s expanding beyond Android TV with webOS support.</p>
<p>LG also announced that it is updating webOS with a brand new interface this year. The overlay menu at the bottom of the screen has been replaced with a full screen menu. You’ll be able to find your favorite apps, access live TV and get some content recommendations —&nbsp;and, yes, there will be ads.</p>
<p>If you’re playing games, there will be a new game menu to access the most relevant settings. For instance, you’ll be able to switch from one TV profile to another from that menu depending on the type of games that you’re playing (FPS, racing games, etc.). It sounds pretty useless to me as you mostly want to reduce latency as much as possible with <em>any</em> genre. You’ll also be able to turn on G-Sync and FreeSync if you’re using a compatible device.</p>
<p>When it comes to new OLED TVs, there are the entry-line A1 models with old processors, the C1 models with support for modern game consoles thanks to variable refresh rate, low latency, etc. At the top of the lineup, the G1 models come in three different sizes (77 inches, 65 inches and 55 inches).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> starts in earnest today, I anticipate we’ll be seeing a lot of hardware focused on remote work. PC sales saw a nice spike last year, even as smartphone sales continued to slip. There was a lot of adapting that needed to be done, moving from offices to virtual work places, and now we’re beginning to see the fruits of that push from hardware makers.</p>
<p>The new Surface Pro 7+ certainly seems to fit the bill. I’m still hesitant to recommend a convertible with a keyboard case as a primary productivity device, but people do seem increasingly willing to move in that direction.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094032" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094032" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2094032 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Surface-Pro-7_Image-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Surface-Pro-7_Image-2.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Surface-Pro-7_Image-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Surface-Pro-7_Image-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Surface-Pro-7_Image-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Surface-Pro-7_Image-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Surface-Pro-7_Image-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Surface-Pro-7_Image-2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Surface-Pro-7_Image-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094032" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Microsoft</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Top line features include optional LTE and faster processing (up to 2.1x per <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> numbers) via an 11th Gen Intel Core processor. That’s paired with up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. There’s a 1080p front-facing webcam for video conferences and a quartet of mics.</p>
<p>Ports include one full-size USB-A and that pesky Surface connector and, unfortunately, only a single USB-C. Microsoft seems pretty committed to that last bit, to its detriment. The device should get up to 15 hours of battery on a charge &#8212; which isn’t exceptional, but isn’t bad either.</p>
<p>It starts at $899 for the Wi-Fi version and $1,149 for LTE. Pre-order starts today and it will ship next week. Speaking of shipping, the already announced Surface Hub 2S 85 whiteboard is finally set to do just that next month in “select markets.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UBTech is the massively funding Chinese robotics company you’ve (probably) never heard of. If you’re familiar at all with the brand here in the States, it&#8217;s likely for its STEM or other robotic toys, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/ubtechs-robotic-first-order-stormtrooper-patrols-ar-battlefields/">including a Star Wars Storm Trooper robot</a> from a few years back (my own first exposure to the company). But with around <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ubtech">$940 million in funding</a>, it seems the sky’s the limit, in terms of product expansion.</p>
<p>Among its announcements at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today is the arrival of line of UV-C disinfecting robots. The need is certainly clear, following the events of the past 12 months. In fact, UBTech isn&#8217;t even the first company to introduce a UV robot for the show – that distinction <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/press-release/lg-announces-autonomous-robot-with-disinfecting-uv-light-for-various-b2b-applications">falls to LG</a>, which is set to offer its own solution this year.</p>

<p>And like LG, UBTech has already begun piloting its tech. The State of Delaware’s Department of Education has deployed models in a number of locations. The company is producing a few different models of Adibot – including rolling and stationary versions. They’re available for purchase starting this week, with financing plans starting at $15 a day.</p>
<p>As the company notes, while the need for such functionality has been at top of mind during the COVID-19 pandemic, it certainly doesn’t start or end with that specific virus. Epidemiologists have warned that this particular strain most likely won’t be the last major pandemic of our lifetimes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Moderna, the biotech company behind one of the two mRNA-based vaccines currently being rolled out globally to stem the tide of COVID-19, has <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-business-update-and-announces-three-new">announced</a> that it will purse development programs around three new vaccine candidates in 2021. These include potential vaccines for HIV, seasonal flu and the Nipah virus. Moderna&#8217;s development and clinical trial of its COVID-19 vaccine is among the fastest in history, and thus far its results have been very promising, buoying hopes for the efficacy of other preventative treatments being generated using this technology which is new to human clinical use.</p>
<p>An mRNA vaccine differs from typical, historical vaccines because it involves providing a person with just a set of instructions on how to build specific proteins that will trigger a body&#8217;s natural defenses. The mRNA instructions, which are temporary and do not affect a person&#8217;s actual DNA, simply prompt the body&#8217;s cells to produce proteins that mirror those used by a virus to attach to and infect cells. The independent proteins are then fought off by a person&#8217;s natural immune response, which provides a lasting lesson in how to fight off any future proteins that match that profile, including those which help viruses attach to and infect people.</p>

<p>Moderna&#8217;s new programs will target not only seasonal flu, but also a combinatory vaccine that could target both the regular flu and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that leads to COVID-19. The HIV candidate, which is developed in collaboration with both the AIDS Vaccine Initiative and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is expected to enter into Phase 1 trials this year, as will the flue face. Nipah virus is a highly lethal illness that can cause respiratory and neurological symptoms, and which is particularly a threat in India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Singapore.</p>
<p>mRNA-based vaccines have long held potential for future vaccine development, in part because of their flexibility and programmability, and in part because they don&#8217;t use any active or dormant virus, which reduces their risks in terms of causing any direct infections up front. The COVID-19 pandemic spurred significant investment and regulatory/health and safety investment into the technology, paving the way for its use in other areas, including these new vaccine candidate trials by Moderna.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Big tech&#8217;s decision to pull the plug on president Donald Trump&#8217;s presence on their platforms, following his supporters&#8217; attack on the US capital last week, has been seized on in Europe as proof &#8212; if proof were needed &#8212; that laws have not kept pace with tech market power and platform giants must face consequences over the content they amplify and monetize.</p>
<p>Writing in <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/thierry-breton-social-media-capitol-hill-riot/">Politico</a>, the European Commission&#8217;s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, dubs the 6/1 strike at the heart of the US political establishment as social media&#8217;s &#8216;9/11&#8217; moment &#8212; aka, the day the whole world woke up to the real-world impact of unchecked online hate and lies.</p>
<p>Since then Trump has been booted from a number of digital services, and the conservative social media app Parler has also been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">ejected</a> from the App Store and Google Play over a failure to moderate violent threats, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-jumps-to-no-1-on-app-store-after-facebook-and-twitter-bans/">Trump supporters flocked to the app</a> in the wake of Facebook&#8217;s and Twitter&#8217;s crackdown.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the time of writing, Parler is also poised to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/">booted</a> by its hosting provider AWS, while Stripe has reportedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/stripe-reportedly-joins-the-tech-platforms-booting-president-trump-from-their-services/">pulled the plug</a> on Trump&#8217;s ability to use its payment tools to fleece supporters. (Although when this reporter asked in November whether Trump was breaching its TOC by using its payment tools for his &#8216;election defense fund&#8217; Stripe ignored TechCrunch&#8217;s emails&#8230;)</p>
<p>&#8220;If there was anyone out there who still doubted that online platforms have become systemic actors in our societies and democracies, last week’s events on Capitol Hill is their answer. What happens online doesn’t just stay online: It has — and even exacerbates — consequences &#8216;in real life&#8217; too,&#8221; Breton writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last week’s insurrection marked the culminating point of years of hate speech, incitement to violence, disinformation and destabilization strategies that were allowed to spread without restraint over well-known social networks. The unrest in Washington is proof that a powerful yet unregulated digital space &#8212; reminiscent of the Wild West &#8212; has a profound impact on the very foundations of our modern democracies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Europe Commission proposed a major update to the rules for digital services and platform giants in December, when it laid out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act</a> &#8212; saying it&#8217;s time to level the regulatory playing field by ensuing content and activity that&#8217;s illegal offline is similarly sanctioned online.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s proposal also seeks to address the market power of tech giants with proposals for additional oversight and extra rules for the largest platforms that have the potential to cause the greatest societal harm.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, then, Breton has seized on the chaotic scenes in Washington to push this already-formed tech policy plan &#8212; with his eye on a domestic audience of European governments and elected members of the European Parliament whose support is needed to pass the legislation and reboot the region&#8217;s digital rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that a CEO can pull the plug on POTUS’s loudspeaker without any checks and balances is perplexing. It is not only confirmation of the power of these platforms, but it also displays deep weaknesses in the way our society is organized in the digital space,&#8221; he warns.</p>
<p>&#8220;These last few days have made it more obvious than ever that we cannot just stand by idly and rely on these platforms’ good will or artful interpretation of the law. We need to set the rules of the game and organize the digital space with clear rights, obligations and safeguards. We need to restore trust in the digital space. It is a matter of survival for our democracies in the 21st century.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DSA will force social media to clean up its act on content and avoid the risk of arbitrary decision-making by giving platforms &#8220;clear obligations and responsibilities to comply with these laws, granting public authorities more enforcement powers and ensuring that all users’ fundamental rights are safeguarded&#8221;, Breton goes on to argue.</p>
<p>The commissioner also addresses US lawmakers directly &#8212; calling for Europe and the US to join forces on Internet regulation and engage in talks aimed at establishing what he describes as &#8220;globally coherent principles&#8221;, suggesting the DSA as a starting point for discussions. So he&#8217;s not wasting the opportunity of #MAGA-induced chaos to push a geopolitical agenda for EU tech policy too.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/europe-will-push-to-work-with-the-us-on-tech-governance-post-trump/">Last month</a> the Commission signalled a desire to work with the incoming Biden administration on a common approach to tech governance, saying it hoped US counterparts would work with to shape global standards for technologies like AI and to force big tech to be more responsible, among other areas. And recent events in Washington do seem to be playing into that hand &#8212; although it remains to be seen how the incoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/tech-biden-era-cabinet-antitrust-transition/">Biden administration will approach regulating big tech</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DSA, which has been carefully designed to answer all of the above considerations at the level of our Continent, can help pave the way for a new global approach to online platforms &#8212; one that serves the general interest of our societies. By setting a standard and clarifying the rules, it has the potential to become a paramount democratic reform serving generations to come,&#8221; Breton concludes.</p>

<p>Twitter&#8217;s decision to (finally) pull the plug on Trump also caught the eye of UK minister <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/matt-hancock" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="matt-hancock">Matt Hancock, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the former  secretary of state for the digital brief (now the health secretary). Speaking to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-55609903">BBC</a> this weekend, he suggested the unilateral decision &#8220;raises questions&#8221; about how big tech is regulated that would result in &#8220;consequences&#8221;.</p>
<div class="css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i83" data-component="text-block">
<div class="css-83cqas-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2">
<p>&#8220;The scenes, clearly encouraged by President Trump &#8212; the scenes at the Capitol &#8212; were terrible &#8212; and I was very sad to see that because American democracy is such a proud thing. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But there&#8217;s something else that has changed, which is that social media platforms are making editorial decisions now. That&#8217;s clear because they&#8217;re choosing who should and shouldn&#8217;t have a voice on their platform,&#8221; he told the Andrew Marr program.</span></p>
<div class="css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i83" data-component="text-block">
<div class="css-83cqas-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2">
<p>The BBC reports that Hancock also told Sky News Twitter&#8217;s ban on Trump means social media platforms are taking editorial decisions &#8212; which he said &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">raises questions about their editorial judgements and the way that they&#8217;re regulated&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>Hancock&#8217;s remarks are noteworthy because back in 2018, during his time as digital minister, he <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/19107ba2-5ba0-11e8-94fc-3fbd0b39cd83">said</a> the government would legislate to introduce a statutory code of conduct on social media platforms forcing them to act against online abuse.</p>
<p>More than two years&#8217; later, the UK&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/uk-sets-out-safety-focused-plan-to-regulate-internet-firms/">safety-focused plan</a> to regulate the Internet is still yet to be put before parliament &#8212; but late last year ministers committed to introducing an Online S<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">afety Bill this year. </span></p>
<p>Under the plan, the UK&#8217;s media regulator, Ofcom, will gain new powers to oversee tech platforms &#8212; including the ability to levy fines for non-compliance with a safety-focused duty of care of up to 10% of a company&#8217;s annual turnover.</p>
<p>The proposal covers a wide range of digital services, not just social media. Larger platforms are also slated to have the greatest responsibility for moderating content and activity. And &#8212; at least in its current form &#8212; the proposed law is intended to apply not just to content that&#8217;s illegal under UK law but also the fuzzier category of &#8216;harmful&#8217; content.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s something the European Commission proposal has steered clear of &#8212; with more subjective issues like disinformation set to be tackled via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">a beefed-up (but still voluntary) code of practice</a>, instead of being baked into digital services legislation. So online speech looks set to be one area of looming regulatory divergence in Europe, with the UK now outside the bloc.</p>
<p>Last year, the government said larger social media platforms &#8212; such as Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter &#8212; are likely to &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">need to assess the risk of legal content or activity on their services with ‘a reasonably foreseeable risk of causing significant physical or psychological </span><span class="il" style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">harm</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to adults’&#8221; under the forthcoming Online Safety Bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;They will then need to make clear what type of ‘legal but harmful’ content is acceptable on their platforms in their terms and conditions and enforce this transparently and consistently,” it added, suggesting the UK will in fact legislate to force platforms to make &#8216;editorial&#8217; decisions.</span></p>
<p>The consequences Hancock thus suggests are coming for tech platforms look rather akin to the &#8216;editorial&#8217; decisions they have been making in recent days.</p>
<p>Albeit, the uncomfortable difference he seems to have been articulating is between tech platforms that have massive unilateral power to silence the US president at a stroke and at a point of their own choosing vs tech platforms being made to comply with a pre-defined rules-based order set by legislators and regulators.</p>

<p>In additional high level responses on Monday, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, described Twitter&#8217;s shuttering of Trump&#8217;s account as &#8220;problematic&#8221;, per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/merkel-sees-closing-trump-s-social-media-accounts-problematic?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic">Bloomberg</a>, which quotes her chief spokesman, Steffen Seibert, making the comment at a regular news conference in Berlin. Rights like the freedom of speech &#8220;can be interfered with, but by law and within the framework defined by the legislature &#8212; not according to a corporate decision&#8221;, the spokesman added.</p>
<p>Similar views were espoused by the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, who said it should be for states and the justice system to regulate big tech, not for the &#8220;digital oligarchy&#8221; to regulate itself.</p>
<p>He also described regulation of big tech as &#8220;necessary&#8221;.</p>

<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Last week, I provided some of my predictions for 2021 focused on autonomous vehicle technology and electric vehicles. I&#8217;ll weigh in today with a few predictions about the rest of the &#8220;future of transportation&#8221; sector, including ride-hailing, on-demand delivery and in-car tech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Email me at <a href="mailto:kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com">kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com</a> to share thoughts, criticisms, offer up opinions or tips. You can also send a direct message to me at Twitter — <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">@kirstenkorosec</a>.</p>
<p>Alrighty, here&#8217;s the remaining predictions for the 2021.</p>
<h2><strong>Delivery </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2037863 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png" alt="the-station-delivery" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></h2>
<p>On-demand delivery will continue to grow even as consumers return to physical stores, which will put pressure on the logistics ecosystem. The retailers that have the best success will be the ones that have locked in multiple channels to get their &#8220;goods&#8221; to the consumer.</p>
<p>Big retailers and even smaller local stores have come to understand that their physical location has become an extended part of the supply chain. Startups that have developed platforms to make it easier to manage inventory and get it to the consumer will continue to pop up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the increase in demand for delivery will encourage giants like Amazon and Walmart invest in technological solutions to meet their needs. This might include partnering with or acquiring startups. (This goes beyond interests in longer term efforts like autonomous vehicle delivery).</p>
<p>Delivery apps such as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Eats, DoorDash and Instacart will face increased scrutiny for use of gig economy workers as well as whether businesses benefit from using them. This may very well spawn local businesses to find their own in-house solutions. Demand will rise for digital tools that help optimize delivery fleets and platforms designed to help companies gets goods to consumers without relying on Uber, DoorDash and others.</p>
<p>Restaurant groups will pull together to offer delivery hubs from ghost kitchens, a prediction that mirrors one shared with me from <span lang="EN">Khaled Naim, the CEO </span><span lang="EN">last mile delivery management software startup Onfleet. I believe local stores will make the same efforts. </span></p>
<p>I expect more pitches from companies hawking curbside management tools and subscription delivery platforms.</p>
<p>On the ride-hailing front, shuttle companies like Via will continue to grow (despite concerns about sharing rides) and make acquisitions to round out their current offerings. Via will continue to sell its platform to cities as opposed to standing up more of its own operations. Via handles booking, routing, passenger and vehicle assignment and identification, customer experience and fleet management. And it will likely look for ways to broaden its services to become more appealing.</p>
<h2>In-car tech</h2>
<p>Some of the trends that started two years ago will continue to play out. Automakers are increasing the size and display resolution of infotainment screens in its vehicles. Sadly, only a handful will unlock the more important piece of the infotainment system: the user interface.</p>
<p>Two announcements this past week — one from holographic startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/envisics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="envisics">Envisics <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and the other from Mercedes — hint at what&#8217;s to come in 2021.</p>
<p>Mercedes unveiled January 7 its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mercedes-unveils-hyperscreen-a-curved-56-inch-screen-for-its-flagship-eqs-electric-vehicle/">next-generation MBUX Hyperscreen</a>, which features a 56-inch curved screen that runs the length of the dashboard. The MBUX Hyperscreen will be optional in the 2022 Mercedes EQS, the flagship sedan under the automaker’s electric EQ brand.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093071" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093071" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2093071 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg" alt="Mercedes-EQ. MBUX Hyperscreen" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2093071" class="wp-caption-text">Mercedes-EQ. MBUX Hyperscreen</p></div></p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested and maybe even encouraged (I have yet to test it) in the UI. Mercedes chose to put information on charging, entertainment, phone, navigation, social media, connectivity and massage — yes massage — right up front on the screen. This means no scrolling through menus or using the voice assistant to locate these options.</p>
<p>The system’s software, which will learn the patterns of the driver, will prompt the user, removing any need to go deeper into the sub-menu. The navigation map is always visible in the center and located just below it are the controls for the phone and entertainment — or the feature that best suits the specific situation, according to the automaker.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/holographic-startup-envisics-partners-with-panasonic-to-fast-track-in-car-ar-tech/">Envisics announced a partnership</a> with Panasonic Automotive Systems to jointly develop and commercialize a new generation of head-up displays for cars, trucks and SUVs.</p>
<p>Envisics&#8217; technology allows for head-up displays to have higher resolution, wide color gamut and large images that can be overlaid upon reality. The technology can also project information at multiple distances simultaneously. The company&#8217;s founder Jamieson Christmas told me that in the short term this will provide relatively simple augmented reality applications like navigation, highlighting the lane you’re supposed to be in and some safety applications.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094016" style="width: 2512px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094016" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2094016 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg" alt="Envisics Navigation" width="2502" height="1669" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg 2502w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2502px) 100vw, 2502px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2094016" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Envisics</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;But as you look forward into things like autonomous driving it unlocks a whole realm of other opportunities like entertainment and video conferencing,” he said.</p>
<p>Finally, I expect more chatter and maybe even deployments of driver monitoring systems as automakers roll out more advanced driver assistance systems that allow for &#8220;hands-free&#8221; operations in certain conditions.</p>
<p>I want to stress however, that having a DMS is only part of the solution. The safe operation of an advanced driver assistance system comes down to how well the driver understands the features and can easily see or hear when they&#8217;re on and off. A number of vehicle models, with the regular ol&#8217; less &#8220;advanced versions of ADAS, already fail at properly communicating to drivers when features are on and off. My hope for 2021 and beyond is that there&#8217;s an effort to improve this shortfall.</p>
<p>For those who missed last week&#8217;s predictions, here is my recap on AVs and EVs.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896325 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png" alt="the station autonomous vehicles1" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<h2>Autonomous vehicles</h2>
<p>The wave of consolidation that began in 2020 will continue this year, leaving fewer players that are aiming to commercialize autonomous vehicle technology in three distinct areas: robotaxis, trucking and delivery.</p>
<p>In 2020, Starsky Robotics shut down, Uber sold its self-driving subsidiary to Aurora and autonomous delivery startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nuro-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nuro-2">Nuro <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> acquired Ike Robotics. This evolution is not yet complete.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be paying attention to the activities of all the big AV players including Cruise, Motional, Waymo and Zoox. I&#8217;m particularly interested in how Aurora will handle absorbing Uber ATG into its operations. I&#8217;m also watching for progress at Argo AI, which has spent the past several months integrating VW&#8217;s self-driving subsidiary Autonomous Intelligent Driving (AID) into its operations.</p>
<p>I expect big moves by the often-overlooked Voyage, including new partnerships and driverless operations.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomous delivery</strong> will see the most investment, consolidation and commercialization activity in 2021. This won&#8217;t be the year when autonomous delivery becomes ubiquitous. But expect more pilot programs in urban, and even suburban and rural areas as companies try to figure out what environment and form factor — sidewalk bots, purpose-built vehicles that operate on roads or drones — produces the best economics.</p>
<p>New regionally focused entrants will pop up in 2021 and drone delivery companies will expand to larger geofenced areas.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also curious to see what becomes of Postmates&#8217; autonomous robot now that Uber has completed its acquisition of the on-demand delivery company.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1942908" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1942908" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1942908 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg" alt="Nuro R2 delivery bot" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1942908" class="wp-caption-text">Nuro&#8217;s second-generation R2 delivery robot. <strong>Image credit:</strong> Nuro</p></div></p>
<p>Companies pursuing <strong>autonomous trucking</strong> are going to learn that long-haul logistics are more difficult and expensive than previously thought. While companies will continue to focus on Class 8 trucks that can operate without a human, expect greater activity in the so-called middle-mile logistics market. This is an area that startup Gatik AI has targeted with some successful results.</p>
<p>The middle-mile market, in which autonomous trucks run frequent trips from large distribution centers to local retailers, will become increasingly important as consumers continue to order groceries and other goods online. Amazon, Walmart and Kroger are just a few of the large and deep-pocketed companies keenly interested in finding faster and cheaper ways to move goods. Expect more investments and even acquisitions from big retailers.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomous vehicle regulations</strong> in the United States will shift in 2021 due to the new Biden Administration. The changes won&#8217;t happen immediately; there will be far more activity in 2022 and beyond. But there will be change nonetheless.</p>
<p>The Trump Administration has taken a light touch to autonomous vehicle development and deployment, choosing to stick with voluntary guidelines instead of creating new mandatory rules. For instance, last month the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration posted a notice that clarified AV policy and seemed to make the path to deployment much easier. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/the-station-zooxs-six-year-ride-aurora-makes-its-uber-atg-employee-picks-and-nhtsa-takes-a-new-position-on-avs/">Read the details</a> in my Dec. 21 newsletter)</p>
<p>President-elect Joe Biden nominated former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg as the next Secretary of Transportation, a Cabinet position that will have him overseeing the Federal Highway Administration and NHTSA among other roles. The expectation is that Buttigieg will lead the charge (ahem) for electric charging infrastructure. What&#8217;s less clear is how he and the Biden Administration will approach automated vehicle technology and the advanced driver assistance systems found in today&#8217;s modern vehicles.</p>
<p>The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the automotive industry group, released its<a href="https://www.autosinnovate.org/avroadmap"> four-year plan</a> last month for how it wants the federal government to act. The group made 14 recommendations that includes reforming regulations to allow for AV deployment at scale. Expect the Alliance for Automotive Innovation to push for a national AV pilot program and a new vehicle class for AVs.</p>
<h2>Electric vehicles</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1896228" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1896228" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1896228 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png" alt="the station electric vehicles1" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1896228" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin</p></div></p>
<p>A bevy of new electric vehicles from startups and legacy automakers will arrive in 2021. The Lucid Air, Rivian R1T and R1S, Audi Q4 etron and Nissan Ariya will come to market, while production ramps up for the Ford Mustang Mach-E and VW ID.4 .</p>
<p>In the latter half of the year, we should also see a few electric pickups from Lordstown Motors and the first deliveries of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/bmw-announces-the-ix-its-next-gen-electric-flagship/">the BMW iX</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/gmc-reveals-the-hummer-ev-1000-hp-350-mile-range-and-0-60-in-around-3-seconds/">GMC Hummer EV</a>.  I don&#8217;t expect the Tesla Cybertruck to appear until the very end of 2021, if not 2022.</p>
<p>In the U.S., I&#8217;ll be watching for policy changes at the federal level that might encourage more consumers to make the switch to electric vehicles. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/01/biden-clean-energy-453171">According to Politico</a>, there is $40 billion in unused Energy Department loan authority that was awarded under the 2009 stimulus. These funds could become central piece of the incoming Biden Administration&#8217;s climate and infrastructure plan. While those loans will likely go towards energy storage and other infrastructure, it&#8217;s worth noting that former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm will be heading up the DOE. Granholm was directly involved in the Obama Administration&#8217;s bailout of the U.S. auto industry during the Great Recession.</p>
<p><strong>Electric bikes, mopeds, scooters and even skateboards</strong> will continue to grow in 2021 as consumers look for means of getting around town without buying a car or using personal transit.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean every ebike or scooter company will prosper. Some shared electric scooter companies have struggled in 2020 or shut down altogether. Others are switching to subscription -based models. Expect the tinkering to continue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Chinese fitness class provider <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/keep-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="keep-3">Keep <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> continues to diversify its offerings to include Peloton-like bikes, health-conscious snacks among other things, it&#8217;s bringing in new investors to fund its ambitions.</p>
<p>On Monday, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/keep-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="keep-3">Keep <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said it has recently closed a Series F financing round of $360 million led by SoftBank Vision Fund. Hillhouse Capital and Coatue Management participated in the round, as well as existing investors GGV Capital, Tencent, 5Y Capital, Jeneration Capital and Bertelsmann Asia Investments.</p>
<p>The latest fundraise values the six-year-old startup at about $2 billion post-money, people with knowledge told TechCrunch. Keep said it currently has no plans to go public, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Keep started out in 2014 by providing at-home workout videos and<a href="https://technode.com/2017/08/14/chinese-social-fitness-app-keep-reaches-100-million-users/"> signed up 100 million users</a> within three years. As of late, it has served over 300 million users, the company claims. It has over time fostered an ecosystem of fitness influencers who give live classes to students via videos, and now runs a team of course designers, streaming coaches and operational staff dedicated to its video streaming business.</p>
<p>The company said its main revenue driver is membership fees from the 10 million users who receive personalized services. It&#8217;s also expanding its consumer product line. Last year, for instance, the firm introduced an internet-connected stationary bike that comes with video instructions like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/peloton-interactive" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="peloton-interactive">Peloton <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. It&#8217;s also rolled out apparel, treadmills and smart wristbands.</p>
<p>The company launched <a href="https://keepkeep.com/?_branch_match_id=837951310592172963">foreign versions of its Keep app</a> in 2018 as it took aim at the overseas home fitness market. It was posting diligently on Western social networks including Instagram, Facebook and Twitter up until the spring of 2019.</p>
<p>According to Keep, the purpose of the latest funding is to let it continue doing what it has focused on in recent years: improving services and products for users and serving fitness professionals against a backdrop of the Chinese government&#8217;s campaign for &#8220;national fitness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe fitness has become an indispensable part of Chinese people&#8217;s everyday life as their income rises and health awareness grows,&#8221; said Eric Chen, managing partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/softbank-vision-fund" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="softbank-vision-fund">SoftBank Vision Fund <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s search giant <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/baidu" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="baidu">Baidu <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is extending its car ambitions from mere software to production. The company said Monday that it will set up a company to produce electric vehicles with the help of Chinese automaker Geely. Baidu, a dominant player in China&#8217;s internet search market for the last decade or so, will provide smart driving technologies while Geely, which has an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volvocars-results/geelys-volvo-cars-in-gear-for-recovery-while-merger-delayed-idUSKCN24M0IV">impending merger with Sweden&#8217;s Volvo</a>, will be in charge of car design and manufacturing.</p>
<p>The move marks the latest company in China&#8217;s internet industry to enter the EV space. In November, news arrived that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/alibaba-saic-ev-brand/">Alibaba and Chinese state-owned carmaker SAIC Motor</a> had joined hands to produce electric cars. Ride-share company Didi and EV maker BYD co-developed a model for ride-hailing, which is already attracting customers like <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meg-announces-purchase-agreement-for-2-000-units-of-d1--byds-custom-electric-ride-hailing-vehicle-301198604.html">Ideanomics</a>. Meanwhile, the stocks of China&#8217;s Tesla challengers, such as Xpeng, Li Auto, and NIO, have been in a steady uptrend over the past year.</p>
<p>Baidu&#8217;s car push is part of its effort to diversify a business relying on search advertising revenue. New media platforms such as ByteDance&#8217;s Toutiao news aggregator and short-video app Douyin come with their own search feature and have gradually eroded the share of traditional search engines like Baidu. Short video services have emerged as the second-most popular channel for internet search in China, trailing after web search engines and coming ahead of social networks and e-commerce, data analytics firm Jiguang <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/RUyiG2o7YfSYvJHEMWsCLw">shows</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Baidu has been working aggressively on autonomous driving since 2017. Its Apollo ecosystem, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/baidus-apollo-platform-becomes-the-android-of-the-autonomous-driving-industry/">billed as &#8220;an Android for smart driving,&#8221;</a> has accumulated over a hundred manufacturing and supplier partners. Baidu has also been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/baidu-self-driving-2018/">busy testing autonomous driving</a> and recently <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3101168/baidu-opens-its-robotaxis-public-beijing-making-it-third-city-china">rolled out a robotaxi fleet</a>.</p>
<p>The new venture will operate as a Baidu subsidiary where Geely will serve as a strategic partner and Baidu units like Apollo and Baidu Maps will contribute capabilities. The firm will cover the entire industrial chain, including vehicle design, research and development, manufacturing, sales, and service.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how Baidu&#8217;s tie-up with Geely will affect Apollo&#8217;s operation, though Baidu promised in its announcement that it will &#8220;uphold its spirit of open collaboration across the AI technology industry, striving to work closely with its ecosystem partners to advance the new wave of intelligent transformation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At Baidu, we have long believed in the future of intelligent driving and have over the past decade invested heavily in AI to build a portfolio of world-class self-driving services,&#8221; said Robin Li, co-founder and chief executive officer of Baidu.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that by combining Baidu&#8217;s expertise in smart transportation, connected vehicles and autonomous driving with Geely&#8217;s expertise as a leading automobile and EV manufacturer, the new partnership will pave the way for future passenger vehicles.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">San Francisco police are preparing for a pro-Trump protest at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> headquarters, a building which has been essentially abandoned since the start of the pandemic last year, with most Twitter employees working remotely.</p>
<p>The potential protest comes days after Twitter banned the president from using its service — his favorite form of communication to millions of followers — following what the company called his continued incitements to violence in the wake of the January 6 assault on the Capitol last week by a mob of his followers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The San Francisco Police Department is aware of the possibility of a demonstration on the 1300 block of Market Street (Twitter) tomorrow, Monday January 11, 2021. SFPD has been in contact with representatives from Twitter. We will have sufficient resources available to respond to any demonstrations as well as calls for service citywide,&#8221; a police department spokesperson wrote in an email. &#8220;The San Francisco Police Department is committed to facilitating the public’s right to First Amendment expressions of free speech. We ask that everyone exercising their First Amendment rights be considerate, respectful, and mindful of the safety of others.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The San Francisco Chronicle,<a href="https://twitter.com/sfchronicle/status/1348414208329867265?s=20"> which first reported the preparations from SF police</a>, noted that posts on a popular internet forum for Trump supporters who have relocated from Reddit called for the president&#8217;s adherents to protest his Twitter ban outside of the company&#8217;s headquarters on Monday.</p>
<p data-words="46">Twitter is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">one of several tech companies to deplatform the president</a> and many of his supporters in the wake of the riot at the Capitol on Wednesday.</p>
<aside class="ad-point ad-banner bottom" data-component="ad">
<div id="BP728" data-google-query-id="CO6Z08boku4CFUxc1Qod6TwMMA">At this point, most of the biggest names in tech have pledged to deny service to the President for what they said was his incitement to violence in the wake of the Capitol hill raid that left five people dead &#8212; including a Capitol Police officer.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ajaib.co.id/">Ajaib Group</a>, an online investment platform that says it now runs the fifth-largest stock brokerage in Indonesia by number of trades, announced it has raised a $25 million Series A led by Horizons Ventures, the venture capital firm founded by Li Ka-Shing, and Alpha JWC. Returning investors SoftBank Ventures Asia, Insignia Ventures and Y Combinator also participated in the round, which was made in two closes.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 by chief executive officer Anderson Sumarli and chief operating officer Yada Piyajomkwan, Ajaib Group focuses on millennials and first-time investors, and currently claims one million monthly users. It has now raised a total of $27 million, including a $2 million seed round in 2019.</p>
<p>Stock investment has a very low penetration rate in Indonesia, with only <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/02/07/govt-idx-still-hope-to-attract-more-to-invest-in-stock-market.html">about 1.6 million capital market investors</a> in the country, or less than 1% of its population (in comparison, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx">about 55% of Americans own stocks</a>, according to Gallup data).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The very low penetration rate, coupled with <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/08/27/the-rise-of-the-retail-investor-a-new-force-in-indonesias-pandemic-hit-stock-market.html">growing interest in the capital market among retail investors during the pandemic</a>, has spurred VC interest in online investment platforms, especially ones that focus on millennials. Last week, Indonesian investment app Bibit announced a $30 million growth round led by Sequoia Capital India, while another online investment platform, Bareksa, <a href="https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/bareksa-ovo-investment-169842/">confirmed</a> an undisclosed Series B from payment app OVO last year.</p>

<p>Ajaib Group’s founders said it differentiates as a low-fee stock trading platform that also offers mutual funds for diversification. Bibit is a robo-advisor for mutual funds, while Bareksa is a mutual fund marketplace.</p>
<p>In an email, Sumarli and Piyajomkwan told TechCrunch that the stock investment rate is low in Indonesia because it is typically done by high net-worth individuals who use offline brokers and can afford high commissions. Ajaib Group was launched in 2019 after Sumarli became frustrated by the lack of investment platforms in Indonesia where he could also learn about stock trading.</p>
<p>Inspired by companies like Robinhood in the United States and XP Investimentos in Brazil, Ajaib Group was created to be a mobile-first stock trading platform, with no offline brokers or branches. It appeals to first-time investors and millennials with a simple user interface, in-app education features and a community where people can share investment ideas and low fees.</p>
<p>Since people prefer to invest small amounts when trying out the app for the first time, Ajaib requires no minimums to open a brokerage account. Piyajomkwan said “we typically see investors triple their investment amount within the second month of investing with Ajaib.”</p>
<p>Ajaib Group’s platform now includes Ajaib Sekuritas for stock trading and Ajaib Reksadana for mutual funds. The company says that Ajaib Sekuritas became the fifth-largest stock brokerage in Indonesia by number of trades just seven months after it launched in June 2020.</p>
<p>The Indonesian government and Indonesia Stock Exchange have launched initiatives to encourage more stock investing. Some of Ajaib Group’s Series A will be used for its #MentorInvestai campaign, which works with the government to educate millennials about investing and financial planning. The round will also be spent on expanding Ajaib’s tech infrastructure and products, and to hire more engineers.</p>
<p>Ajaib may eventually expand into other Southeast Asian markets, but for the near future, it sees plenty of opportunity in Indonesia. “Ajaib was built with regional aspiration, having two founders from the two biggest capital markets in Southeast Asia, Indonesia and Thailand,” Piyajomkwan said. “But for the immediate term, we are focused on Indonesia as investment penetration is still low and there are many more millennial investors we can serve.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It might be easier at this point to ask which tech platforms President Donald Trump can still use.</p>
<p>Payment-processing company <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stripe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stripe">Stripe <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is the latest tech company to kick Donald Trump off of its platform, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/stripe-stops-processing-payments-for-trump-campaign-website-11610319116">according to a report in The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>That means the president&#8217;s campaign website and online fundraising arms will no longer have access to the payment processor&#8217;s services, cutting off the Trump campaign from receiving donations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sources told the Journal that the reason for the company&#8217;s decision was the violation of company policies against encouraging violence.</p>
<p>The move comes as the president has remained largely silent through the official channels at his disposal in the wake of last week&#8217;s riot at the Capitol building.</p>
<p>While Trump has been silent, technology companies have been busy repudiating the president&#8217;s support by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">cutting off access to a range of services</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/"> deplatforming of the president</a> has effectively removed Trump from all social media outlets including Snap, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Spotify and TikTok.</p>
<p>The technology companies that power most financial transactions online have also blocked the president. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shopify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shopify">Shopify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/paypal" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="paypal">PayPal <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> were the first to take action against the extremists among President Trump supporters who participated in the riot.</p>
<p>As we wrote earlier this week, PayPal has been <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/paypal-and-shopify-remove-trump-related-accounts-citing-policies-against-supporting-violence/">deactivating the accounts of some groups of Trump supporters</a> who were using the money-transfer fintech to coordinate payments to underwrite the rioters’ actions on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>The company has actually been actively taking steps against far-right activists for a while. After the Charlottesville protests and subsequent rioting in 2017, the company <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paypal-suspends-dozens-of-racist-groups-sites-altright-com/">banned a spate of far-right organizations</a>. These bans have so far not extended directly to the president himself from what TechCrunch can glean.</p>
<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/shopify-pulls-donald-trump-stores-off-its-website/">Shopify announced that it was removing the storefronts</a> for both the Trump campaign and Trump’s personal brand. That’s an evolution on policy for the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/09/shopify-ceo-attempts-to-defend-continued-hosting-of-breitbarts-online-store/">which years ago said that it would not moderate its platform</a>, but in recent years has removed some controversial stores, such as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-05/shopify-bans-some-right-wing-groups-after-activist-pressure?sref=AwwRcx4b">some right-wing shops in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Stripe has joined the actions against the president, cutting off a lucrative source of income for his political operations.</p>
<p>As the Journal reported, the Trump campaign launched a fundraising blitz to raise money for the slew of lawsuits that the president brought against states around the country. The lawsuits were almost all defeated, but the effort did bring in <a class="icon none" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-rnc-raised-207-5-million-after-election-day-11607042954?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> for the Republican party.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hbo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hbo">HBO <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> miniseries &#8220;The Undoing&#8221; wrapped up back in November, but the hosts of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a> took advantage of the holidays to get caught up.</p>
<p>Based on a novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz, &#8220;The Undoing&#8221; tells the story of Grace Fraser (played by Nicole Kidman), a Manhattan psychologist whose husband Jonathan (Hugh Grant) is accused of a brutal murder. As the trial turns into a media spectacle, Grace tries to navigate how she feels about her husband and to discover who else might be guilty of the crime.</p>
<p>While Jordan had already watched the show as it aired, Anthony and Darrell were inspired to binge it thanks to an email from listener Michael Benedosso, who shared some amusing thoughts on Kidman&#8217;s wavering attempts at a New York accent — resulting in what he called &#8220;a world tour expressed via spoken word.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We agreed that Kidman&#8217;s accent left a lot to be desired, and that her performance often felt a bit oblique (the latter, at least, was probably intentional).</p>
<p>We had other quibbles. For one thing, although the cast is relatively diverse, the story spends most of its time on the wealthy white family at its center, as their wealthy white friends. And there were perhaps a few too many red herrings that didn&#8217;t lead anywhere interesting.</p>
<p>Still, we were pretty satisfied in the end. With only six episodes and plenty of plot twists, there was really no time to get bored, and we were particularly impressed by Grant&#8217;s performance as Jonathan, as well as Noah Jupe as the Frasers&#8217; adolescent son Henry and Noma Dumezweni as Jonathan&#8217;s steely lawyer Haley.</p>
<p>Before reviewing he show, we also discussed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/discovery-plus-launch/">the recent launch of the Discovery+ streaming service</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lenovo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lenovo">Lenovo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> seems to have gotten the memo that the real money in the augmented reality space is going to be made in enterprise. Ahead of tomorrow’s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> kick off, the hardware company announced the impending arrival of the ThinkReality A3, a pair of enterprise AR glasses that look to follow the lead set by companies like Epson and Microsoft.</p>
<p>The glasses are set to arrive at some point in the middle of the year. No word from Lenovo on pricing &#8212; which isn’t entirely surprising for an enterprise-only device. The headset sports a 1080p resolution, powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR1 chip. A pair of fish-eye cameras provide motion tracking, while an eight-megapixel RGB camera grabs video for remote use.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094012" style="width: 4010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094012" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2094012 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png" alt="" width="4000" height="3000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4000px) 100vw, 4000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094012" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Lenovo</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The device is designed to tether to a PC or a handful of Motorola (owned by Lenovo) phones via USB-C. The glasses follow the announcement of the ThinkReality A6 head-mounted display, which offers a more traditional form factor (insofar as there is a traditional form factor for AR, I suppose).</p>
<p>“For use in scenarios from factory floors and laboratories to busy retail and hospitality spaces, certified turnkey applications on the Think Reality platform powers remote assistance, guided workflows, and 3D visualization,” the company writes. “Now, industrial workers have a light, flexible, and scalable set of smart glasses to increase productivity and safety while decreasing error rates in daily tasks.”</p>
<p>Clearly Lenovo thinks the immediate future for AR is in the enterprise space. The company has dabbled with it a bit in the consumer space with products like the Star Wars Jedi Challenges headset, but for now at least, that feels like something of a one-off.</p>
