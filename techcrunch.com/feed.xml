										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A partnership between the University of North Carolina&#8217;s Kenan Flagler Entrepreneurship Center, the <a href="https://opportunityhub.co/ourstory/">Opportunity Hub</a>, and <a href="https://blackangels.co/">100 Black Angels and Allies Fund</a>, set up to improve representation and support of diverse founders in the tech industry, is getting more heavy-hitting partners from Duke and Stanford.</p>
<p>As part of the partnership, faculty affiliated with Stanford and Duke will join educators to staff the <a href="https://eship.unc.edu/course/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-solutions-deis-certificate-program/?utm_source=Eship&amp;utm_medium=deis%20announce&amp;utm_campaign=deis%20LP">DEIS Practicum Certificate</a> and <a href="https://eship.unc.edu/course/black-technology-ecosystem-investment-certificate/?utm_source=Eship&amp;utm_medium=deis%20announce&amp;utm_campaign=investors%20LP">Black Technology Ecosystem Investment Certificate</a> programs, which, respectively, try to address ways in which management can engage in diversity and inclusion in a systemic way beyond simply human resources hires and equity in compensation and ways in which more Black investors can become involved in backing startups. <span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In order to address issues like DEI at a systemic organizational level and to address the pervasive issues causing the wealth gap, we need to work together to help make this kind of education more readily available,” said Entrepreneurship Center Executive Director Vickie Gibbs, in a statement. “Together, we are taking action and making progress toward creating a more equitable society and entrepreneurial community.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The addition of affiliated faculty from the Stanford Technology Ventures program and Duke University does more than just further validate the program, according to Rodney Sampson, the executive chairman and chief executive of OHUB and co-founder and general partner of 199 Black Allies &amp; Angels fund. For Sampson, who also serves as a visiting professor at the University of North Carolina and Duke, the addition of the two schools will mean more exposure among the two universities&#8217; alumni</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It also expands the reach of these solutions and insights into the alumni and entrepreneurial communities of these two amazing universities,&#8221; said Sampson in a statement. </span></p>
<p>The framework that Sampson has developed involves a multi-pronged approach for employers that includes: a review of the extent to which diversity, equity, and inclusion is operationalized in corporate boards and governance; in assessments of hiring, promotion and human resources practices; in procurement and vendor services; in innovation and product development; in resources on going to market to reach diverse audiences; in investments into Black and Latino communities, and in monitoring the impact of the business&#8217; operations on the community.</p>
<p>The framework was recently cited in a report from no less auspicious an organization than the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/from-commitments-to-action-how-ceos-can-advance-racial-equity-in-their-regional-economies/">Brookings Institution</a> in a paper authored by Amy Liu and Reniya Dinkins.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;When chief executives demonstrate their own work to dismantle bias and create a culture of true belonging, it provides a level of trust and credibility needed for these firms and leaders to collaborate with others in bringing about broader progress and sustained prosperity in their home regions,&#8221; the authors wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Stanford University in particular, the opportunity to embrace diversity and education training comes as the university tries to rehabilitate an image tarnished after its rush to embrace policies crafted by the former White House administration that called for<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/11/17/stanford-rushes-to-comply-with-trump-executive-order-limiting-diversity-training/"> universities to limit diversity training</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For too long, diversity, equity and inclusion have been an afterthought in entrepreneurship and innovation. I am grateful to be collaborating with thoughtful, action-oriented colleagues to address systemic racism. Together, we&#8217;ll be able to create important new network connections between our organizations and to develop learning insights that can be shared with educators and organizations around the world, &#8221; added Tom Byers, Keohane Distinguished Visiting Professor at UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke University and STVP Faculty Director.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sonos has a new speaker that starts shipping later this month, and it&#8217;s a significant departure from the company&#8217;s usual offerings in a number of ways. The all-new <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/roam.html">Sonos Roam</a> is a compact, portable speaker with a built-in battery and Bluetooth connectivity — but still very much a Sonos system team player, with wifi streaming, multi-room feature, voice assistant support and surprisingly great sound quality.</p>
<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>Priced at $179, the Sonos Roam is truly diminutive, at just over 6 inches, by roughly 2.5 inches for both height and depth. It weighs under a pound, and is available in either a matte white or black finish, which is par for the course for Sonos in terms of colorways. Roam is also IP67-rated, meaning it&#8217;s effectively waterproof, with a resistance rating of up to 30 minutes at depths of up to 1 meter (3.3 feet).</p>
<p>Sonos has placed the speaker&#8217;s control surface at one end of the device, including a microphone button, volume controls and a play/pause button. These are actual, tactile buttons, rather than touch-sensitive surfaces like you&#8217;d find on other Sonos speakers, which makes sense for a speaker designed to be used on the go, and in conditions where touch controls might get flummoxed by things like rain and water.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2134427" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>The Roam also has a power button on the back, next to a USB-C port for charging. It also offers wireless charging, via a receiver found in the base of the speaker, which can be used with Sonos&#8217; own forthcoming magnetic charging adapter (sold separately), or with any standard Qi-powered wireless charger you want.</p>
<p>In addition to wifi streaming, Sonos Roam can also connect to any device via Bluetooth 5.0. It also features AirPlay 2 for connecting to Apple devices when on wifi, and it works out of the box with Spotify Connect. The built-in battery is rated for up to 10 hours of playback on a full charge, according to Sonos, and can also provide up to 10 days of its sleep-like standby mode.</p>
<h2>Design and performance</h2>
<p>This is the smallest speaker yet released by Sonos, and that&#8217;s definitely a big plus when it comes to this category of device. The dimensions make it feel like a slightly taller can of Red Bull, which should give you some sense of just how portable it is. Unlike Sonos&#8217; first portable speaker with a built-in battery, the Sonos Move, the Roam truly feels like something designed to be thrown in a bag and brought with you wherever you happen to need it.</p>
<p>Despite its small size, the Sonos Roam offers impressive sound — likely the best I&#8217;ve yet encountered for a portable speaker in this size class. Inside, it manages to pack in dual amplifiers, one tweeter and a separate custom racetrack mid-woofer, which Sonos developed to help deliver both lows and mids with a faithfulness that normally escapes smaller speakers. The Roam also gets a lot louder than you&#8217;d probably expect it could, while keeping audio quality clear and free of distortion at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2134425" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>One of the keys to the Roam&#8217;s great sound quality is Sonos&#8217; Automatic Trueplay tech, which tunes the audio to best suit its surroundings actively and continually. This feature requires that the mic be enabled to work, but it&#8217;s well worth having on in most settings, and makes a big difference while streaming in both Bluetooth and wifi modes. This also helps the speaker adjust when it&#8217;s switched from horizontal to vertical orientation, and it&#8217;s one of the main reasons that the Roam punches above its weight relative to other speakers in this size and price category.</p>
<p>The Roam would be a winner based on audio quality alone for the price, but the extra Sonos system-specific features it boasts really elevate it to a true category leader. These include a standby mode that preserves battery while keeping the Roam available to your system for wifi streaming via the Sonos app (handy, and also optional since you can hold the power button down for five seconds to truly power off and preserve your charge for even longer, which is great for travel).</p>
<p>One of Roam&#8217;s truly amazing abilities is a hand-off feature that passes playback of whatever you&#8217;re using it to listen to on to the nearest Sonos speaker in your system when you long press the play/pause button. This works almost like magic, and is a great speaker superpower for if you&#8217;re wandering around the house and the yard doing chores with the Roam in your pocket.</p>
<h2><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2134426" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>Bottom line</h2>
<p>Sonos waited a long time to release their first travel-friendly portable speaker, but they obviously used that time wisely. The Sonos Roam is the most thoughtfully-designed, feature-rich and best-sounding portable speaker you can get for under $200 (and better than many more expensive options, at that). Even if you don&#8217;t already have a Sonos system to use it with, it&#8217;s an easy choice if you&#8217;re in the market for a portable, rugged Bluetooth speaker — and if you&#8217;re already a Sonos convert, the decision gets that much easier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Machine learning (ML) models are only as good as the data you feed them. That&#8217;s true during training, but also once a model is put in production. In the real world, the data itself can change as new events occur and even small changes to how databases and APIs report and store data could have implications on how the models react. Since ML models will simply give you wrong predictions and not throw an error, it&#8217;s imperative that businesses monitor their data pipelines for these systems.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where tools like <a href="https://www.aporia.com/">Aporia</a> come in. The Tel Aviv-based company today announced that it has raised a $5 million seed round for its monitoring platform for ML models. The investors are Vertex Ventures and TLV Partners.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134288" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/screen1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134288" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2134288" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/screen1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="563" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/screen1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/screen1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/screen1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/screen1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/screen1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/screen1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2134288" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aporia</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aporia co-founder and CEO Liran Hason, after five years with the Israel Defense Forces, previously worked on the data science team at Adallom, a security company that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/08/microsoft-confirms-purchase-of-cloud-security-firm-adallom/">acquired by Microsoft in 2015</a>. After the sale, he joined venture firm Vertex Ventures before starting Aporia in late 2019. But it was during his time at Adallom where he first encountered the problems that Aporio is now trying to solve.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was responsible for the production architecture of the machine learning models,&#8221; he said of his time at the company. &#8220;So that&#8217;s actually where, for the first time, I got to experience the challenges of getting models to production and all the surprises that you get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea behind Aporia, Hason explained, is to make it easier for enterprises to implement machine learning models and leverage the power of AI in a responsible manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;AI is a super powerful technology,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But unlike traditional software, it highly relies on the data. Another unique characteristic of AI, which is very interesting, is that when it fails, it fails silently. You get no exceptions, no errors. That becomes really, really tricky, especially when getting to production, because in training, the data scientists have full control of the data.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as Hason noted, a production system may depend on data from a third-party vendor and that vendor may one day change the data schema without telling anybody about it. At that point, a model &#8212; say for predicting whether a bank&#8217;s customer may default on a loan &#8212; can&#8217;t be trusted anymore, but it may take weeks or months before anybody notices.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How artificial intelligence will be used in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/how-artificial-intelligence-will-be-used-in-2021/embed/#?secret=RKQYoFNfLq" data-secret="RKQYoFNfLq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Aporia constantly tracks the statistical behavior of the incoming data and when that drifts too far away from the training set, it will alert its users.</p>
<p>One thing that makes Aporio unique is that it gives its users an almost IFTTT or Zapier-like graphical tool for setting up the logic of these monitors. It comes pre-configured with more than 50 combinations of monitors and provides full visibility in how they work behind the scenes. That, in turn, allows businesses to fine-tune the behavior of these monitors for their own specific business case and model.</p>
<p>Initially, the team thought it could build generic monitoring solutions. But the team realized that this wouldn&#8217;t only be a very complex undertaking, but that the data scientists who build the models also know exactly how those models should work and what they need from a monitoring solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monitoring production workloads is a well-established software engineering practice, and it&#8217;s past time for machine learning to be monitored at the same level,&#8221; said Rona <span id="m_-8268495363104750682gmail-m_4802936678506691575gmail-m_8577113331375561002:2x4.31">Segev</span>, founding partner at  <span id="m_-8268495363104750682gmail-m_4802936678506691575gmail-m_8577113331375561002:2x4.32">TLV</span> Partners. &#8220;<span id="m_-8268495363104750682gmail-m_4802936678506691575gmail-m_8577113331375561002:2x4.33"><span class="il">Aporia</span>&#8216;s</span> team has strong production-engineering experience, which makes their solution stand out as simple, secure and robust.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At its Octane21 conference, Okta, the popular authentication and identity platform, today announced a new &#8212; and free &#8212; developer edition that features fewer limitations and support for significantly more monthly active users than its current free plan.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its <a href="https://www.okta.com/oktane21/">Octane21</a> conference, <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>, the popular authentication and identity platform, today <a href="https://www.okta.com/press/the-new-okta-developer-experience">announced</a> a new &#8212; and free &#8212; developer edition that features fewer limitations and support for significantly more monthly active users than its current free plan.</p>
<p>The new &#8216;<span class="il">Okta</span> Starter Developer Edition,&#8217; as it&#8217;s called, allows developers to scale up to 15,000 monthly active users &#8212; up from only 1,000 on its existing free plan. In addition, the company is also launching enhanced documentation, a set of sample apps and new SDKs, which now cover languages and frameworks like Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, Vue.js, React Native and Spring Boot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our overall philosophy isn&#8217;t, &#8216;we want to just provide [&#8230;] a set of authentication and authorization services.&#8217; The way we&#8217;re looking at this is, &#8216;hey, app developer, how do we provide you the foundation you need to get up and running quickly with authorization and authentication as one part of it,&#8217; &#8221; Diya Jolly, Okta&#8217;s chief product officer, told me. And she believes that Okta is in a unique position to do so, because it doesn&#8217;t only offer tools to manage authorization and access, but also systems for securing microservices and providing applications with access to privileged resources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2134328" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sample-apps.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134328" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2134328" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sample-apps.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="580" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2134328" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Okta</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that, while the deal hasn&#8217;t closed yet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/">Okta&#8217;s intent to acquire Auth0</a> significantly extends its developer strategy, given Auth0&#8217;s developer-first approach.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Making sense of the $6.5B Okta-Auth0 deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/making-sense-of-the-6-5b-okta-auth0-deal/embed/#?secret=cj0rER7Dju" data-secret="cj0rER7Dju" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As for the expanded free account, Jolly noted that the company found that developers wanted to be able to access more of the service&#8217;s features during their prototyping phases. That means the new free Developer Edition comes with support for multi-factor authentication, machine-to-machine tokens and B2B integrations, for example, in addition to expanded support for integrations into toolchains. As is so often the case with enterprise tools, the free edition doesn&#8217;t come with the usual enterprise support options and has lower rate limits than the paid plans.</p>
<p>Still, and Jolly acknowledged this, a small to medium-sized business may be able to build applications and take them into production based on this new free plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;15K [monthly active users] is is a lot, but if you look at our customer base, it&#8217;s about the right amount for the smaller business applications, the real SMBs, and that was the goal. In a developer motion, you want people to try out things and then upgrade. I think that&#8217;s the key. No developer is going to come and build with you if you don&#8217;t have a free offering that they can tinker around and play with.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134339" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dev-onboarding-UI.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134339" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2134339" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dev-onboarding-UI.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="528" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2134339" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Okta</p></div></p>
<p>She noted that the company has spent a lot of time thinking about how to support developers through the application development lifecycle overall. That includes better CLI tools for developers who would rather bypass Okta&#8217;s web-based console, for example, and additional integrations with tools like Terraform, Kong and Heroku. &#8220;Today, [developers] have to stitch together identity and Okta into those experiences &#8212; or they use some other identity &#8212; we&#8217;ve pre-stitched all of this for them,&#8221; Jolly said.</p>
<p>The new Okta Starter Developer Edition, as well as the new documentation, sample applications and integrations, are now available at <a href="http://developer.okta.com/">developer.okta.com</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital transformation is the name of the game these days, and companies that are enabling businesses to take a leap into the future, by helping them tackle their most complex operations, are reaping the rewards. In the latest development, <a href="https://www.onestreamsoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OneStream</a>, a startup that provides a toolkit of services to enterprises to help them run financial operations (for example, reporting, planning, tax and more), has raised $200 million in primary equity. The funding values OneStream at $6 billion.</p>
<p>D1 Capital Partners led the financing, with participation from Tiger Global and Investment Group of Santa Barbara (IGSB), the company said. Tiger Global and D1 appear to share at least one common backer, Tiger Management, which may be one reason why you see them together in many big deals.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the funding to continue building out the tools that it provides to customers, and to keep up with demand for its services as more customers replace legacy applications and very basic, spreadsheet-based operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We remain sharply focused on delivering innovative planning, reporting and analysis solutions designed to help our customers succeed for today’s fast-paced and increasingly complex business environment,&#8221; said Tom Shea, CEO of <span class="il">OneStream</span> Software, in a statement. &#8220;The valuation we received is great recognition of the value our employees and stakeholders have helped to create, as well as the exciting opportunities ahead for <span class="il">OneStream</span>.”</p>
<p>To put these large numbers into some context, OneStream was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kkr-agrees-to-take-majority-stake-in-financial-software-maker-onestream-11549535401">valued at $1 billion only two years ago</a>, when KKR took a majority stake in the company worth more than $500 million. The company&#8217;s CFO Bill Koefoed has confirmed to us that KKR will continue to be &#8220;substantially OneStream’s largest shareholder and remains a very supportive investor&#8221;. The company meanwhile appears to be holding off any plans for going public for the time being &#8212; <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2021/02/25/kkr-owned-onestream-software-could-go-public/?sh=159d4f047a90" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despite some possible hints</a> that it was considering that move.</p>
<p>&#8220;OneStream is currently focused on delivering 100% customer access, continuing to grow the business and creating value for stakeholders,&#8221; Koefoed said. &#8220;IPO is a potential exit and OneStream is preparing to be a public company. However, there is no specific timeline.&#8221;</p>
<p>The growth in valuation, meanwhile, reflects the surge of business that OneStream has seen in the last two years, and in particular in the last 12 months, as companies have been compelled to update their systems to work more efficiently and flexibly amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the impact it has had around in-person interactions. OneStream said annual recurring revenue grew 85% in 2020, with customers growing by 40% to 650 enterprises.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s focus is specifically in the area commonly called corporate performance management (CPM), which includes a number of the financial corporate operations that a company runs behind the scenes to keep its business ticking.</p>
<p>Some of these would have fallen to a range of software providers, and much of the work would have been carried out by way of on-premise solutions, with companies like SAP, Oracle Hyperion, IBM dominating the space with all-in solutions, and others like Anaplan and Blackline providing point solutions addressing specific aspects of those functions.</p>
<p>But as with other areas of enterprise services, the advances of technology and software have created opportunities to take a lot of that functionality into the cloud and to run the processes across a single system to improve analytics and efficiency, and that has provided an opportunity to the likes of OneStream.</p>
<p>The impact of the pandemic should not be underestimated in this trend, and it was one that OneStream was able to nail because its software can be used across disparate teams and can draw a direct line to helping companies manage their finances better. And unlike a lot of tech companies that raise venture funding, one interesting detail with OneStream is that it has extended its customer base well outside the realm of technology companies and other early adopters. <a href="https://www.onestreamsoftware.com/testimonials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Those using its software</a> include the likes of Fruit of the Loom, McCain (the frozen fries king), and AAA, but also Takeaway.com, the Carlyle Group and many others.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pandemic accelerated OneStream’s business given that it was a wake-up call for many companies that had not digitally transformed their key finance processes,&#8221; said Koefoed. &#8220;As a result, we have seen increased demand from companies who were using spreadsheets or legacy CPM applications to manage their financial close, consolidation, reporting, planning and forecasting processes&#8230; <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">They are better able to keep their finance teams connected and collaborating while physically dispersed. In addition, we have seen many organizations increasing the frequency of their forecasting and scenario modeling from quarterly or monthly to weekly and daily in some cases, especially during the early days of the pandemic when modeling revenue and cash flow was critical.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>For investors, the interest more specifically was how OneStream managed to add more customers away from competitors in the last year.</p>
<p>“<span class="il">OneStream</span>’s platform delivers exceptional customer value,” said Andrew Wynne, a principal at D1 Capital Partners, in a statement. “Management’s intense focus on customer success has enabled <span class="il">OneStream</span> to capture significant market share from incumbents, while posting strong growth in both revenue and customer acquisition. We believe <span class="il">OneStream</span> has both the vision and product required to be a dominant force in its industry.”</p>
<p>Going forward, it sounds like the company will continue to build on what it has already established. That will include more business into Asia Pacific alongside its current operations in North America and Europe, Koefoed said. It will also use its foothold in finance and providing services to the finance department to make inroads into other areas that link closely to money management: money spending and revenue generation, with tools to plan and operate in areas like HR, IT, sales, marketing, supply chain management &#8220;and other areas to ensure alignment and optimal resource allocations,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union may investigate Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/">$1BN acquisition</a> of customer service platform Kustomer after concerns were referred to it under EU merger rules.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Commission confirmed it received a request to refer the proposed acquisition from Austria under Article 22 of the EU&#8217;s Merger Regulation &#8212; a mechanism which allows Member States to flag a proposed transaction that&#8217;s not notifiable under national filing thresholds (e.g. because the turnover of one of the companies is too low for a formal notification).</p>
<p>The Commission spokeswoman said the case was notified in Austria on March 31.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Following the receipt of an Article 22 request for referral, the Commission has to transmit the request for referral to other Member States without delay, who will have the right to join the original referral request within 15 working days of being informed by the Commission of the original request,&#8221; she told us, adding: &#8220;Following the expiry of the deadline for other Member States to join the referral, the Commission will have 10 working days to decide whether to accept or reject the referral.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll know in a few weeks whether or not the European Commission will take a look at the acquisition &#8212; an option that could see the transaction stalled for months, delaying Facebook&#8217;s plans for integrating Kustomer&#8217;s platform into its empire.</p>
<p>Facebook and Kustomer have been contacted for comment on the development.</p>
<p>The tech giant&#8217;s planned purchase of the customer relations management platform was announced last November and quickly raised concerns over what Facebook might do with any personal data held by Kustomer &#8212; which could include sensitive information, given sectors served by the platform include healthcare, government and financial services, among others.</p>
<p>Back in February, the <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Kustomer-regulatory-authorities.pdf">Irish Council for Civil Liberties</a> (ICCL) wrote to the Commission and national and EU data protection agencies to raise concerns about the proposed acquisition &#8212; urging scrutiny of the &#8220;data processing consequences&#8221;, and highlighting how Kustomer&#8217;s terms allow it to process user data for very wide-ranging purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook is acquiring this company. The scope of &#8216;improving our Services&#8217; [in Kustomer&#8217;s terms] is already broad, but is likely to grow broader after Kustomer is acquired,&#8221; the ICCL warned. &#8220;&#8216;Our Services&#8217; may, for example, be taken to mean any Facebook services or systems or projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The settled caselaw of the European Court of Justice, and the European data protection board, that &#8216;improving our services&#8217; and similarly vague statements do not qualify as a &#8216;processing purpose&#8217;,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>The ICCL also said it had written to Facebook asking for confirmation of the post-acquisition processing purposes for which people&#8217;s data will be used.</p>
<p>Johnny Ryan, senior fellow at the ICCL, confirmed to TechCrunch it has not had any response from Facebook to those questions.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also asked Facebook to confirm what it will do with any personal data held on users by Kustomer once it owns the company &#8212; and will update this report with any response.</p>
<p>In a separate (recent) episode &#8212; involving Google &#8212; its acquisition of wearable maker Fitbit went through months of competition scrutiny in the EU and was only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/">cleared by regional regulators</a> after the tech giant made a number of concessions, including committing not to use Fitbit data for ads for ten years.</p>
<p>Until now Facebook&#8217;s acquisitions have generally flown under regulators&#8217; radar, including, around a decade ago, when it was sewing up the social space by buying up rivals Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Several years later it was forced to pay a fine in the EU over a &#8216;misleading&#8217; filing &#8212; after it combined WhatsApp and Facebook data, despite having told regulators it could not do so.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/a-brief-history-of-facebooks-privacy-hostility-ahead-of-zuckerbergs-testimony/">so many data scandals now inextricably attached to Facebook</a>, the tech giant is saddled with customer mistrust by default and faces far greater scrutiny of how it operates &#8212; which is now threatening to inject friction into its plans to expand its b2b offering by acquiring a CRM player. So after &#8216;move fast and break things&#8217; Facebook is having to move slower because of its reputation for breaking stuff.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google Cloud today announced that it is joining the <a href="https://www.finops.org/">FinOps Foundation</a> as a Premier Member.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.finops.org/">FinOps Foundation</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> is a relatively new open-source foundation, hosted by the Linux Foundation, that launched last year. It aims to bring together companies in the &#8216;cloud financial management&#8217; space to establish best practices and standards. As the term implies, &#8216;cloud financial management,&#8217; is about the tools and practices that help businesses manage and budget their cloud spend. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">There&#8217;s a reason, after all, that there are a number of successful startups that do nothing else but help businesses optimize their cloud spend (and ideally lower it). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Maybe it&#8217;s no surprise that the FinOps Foundation was born out of Cloudability’s quarterly Customer Advisory Board meetings. Until now, CloudHealth by VMware was the Foundation&#8217;s only Premiere Member among its vendor members. <a href="https://landscape.finops.org/card-mode?category=fin-ops-foundation-member&amp;grouping=category&amp;style=logo">Other members</a> include Cloudability, Densify, Kubecost and SoftwareOne. With Google Cloud, the Foundation has now signed up its first major cloud provider.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span class="il">&#8220;FinOps</span> best practices are essential for companies to monitor, analyze, and optimize cloud spend across tens to hundreds of projects that are critical to their business success,&#8221; said Yanbing Li, Vice President of Engineering and Product at Google Cloud. &#8220;More visibility, efficiency, and tools will enable our customers to improve their cloud deployments and drive greater business value. We are excited to join <span class="il">FinOps</span> Foundation, and together with like-minded organizations, we will shepherd behavioral change throughout the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google Cloud has already committed to sending members to some of the Foundation&#8217;s various Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and Working Groups to &#8220;help drive open source standards for cloud financial management.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The practitioners in the <span class="il">FinOps</span> Foundation greatly benefit when market leaders like Google Cloud invest resources and align their product offerings to <span class="il">FinOps</span> principles and standards,&#8221; said J.R. Storment, Executive Director of the <span class="il">FinOps</span> Foundation. &#8220;We are thrilled to see Google Cloud increase its commitment to the <span class="il">FinOps</span> Foundation, joining VMware as the 2nd of 3 dedicated Premier Member Technical Advisory Council seats.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Messaging is the medium these days, and today a startup that has built an API to help others build text and video interactivity into their services is announcing a big round to continue scaling its business. <a href="https://sendbird.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sendbird</a>, a popular provider of chat, video and other interactive services to the likes of Reddit, Hinge, Paytm, Delivery Hero and hundreds of others by way of a few lines of code, has closed a round of $100 million, money that it plans to use to continue expanding the functionalities of its platform to meet our changing interactive times. Sendbird has confirmed that the funding values the company at $1.05 billion.</p>
<p>Today, customers collectively channel some 150 million users through Sendbird&#8217;s APIs to chat with each other and large groups of users over text and video, a figure that has seen a lot of growth in particular in the last year, where people were spending so much more time in front of screens as their primary interface to communicate with the world.</p>
<p>Sendbird already provides some services around that core functionality such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/sendbirds-messaging-platform-gets-new-moderation-tools-full-text-search-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderation and text search</a>. John Kim, Sendbird&#8217;s CEO and founder, said that additional developments like moderation has seen a huge take-up, and services it plans to add into the mix include payments and logistics features, and that it is looking at adding in group audio conversations for customers to build their own Clubhouse clones.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are getting enquiries,&#8221; said Kim. &#8220;We will be setting it up in a personalized way. Voice chat has certainly picked up due to Clubhouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding &#8212; oversubscribed, the company says &#8212; is being led by Steadfast Financial, with Softbank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2 also participating, along with previous backers ICONIQ Capital, Tiger Global Management, and Meritech Capital. It comes about two years after Sendbird closed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/06/sendbird-snags-additional-50m-as-it-extends-series-b-to-102m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B at $102 million</a>, and the startup appears to have nearly doubled its valuation since then: PitchBook estimates it was <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/121369-42/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around $550 million in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>That growth, in a sense, is not a surprise, given not just the climate right now for virtual interaction, but the fact that Sendbird itself has tripled the number of customers using its tools since 2019. The company, co-headquartered in Seoul, Korea and San Mateo, has now raised around $221 million.</p>
<p>The market that Sendbird has been pecking away at since being founded in 2013 is a hefty one.</p>
<p>Messaging apps have become a major digital force, with a small handful of companies overtaking (and taking on) the primary features found on the most basic of phones and finding traction with people by making them easier to use and full of more interesting features to use alongside the basic functionality. That in turn has led a wave of other companies to build in their own communications features, a way both to provide more community for their users, and to keep people on their own platforms in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s an arms race going on between messaging and payment apps,&#8221; Sid Suri, Sendbird&#8217;s marketing head, said to me in describing the competitive landscape. &#8220;There is a high degree of urgency among all businesses to say we don’t have to lose users to any of them. White label services like ours are powering the ability to keep up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sendbird is indeed one of a wave of companies that have identified both that trend and the opportunity of building that functionality out as a commodity of sorts that can be embedded anywhere a developer chooses to place it by way of an API. It&#8217;s not the only one: others in the same space include publicly-listed Twilio, the similarly-named competitor MessageBird (which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/messagebird-series-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also highly capitalised</a> and has positioned itself as a <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210330/p17#a210330p17" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consolidator</a> in the space), PubNub, Sinch, Stream, Firebase and many more.</p>
<p>That competition is one reason why Sendbird has raised money. It gives it more capital to bring on more users, and critically to invest in building out more functionality alongside its core features, to address the needs of its existing users, and to discover new opportunities to provide them with features they perhaps didn&#8217;t know they needed in their messaging channels to keep users&#8217; attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doing a lot around transactions and payments, as well as logistics,&#8221; Kim said in an interview. &#8220;We are really building out the end to end experience [since that] really ties into engagement. A couple of new features will be heavily around transactions, and others will be around more engagement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Karan Mehandru, a partner at Steadfast, is joining the board with this round, and he believes that there remains a huge opportunity especially when you consider the many verticals that have yet to adopt solid and useful communications channels within their services, such as healthcare.</p>
<p>&#8220;The channel that Sendbird is leveraging is the next channel we have come to expect from all brands,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;Sendbird may look the same as others but if you peel the onion, providing a scalable chat experience that is highly customized is a real problem to solve. Large customers think this is critical but not a core competence and then zoom back to Sendbird because they can’t do it. Sendbird is a clear leader. Sendbird is permeating many verticals and types of companies now. This is one of those rare companies that has been at the right place at the right time.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The energy giant Shell has joined a slew of strategic investors including All Nippon Airways, Suncor Energy, Mitsui, and British Airways in funding LanzaJet, the company commercializing a process to convert alcohol into jet fuel. </span></p>
<p>A spin-off from LanzaTech, one of the last surviving climate tech startups from the first cleantech boom that&#8217;s still privately held, LanzaJet is taking a phased investment approach with its corporate backers, enabling them to invest additional capital as the company scales to larger production facilities.</p>
<p>Terms of the initial investment, or LanzaJet&#8217;s valuation after the commitment, were not disclosed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LanzaJet claims that it can help the aviation industry reach net-zero emissions, something that would go a long way toward helping the world meet the emissions reductions targets set in the <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement#:~:text=The%20Paris%20Agreement%20is%20a,compared%20to%20pre%2Dindustrial%20levels.">Paris Agreement</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;LanzaJet&#8217;s technology opens up a new and exciting pathway to produce SAF using an AtJ process and will help address the aviation sector&#8217;s urgent need for SAF. It demonstrates that the industry can move faster and deliver more when we all work together,&#8221; said Anna Mascolo, President, Shell Aviation, in a statement. &#8220;Provided industry, government and society collaborate on appropriate policy mechanisms and regulations to drive both supply and demand, aviation can achieve net-zero carbon emissions. The strategic fit with LanzaJet is exciting.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>LanzaJet is currently building an alcohol-to-jet fuel facility in Soperton, Ga. Upon completion it would be the first commercial scale plant for sustainable synthetic jet fuel with a capacity of 10 million gallons per year.</p>
<p>The fuel is made by using an ethanol inputs &#8212; something that Shell is very familiar with. It&#8217;s also something that the oil giant has in ready supply. Through the Raízen joint venture in Brazil, Shell has been producing bio-ethanol for over ten years.</p>
<p>The company expects that its sustainable fuel will be mixed with conventional fossil jet fuel to power airplanes in a lower carbon intensity way. Roughly 90% of the company&#8217;s production output will be aviation fuel, while the remaining 10% will be renewable diesel, the company said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> LanzaJet’s SAF is approved to be blended up to 50% with fossil jet fuel, the maximum allowed  by ASTM, and is a drop-in fuel that requires no modifications to engines, aircraft, and infrastructure.  Additionally, LanzaJet’s SAF delivers more than a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on a  lifecycle basis, compared to conventional fossil jet fuel. The versatility in ethanol, and a focus on low carbon, waste-based, and non-food /non-feed sources, along with ethanol’s global availability, make  LanzaJet’s technology a relevant and enduring solution for SAF. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Death, despite being one of the most inevitable of life&#8217;s events, can also be one of the most complicated and problematic. Fraught with emotional and religious complexities, for many families it can also come with financial and organizational ones. Today, a startup called <a href="http://empathy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Empathy</a> is coming out of stealth with the aim of taking some of the stigma out of working on some of those challenges head-on, with an AI-based platform for families to help organize affairs (and thus indirectly help assist in those families attending to themselves) after a death.</p>
<p>&#8220;On average, a family can spend 500 hours dealing with the different aspects related to the death of a loved one,&#8221; said CEO Ron Gura, who co-founded the company with Yonatan Bergman. &#8220;We provide a digital companion in the form of native apps that are built to empower bereaved families.&#8221; He said he likens Empathy to a &#8220;GPS for the recently bereaved.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Israeli startup is launching first in the U.S. market, and it&#8217;s doing so with $13 million in funding co-led by VCs General Catalyst and Aleph.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some 3 million people on average die in the U.S. each year &#8212; a number that has seen <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/excess-mortality-p-scores" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some spikes more recently due to Covid-19</a>. And despite it being one of the more natural and predictable of things that we will all go through sooner or later, it&#8217;s not something that many people prepare for, whether it&#8217;s due to fear or religion or simply not wanting to dwell on morbid subjects. Ironically, that hasn&#8217;t been helped by the fact that it has in turn created a pretty significant stigma around building services to help people deal with it, either for themselves, or on behalf of others.</p>
<p>In very typical startup fashion, this spells opportunity, of course.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve been obsessed with this narrative for a few years,&#8221; said Gura, who previously worked with Berman at The Gifts Project and then later at eBay in Israel after it acquired the social gifting startup. &#8220;Death is one of the last consumer sectors that is untouched by innovation. It’s not because of technology or even a regulatory barrier. It seems it&#8217;s mainly because of the inherent optimism in us and our human nature that causes us to avoid talking about the inevitable truth of death and dying. So there is an unspoken sector that is not seeing transformation that pretty much every other sector is seeing these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also, I suspect, because death makes people incredibly vulnerable, and any enterprise based around vulnerability feels off.</p>
<p>Empathy&#8217;s approach is to make its help, and the building of a business around that idea, as transparent as possible. The company offers services for free for the first 30 days, and after that you pay a one-off fee of $65, which does not go up the longer you use the service, which could be five months or five years (or yes, longer).</p>
<p>After you fill in a few details about your particular circumstance, you are then guided through a step-by-step process of all of the different things one needs to deal with after a person dies.</p>
<p>These include things like the first, immediate arrangements you might need to make, how to inform others (and informing them), organising a funeral or other ceremony, procuring the right documents, dealing with the will, securing the deceased&#8217;s identity, dealing with his/her property, organising a probate, settling benefits and accounts, and bills, and other assets, taxes and perhaps bereavement counseling for ourselves. For many of us, not only are we upset, but we may have never had to go through these processes before, and it&#8217;s a surreal learning curve to be experiencing when you are already on a potential emotional rollercoaster.</p>
<p>The idea with Empathy is that while some of these will require some lifting from you, the platform will play the part of a &#8220;digital assistant&#8221; by helping prompt what you need to do next, and give you guidance for how to get through that. It doesn&#8217;t refer you to others; it doesn&#8217;t advertise other services and never plans to. The data that does go into the platform, Gura said, will not be used anywhere other than where you are channelling it for the purposes of settling affairs.</p>
<p>Empathy is not the first but the next in an interesting and slowly growing cluster of startups tackling this area. Others include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/uks-farewill-raises-25m-for-its-new-approach-online-will-writing-funerals-and-other-death-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Farewill</a> in the UK, helping people write wills for themselves; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/lantern-is-a-startup-looking-to-ignite-a-conversation-about-how-to-die-well/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lantern</a> to help open up the conversation about death and planning for it; and estate planning startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/trust-will-raises-15m-as-digital-estate-planning-hits-mainstream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trust &amp; Will</a>. Competition, perhaps, but at least for now showing that there can be helpful tech build even for the more difficult areas of life.</p>
<p>“The end-of-life industry is a large sector that has been untouched by the wave of digital transformation occurring in every other industry,” said Joel Cutler, MD and co-founder of General Catalyst, in a statement. “Empathy is unique in that it addresses both the emotional and logistical anguish of loss.  We believe this is the technology and experience that can greatly benefit every family.”</p>
<p>“The Empathy team is directing their vast experience in consumer software to significantly improve how people handle the burdens that come with death,” added Michael Eisenberg, partner and co-founder at Aleph. “When grieving, many families do not have the bandwidth to deal with tasks and bureaucracy. By combining financial technology and emotional understanding, Empathy has built a product for the next-of kin with compassion at its core.”</p>
<p>Longer term, Gura said that Empathy may look to tackle other aspects of the process, such as organizing affairs before the death of a loved one, or perhaps looking at other problematic life events, like divorce, that also spur a lot of obligations in their aftermath.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, podcasts have been aimed at consumers. The value to be gained in the B2B world is something that has been largely untapped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsaytjepkema/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindsay Tjepkema</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; who has been entrenched in the world of B2B marketing for more than 15 years &#8212; the opportunity was massive. So in 2019, she founded </span><a href="https://casted.us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an audio and video podcast product aimed at B2B marketers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now Casted has raised $7 million in Series A funding led by </span><a href="https://revolution.com/entity/ventures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revolution Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers High Alpha Capital, Elevate Ventures and Tappan Hill Ventures also participated in the financing, which brings Indianapolis-based Casted’s total raised to about $9.3 million since its inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 was a good year for Casted. The startup quadrupled its revenue, tripled its customer base and doubled the size of its team during the course of the 12-month period. It has an impressive list of customers, including PayPal, HubSpot, Drift and ZoomInfo. Casted’s platform is also “the system of record” for Salesforce’s 25+ podcasting shows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And to make things even more impressive, that revenue growth looks more like 8x year over year, according to Tjepkema.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She believes the company’s value prop goes beyond just giving companies a way to get their podcasts out there. Its ability to analyze data and turn that into intelligence for sales and marketing is what really sets it apart, she said.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;More thoughts on growing podcasts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/more-thoughts-on-growing-podcasts/embed/#?secret=RVkBaQGBZg" data-secret="RVkBaQGBZg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you&#8217;re a podcaster, and you&#8217;re doing it to grow a large audience, monetize and sell advertising, the number of downloads is important,” Tjepkema told TechCrunch. “But when you&#8217;re a B2B company or an enterprise company, the number of downloads doesn&#8217;t help. You need to know who&#8217;s engaged, how are people interacting with the content and then how is that going to impact revenue and pipeline, and customer loyalty and lifetime value.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, Casted’s SaaS platform gives marketing teams a way to publish content. Once published, Casted provides access to a “fully searchable content archive” with transcription services and tagging. It then also helps the company amplify that content via cross-channel distribution. And finally &#8212; largely by integrating with digital marketing platforms such as HubSpot, WordPress and Marketo &#8212; Casted’s software provides analytics on what a specific user is paying attention to. Those data-driven analytics becomes valuable information for sales and marketing teams in terms of who to target and why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because everything that&#8217;s in the platform is transcribed, there are ways to clip it up and share it across other channels and get that into the hands of your sales team so they can use it to make their conversations with their customers even easier,” Tjepkema said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revolution Ventures Managing Partner David Golden said that marketing technology has been a difficult sector for his firm to invest in, considering the volume of companies providing a variety of services such as email optimization and sales automation and business intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But what Lindsay and her team was building out was clearly a new category in this space and the sort of slap-your-forehead category. Of course, podcasting for B2B marketing makes all the sense in the world when you look at the evolution of tools that have been available to business marketers, such as blogs, white papers and webinars,” Golden told TechCrunch. “It was just going to be a matter of time before audio and video would be important pieces of that toolbox, and there was nobody doing it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revolution estimates that B2B content makes up roughly just 15% of the podcasting content out there today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given the growth on the consumer side, we think this could be up to a $20 billion market by five years from now,” Golden said.</span></p>
<p>The company, he added, is just one of a growing number of martech companies <a href="https://flyoverfuture.com/stories/tracing-the-dna-of-indys-martech-startup-boom/">based in Indianapolis</a>, including ExactTarget (which was acquired by Salesforce for $2.5 billion).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Casted said the new capital will go toward expanding its 25-person team and scaling the platform with new integrations and partnerships. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The venture capital scene in the North African tech ecosystem will be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">absolutely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> buzzing right now with the announcement of two large VC funds in the space of two days</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="https://algebraventures.com/">Algebra Ventures</a>, an Egyptian VC firm, announced that it has launched its $90 million second fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years ago, Algebra Ventures closed its first fund of $54 million, and with this announcement, the firm hopes to have raised a total of $144 million when the second fund closes (with first close by Q3 2021).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If achieved,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Algebra will most likely have the largest indigenous fund from North Africa and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arguably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the managing partners &#8212; <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/tassaad">Tarek Assaad</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karimhussein">Karim Hussein</a>, the first fund was an Egyptian-focused fund. Still, the firm made some selective investments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a few companies outside the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second fund will be similar &#8212; Egypt first, Egypt focused, but allocating investments in East and West Africa, North Africa and the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assaad and Ziad Mokhtar, a third managing partner (who now serves as an advisor) launched the firm in 2016 as one of Egypt&#8217;s first independent venture capital funds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It wasn&#8217;t easy to start one at the time, and it took the partners including Hussein who joined months later, two years to close the first fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Raising a venture capital fund in Egypt in 2016, in all honesty, was a pain. There was no venture capital to speak of back then,&#8221; Assaad told TechCrunch. &#8220;The high-flying startups back then were raising between $1 million and $2 million. We decided to take the bull by the horn and raise from very established LPs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These LPs include Cisco, the European Commission, Egyptian-American Enterprise Fund (EAEF), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), International Finance Corporation (IFC) and private family offices</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the first fund, Algebra backed 21 startups in Egypt and MENA, and according to the firm, six of its most established companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are valued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at over $350 million and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generate more than $150 million in annual revenue</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It hopes to back 31 startups from the second fund.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rising African venture investment powers fintech, clean tech bets in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/embed/#?secret=lIum5oZvTX" data-secret="lIum5oZvTX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Algebra says it&#8217;s sector-agnostic but has a focus on fintech, logistics, health tech and agritech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the firm has invested in startups in seed and Series B stages, Algebra </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be an investor in startups looking to raise Series A investments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another appealing proposition from Algebra lies in the fact that it owns an in-house team focused on talent acquisition &#8212; in operations, marketing, finance, engineering, etc., for portfolio companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm&#8217;s ticket size remains unchanged from the first fund and will continue to cut checks ranging from $500,000 to $2 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some aspects </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how the firm handles operations might change according to the partners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the lessons learned in our first fund is that we see that there are more interesting opportunities and great entrepreneurs in the seed stage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And given that we&#8217;re more on the ground in Egypt, sometimes we wait for them to mature to Series A. But going forward, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we might</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need to build relationships with those we find </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exceptional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the seed level and also expand our participation on the Series B level, too,&#8221; Hussein said on how the firm will act going forward</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hussein adds that the company will also be doubling down on its talent acquisition network</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Algebra helps portfolio companies hire C-level executives, and while it plans to continue doing so, the firm might adopt a startup studio model &#8212; pairing some professionals to start a company that eventually gets Algebra&#8217;s backing and support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason behind this stems from the next set of companies Algebra will be looking to invest in. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Hussein, the partners at Algebra have studied successful businesses in other emerging markets for some time and want to identify parallels in North Africa where the firm can invest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In cases where the firm can&#8217;t find those opportunities, we may spur some of those in the network to start building those businesses and capture those opportunities,&#8221; he remarked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Algebra, Hussein has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been involved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with building some successful tech companies in the U.S. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an engineer after bagging both bachelors and doctorate degrees from Carnegie Mellon University and MIT, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he ventured into the world of startup investing and entrepreneurship after working for a consulting company in the dot-com era</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He would go on to start Riskclick, a software company known for its commercial insurance applications</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The founders sold the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to Skywire before Oracle acquired the company to become part of its suite of insurance services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After some time at WebMD, Hussein returned to Egypt and began mentoring startups as an angel investor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside other angel investors, he co-founded Cairo Angels, an angel investor network in Egypt, in 2013</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There was a massive gap in the market. We were putting in a bit of small angel money to these businesses but there were no VCs to take them to the next level. So I met up with Tarek and Mokhtar, and the rest is Algebra,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assaad is also an engineer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He obtained his bachelors in Egypt before switching careers by going to Stanford Graduate School of Business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He continued on that path working for some Bay Area companies before his return to Egypt. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On his return, he became a managing partner at Ideavelopers, a VC firm operating a $50 million fund since 2009</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The firm has had a couple of good success stories, the most notable being fintech startup Fawry. Fawry is n</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ow a publicly traded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> billion-dollar company and Assaad was responsible for the investment which realized a $100 million exit for Ideavelopers in 2015</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134336" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134336" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2134336" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg?w=680" alt="Algebra Ventures" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg 7360w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134336" class="wp-caption-text">Tarek Assaad (Managing partner, Algebra Ventures)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Algebra, both partners are pioneering local investments in the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of its portfolio companies are the most well-known companies on the continent &#8212; health tech startup Yodawy; social commerce platform Brimore; logistics startup Trella; ride-hailing and super app Halan; food discovery and ordering platform Elmenus; fintech startup, Khazna; and others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm&#8217;s latest raise and $144 million capital amount is one of the largest funds dedicated to African startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other large Africa-focused funds include the $71 million fund recently closed by another Egyptian firm, Sawari Ventures; Partech&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/partech-is-doubling-the-size-of-its-african-venture-fund-to-143-million/">$143 million fund</a>; Novastar Ventures&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/novastar-ventures-becomes-200m-african-vc-fund-after-108m-raise/">$200 million fund</a>; and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/tlcom-capital-closes-71m-africa-fund-with-plans-to-back-12-startups/">$71 million Tide Africa Fund</a> by TLcom Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These funds have been very pivotal to the growth of the African tech ecosystem </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funding. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, African startups raised almost $1.5 billion from both local and international investors, according to varying reports</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This number was j</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ust</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/23/the-rise-of-silicon-savannah-and-africas-tech-movement/"> half a billion dollars</a> six years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, regardless of the period &#8212; 2015 or 2021 &#8212; African VC investments have always been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dominated by foreign investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But VC firms like Algebra Ventures are showing that local investors can cumulatively raise nine-figure funds or attempt to do so. Obviously, this will provide more startups with more funds and pave the way for indigenous and local VCs to at least increase their participation to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> equal levels when compared to international investors.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two-year-old CRED has become the youngest Indian startup to be valued at $2 billion or higher.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based <a href="https://www.cred.club/">CRED</a> said on Tuesday it has raised $215 million in a new funding round &#8212; a Series D &#8212; that valued the Indian startup at $2.2 billion (post-money), up from about $800 million valuation in the $81 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/india-cred-raises-81m-buys-back-1-2m-shares-from-employees/">Series C round in January this year</a>.</p>
<p>New investor Falcon Edge Capital and existing investor Coatue Management led the new round. Insight Partners and existing investors DST Global, RTP Global, Tiger Global, Greenoaks Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group, and Sofina also participated in Series D, which brings CRED&#8217;s total to-date raise to about $443 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/india-cred-in-talks-to-raise-200-million-at-2-billion-valuation/">reported</a> last month that CRED was in advanced stages of talks to raise about $200 million at a valuation of around $2 billion.</p>
<p>CRED operates an app that rewards customers for paying their credit card bills on time and gives them access to a range of additional services such as credit and a premium catalog of products from high-end brands.</p>
<p>An individual needs to have a credit score of at least 750 to be able to sign up for CRED. By keeping such a high bar, the startup says it is ensuring that people are incentivized to improve their financial behavior. (More on this later.)</p>
<p>CRED today serves more than 6 million customers, or about 22% of all credit card holders &#8212; and 35% of all premium credit card holders &#8212; in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Kunal Shah, founder and chief executive of CRED, told TechCrunch in an interview that the startup intends to become the platform for affluent customers in India and also not limit its offerings to financial services.</p>
<p>He said the startup’s aforementioned e-commerce service, for instance, has been growing fast. He attributed the early success to customers enjoying the curation of items on CRED and merchants finding the platform appealing as the ticket size of each transaction on CRED tends to be higher.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our focus on helping CRED members progress financially and have access to a high-trust environment has given us a massive opportunity to shape responsible behaviour, imagine new use cases, and create a rewarding platform for members.</p>
<p>&mdash; Kunal Shah (@kunalb11) <a href="https://twitter.com/kunalb11/status/1379373976493916160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh funds to scale several of its revenue channels and engage in more experimentations, he said.</p>
<p>When asked whether CRED would like to serve all credit card users in India some day, Shah said the selection criteria limits the startup from doing so, but he was optimistic that more users will improve their scores in the future.</p>
<p>The startup, unlike most others in India, doesn’t focus on the usual TAM (addressable market) — hundreds of millions of users of the world’s second-most populated nation — and instead caters to some of the most premium audiences.</p>

<p>“India has 57 million credit cards (vs 830 million debit cards) [that] largely serves the high-end market. The credit card industry is largely concentrated with the top 4 banks (HDFC, SBI, ICICI and Axis) controlling about 70% of the total market. This space is extremely profitable for these banks – as evident from the SBI Cards IPO,” analysts at Bank of America wrote in a recent report to clients.</p>
<p>“Very few startups like CRED are focusing on this high-end base and [have] taken a platform-based approach (acquire customers now and look for monetization later). Credit card in India remains an aspirational product. The under penetration would likely ensure continued strong growth in coming years. Overtime, the form-factor may evolve (i.e. move from plastic card to virtual card), but the inherent demand for credit is expected to grow,” they added.</p>
<p>CRED has become one of the most talked about startups in India, in part because of the pace at which it has raised money of late, its growing valuation, and the fact that it only caters to select customers.</p>
<p>Some users have also said that CRED doesn&#8217;t offer as appealing perks as it used to a year ago.</p>
<p>Shah, who is one of the most prolific angel investors in India and delivered one of the rare successful exits in the country with his previous venture, said CRED is already addressing these concerns. A recent feature, which allows customers to use CRED points at over a thousand merchants, for instance, has made the reward more appealing, he said, adding that the startup is slowly incorporating that into its own e-commerce store as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;What will soon happen is that customers will realize that these points are asset and not a liability. They will start to see benefits of the points in more places,&#8221; he said, adding that the pandemic derailed some of the things CRED had planned.</p>
<p>The startup, which bought back shares worth $1.2 million from employees in January this year, told them in an email today that it will soon be buying back stocks worth $5 million. &#8220;As the funding helps CRED invest in its future, hopefully the buyback will help some of you do that too,&#8221; the email said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Used-goods marketplaces, an online staple since the beginning of the internet as we know it, have really come into their own during the Covid-19 pandemic: they&#8217;ve been a place for people clearing out their domestic spaces to list items that they have that are still in good shape, making some money in the process; and for buyers, they are a resource for finding items at a time when shopping in person and spending money in uncertain economic times have both fallen out of favor. Today, <a href="https://www.mpb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MPB</a> &#8212; a popular marketplace that specializes in used cameras and photographic equipment &#8212; is announcing significant funding to double down on the opportunity after seeing its platform &#8220;recirculate&#8221; some 300,000 items of kit globally each year and pass £100 million ($139 million) in revenues this year.</p>
<p>The Brighton, England-based startup has snapped up £49.8 million (about $69 million at current exchange rates). It plans to use the money both to expand into more markets &#8212; it currently has offices in Brooklyn and Berlin &#8212; and into more product areas, specifically, extending the marketplace concept to serve content creators.</p>
<p>The Series D is being led by Vitruvian Partners, with significant participation from Acton Capital, and Mobeus Equity Partners, Beringea and FJ Labs also participating. Vitruvian is a new backer for MPB; the rest were already invested in the startup, which has raised around $91 million since 2011.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MPB did not disclose its valuation in a statement on the fundraise; we have contacted the company to ask and will update if / when we learn more.</p>
<p>For some context, this is the biggest-ever round raised by a startup out of Brighton. Home to one university and right next to another, Brighton has had some tech world focus &#8212; Brandwatch made a splash in February when it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/brandwatch-is-acquired-by-cision-for-450m-creating-a-pr-marketing-and-social-listening-giant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Cision for $450 million</a>; and it is well known for gaming companies and talent &#8212; but has largely been off the fundraising radar, perhaps in part because it is so close to London and its own gravitational pull for entrepreneurs and VCs. <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/133204-42/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> put MPB&#8217;s valuation at $50.86 million in 2019; it&#8217;s likely to be significantly higher than this now.</p>
<p>“This funding round is a major milestone for MPB, culminating a decade of strong performance and a vision to make great kit accessible and affordable,&#8221; said Matt Barker, MPB&#8217;s founder and CEO, in a statement. &#8220;With the backing of Vitruvian Partners and those reinvesting in our business, we can accelerate our US and European growth strategy at scale, profitably. Photography and videography are intrinsic to societies and cultures all over the world, and at MPB we have created a circular model that offers everyone the chance to be visual storytellers and content creators in a way that’s good for the planet.”</p>
<p>Indeed, what&#8217;s interesting about MPB is how it touches on and addresses a number of themes that have been playing out across the world of e-commerce and wider digital society, and what&#8217;s probably made it successful has been its appeal to people on one or more of those fronts at the same time.</p>
<p>First, there is the platform it gives to people to sell and buy used camera equipment. The sale of used items gives owners an opportunity to make money off items they no longer need, and buyers a way to procure items at lower costs. And it has an obvious environmental angle to it, since circular economy operators encourage people to get more life out of electronics that might otherwise simply become part of landfill (or encourage more manufacturing of new goods in their place).</p>
<p>But on a more practical level, used-good sales also have often put people off in part because they are deprived of some of the guarantees that you would normally get on goods when buying from more established retailers.</p>
<p>MPB provides buying and seller security in its own way: by employing a team of people to vet and prepare items for sale, and providing a six-month guarantee on items sold over its platform. That has paid off for it even pre-pandemic: the company said that its compound growth rate over the last five years has been 53%.</p>
<p>(And more generally, used goods marketplaces are seeing some big attention from VCs at the moment in Europe: in February, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/spains-wallapop-raises-191m-at-an-840m-valuation-for-its-classifieds-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wallapop in Spain raised $191 million</a> for its more generalised used-goods marketplace, and in March <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/vestiaire-collective-raises-216-million-for-its-second-hand-fashion-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vestaire Collective raised $216 million</a>.)</p>
<p>Second, it touches on the bigger trend we&#8217;ve seen around the growth of communities focused on specific rather than general interests. It&#8217;s a clear way of conferring more authenticity, focus and signal in an otherwise very noisy world online, and in a specialized area like the sale of photography equipment, this can be especially critical and a unique selling point over more generic sales platforms like eBay: it means more attention paid by the platform to stock, as well as a more focused community of buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>Third, there is the focus of MPB in particular. We have most definitely seen the birth of a &#8220;creator economy&#8221; online, where people are making livings out of their own brands (ugh), or from their specific creative output, bypassing some of the more traditional middle-men in favor of newer ones (eg, network broadcasters no longer the sole gatekeepers for serialized video content and all of the work that goes into making it; YouTube conversely now makes a killing off it, and if Substack, Patreon and others like it play their cards right, they will soon, in their own areas of interest, too.)</p>
<p>What this might mean for companies like MPB is a surge of interest and attention on equipment for capturing those images, although it will be interesting to see how and if that can be leveraged on a wider scale, given how so much of that creation today is happening on smartphones, which themselves continue to get more sophisticated and eat into not just casual photographers&#8217; buying patterns, but more serious ones, too.</p>
<p>In the question of scaling, MPB will have an interesting partner in the form of Vitruvian Partners, which backs second-hand clothes marketplace Vestiaire Collective &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/vestiaire-collective-raises-216-million-for-its-second-hand-fashion-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $216 million last month</a>, another sign of the times and how they have boosted the opportunities for used-good sales &#8212; alongside other marketplaces like Carwow, Just Eat, Farfetch, Skyscanner and Trustpilot.</p>
<p>“MPB has developed a unique tech-enabled platform to meet a market need, transforming access to photography kit to become a global leader in its field, whilst building a product that genuinely has a positive impact on the world,&#8221; said Tom Studd, partner at Vitruvian Partners, said in a statement. &#8220;Matt and the team have achieved strong and profitable growth through recent launches in the US and Germany, and we’re delighted to partner with them for the next step of the journey. Vitruvian looks to back exceptional teams with unique products in large markets, and we believe Matt and the team fit those criteria perfectly.”</p>
<p>Sebastian Wossagk, managing partner at Acton Capital, added: “It’s always a privilege to watch companies like MPB grow and excel in their field. Matt and his team have already taken the first steps into internationalisation by opening locations in Brooklyn and Berlin, and we’re excited to support them as they pursue further expansion in both the US and Europe.”</p>
<p>Something notable about MPB is that Barker <a href="https://spectrumphoto.co.uk/5-questions-mpb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once said</a> that he founded it in part because he didn&#8217;t feel that the requirements of people in the photography community were being addressed well enough by more general sites like eBay or Gumtree. That may still be the case for those two sites (and countless other generic sales platforms), but it doesn&#8217;t mean that there are not a number of other players addressing the used-photography equipment market. They include the likes of <a href="https://www.worldwidecameraexchange.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldwide Camera Exchange</a>, <a href="https://www.parkcameras.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Park Cameras</a>, <a href="https://www.cameraworld.co.uk/used" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Camera World</a>, and many others with equally SEO-friendly names. That represents opportunities for consolidation, competitive threat, and hopefully innovation for better services, but also a sign that there is more to this market than might meet the eye.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://bobw.co">Bob W</a>, the self-described &#8220;tech-driven&#8221; hospitality provider that offers an alternative to traditional hotels and short-stay rentals, is disclosing €10 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round, which included a first tranche of €4 million last year, is byFounders VC and private equity firm Finnish Industry Investment (Tesi). Other European real estate and venture capitalist investors participating include Kaamos, Superangel, United Angels and NREP (via its anchor investment into the 2150 venture capital fund, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/2150-launches-with-281m-fund-to-reduce-the-carbon-footprint-of-the-worlds-growing-cities/">promises to back</a> sustainable urban technologies).</p>
<p>Founded in 2018 by Niko Karstikko and Sebastian Emberger, Bob W &#8212; which is a play on the phrase &#8220;best of both worlds&#8221; &#8212; is described as offering tech-powered short-stay apartments that combine hotel-like quality with the authenticity of individual rentals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its &#8220;full-stack&#8221; model sees it source and manage properties and provide an accompanying app for guests, with support for chat-based customer service and contactless online check-in. It also claims to have made the majority of its operations autonomous. &#8220;[This] not only minimises human error but also allows the company to craft the entire guest experience, from booking to check-out, at scale,&#8221; says the company.</p>
<p>Launched in a number of Nordics markets, and on the verge of opening properties in London, the startup seems to be weathering the pandemic, reaching occupancy rates as high as 90% at its existing properties in Estonia and Finland. Revenue is also said to have grown by 80% in 2020, with the company putting a lot of marketing toward claims behind being more hygienic than many hotels.</p>

<p>&#8220;A new generation of travellers have developed a refined taste when it comes to accommodation; they’re mixing business with pleasure and often staying for longer,&#8221; says Niko Karstikko co-founder and CEO of Bob W. &#8220;They want the reliable quality of a hotel and the authenticity and convenience of a private apartment. The problem is that many hotels feel generic and lack key amenities like kitchens, while booking a private rental feels like playing roulette&#8221;.</p>
<p>Despite this contradiction, Karstikko says the short-stay rental market has continued to grow over the past decade with millions of properties available, &#8220;demonstrating the demand for home-like settings where guests can live like a local&#8221;. And it&#8217;s this demand that was the inspiration behind Bob W.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134197" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134197" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2134197" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="408" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg?resize=1536,922 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg?resize=2048,1229 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134197" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bob W</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Bob W guarantees the best short-stay apartment experience, which includes the amenities and local authenticity of a home combined with responsive host communication available 24/7, the best professional cleaning program in the industry, curated local service partners (gym, breakfast, etc.), dedicated business services and more&#8221;.</p>
<p>This means that guests can rely on &#8220;hotel-like consistency&#8221; across all of Bob W&#8217;s locations, without paying hotel prices and with &#8220;the flexibility to stay days, weeks or months&#8221;.</p>
<p>Karstikko says a typical Bob W guest is someone who &#8220;travels less but stays longer&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;They often mix business and pleasure and come for leisure, work, digital nomad-ery or just to get away and get a taste of living like a local,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;To do that, they seek out authentic places to stay which also have the amenities and consistent quality they expect, like a fully equipped kitchen and some elbow room. What they want is a home away from home&#8221;.</p>

To that end, Karstikko argues that Bob W is the &#8220;most local, authentic experience&#8221; on the market and offers the most consistent, yet customized experience. It also pitches itself on being more sustainable.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have put sustainability at the core of everything we do,&#8221; adds the Bob W CEO, &#8220;from powering our apartments with 100% renewable energy to recycling, minimising single-use plastic, sourcing furniture responsibly and [other] green initiatives throughout the business. We will also have massive news soon about how we’re taking sustainability to the next level, as all of us need to do more to combat the climate crisis&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.hello-charles.com">Charles</a>, a Berlin-based startup that offers a &#8220;conversational-commerce&#8221; SaaS for businesses that want to sell on WhatsApp and other chat apps, has raised €6.4 million in funding.</p>
<p>Led by Accel and HV Capital, the seed funding will be used by the company to scale and meet existing demand for its conversational commerce platform.</p>
<p>Launched in 2020 by Artjem Weissbeck and Andreas Tussing after the pair had run a year-long experiment running a store in WhatsApp, Charles enables businesses to sell products and services via WhatsApp and other chat apps in order to &#8220;increase conversion rate, customer loyalty and ultimately revenue&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The SaaS connects chat app APIs, such as WhatsApp and Messenger, with shop and CRM systems, like Shopify, SAP and HubSpot, all delivered through a user-friendly interface. The idea is to make it easier for businesses to meet their customers on the channels they already use and to bridge the gap between sales enquiries and support, and actual conversions.</p>

<p>&#8221; &#8216;Traffic&#8217; and with it &#8216;conversion&#8217; will exponentially move from the streets (retail) and the browser/native apps into chat apps,&#8221; says Weissbeck. &#8220;Thereby, conversational commerce will be the third big pillar of commerce, gluing together all channels and unlocking the full potential of personalization via the unique identification of customers via their phone number&#8221;.</p>
<p>This transition, argues the Charles founder, creates &#8220;tremendous challenges and opportunities&#8221; for companies in terms of customer journey design and the tech stack, which to date &#8212; Asia, aside &#8212; has been predominantly tailored around webshops and e-mail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately our technology provides the operating system for companies to master this challenge,&#8221; adds Tussing. &#8220;The core of our software integrates chat apps with shop/CRM backends in an intuitive interface that puts the human chat sales agent in the center, supported by chatbots and AI&#8221;.</p>
<p>Luca Bocchio, partner at Accel, says that conversational commerce is emerging as a &#8220;critical channel for brands,” and is a trend that will reshape the way brands interact with customers. [This is] paving the way for potential new category-defining tools to emerge,&#8221; he says, noting that Charles has the potential to be one of those tools.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we talk to potential clients it&#8217;s mostly existing customer service tools like Zendesk who are starting to add chat apps as an additional channel,&#8221; says Weissbeck, when asked to cite direct competitors. &#8220;These tools are usually built upon a &#8216;ticketing&#8217; logic, optimized to solve customer inquiries as quickly as possible and with a clear focus on service cases, not sales&#8221;.</p>
<p>In contrast, Weissbeck says Charles is built upon a &#8220;feed&#8221; logic, showing customer interaction as an ongoing conversation and end-to-end relationship &#8212; in the same way as the customer sees it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Further we deeply integrate into shop/CRM-backends to make it easy for agents to sell product and create carts or contracts &#8212; all in a very design-driven and intuitive interface, that is fun to use for the agent and puts her/him in the center,&#8221; says Tussing. &#8220;Supported by chatbots, not replaced&#8221;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the revenue model is simple enough: Businesses pay a monthly base fee to cover Charles&#8217; fixed costs and on top of this the startup earns money on conversions. &#8220;We take a small share of the net sales, ensuring we are co-incentivised,&#8221; explains Weissbeck.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egyptian-based VC firm <a href="https://sawariventures.com/">Sawari Ventures</a> has closed its $71 million fund for North Africa&#8217;s rapidly growing startup ecosystem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm first <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/sawari-ventures-35-million-fund/">announced its fund</a> in 2018, when it closed an initial $35 million (which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increased to $41 million) in hopes to close at $70 million, per Menabytes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investors in the first tranche included CDC (which <a href="https://www.cdcgroup.com/en/our-impact/fund/sawari-ventures-fund-i/">forked over $12 million</a>), European Investment Bank, Proparco and the Dutch Good Growth Fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having closed an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $30 million, Sawari Ventures&#8217; total raise is $1 million more than</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its original target</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it has added a range of new backers that includes Banque Misr, Banque du Caire, Ekuity, Misr Insurance Group, National Bank of Egypt and Suez Canal Bank</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-el-alfi-622a204b">Ahmed El Alfi</a>, <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/hany-al-sonbaty-12274322">Hany Al-Sonbaty</a> and <a href="https://www.itworx.com/company/board/wael-amin-board-director/">Wael Amin</a> launched Sawari Ventures in 2010. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before venturing into the world of venture capital, El Alfi and Al-Sonbaty were investment professionals in the Egyptian tech space for more than two decades</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amin, meanwhile, was a founder of a tech company called ITWorx that made notable acquisitions in the Egyptian tech ecosystem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Egypt, Sawari Ventures focuses on Morocco and Tunisia. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the firm, these three countries represent one of the best investment opportunities around given the mismatch between the capital available (amounts and variation at every stage) and the market opportunity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also share common traits such as language, culture, business, governance norms and market dynamics, making it easier for cross-border cooperation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching the firm over 10 years ago, Sawari claims to have invested in more than 30 companies, mostly in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these companies include ride-hailing service SWVL, software startup Instabug, and AI chat-based personal assistant Elves, but its</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sweet spots are the hardware, education, healthcare, cleantech and fintech sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We try to cast a wide net given that, in essence, this is a transformative moment in emerging markets tech with the rapid digitization of the underlying economy,&#8221; a company spokesperson told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So as expected, we’re seeing a great deal flow in the digitization of financial services, health care and education technologies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, given the engineering talent, there are unique opportunities in SaaS products, semiconductors and IoT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sawari Ventures invests in growth-stage companies, in particular. But it also</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> operates <a href="https://flat6labs.com/">Flat6Labs</a>, a seed VC firm akin to an accelerator that has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to perform its seed investments since establishing both Cairo and Tunis offices in 2011 and 2016</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sawari says 10% of the now-closed investments will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be earmarked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for seed-stage companies as investments through Flat6Labs Cairo and Tunis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flat6Labs Cairo will seed between 80 to 100 companies and offer follow-on investments to between 30 and 40</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Flat6Labs Tunisia will seed 60 to 70 companies and offer follow-on investments for 30 to 40. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining 90% will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to invest in 20 to 25 growth-stage companies across Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco, with a median investment range of $2 million to $3 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment range is a continuation of how Sawari </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cut checks for <a href="https://sawariventures.com/portfolio/">portfolio startups</a> since closing the first tranche three years ago</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm said it has invested between $1 million and $4 million in</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Elves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brantu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ExpandCart</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Almentor, SWVL and MoneyFellows, among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Egypt-based fund is a privately held fund regulated by the Financial Regulatory Authority of Egypt (FRA), which allowed us to attract capital from top-tier local financial institutions to co-invest with foreign capital from international development financial institutions, doubling our allocation to invest in Egyptian high-growth companies to $68 million,” El Alfi said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our aim is to create exceptional returns through investing in knowledge-driven companies, which have the potential of bringing transformational changes to the Egyptian economy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund will support local companies with dedicated capital, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to quality expertise from our seasoned and specialized team, and the value-add of our investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

<p>Founded in 2018, InfuseAI says the market for MLOps solutions is worth $30 million a year in Taiwan, with the global market expected to reach about $4 billion by 2025, <a href="https://www.cognilytica.com/2020/04/02/infographic-the-rapid-growth-of-mlops/">according to research firm Cognilytica</a>.

<p>InfuseAI helps companies deploy and manage machine learning models with turnkey solutions like PrimeHub, a platform that includes a model training environment, cloud or on-premise cluster computing (including container orchestration with Kubernetes) and collaboration tools for teams. Another product, called PrimeHub Deploy, lets clients train, deploy, update and monitor AI models.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Hive Ventures founder and managing partner Yan Lee said, &#8220;As enterprises from manufacturing, healthcare, finance and other sectors seek to scale their AI operations and model deployments, they will require a platform like InfuseAI to allow seamless collaboration between developers and data scientists. InfuseAI fits perfectly into our investment thesis which is focused on platforms and software in the enterprise adoption cycle.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://glints.com/">Glints</a>, the Singapore-based career platform, announced today it has raised $22.5 million in Series C funding led by Japanese human resources management firm PERSOL Holdings. The new capital will be used on Glints’ expansion in Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam and Taiwan and hiring for its product and engineering teams.</p>
<p>Glints co-founder and chief executive officer Oswald Yeo said this is the largest funding round to date for a talent platform in Southeast Asia, and brings the startup’s total raised to $33 million. Other participants included returning investors Monk’s Hill Ventures, Fresco Capital, Mindworks Ventures, Wavemaker Partners, Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal and former Goldman Sachs TMT China head and partner Xiaoyin Zhang.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Glints says it has been used by more than 1.5 million professionals and 30,000 organizations, including Gojek, Tokopedia, Starbucks and Mediacorp. Most of its current users are from the tech and financial services sectors, but Glints has a &#8220;broad horizontal focus on young to mid-level professionals,&#8221; and its long-term goal is to be sector agnostic, Yeo told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>One of the ways Glints differentiates from other job platforms active in its markets, like LinkedIn, JobStreet and CakeResume, is by building a &#8220;full-stack&#8221; of services for people who want to advance their careers. In addition to its job marketplace, which the company says has more than 7,000 active listings and 4 million visitors each month, Glints also offers community features and skills education, like online classes.</p>
<p>One of Glints’ value propositions is helping companies, especially in tech, cope with the regional talent shortage, a topic it recently covered in <a href="https://www.monkshill.com/content-hub/the-southeast-asia-tech-talent-report-mhv">a comprehensive report</a> with Monk’s Hill Ventures.</p>
<p>One of the solutions the report highlighted is hiring teams based in different Southeast Asian countries to address talent crunches in specific markets, like Singapore. Glints says its cross-border remote work hub, TalentHub, doubled its business in 2020 as the pandemic also made employers more open to hiring remotely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">KKR has just closed $15 billion for its Asia-focused private equity fund, exceeding its original target size after receiving &#8220;strong support&#8221; from new and existing global investors, including those in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>The new close came nearly four years after KKR raised its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170601006750/en/KKR-Closes-US9.3-Billion-Asian-Fund-III">Asian Fund III of $9.3 billion</a> and marks the New York-based alternative asset management titan&#8217;s ongoing interest in Asia. It also makes KKR Asian Fund IV one of the largest private equity funds dedicated to the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>KKR itself will inject about $1.3 billion into Fund IV alongside investors through the firm and its employees&#8217; commitments. The new fund will be on the lookout for opportunities in consumption and urbanization trends, as well as corporate carve-outs, spin-offs, and consolidation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>KKR has been a prolific investor in Asia-Pacific since it entered the region 16 years ago with a multifaceted approach that spans private equity, infrastructure, real estate and credit. It currently has $30 billion in assets under management in the region.</p>
<p>The firm has been active during COVID-19 as well. On the one hand, the pandemic has accelerated the transition to online activities and singled out tech firms that proved resilient during the health crisis. Market disruption in the last year has also made valuations more attractive and pressured companies to seek new sources of capital. All in all, these forces provide &#8220;increasingly interesting opportunities for flexible capital providers like KKR,&#8221; the firm&#8217;s spokesperson Anita Davis told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Since the pandemic, KKR has deployed about $7 billion across multiple strategies in Asia.</p>
<p>While KKR looks for deals across Asia, each market provides different opportunities pertaining to the state of its economy. For deals in consumption upgrades, KKR seeks out companies in emerging markets like China, Southeast Asia and India, said Davis. In developed countries like Japan, Korea and Australia, KKR observed that continued governance reform, along with a focus on return on equity (ROE), has driven carve-outs from conglomerates and spin-offs from multinational corporations, Davis added.</p>
<p>Specifically, KKR&#8217;s private equity portfolio in Asia consists of about 60 companies across 11 countries. Some of its more notable deals include co-leading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/chinas-bytedance-leapfrogs-uber-to-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-startup/">ByteDance&#8217;s $3 billion raise in 2018</a> amid the TikTok parent&#8217;s rapid growth and bankrolling Reliance Jio <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/kkr-invests-1-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">with $1.5 billion</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;The opportunity for private equity investment across Asia-Pacific is phenomenal,&#8221; said Hiro Hirano, co-head of Asia Pacific Private Equity at KKR. &#8220;While each market is unique, the long-term fundamentals underpinning the region’s growth are consistent &#8212; the demand for consumption upgrades, a fast-growing middle class, rising urbanization, and technological disruption.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Asian Fund IV followed in the footsteps of KKR&#8217;s two other Asia-focused funds that closed in January, the <a href="https://media.kkr.com/news-details/?news_id=223def4b-2e42-4bea-ba85-c2cda7cbd79a">$3.9 billion Asia Pacific Infrastructure Investors Fund</a> and the<a href="https://media.kkr.com/news-details/?news_id=093ad462-7de2-4c5e-88e0-5d1f73f8aabc"> $1.7 billion Asia Real Estate Partners Fund</a>.</p>
