					<description><![CDATA[The total addressable market that Forge serves is growing by the day, with more and more unicorns being born and a steady drumbeat of unicorn IPOs doing little to clear the decks.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public/">Warby Parker</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/inside-freshworks-ipo-filing-as-the/">Freshworks</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/what-amplitudes-choice-to-direct-list-says-about-its-products-growth-and-value/">Amplitude</a>Â and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">Toast</a> look to list in the coming weeks, we shouldn&#8217;t forget the SPAC boom. This week, for example, Forge Global (Forge), a technology startup that operates a market for secondary transactions in private companies, announced that it would go public via a blank-check combination.</p>
<p>And while we&#8217;re not unpacking every single SPAC combination that crosses our radar, the Forge deal is a good one to spend time parsing.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Why? Several reasons. First, we&#8217;re curious about how the company generates revenue and how diversified its revenue is. We&#8217;re also interested in how big the market may prove to be for trading secondary shares in unicorns &#8212; late-stage tech startup equity is popular on secondary exchanges. Additionally, we want to know whether the deal feels expensive, because that may help us get a heat-check on the SPAC market more broadly.</p>

Then we get to have fun. To work!</p>
<h2>The Forge SPAC</h2>
<p>Forge is <a href="https://forgeglobal.com/press-releases/forge-global-to-go-public-in-2-billion-merger-with-motive-capital/">merging</a> with Motive Capital, a blank-check company that <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/73990/Fintech-SPAC-Motive-Capital-prices-upsized-$360-million-IPO-at-$10">raised $360 million</a> in December 2020.</p>
<p>Per the company&#8217;s calculations, the combined entity will sport a roughly $2 billion valuation on a &#8220;fully diluted equity value on a pro forma basis.&#8221; The company&#8217;s anticipated <em>enterprise</em> value is a smaller $1.60 billion thanks to an expected $435 million in cash after the deal&#8217;s completion, though that number will change some before it trades.</p>
<p>Skipping the nuances of the transaction &#8212; there&#8217;s a PIPE, 90% equity rollover from existing shareholders and more, in case you wanted to get into it &#8212; what matters is that Forge will be worth around $2 billion in equity terms and have hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank after the deal.</p>
<p>The resulting valuation is notable not only for making Forge a unicorn, but also for representing a dramatic upward movement in the worth of the company. PitchBook and Crunchbase data agree that Forge was last valued at $700 million (post-money) when raising $150 million earlier this year. So, the company appears set to provide a solid return to more than just its early backers; even the private investors who put capital into the company rather recently should do well in the deal.</p>
<p>That brings us to the company&#8217;s business, and business model. Forge helps pre-IPO companies trade before they float. It&#8217;s somewhat ironic that price discovery is something that the company claims its platform can help companies with before they debut, while the company is set to see its private valuation quickly beaten by a public debut.</p>
<p>Regardless, let&#8217;s talk unicorns.</p>
<h2>A solution to the unicorn traffic jam?</h2>
<p>One of my favorite long-term issues with the late-stage startup market is that it is far better at creating value than it is at finding an exit point for that accreted value. More simply, the startup market is excellent at creating unicorns but somewhat poor at taking them public.</p>
<p>That antitrust regulatory concerns have made it harder for wealthy tech companies to snap up promising startups that could challenge them is only part of the matter. There just aren&#8217;t enough IPOs, even this year, to counterbalance the growth in the number of global unicorns.</p>
<p>That pressure is a good bit of why Forge is an interesting firm. The more unexited unicorns there are in the world, the more demand, presumably, there is for marketplaces like the one it operates, which allows existing shareholders in valuable private companies to drive liquidity for themselves ahead of eventual public-market debuts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.relyance.ai/">Relyance AI</a>, an early stage startup that is helping companies stay in compliance with privacy laws at the code level, announced a $25 million Series A today. At the same time, they revealed a previously unannounced $5 million seed round.</p>
<p>Menlo Ventures and Unusual Ventures led the A round, while Unusual was sole lead on the seed. Serial entrepreneur Jyoti Bansal from Unusual will join the board under the terms of the deal. His partner John Vrionis had previously joined after the seed round. Matt Murphy from Menlo is coming on as a board observer. The company has now raised $30 million.</p>
<p>Relyance takes an unusual approach to verifying that data stays in compliance working at the code level, while ingesting contracts and existing legal requirements as code to ensure that a company is in compliance. Company co-CEO and co-founder Abhi Sharma says that code-level check is key to the solution. &#8220;For the first time, we are building the legal compliance and regulation into the source code,&#8221; Sharma told me.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;Relyance is actually embedded within the DevOps pipeline of our customers infrastructure. So every time a new ETL pipeline is built or a machine learning model is receiving new source code, we do a compiler-like analysis of how personal sensitive data is flowing between internal microservices, data lakes and data warehouses, and then get a metadata analysis back to the privacy and compliance professionals [inside an organization].&#8221;</p>
<p>Leila R. Golchehreh, the other founder and co-CEO brings a strong compliance background to the equation and has experienced the challenge of keeping companies in compliance first-hand. She said that Relayance also enables companies to define policy and contracts as code.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our approach is specifically to ingest contracts. We&#8217;ve actually created an algorithm around how [you] actually write a good data protection agreement. We&#8217;ve extracted those relevant provisions and we will compare that against [your] operational reality. So if there&#8217;s a disconnect, we will be able to raise that as an intelligent insight of a data misalignment,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>With 32 employees, the co-founders hope to double or perhaps even triple that number in the next 12-18 months. Golchehreh and Sharma are a diverse co-founder team and they are attempting to build a company that reflects that. They believe being remote first gives them a leg up in this regard, but they also have internal policies to drive it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The recruiters we work with have a mandate internally to say, &#8216;Hey, we really want to hire good people and diverse people.&#8217; Reliance as a company is the genesis of two individuals from two completely different ends of the spectrum coming together. And I think hopefully, we can do our job of relaying that into the company as we scale,&#8221; Sharma said.</p>
<p>The two founders have been friends for several years and began talking about forming a company together in 2019 over a pizza dinner. The idea began to gel and they launched the company in February 2020. They spent some time talking to compliance pros to understand their requirements better, then began building the solution they have today in July 2020. They released a beta in February and began quietly selling it in March.</p>
<p>Today they have a number of early customers working with their software including Dialpad, Patreon, Samsara and True.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>At Burning Man a few years ago, I was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor for smoking marijuana in public (in my car) and driving under the influence. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I currently have a green card and want to apply for U.S. citizenship next year. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can I? If so, how should I handle my criminal record?</strong></p>
<p><strong>â Remorseful About the Reefer</strong></p>
<p>Dear Remorseful,</p>
<p>As youâve discovered, you have to be extra careful when youâre an immigrant: Obviously, you should never break the law, but as an immigrant, if you do, it can have severe and lasting consequences.</p>
<p>You even need to be careful to avoid doing things that an immigration officer might consider to be outside the bounds of good moral character, even if they are not crimes. All immigrants should remember that even though limited use of marijuana for recreational and medical uses is legal in several states, itâs <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/marijuana-hurts-your-immigration-citizenship-chances/">illegal under federal law</a>.</p>
<p>My law partner, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/member/anita-koumriqian/">Anita Koumriqian</a>, recently <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/088-should-i-apply-for-citizenship-if-i-have-a-record/">podcasted</a> on how various crimes can impact your green card status and affect your ability to become a U.S. citizen. Take a listen and (always in this situation) consult an experienced immigration attorney. Tell your attorney about your DUI and marijuana charges, any subsequent marijuana use, any other arrests or citations, and even things you might consider minor such as speeding, parking or jaywalking tickets. An immigration attorney can determine whether you should proceed with applying for U.S. citizenship and if so, when and how to do so.</p>

<h2>What is good moral character?</h2>
<p>As you know, you must be a permanent resident (green card holder) for at least five years â or three years if you have a green card through marriage â to be eligible to apply for <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/035-becoming-a-u-s-citizen-naturalization-and-citizenship/">U.S. citizenship</a>. Additionally, you must demonstrate âgood moral characterâ during the five- or three-year statutory period.</p>

As more companies lean into remote work, and a great many startups are founding themselves on multiple continents, the new capability could boost Airbase&#8217;s effective total addressable market.</p>
<p>The product news is interesting, but more so when we consider Airbase&#8217;s feature decisions in the larger context of the corporate spend management space itself. Startups competing in the market offer customers corporate cards and a software suite to help them manage spend more generally, along with other functionality that varies based on the provider in question.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-and-brex-draw-diverging-market-plans-with-ma-strategy/">spilled much ink in recent months</a> tracking Airbase competitors Ramp and Brex, for example, as they raise capital and look to differentiate their products to better serve their target markets. They are doing so by both pricing decisions and feature choices.</p>

<p>Airbase, while perhaps less well-known than its rivals, was early to the decision to charge for its software in addition to deriving interchange revenues from its business. Brex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/how-brex-more-than-doubled-its-valuation-in-a-year/">added a paid package of software</a> at an SMB-friendly price point. Ramp is sticking to its zero-cost guns for now.</p>
<p>Now with support for international subsidiaries and currencies for U.S.-based companies, Airbase is executing against its vision to provide spend management services for companies from inception through IPO, founder and CEO Thejo Kote told TechCrunch an interview.</p>
<p>In more detailed terms, Airbase supports payouts to some 200 countries, as well as support for moving money around more generally in a more constrained geographic area.</p>
<p>The product news fits into Airbase&#8217;s goal of supporting companies even as they scale. Other competitors in its market have a greater SMB focus, it appears. Not that that is a diss; offering corporate spend services as a free package has proven lucrative for some companies looking to onboard a host of smaller enterprises. Divvy did so and sold for more than $1 billion. And Ramp and Brex are pricing their services to be well within the reaches of smaller firms.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ramp and Brex draw diverging market plans with M&#038;A strategies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-and-brex-draw-diverging-market-plans-with-ma-strategy/embed/#?secret=PElsFX4eHV" data-secret="PElsFX4eHV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Airbase does offer a free tier, but more as a method of attracting customers that could scale into large accounts in time, it explained. Those larger accounts are the startup&#8217;s goal. Kote said during a conversation that his company now has a number of customers paying six figures per year for its software, a change from when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/airbase-raises-60m-as-the-corporate-spend-market-segments-matures/">raised $60 million earlier this year,</a> when such account sizes were rarer.</p>
<p>By adding more capabilities for multinational companies, Airbase may be able to land more large customers, which, in turn, would generate both software and interchange incomes for the startup.</p>
<p>Kote also disclosed new growth metrics for Airbase, though in relative instead of absolute terms. The startup has scaled annual recurring revenue &#8212; a metric that calculates annualized subscription software sales at a company &#8212; by 3.5x in the last 12 months, he said, and 2x in the last half-year. Kote also disclosed that his company is &#8220;approaching&#8221; $2 billion in annualized payment volume through its service, up 5x in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Now in the process of digesting its Series B, Airbase has graduated from baby startup metrics, and we&#8217;ll expect something a bit harder the next time we cover the company.</p>
<p>Still, as Airbase looks to support larger companies longer, we&#8217;re seeing an interesting divergence between the corporate spend startups battling for North American market share. With three major players charging nothing, a little and a lot, it isn&#8217;t hard to guess where each will focus their product efforts in customer terms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p id="speakable-summary">One of the biggest problems in the world of e-commerce is the predicament of shopping cart abandonment: when shoppers aren&#8217;t getting to what they want fast enough &#8212; whether it&#8217;s finding the right item, or paying for it in a quick and easy way &#8212; they bounce. That singular problem is driving a wave of technology development to make the experience ever more seamless, and today one of the companies closely involved in that space is announcing some funding on the back of healthy growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://Constructor.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Constructor</a>, which has built technology that powers search and product discovery tools for e-commerce businesses, has picked up $55 million in a Series A round of funding. Constructor says that it powers &#8220;billions&#8221; of queries every month, with revenues growing 233% in the last year. Customers it works with include Sephora, Walmart&#8217;s Bonobos, Backcountry and many other big names.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Silversmith Capital Partners &#8212; which coincidentally, just today, led another round for an e-commerce startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/zonos-banks-69m-to-develop-apis-for-democratizing-cross-border-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zonos</a>.</p>
<p>It is joined by a long list of notable individual investors. They include David Fraga, former president of InVision; Kevin Weil, former head of product at Twitter and Instagram; Jason Finger, founder of Seamless; Carl Sparks, ex-CEO of Travelocity; Robyn Peterson, CTO at CNN; Dave Heath, founder of Bombas; Ryan Barretto, president at Sprout Social; Melody Hildebrandt, EVP engineering and CISO at FOX; Zander Rafael, co-founder of Better.com; and Seth Shaw, CRO at Airtable. Cap Table Coalition &#8212; a firm that helps underrepresented-background investors back up-and-coming startups &#8212; was also involved. Fraga is joining Constructor&#8217;s board with this round.</p>
<p>The last year and a half has been a bumper one for the world of e-commerce &#8212; with more traffic, transactions and retailers moving online in the wake of social distancing measures impacting in-person, physical shopping. But that has also exposed a lot of the cracks in how e-commerce works (or doesn&#8217;t work, as the case may be).</p>
<p>One of the more dysfunctional areas is search and discovery. As most of us have unfortunately learned first-hand, when we search for things in the search window of an online store, it&#8217;s almost always the case that the results don&#8217;t have what we want.</p>
<p>When we browse as we might in a physical store, because we are not sure of what we want, all too often we are not prompted with pictures of things we might actually like to buy. They may be there &#8212; we typically visit sites because we either already know them, or have seen something we like elsewhere &#8212; but nevertheless, finding what we might actually like to buy can take a lot of time, and in many cases may never happen at all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eli Finkelshteyn, Constructor&#8217;s CEO and founder, says that one of the issues is that search and discovery are often built as static experiences: they are designed to meet a one-size-fits-all model where site architects have effectively guessed at what a shopper might want, and built for that. This is one area that Constructor has rethought, specifically by making search and discovery more dynamic and responsive to what&#8217;s happened before you ever visit a site.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things wrong with product discovery was that prescriptively sites show you what they think is valuable to you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We think the process should be descriptive.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an example, he talked about Cheetos. Sometimes people who might want to buy these start out by navigating to the potato chip category. In many static searches, those results might not include Cheetos. Some people might abandon their search altogether (bounce), but some might navigate away from that and search specifically for Cheetos and add them to their carts. In a descriptive and more dynamic environment, Finkelshteyn believes that these two flows should subsequently inform all future chip searches.</p>
<p>&#8220;We take into account as much data as we can learn from, and that list is always growing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The goal is anything we can learn from should become part of the user experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google is the current, undisputed leader in the world of search, and it too uses a lot of dynamic, AI-based tools to learn and tweak how it searches and what results it produces.</p>
<p>Interestingly it hasn&#8217;t extended as much of this to third parties as you might think. The company <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-shutting-down-site-search-service-moving-customers-to-cse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wound down its own site search product in 1997</a> and now if you look for this you are redirected to the <a href="https://workspace.google.com/products/cloud-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s enterprise search suite</a>.</p>
<p>There are however others that have also stepped into that void to provide services that compete with Constructor, including the likes of Algolia, Yext, Elasticsearch and more. Finkelshteyn believes that among all of these, none have managed yet to provide a service like Constructor&#8217;s that learns and adjusts its results constantly based on search and browsing activity.</p>
<p>This is one reason the company has stood out with its customers, and with investors.</p>
<p>âConstructor has built a search and discovery platform that is truly making a difference for enterprise retailers. They are providing customers with comprehensive and optimized search and discovery that is unmatched in the market,â said Sri Rao, Constructor board member and general partner at Silversmith Capital Partners, in a statement. âWe are excited to partner with the Constructor team as they continue to revolutionize search and discovery capabilities for retailers across all platforms.â</p>
<p>Looking forward, there will be some interesting opportunities ahead for Constructor to take its search and discovery tools to new frontiers. These could include ways to bring in and account for shoppers on third-party platforms &#8212; currently Constructor does not power experiences on, say, social media, so that is one potential area to explore &#8212; as well as more offline experiences, critical as retailers and shoppers take on more blended approaches that might start online and finish in stores, or proceed the other way around, or find users walking around with their phones to shop even as they are in physical stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Weâre thrilled that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=5reasonspost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=5reasonspost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> is just slightly more than a month away on October 27. You have purchased your event ticket, right? No? Well then, itâs time to get your rhymes-with-SaaS in gear.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Youâll save $100 if you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=5reasonspost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=5reasonspost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy your pass</a> <strong>before October 1 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>. Whatâs that? You need a bit more convincing? Fair enough and listen up.</p>
<p>TC Sessions are a special kind of TechCrunch event. We take one topic and devote an entire day (or sometimes two) and explore the latest trends, challenges and possibilities. And we always focus on the early-stage founders hard at work building or reinventing the sector.</p>
<p>So, what can TC Sessions: SasS do for you? Here are five reasons why attending isnât just essential â itâs imperative.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Expand your knowledge base</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The defacto software for the B2B and B2C crowd, SaaS is rapidly expanding and constantly evolving to meet ever-increasing demand. How do you scale effectively? Whatâs your plan to keep company and customer data safe at a time where security threats proliferate faster than bacteria?</p>
<p>Youâll hear from and engage with the leading voices in SaaS on these and other topics like <strong>Data, Data Everywhere</strong> and <strong>Automation&#8217;s Moment Is Now</strong>. Take a look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">our still-growing event agenda</a>.</p>
<p>âAttending TC Sessions helps us keep an eye on whatâs coming around the corner. It uncovers crucial trends so we can identify what we should be thinking about before anyone else.â â Jeff Johnson, vice president of enterprise sales and solutions at FlashParking.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">2. Network for opportunity</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of SaaS-y people from around the world will attend, and that means infinite possibilities for collaboration and opportunities. The following real-world example comes out of TC Sessions: Mobility, provided courtesy of Karin Maake, senior director of communications at FlashParking.</p>
<p>âTC Sessions isn&#8217;t just an educational opportunity, it&#8217;s a real networking opportunity. Everyone was passionate and open to creating pilot programs or other partnerships. That was the most exciting part. And now â thanks to a conference connection â weâre talking with Goodyear&#8217;s Innovation Lab.â</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">3. Connect with founders or investors</strong></p>
<p>Early-stage founders in search of funding and VCs in search of promising startups â it is ever thus, and youâll find each other at TC Sessions: SasS. Take advantage of CrunchMatch, our AI-powered platform that makes finding and connecting with the people you most want to meet simple and efficient.</p>
<p>Start a conversation and see where it leads. Itâs one big reason why Rachael Wilcox, creative producer, Volvo Cars makes it a point to attend TC Session events.</p>
<p>âI go TC Sessions to find new and interesting companies, make new business connections and look for startups with investment potential. Itâs an opportunity to expand my knowledge and inform my work.â</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">4. Connect with community</strong></p>
<p>Building a startup can be a lonely pursuit, even without a pandemic. Spend a day with your people â explore the startups in the demo area, talk shop with other founders and engineers, learn the latest trends, hear SaaS icons share their journey and insight. In short, get inspired to keep at the Sisyphean task of building your empire.</p>
<p>âTC Sessions is definitely worth your time, especially if youâre an early-stage founder. You get to connect to people in your field and learn from founders who are literally a year into your same journey. Plus, you can meet and talk to the movers and shakers â the people who are making it happen.â â Jens Lehmann, technical lead and product manager, SAP.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">5. Discover new and exciting startups</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of that demo area, weâve got 10 outstanding early-stage startups ready to show you their latest and greatest. Marvel at your colleaguesâ ingenuity, start a conversation, schedule a product demo. Who knows, you might join forces and create a little SaaS magic.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back toÂ <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunchâs venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Wednesday show, where we niche down to a single topic. This time &#8217;round we took a look into the world of on-demand delivery in Europe, with an especial focus on the so-called &#8220;instant&#8221; grocery sector, and delivered convenience items. To help <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> get through the subject, we lassoed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/steve-o-hear/">TechCrunch alum</a> and present-day VP at <a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp</a>, a company in the sector under discussion, <a href="https://twitter.com/sohear">Steve O&#8217;Hear</a> to chat with us.</p>
<p>We spent time chatting through the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent news from the sector, including that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-13/getir-tops-1-billion-in-fundraising-this-year-with-latest-deal-ktirahny?sref=gni836kR">Turkey&#8217;s Getir has just raised a bucket of new capital</a>, and that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/grocery-startup-weezy-said-to-work-with-evercore-to-assess-sale?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google">Weezy is looking to exit</a>; the latter item wound up being important we got around to discussing consolidation in the space.</li>
<li>Steve gave us an overview of Zapp, and how its approach to infra could help its economics.</li>
<li>We chatted about GoPuff and its economic fortunes, which in fundraising terms are solid, even if questions regarding future profitability are still in play.</li>
<li>And regarding the ever-present pandemic question, Steve was bullish on consumer behavior staying where it is if &#8212; when? &#8212; the COVID-19 pandemic eventually leaves us.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are back on Friday! Chat then!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google&#8217;s streaming TV service, YouTube TV, announced today it&#8217;s adding more Spanish-language networks to its base membership package and is preparing to launch an add-on package that will include even more Spanish-language content. Starting today, all subscribers will gain access to three new TV networks at no additional cost: Univision, UniMÃ¡s, and GalavisiÃ³n. These will join YouTube TV&#8217;s existing lineup of over 85 live TV channels, which today include top networks like Fox, ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, and others, in addition to entertainment networks like those from Discovery and ViacomCBS.</p>
<p>The additions will bring to YouTube TV members a range of new Spanish-language content, including primetime series like &#8220;La Desalmada&#8221; and &#8220;Vencer El Pasado&#8221; arriving this fall, reality competition series &#8220;Nuestra Belleza Latina&#8221; on September 26, plus the 22nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards on November 18. The additions also bring sports programming like the Campeones Cup on September 29, and ongoing match-ups from Liga MX, UEFA Champions League, MLS, and the Mexican National Team, the company says.</p>
<p>Univision also noted that subscribers in top Hispanic markets, including Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Houston, Dallas, Chicago, and others, will be able to access Univision and UniMÃ¡sâ local news, weather, and other programming. Plus, YouTube TV will carry Univision&#8217;s video-on-demand content library at launch, and subscribers will be able to use their YouTube TV credentials to authenticate with the company&#8217;s &#8220;TV everywhere&#8221;-powered Univision app.</p>
<p>The companies did not disclose the financial terms of their new agreement, but the deal hasn&#8217;t come with a price increase. YouTube TV, however, has been steadily hiking prices since its debut. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/youtube-tv-hikes-price-to-64-99-per-month-following-new-channel-additions/">increased</a> the service&#8217;s pricing to $64.99 last summer, following the new additions of 14 ViacomCBS networks, for example. But last month, YouTube Chief Product Officer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22606296/youtube-shorts-fund-neal-mohan-decoder-interview">Neal Mohan said</a> there would be no new price increases in the near-term.</p>
<p>While the new channels will reach all subscribers, YouTube TV also announced plans to introduce a new add-on package that will be available for an additional monthly cost. This will include other Spanish-language networks like Sony Cine, CNN EspaÃ±ol, Discovery en EspaÃ±ol, Estrella TV, Cinelatino, Fox Deportes, and others. YouTube TV is not yet sharing the full lineup nor the price of the add-on just yet, but said it would offer more details in the &#8220;coming months.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Spanish-language network Pantaya will also be offered in the weeks ahead for an additional $5.99 per month, providing access to Spanish-language movies and exclusive original series, all of which are on-demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are delighted to partner with YouTube TV to expand Univisionâs robust portfolio of networks and stations to include YouTube TV,&#8221; said Hamed Nasseri, Univision Vice President, Content Distribution, in a statement. &#8220;Amid the popularity of streaming services as well as the growing influence of our Hispanic community, this is an important step to ensure that our audience has access to our leading Spanish-language news, sports, and entertainment wherever they consume content. We are excited for todayâs launch and recognize YouTube TVâs continued commitment to serving our growing and influential Hispanic audience.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>YouTube TV is not the first streamer to cater to an audience looking for Spanish-language content. In 2018, <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2018/11/02/hulu-announces-new-spanish-language-and-lifestyle-add-ons-for-live-tv-service/">Hulu added its own</a> Spanish-language bundle called â<a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/espanol-add-on">EspaÃ±ol</a>,â which now gives subscribers live programming from networks including ESPN Deportes, NBC Universo, CNN En EspaÃ±ol, History Channel En EspaÃ±ol, Discovery en EspaÃ±ol, and Discovery Familia. Hulu, however, doesn&#8217;t carry Univision but does offer Telemundo. Fubo TV, meanwhile, offers Univision and Telemundo and provides an EspaÃ±ol plan with dozens of Spanish-language channels.</p>
<p>If anything, YouTube TV had <a href="https://www.reviews.org/tv-service/best-streaming-services-for-spanish-speakers/">been behind</a> in terms of catering to Spanish speakers until now, and this offering will make it more competitive with rival services.</p>

<p>After months of publicity, an NFT auction, and even a Netflix docu-series, itâs finally here: the four-person crew of Inspiration4 will be heading to space.</p>
<p>What makes this launch different from any that came before it? None of the four people onboard are astronauts. The mission marks the first time that an all-civilian crew will fly to space. Letâs meet them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire whose fortune comes from the payment processing company Shift4 Payments, which went public in the summer of last year. He is the mission commander.</li>
<li>Sian Procter, a community college professor with a PhD in science education. Procter was among 47 finalists chosen by NASA for a 2009 astronaut class, though she was not one of the nine eventually chosen to join the agency. She will be Inspiration4âs pilot, the first Black woman to pilot a spacecraft. Sheâs 51.</li>
<li>Hayley Arceneaux, a 29-year-old physician assistant at St. Judeâs Research Hospital and a survivor of childhood cancer. Sheâll be the crewâs health officer.</li>
<li>Christopher Sembroski, a data engineer for Lockheed Martin, also a former camp counselor at none other than Space Camp. The 42-year-old will be acting as mission specialist.</li>
</ul>
<p>The crew will be cruising to orbit inside a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which will launch from a Falcon 9 rocket. Theyâll spend three days flying around the Earth before splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida.</p>
<p>SpaceXâs Youtube channel is hosting a live launch webcast starting from 3:45 PM EST, with the five-hour launch window opening at <strong>8:02 PM EST</strong>. As of Sunday, Inspiration4 said weather conditions at Kennedy Space Center looked 70% favorable. Thereâs also a back-up launch window opening at the same time the following day.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ascend is moving insurance into the digital age by with a payments platform that combines financing, collections and payables.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://useascend.com/">Ascend</a> on Wednesday announced a $5.5 million seed round to further its insurance payments platform that combines financing, collections and payables.</p>
<p>First Round Capital led the round and was joined by Susa Ventures, FirstMark Capital, Box Group and a group of angel investors, including Coalition CEO Joshua Motta, Newfront Insurance executives Spike Lipkin and Gordon Wintrob, Vouch Insurance CEO Sam Hodges, Layr Insurance CEO Phillip Hodges, Anzen Insurance CEO Max Bruner, Counterpart Insurance CEO Tanner Hackett, former Bunker Insurance CEO Chad Nitschke, SageSure executive Paul VanderMarck, Instacart co-founders Max Mullen and Brandon Leonardo and Houseparty co-founder Ben Rubin.</p>
<p>This is the first funding for the company that is live in 20 states. It developed payments APIs to automate end-to-end insurance payments and to offer a buy now, pay later financing option for distribution of commissions and carrier payables, something co-founder and co-CEO Andrew Wynn, said was rather unique to commercial insurance.</p>
<p>Wynn started the company in January 2021 with his co-founder Praveen Chekuri after working together at Instacart. They originally started Sheltr, which connected customers with trained maintenance professionals and was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191121005276/en/Hippo-Expands-Its-Proactive-Suite-of-Offerings">acquired by Hippo</a> in 2019. While working with insurance companies they recognized how fast the insurance industry was modernizing, yet insurance sellers still struggled with customer experiences due to outdated payments processes. They started Ascend to solve that payments pain point.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startup insurance provider Vouch raises $90M, now valued at $550M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/vouch-business-insurance-provider-to-startups-raises-90m-and-is-now-valued-at-550m/embed/#?secret=AHPw7xadyp" data-secret="AHPw7xadyp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The insurance industry is largely still operating on pen-and-paper â some 600 million paper checks are processed each year, Wynn said. He referred to insurance as a âspaghetti web of money movementâ where payments can take up to 100 days to get to the insurance carrier from the customer as it makes its way through intermediaries. In addition, one of the only ways insurance companies can make a profit is by taking those hundreds of millions of dollars in payments and investing it.</p>
<p>Home and auto insurance can be broken up into payments, but the commercial side is not as customer friendly, Wynn said. Insurance is often paid in one lump sum annually, though, paying tens of thousands of dollars in one payment is not something every business customer can manage. Ascend is offering point-of-sale financing to enable insurance brokers to break up those commercial payments into monthly installments.</p>
<p>âInsurance carriers continue to focus on annual payments because they donât have a choice,â he added. âThey want all of their money up front so they can invest it. Our platform not only reduces the friction with payments by enabling customers to pay how they want to pay, but also helps carriers sell more insurance.â</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Startups like Ascend aiming to disrupt the insurance industry are also attracting venture capital, with recent examples including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/vouch-business-insurance-provider-to-startups-raises-90m-and-is-now-valued-at-550m/">Vouch</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/marshmallow-insurance-85-million/">Marshmallow</a>, which raised close to $100 million, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/insurify-a-virtual-insurance-agent-raises-100m-series-b/">Insurify</a> raised $100 million.</p>
<p>Wynn sees other companies doing verticalized payment software for other industries, like healthcare insurance, which he says is a âgood sign for where the market is going.â This is where Wynn believes Ascend is competing, though some incumbents are offering premium financing, but not in the digital way Ascend is.</p>
<p>He intends to deploy the new funds into product development, go-to-market initiatives and new hires for its locations in New York and Palo Alto. He said the raise attracted a group of angel investors in the industry, who were looking for a product like this to help them sell more insurance versus building it from scratch.</p>
<p>Having only been around eight months, it is a bit early for Ascend to have some growth to discuss, but Wynn said the company signed its first customer in July and six more in the past month. The customers are big digital insurance brokerages and represent, together, $2.5 billion in premiums. He also expects to get licensed to operate as a full payment in processors in all states so the company can be in all 50 states by the end of the year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Insurify, a &#8216;virtual insurance agent,&#8217; raises $100M Series B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/insurify-a-virtual-insurance-agent-raises-100m-series-b/embed/#?secret=d2DJnEMoIT" data-secret="d2DJnEMoIT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The ultimate goal of the company is not to replace brokers, but to offer them the technology to be more efficient with their operations, Wynn said.</p>
<p>âBrokers are here to stay,â he added. âWhat will happen is that brokers who are tech-enabled will be able to serve customers nationally and run their business, collect payments, finance premiums and reduce backend operation friction.â</p>
<p>Bill Trenchard, partner at First Round Capital, met Wynn while he was still with Sheltr. He believes insurtech and fintech are following a similar story arc where disruptive companies are going to market with lower friction and better products and, being digital-first, are able to meet customers where they are.</p>
<p>By moving digital payments over to insurance, Ascend and others will lead the market, which is so big that there will be many opportunities for companies to be successful. The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/commercial-insurance-market-is-projected-to-reach-usd-1-227-80-billion-by-2028-growing-at-a-cagr-of-8-5-valuates-reports-890462419.html">global commercial insurance market</a> was valued at $692.33 billion in 2020, and expected to top $1 trillion by 2028.</p>
<p>Like other firms, First Round looks for team, product and market when it evaluates a potential investment and Trenchard said Ascend checked off those boxes. Not only did he like how quickly the team was moving to create momentum around themselves in terms of securing early pilots with customers, but also getting well known digital-first companies on board.</p>
<p>âThe magic is in how to automate the underwriting, how to create a data moat and be a first mover â if you can do all three, that is great,â Trenchard said. âInstant approvals and using data to do a better job than others is a key advantage and is going to change how insurance is bought and sold.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The ability to offer stock options is utterly essential to startups. They convince talented people to join when the startup is unlikely to be capable of matching the high salaries that larger, established tech firms can offer.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s a complex business developing a competitive stockÂ optionÂ plan. Luckily, London-based VC Index Ventures today launches both a handy web app to calculate all this, plus new research into how startups are compensating their key hires across Europe and the US.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.indexventures.com/optionplan/#expected_funding_rounds_pre_exit=series-b-and-c&#038;employee_country=us&#038;mode=seed">OptionPlanÂ Seed</a>, is a web-app for seed-stage founders designing ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans).Â â¨The web app is based on Indexâs analysis of seed-stageÂ optionÂ grants, drawing on data from over 1,000 startups.</p>
<p>The web app covers a variety of roles; 6 different levels of allocation benchmarks; calculates potential financial upside for each team member (including tax); and adjusts according to policy frameworks in the US, Canada, Israel, Australia, and 20 European countries.</p>
<p>It also builds on theÂ <a href="https://www.indexventures.com/optionplan/#expected_funding_rounds_pre_exit=series-b-and-c&#038;employee_country=us&#038;mode=venture">OptionPlanÂ for Series A companies</a>Â that Index  launched a few years ago.</p>
<p>As part of its research for the new tool, Index said it found that almost all seed-stage employees receive stock options. However, while this reaches 97% of technical hires at seed-stage startups and 80% of junior non-technical hires for startups in the US, in Europe only 75% of technical hires receive options, dropping to 60% for junior non-technical hires.</p>
<p>That said, Index found stockÂ optionÂ grant sizes are increasing, particularly among startups âwith a lot of technical DNA, and weighted towards the Bay Areaâ. In less tech-heavy sectors such as e-commerce or content, grant sizes have not shifted much. Meanwhile, grants are still larger overall as seed valuations have grown in the last few years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Index found the ESOP size is increasing at seed stage, following a faster rate of hiring, and larger grants per employee. Index recommends an ESOP size at seed stage is set at 12.5% or 15%, rather than the more traditional 10% in order to retain and attract staff.</p>
<p>The research also found seed fundraise sizes and valuations have doubled, while valuations have risen by 2.5x, in Europe and the US. â¨</p>
<p>Additionally, salaries at seed have ârisen dramaticallyâ with average salaries rising in excess of 60%. Senior tech roles at seed-stage startups in the US now earn an average $185,000 salary, a 68% increase over 3 years, and can rise to over $220,000. But in Europe, the biggest salary increases have been for junior roles, both technical and non-technical.â¨</p>
<p>â¨That said, Index found that âEuropeâs technical talent continues to have a compensation gapâ with seed-stage technical employees in Europe still being paid 40-50% less on average than their US counterparts. Indeed, Index found this gap had actually widened since 2018, âdespite a narrowing of the gap for non-technical rolesâ.â¨</p>
<p>Index also found variations in salaries across Europe are âmuch wider than the USâ,  reflecting high-cost hubs like London, versus lower-cost cities like Bucharest or Warsaw.</p>
<p>The war for talent is now global, with the compensation gap for technical hires narrowing to 20-25% compared to the US.â¨</p>
<p>Indexâs conclusion is that âambitious seed founders in Europe should raise the bar in terms of who they hire, particularly in technical rolesâ as well as aiming for more experienced and higher-caliber candidates, larger fundraises to be competitive on salaries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://inspiredcapital.com/">Inspired Capital</a>, the New York-based early-stage venture firm that was founded in 2019 by entrepreneurs Alexa von Tobel and Penny Pritzker, is today announcing the close of their second fund with $281 million in capital commitments, an amount that brings the firm&#8217;s total assets under management to nearly half a billion dollars. (Inspired raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/inspired-capital-founded-by-alexa-von-tobel-and-penny-pritzker-just-closed-its-debut-fund-with-200-million/">$200 million</a> for its debut fund.)</p>
<p>We talked earlier this week with von Tobel about the portfolio of 25 companies that her firm &#8212; which also counts as cofounders partner Lucy Deland and COO Mark Batsiyan &#8212; helped to fund with its first vehicle. We also talked, of course, about Inspired&#8217;s new fund, which, like its predecessor, will be used to invest in a wide range of companies, mostly, but not exclusively, in the U.S.</p>
<p>Excerpts from that conversation follow.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have a larger fund &#8212; will the strategy remain the same?</strong></p>
<p>AV: We&#8217;re the same team, same strategy, same everything, so [writing] seed to Series A [checks]. We can go from early, early seed &#8212; truly, like a napkin idea &#8212;Â  all the way to writing $15 million checks. We&#8217;re still really collaborative, so we both lead and co-lead deals. We&#8217;re a generalist fund investing around the country, so our first fund was equally weighted on East and West Coasts by companies that ranged from many categories.</p>
<p>[Editor&#8217;s note: some of these include the business banking startup Rho, a LatAm real estate company called Habi, the embedded payments startup Finix, and an autonomous landscaping startup called Scythe that makes all-electric mowers and employs a robots-as-a-service revenue model.]</p>
<p><strong>TC: You rolled out your first fund five months before the coronavirus shut down the U.S. How did that impact you?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AV: We stood up fund one in February, 2019, then I had my third child, then we closed the fund that summer, so yes, we literally went into COVID. But it was a brand-new fund with fresh capital, so by nature, any of the companies that we backed, we&#8217;d <em>just</em> backed, so they were in good shape; they had 24 months of runway.</p>
<p>Also, our team has over 55 years of connectivity. Lucy and I have known each other for 20 years. Mark and I have known each other for 11 years. Penny and I have known each other for almost a decade. Our VP of platform has been with me for 12 years. Even [my PR firm] has been with me for almost 12 years, so that allowed us to be extremely nimble to what was happening in the world.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/14/what-startups-can-learn-from-learnvests-250-million-acquisition/"> founded and sold</a> a financial planning company, LearnVest. Inspired isn&#8217;t funding fintech exclusively, but it sounds like you are investing only in the U.S. when there&#8217;s a lot happening in fintech elsewhere, too.</strong></p>
<p>AV: We invested 40% of our first fund on the East Coast, 40% on the West Coast, and 20% in the middle of the country, as well as internationally. For example, we have a great [Bogota, Colombia-based] portfolio company called <a href="https://habi.co/">Habi</a> that&#8217;s on an exceptional course and that just raised <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2021/06/27/colombian-ibuyer-habi-raises-100m-in-softbank-led-series-b/">$100 million</a> led by SoftBank. I&#8217;ve known [cofounder Brynne McNulty Rojas] for years, and we had a really clear thesis on the category, so I went and tapped her on the shoulder and said, &#8216;Can we back you?&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: Which companies have received the most capital from Inspired so far?</strong></p>
<p>AV: Habi is one. Another is <a href="https://www.meetdandy.com/">Dandy</a> [a company that&#8217;s trying to modernize the dental lab process]. A third is <a href="https://orum.io/">Orum</a> that we helped incubate. [It aims to speed up interbank transfer and closed on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/orum-raises-56m/">$56 million</a> in Series B funding in June.] It was super early. It was my old team from LearnVest.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you planning to incubate more companies, or was that more of an anomaly?</strong></p>
<p>AV: When the stars properly align, you will absolutely see more of that from us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Businesses and the tech companies that serve them are run on data. At best, it can be used to help with decision-making, to understand how well or badly an organization is doing, and to build new systems to run the next generation of services. At its most challenging, though, data can represent a real headache: there is too much of it, in too many places, and too much of a task to bring it into any kind of order.</p>
<p>Enter a startup called Matillion, which has built a platform to help companies harness their data so that it <em>can</em> be used, and what&#8217;s more the platform is not just for data scientists, but it&#8217;s written with a &#8220;low-code&#8221; approach that can be used by a wider group of users.</p>
<p>Today, it is announcing a big round of investment &#8212; $150 million at a $1.5 billion valuation &#8212; a sign not just of Matillion&#8217;s traction in this space, but of the market demand for the tech that it has built.</p>
<p>The company currently has &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of large enterprise customers, including Hundreds of large enterprises including Western Union, FOX, Sony, Slack, National Grid, Peetâs Coffee and Cisco for projects ranging from business intelligence and visualization through to artificial intelligence and machine learning applications.</p>
<p>General Atlantic is leading the funding, with Battery Ventures, Sapphire Ventures, Scale Venture Partners, and Lightspeed Venture Partners &#8212; some of the biggest enterprise startup investors in the world &#8212; also participating. Matillion last raised money &#8212; a Series D of around $100 million million &#8212; as recently as February this year, at what was an undisclosed valuation at the time.</p>
<p>Announcing this latest round at a $1.5 billion valuation is significant not just for Matillion. The startup was founded in Manchester (it now also has a base in Denver), and this makes it one of a handful of tech startups out of the city &#8212; others we&#8217;ve recently covered include The Hut Group, Peak AI and Fractory &#8212; now hitting the big leagues and helping to put it on the innovation map as an urban center to watch.</p>
<p>Matthew Scullion, the startup&#8217;s CEO and founder, explained that the crux of the issue Matillion is addressing is the diamond-in-the-rough promise of big data. Typically, large organizations are producing giant amounts of data every day, hugely valuable information as long as it can be tapped efficiently. The problem is that this data is often sitting across a lot of different places &#8212; typically large organizations might have over 1,000 data sources, apps sitting across multiple clouds and servers, and storage across Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, and Databricks. On top of this, while a lot of that data is very structured, those sources are not necessarily aligned with each other.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Data has become the new currency, and the world is pivoting to that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s changing all aspects of how we work, and it is happening very fast. But the problem is that the worldâs ability to innovate with data is constrained. Itâs not the shortage of data or demand to put it to work, but the point is the worldâs ability to make that data useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matillion has answered that with a framework and system that can both identify data sources and basically bring order to them, without needing to move the data from one place to another in order to be used. It&#8217;s an ETL (extract, transform, and load) provider, and it is far from being the only one in the market, with others like Dataiku, Talent, SnapLogic, as well as cloud providers like AWS and Microsoft, among the many trying to address this area.</p>
<p>The difference with Matillion, Scullion said, is that it has democratized platform, so that organizations don&#8217;t have to rely on data scientists to get involved in order to use it, by building a low-code interface around it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have made it accessible, intuitive and easy to use by bringing in a low-code approach,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Weâve developed a platform and data operating system that has all the things in the kit bag that an organization needs to make it useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is important because, as big data analytics and the tools to build these processes become more mainstream and themselves take on low-code interfaces, Matillion is providing a way for those less technical users to source and use their data, too. This means more efficiency, less cost, and more time for data scientists to work on more difficult problems and do less busy work.</p>
<p>âAs organizations look for ways to harness data to make better business decisions, the market for cloud data integration and transformation is expanding,â said Chris Caulkin, MD and Head of Technology for EMEA at General Atlantic. âWe believe that Matillionâs low-code ETL platform simplifies the process of constructing data pipelines and preparing data for analysis, enabling citizen data scientists and data engineers alike to play a valuable role in extracting data-based insights. We look forward to supporting the team through its next phase of growth and expansion.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, a startup called Olive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/olive-launch/">launched its new shopping site and app</a> with the goal of making e-commerce more efficient, convenient, and sustainable by offering a way for consumers to aggregate their orders from across retailers into single shipments that arrive in reusable packaging, not cardboard. If items need to be returned, those same packages are reused. Otherwise, Olive will return to pick them up. Since its February 2021 debut, the company has grown to include over 100 retailers, predominately in the fashion space. Today, it&#8217;s expanding again by adding support for another 25 beauty retailers.</p>
<p>Launch partners on the new effort include brands like Supergoop!, Kora Organics, Pai Skincare, Erno Laszlo, Jecca Blac, Sahajan, Clark&#8217;s Botanicals, NuFace, Purlisse, Cover FX, LYS Beauty, SiO Beauty, Peace Out Skincare, Koh Gen Do, Julep Beauty, In Common Beauty, Indie Lee, Glow Recipe, Ursa Major, RMS Beauty, Ceremonia, Sweet Chef, Follain, and BalmLabs.</p>
<p>They join Olive&#8217;s numerous apparel and accessory retailers like Adidas, Superga, Rag &amp; Bone, Birdies, Vince, Goop, Khaite, and Veronica Beard, among others.</p>
<p>To support the expansion, Olive also developed a new set of reusable packaging that has protective elements for more damageable items. While before, the company had offered a variety of packages like soft-sided garment bags and various sizes of more rigid containers (see below), it&#8217;s now introducing its own alternative to the air bubble strips you&#8217;ll find in most Amazon boxes these days. Olive&#8217;s version is integrated into its reusable packaging and can be easily deflated by the customer when it&#8217;s time to return the package at pickup.</p>

<p>The idea for Olive is a timely one. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/covid-19-pandemic-accelerated-shift-to-e-commerce-by-5-years-new-report-says/">e-commerce adoption has soared</a>. But so has consumers&#8217; guilt. Multiple packages land on doorsteps every week, with cardboard and plastic to recycle &#8212; if that&#8217;s even available in your area. Delivery trucks &#8212; Amazon, UPS, FedEx, and others &#8212; are now a daily spectacle on every city street. Meanwhile, market leaders like Amazon and Walmart seem largely interested in increasing the speed of delivery, not necessarily the efficiency and sustainability.

<p>Olive founder Nate Faust says he was inspired to build the company after realizing how little interest there was from larger e-commerce players in addressing some of the inconveniences and inefficiencies in the market. Faust had previously served as a vice president at Quidsi (which ran Diapers.com and Soap.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/08/confirmed-amazon-spends-545-million-on-diapers-com-parent-quidsi/">and sold to Amazon</a>), then co-founder and COO at Jet, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/08/confirmed-walmart-buys-jet-com-for-3b-in-cash/">acquired by Walmart for $3.3 billion</a>. Before Olive, he was a senior vice president at Walmart.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After some soul searching, he realized he wanted to build something in the e-commerce space that was focused more on the social and environmental impact, not just on driving growth and consumption.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had an epiphany one evening when taking out the trash and recycling,&#8221; Faust explains. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty crazy that we&#8217;re this far into e-commerce and this is the status quo delivery experience &#8212;Â  all this waste, which is both an environmental issue and a hassle for consumers,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And the bigger issue than the packaging is actually the fact that the majority of those packages are delivered one at a time, and those last-mile emissions are actually the biggest contributor of carbon emissions in the post-purchase e-commerce supply chain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Consumers may not think about all the issues, because many of them are hidden, but they do struggle in other ways beyond dealing with the waste. Returns are still a hassle &#8212; so much so, that Amazon now allows customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/you-can-now-take-your-amazon-returns-to-all-kohls-stores/">to go to Kohl&#8217;s</a> where it&#8217;s partnered on in-store return kiosks that also help the brick-and-mortar retailer increase their own foot traffic.</p>
<p>Plus, consumers who shop from different sites have to set up online accounts over and over, entering in addresses and payment information many times, which is an annoyance. Olive offers the convenience of an Amazon-like one-stop-shop experience on that front.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Olive addresses the return issue by allowing consumers to simply place their unwanted items back in Olive&#8217;s packaging then leave them on their doorstep or with the building&#8217;s doorman for return. It works with both the USPS and a network of local carriers to serve the customers in its current footprint, which is about 100 million U.S. consumers on both coasts.</p>
<p>While customers don&#8217;t have to deal with packaging, it hasn&#8217;t been entirely eliminated from the equation at this point. Olive today partners with retailers who ship packages to its own west coast and east coast warehouses, where they repackage them into the reusable containers to deliver to customers. Right now, that means Olive is responsible for the recycling issues. But it&#8217;s working with its brand partners to have them pack orders directly into the reusable packaging from the start &#8212; before shipping to Olive&#8217;s consolidation warehouses for delivery. Today, it has a few retailers on board with this effort, but it hopes that will eventually expand to include all partners.</p>
<p>The company generates revenue on an affiliate commission model, which works for now. But over time, it may need to evolve that business model over time, as its customer base and partnerships grow. At present, around 10,000 consumers have used Olive, ahead of any large-scale marketing and customer acquisition efforts on the startup&#8217;s part.</p>
<p>For now, New York-based Olive is growing its business by way of a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/olive-0779-series-a--d6a07429">fundraise</a> of around $15 millionÂ from investors including Invus, Primary Venture Partners, and SignalFire.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[SmarterTravel provides personalized travel recommendations and targeted travel content.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Travel startups continue to rake in venture capital dollars as more people become comfortable traveling amid the global pandemic. The latest is SmarterTravel, which brought in $9.5 million in Series B funding co-led by Link Ventures and Second Alpha, with existing investors also participating.</p>
<p>In addition to the fundraise, the company, a provider of personalized travel recommendations and targeted travel content, announced its name change from HopJump, which reflects the companyâs renewed vision of providing an informative online travel experience, CEO Jordan Staab told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202707" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202707" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2202707" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202707" class="wp-caption-text">Jordan Staab, CEO of SmarterTravel. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> SmarterTravel</p></div></p>
<p>SmarterTravel has 7 million email newsletter subscribers and uses proprietary artificial intelligence fixes to give customers travel information and discounts. The company writes articles on every facet of travel to inform customers, especially now with airlines, hotels and countries placing certain restrictions on travel.</p>
<p>âThe travel consumer is changing how they absorb information,â Staab said. âThe consumer is coming to us instead of visiting 20 websites before they book. Before, you might have combed through reviews, but now you just want an expert to tell you, and that is what we are.â</p>
<p>HopJump was co-founded in 2018 by Staab as a digital marketing agency helping big brands with user acquisition campaigns. As it was building up to an initial public offering, Staab said the company wanted to move into building its own brand and saw an opportunity in travel, which accounts for a big market â 10% of global gross domestic product, he added.</p>
<p>The company went on to provide hotel discount travel prices to consumers but found it to be challenging. There are a lot of nuances and different approaches for offering four-star hotel rooms for two-star prices and bundling tactics, Staab explained.</p>
<p>âWe fell in love with uncomplicating the process,â he said. âConsumers just want a good price from a company they trust, and that is what we set out to solve.â</p>
<p>In January 2020, the company launched its first product and had 60 members join in the first few months, but then the global pandemic hit. Suddenly, HopJump went from managing rapid growth to managing how the company might shut down.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Headout raises $12M, plans to hire 150+ people as domestic travel rebounds&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/headout-raises-12m-plans-to-hire-150-people-as-domestic-travel-rebounds/embed/#?secret=5f3jDVigeJ" data-secret="5f3jDVigeJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Still eager to stay in travel, the company pivoted back to marketing so it could continue examining the travel industry, he said. While the company was figuring out its next move, Staab said folks at SmarterTravel were helpful to them, and when he heard that its parent company, TripAdvisor, was needing to make layoffs, and that division was going to be let go, he decided to purchase that asset along with seven others, including Airfarewatchdog, Family Vacation Critic and Oyster. The deal closed in 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lisa Dolan, managing director at Link Ventures, said that SmarterTravelâs growth was one of the drivers of her firmâs investment. When no one was traveling due to COVID, the company acquired travel companies and made it through the pandemic while other startups in the space were struggling.</p>
<p>She also cited its strong revenue-generating business on the email side and that it capitalized on the fact that even in the pandemic, people were conducting web searches for car rentals, things to do in certain cities and looking for vacation inspiration.</p>
<p>SmarterTravel is going after a <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/962/global-tourism/">U.S. travel and tourism industry</a> valued at $580.7 billion in 2019. It is also not the only one to gain investor attention recently. For example, just over the past month companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/thatch-using-3m-round-to-put-travel-creators-on-the-map/">Thatch raised $3 million</a> for its platform aimed at travel creators, travel tech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/hopper-raises-170m-on-3-5b-valuation-as-travel-surges-and-its-fintech-tools-help-offset-variant-concerns/">Hopper brought in $175 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/wheel-the-world-raises-2m-to-provide-unlimited-experiences-for-travelers-with-limited-accessibility/">Wheel the World grabbed $2 million</a> for its disability-friendly vacation planner and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/elude-raises-2-1m-to-show-spontaneous-travelers-the-best-destinations-for-their-budgets/">Elude raised $2.1 million</a> to bring spontaneous travel back to a hard-hit industry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the funding will drive SmarterTravelâs aim to grow rapidly in terms of getting its name out there, building new travel products and hiring key staff. The company already has 50 people, but needs more, Staab said.</p>
<p>âTravel has had a tough couple of years, but some pockets of it are back, and we are seeing that,â he added. âIn a year that should have been a bad year, our growth has been good. We were up eight times in revenue in the past 12 months. We are growing, profitable and have extra funding to lean into the growth. It is not going to be easy growth, but we are well-positioned to understand how to do it.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric vehicle fleet and infrastructure startup Gravity thinks it has cracked the code for urban EV charging infrastructure.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which was founded in February this year, announced its construction project to convert an indoor parking garage in the middle of Manhattan into a public EV fast charging hub. When the 29-space garage on 42nd Street, which Gravity is leasing from real estate firm Related Companies, opens in within a few weeks, it will be the islandâs first dedicated EV charging space. Based on Gravityâs plans to scale, it wonât be the last.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âWeâll probably see five to ten fast charging sites of different capacity in Manhattan over the next six months or so,â Moshe Cohen, Gravityâs CEO and founder told TechCrunch. âWeâve gone with Con Ed to dozens of sites in the five boroughs. Weâve surveyed the power grid and have plans to scale because it doesnât work as a one-off. It works with scale, with coverage areas.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding a place to park your car in New York City is a nightmare in and of itself. Finding a park </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a charge for your EV is like finding a unicorn, and probably an expensive unicorn at that. Most of NYCâs EV charge points are behind the literal paywalls of parking garages, where you might find one or two Blink or EV Connect chargers nestled into a sea of ICE vehicle parking spaces. With Gravityâs hub, parking is free while cars are being charged. The only cost is that of electricity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gravity is not the first to recognize the problem of charging electric vehicles in an urban core. Electric mobility company Revel, first known for its shared e-mopeds around New York City, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/revel-unveils-electric-vehicle-fast-charging-superhub-with-25-chargers-in-brooklyn/">opened the cityâs first public fast charging hub in an outdoor lot in Brooklyn this past June</a>. Con Edison, New Yorkâs electric utility company, has supported both initiatives with its </span><a href="https://www.coned.com/en/save-money/rebates-incentives-tax-credits/rebates-incentives-tax-credits-for-residential-customers/electric-vehicle-rewards"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electric vehicle charging incentives and rewards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Gravity&#8217;s site at Manhattan Plaza, the company worked with Con Ed to pull spare capacity power from two separate utility rooms on 42nd Street and Ninth Avenue, bringing in around 2,400 amps of power, which Cohen says is extremely rare to have condensed in one place in any city, let alone New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cohen said he spent a long time location-scouting before choosing this as Gravityâs first spot, and proximity to power wasnât the only game changer here. The site has its own dedicated entrance off 42nd Street and falls right between Ninth and Tenth Avenues, which is not only close to Times Square and the heart of the city, but also to the Lincoln Tunnel which provides access to and from New Jersey.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âOur vision is we are bringing infrastructure to all the places that cars are right now, so if you&#8217;re in our coverage area, you should never have to worry about charging your vehicle, because it&#8217;ll get charged where it&#8217;s parked,â said Cohen. âSo if you think about dense urban areas like Manhattan or downtown Chicago, where are cars parked? Theyâre either on a curb or they&#8217;re inside parking garages, and they&#8217;re very space constrained. And so you have to design different equipment that deals with the space and power constraints in order to have charging happen in all those places.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design is a big part of Gravityâs business model, from the design of the space itself to the charging equipment. The company says itâs collaborating with Jasmit Rangr, an architect who is known for integrating his buildings with the landscape, climate and environment, in order to transform garages into attractive and welcoming spaces that house clean electric vehicles.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThe whole area is for EVs only, so itâs really a chance to showcase an experience around what the world would look like if parking areas for cars had no pollution or oil spills,â said Cohen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the renderings do look pretty flash â not at all the dark, creepy, petrol-smelling caverns that one associates with city parking garages. Gravity says Rangr also integrated interactive touchscreens into the designs of the various spaces the company is building out around NYC. The touchscreens are designed by Gravity to help users adjust and monitor their vehicleâs charging as they wait amongst the light-filled wooden car cubbies and try to decide if the plant decor is real or fake.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing standardized and simplified equipment was a big concern for Cohen, as well. He says the current model for public charging equipment in most cases includes an amalgamation of software, hardware and payment processing that are not very well integrated. Gravity has worked with an unnamed manufacturing partner to consolidate those segments and create a more seamless user experience, and that includes whatâs happening on the back end of the charge, according to the company.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gravityâs first site will accommodate about 22 fast chargers, three intermediate chargers and a few slow chargers. All of the fast chargers are up to 180kW, which means that even when two vehicles are plugged into one installation, each plug can do 90 kW of energy. Cohen says anything below 80 kW isnât truly fast charging, and many of the companies that claim they offer fast charging are really only <a href="https://chargehub.com/en/full-details-page.html?locId=63245">able to put out around 62.5 kW</a>. Cohen also says by sending that current through 400 amp charging cables, even smaller volt batteries like those in Teslas can receive more than 80 kW.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intermediate chargers use about 24kW to 30 kW equipment and charge cars within one to three hours. The slow chargers charge overnight or within six to eight hours using 11 kW equipment.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the parking spots will be taken up by Gravityâs fleet of Tesla Model Y yellow cabs, which will charge overnight, says Cohen. Bringing a fleet of electric taxis to NYC was actually the impetus behind building charging infrastructure. Cohen has a soft spot for the yellow cab as an institution and wanted to come up with a way to give it a Renaissance. He got the greenlight from Tesla to lease the vehicles for this use case and worked with the cityâs Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) to change the rules so a Tesla could be seen as a taxi before setting out on the harder task of how to charge the fleet.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âI talked to all the major charging equipment companies, and I quickly realized that there&#8217;s no charging equipment that is set up for charging fleets, and I realized the extent of the problem,â said Cohen. âWe started thinking about infrastructure because the model just does not work without infrastructure and a yellow taxi using a model Y requires high levels of utilization and scale.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, the T</span><a href="https://insideevs.com/news/506007/tesla-modely-taxi-fleet-nyc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LC approved Gravityâs pilot program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Cohen said the agency is going to release an MOU to continue the program within the next few weeks. In the meantime, Gravity wants to ramp up installing equipment at scale so that it can then grow its fleet.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;People think of mobility as this drain of cash and nobody has figured it out,&#8221; said Cohen. &#8220;I actually think that mobility and infrastructure are going to get solved together, and you&#8217;ll be able to make margins off utilization that are generous.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building credit history can be difficult if you are a consumer that is having trouble getting access to credit in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter <a href="https://www.tomocredit.com/">TomoCredit</a>, which has developed a credit card focused on building credit history for first-time borrowers. The San Francisco-based startup is announcing today that it has raised $10 million in a Series A funding round co-led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kapor Capital and KB Investment Inc. (KBIC), a subsidiary of South Koreaâs leading consumer bank. Lewis &amp; Clark Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, Knollwood Investment Advisory, WTI, Bronze and Square co-founder Sam Wen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">also participated in the Series A financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital comes just over seven months after TomoCredit raised $7 million in seed funding, and brings its total raised this year to $17 million. The company also announced today it has appointed Ash Gupta, former CRO at American Express, to its board.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TomoCredit co-founder and CEO Kristy Kim came up with the concept for the company after being rejected multiple times for an auto loan while in her early 20s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim, who immigrated to the U.S. from South Korea with her family as a child, was disappointed that her lack of credit history proved to be such an obstacle despite the fact she had a job âand positive cash flow.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So she teamed up with Dmitry Kashlev, a Russian immigrant, in January of 2019 to create a solution for other foreign-born individuals and young adults facing similar credit challenges. That fall, the startup (short for Tomorrowâs Credit) was accepted into the Barclays Accelerator, powered by Techstars.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech offers a credit card aimed at helping first-time borrowers build credit history, based on their cash flow, rather than on their FICO or credit report ratings. Its biggest differentiator, believes Kim, is that it has no fees, no APR and no credit pull. Traditional credit products rely heavily on fees and APR, she said, while TomoCredit makes money through merchant fees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TomoCredit is powered by Finicity (which was acquired by Mastercard last year), and leverages that companyâs data network and open banking technology so that it can âsecurelyâ access applicantsâ bank accounts to obtain financial data for underwriting purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once approved, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">applicants receive the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/this-mba-student-is-building-a-way-to-give-immigrants-credit-where-credit-is-due/">TomoCredit Mastercard</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The goal is to bring âmillions of individuals that lack a credit score into the financial system, allowing a diverse group of consumers the opportunity to better position themselves as qualified candidates for mortgages, auto loans, or other major life purchases,â the company said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TomoCredit has already pre-approved more than 300,000 customers and expects to issue a total of 500,000 cards by yearâs end, according to Kim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âWeâve grown 10x this year from the beginning of 2021,â Kim said. âStill, this round came together earlier than expected.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something that has been surprising to Kim is the interest from a variety of types of consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âIn the beginning, we thought international students and immigrants would be most interested in our product,â she told TechCrunch. âBut after launching, weâve realized that so many people can benefit &#8212; from gig economy workers to YouTubers to any young person who hasnât had a chance to build credit yet. The market is way bigger than we even realized.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early 2022, the company plans to roll out the Tomo Black card, a product for some of its existing customers that âare showing good performance.â Itâs currently testing it with some of its existing user base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThis is a premium product that can grow with our customers, who we want to retain over the next 10 to 20 years,â Kim said. â</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We donât want our product to be a stop-gap solution.â</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202805" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202805" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2202805 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg 4501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202805" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TomoCredit</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital to do more hiring and enhance features such as weekly autopay and high credit limits in an effort to âboost credit scores faster,â she added. Currently, TomoCredit has about 30 employees, up from 10 at the time of its last raise in February.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âM</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">y main focus is recruiting top talent,â Kim said, noting that the company had already hired âsome senior people from Wells Fargo.âÂ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âWhen we recruit and hire, we care about diversity,â she added. âWeâre building products for people who have been traditionally underserved by major banks. I think to align with our mission, we should embody that in building our team. More than 50% of our execs are female. The entire risk team is female. We are diverse in terms of gender, age and ethnicity because we want to truly understand our customers and build a product that is inclusive.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Dixon, partner at Kapor Capital, points out that there</span><span class="s1"> are about 45 million people in the U.S. who should have credit scores, but cannot take out a loan, get a credit card, or apply for a mortgage. And that number is only increasing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;When we learned that Kristy experienced these issues firsthand when she moved to the United States and thoughtfully figured out a way to circumvent the predatory and broken credit card system, it deepened our conviction in her and the product itself,&#8221; he wrote via email.</span></p>
<p>Dixon believes that TomoCredit&#8217;s model of not charging the user makes it a &#8220;<span class="s1">safe and affordable alternative&#8221; to what is in the market.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">&#8220;Their mission aligns with our thesis of closing gaps of access and opportunity in the credit space at large as well,&#8221; he added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In order to support a buildout of renewable energy, which tends to over-generate electricity at certain times of day and under-generate at others, the grid is going to need a lot of batteries. While lithium-ion works fine for consumer electronics and even electric vehicles, battery startup EnerVenue says it developed a breakthrough technology to revolutionize stationary energy storage.</p>
<p>The technology itself â nickel-hydrogen batteries â isnât actually new. In fact, itâs been used for decades in aerospace applications, to power everything from satellites to the International Space Station and the Hubble Telescope. Nickel-hydrogen had been too expensive to scale for terrestrial applications, until Stanford University professor (and now EnerVenue chairman) Yi Cui determined a way to adapt the materials and bring the costs way, way down.</p>
<p>Nickel-hydrogen has a number of key benefits over lithium-ion, according to EnerVenue: it can withstand super-high and super-low temperatures (so no need for air conditioners or thermal management systems); it requires very little to no maintenance; and it has a far longer lifespan.</p>
<p>The technology has caught the eye of two giants in the oil and gas industry, energy infrastructure company Schlumberger and Saudi Aramcoâs VC arm, who together with Stanford University have raised $100 million in Series A funding. The investment comes around a year after EnerVenue raised a $12 million seed. The company is planning on using the funds to scale its nickel-hydrogen battery production, including a Gigafactory in the U.S., and has entered a manufacturing and distribution agreement with Schlumberger for international markets.</p>
<p>âI spent almost three and a half years prior to EnerVenue looking for a battery storage technology that I thought could compete with lithium-ion,â CEO Jorg Heinemann told TechCrunch in a recent interview. âI had essentially given up.â Then he met with Cui, who had managed through his research to bring the cost down from around $20,000 per kilowatt hour to $100 per kilowatt hour within line of sight â a jaw-dropping decrease that puts it on-par with existing energy storage technology today.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202350" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202350" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2202350" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg 4480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202350" class="wp-caption-text">EnerVenue CEO Jorg Heinemann <strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://enervenue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EnerVenue <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Think of a nickel-hydrogen battery as a kind of battery-fuel cell hybrid. It charges by building up hydrogen inside a pressure vessel, and when it discharges, that hydrogen gets reabsorbed in water, Heinemann explained. One of the key differences between the batteries in space and the oneâs EnerVenue is developing on Earth is the materials. The nickel-hydrogen batteries in orbit use a platinum electrode, which Heinemann said accounts for as much as 70% of the cost of the battery. The legacy technology also uses a ceramic separator, another high cost. EnerVenueâs key innovation is finding new, low-cost and Earth-abundant materials (though the exact materials they arenât sharing).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Heinemann also hinted that an advanced team within the company is working on a separate technology breakthrough that could bring the cost down even further, to the range of around $30 per kilowatt hour or less.</p>
<p>Those arenât the only benefits. EnerVenueâs batteries can charge and discharge at different speeds depending on a customerâs needs. It can go from a 10-minute charge or discharge to as slow as a 10-20 hour charge-discharge cycle, though the company is optimizing for a roughly 2 hour charge and 4-8 hour discharge. EnerVenueâs batteries are also designed for 30,000 cycles without experiencing a decline in performance.</p>
<p>âAs renewables get cheaper and cheaper, there&#8217;s lots of time of the day where you&#8217;ve got, say, a 1-4-hour window of close to free power that can be used to charge something, and then it has to be dispatched fast or slow depending on when the grid needs it,â he said. âAnd our battery does that really well.â</p>
<p>Itâs notable that this round was funded by two companies that loom large in the oil and gas industry. âI think it&#8217;s nearly 100% of the oil and gas industry is now pivoting to renewables in a huge way,â Heinemann added. âThey all see the future as, the energy mix is shifting. We&#8217;re going to be 75% renewable by mid-century, most think it&#8217;s going to happen quicker, and those are based on studies that the oil and gas industry did. They see that and they know they need a new play.â</p>

<p>Donât expect nickel-hydrogen to start appearing in your iPhone anytime soon. The technology is big and heavy â even scaled down as much as possible, a nickel-hydrogen battery is still around the size of a two-liter water flask, so lithium-ion will definitely still play a major role in the future.</p>
<p>Stationary energy storage may have a different future. EnerVenue is currently in âlate-stageâ discussions on the site and partner for a United States factory to produce up to one gigawatt-hour of batteries annually, with the goal of eventually scaling even beyond that. Heinemann estimates that the tooling cap-ex per megawatt hour should be just 20% that of lithium ion. Under the partnership with Schlumberger, the infrastructure company will also be separately manufacturing batteries and selling them in Europe and the Middle East.</p>
<p>âIt&#8217;s a technology that works today,â Heinemann said. âWe&#8217;re not waiting on a technology breakthrough, there&#8217;s no science project in our future that we have to go achieve in order to prove out something. We know it works.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The EU will use legislation to push for greater resilience and sovereignty in regional semiconductor supply chains.</p>
<p>The bloc&#8217;s president trailed a forthcoming &#8216;European Chips Act&#8217; in a state of the union <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_4701">speech</a> today. Ursula von der Leyen suggested that gaining greater autonomy in chipmaking is now a key component of the EU&#8217;s overarching digital strategy.</p>
<p>She flagged the global shortage of semiconductors, which has led to slow downs in production for a range of products that rely on chips to drive data processing &#8212; from cars and trains to smartphones and other consumer electronics &#8212; as driving EU lawmakers&#8217; concern about European capacity in this area.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no digital without chips,&#8221; said von der Leyen. &#8220;While we speak, whole production lines are already working at reduced speed &#8212; despite growing demand &#8212; because of a shortage of semi-conductors.</p>
<p>&#8220;But while global demand has exploded, Europe&#8217;s share across the entire value chain, from design to manufacturing capacity has shrunk. We depend on state-of-the-art chips manufactured in Asia. So this is not just a matter of our competitiveness. This is also a matter of tech sovereignty. So let&#8217;s put all of our focus on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Chips Act will aim to link together the EU&#8217;s semiconductor research, design and testing capacities, she said, calling for &#8220;coordination&#8221; between EU and national investments in this area to help boost the bloc&#8217;s self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aim is to jointly create a state-of-the-art European chip ecosystem, including production. That ensures our security of supply and will develop new markets for ground-breaking European tech,&#8221; she added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The EU president couched the ambition for bolstering European chip capacity as a &#8220;daunting task&#8221; but likened the mission to what the bloc did with its Galileo satellite navigation system two decades ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today European satellites provide the navigation system for more than 2 billion smartphones worldwide. We are world leaders. So let&#8217;s be bold again, this time with semi-conductors.&#8221;</p>
<p>In follow up remarks, the EU&#8217;s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, put a little more meat on the bones of the legislative plan &#8212; saying the Commission wants to integrate Member State efforts into a &#8220;coherent&#8221; pan-EU semiconductor strategy and also create a framework &#8220;to avoid a race to national public subsidies fragmenting the single market&#8221;.</p>
<p>The aim will be to &#8220;set conditions to protect European interests and place Europe firmly in the global geopolitical landscape&#8221;, he added.</p>
<p>Per Breton, the Chip Act will comprise three elements: Firstly, a semiconductor research strategy that will aim to build on work being done by institutions such as IMEC in Belgium, LETI/CEA in France and Fraunhofer in Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building on the existing research partnership (the KDT Joint Undertaking), we need to up our game, and design a strategy to push the research ambitions of Europe to the next level while preserving our strategic interests,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>The second component will consist of a collective plan to boost European chipmaking capacity.</p>
<p>He said the planned legislation will aim to support chip supply chain monitoring and resilience across design, production, packaging, equipment and suppliers (e.g. producers of wafers).</p>
<p>The goal will be to support the development of European &#8220;mega fabs&#8221; that are able to produce high volumes of the most advanced (towards 2nm and below) and energy-efficient semiconductors.</p>
<p>However the EU isn&#8217;t planning for a future when it can make all the chips it needs itself.</p>
<p>The last plank of the European Chip Act will set out a framework for international co-operation and partnership.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is not to produce everything on our own here in Europe. In addition to making our local production more resilient, we need to design a strategy to diversify our supply chains in order to decrease over-dependence on a single country or region,&#8221; Breton went on. &#8220;And while the EU aims to remain the top global destination of foreign investment and we welcome foreign investment to help increase our production capacity especially in high-end technology, through the European Chips Act we will also put the right conditions in place to preserve Europeâs security of supply.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The US are now discussing a massive investment under the American Chips Act designed to finance the creation of an American research centre and to help open up advanced production factories. The objective is clear: to increase the resilience of US semiconductor supply chains,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taiwan is positioning itself to ensure its primacy on semiconductor manufacturing. China, too, is trying to close the technological gap as it is constrained by export control rules to avoid technological transfers. Europe cannot and will not lag behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>In additional documentation released today, the EU said the Chips Act will build on other digital initiatives already presented by the Von der Leyen Commission &#8212; such as moves to contain the power of &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; Internet giants and increase platforms&#8217; accountability (the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act</a>); regulate high risk applications of AI (the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">Artificial Intelligence Act)</a>; tackle online disinformation (via a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/europe-to-press-the-adtech-industry-to-help-fight-online-disinformation/">beefed up code of practice</a>); and boost investment in regional digital infrastructure and skills.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce has undoubtedly seen a huge boost in growth in the last year and a half of Covid-19 living, with people turning to the web and apps to shop for essentials and not-so-essentials to keep their social distance, and using delivery services to receive their goods rather than picking things up in person.</p>
<p>Today, a Dutch startup called <a href="https://www.sendcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sendcloud</a> that has built a service to help retailers with the latter of these &#8212; providing a cloud-based to easily organize and carry out shipping services by choosing from a wide range of carriers and other options &#8212; is announcing $177 million in funding, a major investment that speaks not just to Sendcloud&#8217;s recent growth, but of the demand in the market for what it does: provide an efficient and viable alternative to simply turning to Amazon for fulfillment, or going through the manual and costly process of sorting out shipping directly with the companies that provide it.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We try to provide Amazon-level logistics to all the other merchants out there,&#8221; Rob van den Heuvel, Sendcloud&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, said in an interview. Pre-lock down, he said the company &#8212; which now has 23,000 customers &#8212; was seeing on average between 70% and 80% growth each year. During lockdown that went up to 120%, with 133% increases in parcel volumes, &#8220;And we have not seen volumes going down since,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Softbank Vision Fund 2 &#8212; a prolific investor in the many parts of the e-commerce ecosystem &#8212; is leading this Series C, with <i>L</i> Catterton and HPE Growth also participating. This by far the biggest investment Sendcloud has ever had: the Eindhoven, Netherlands-based startup has been around since 2012 and before now had raised just over $23 million ($23 million, 23,000 customers has a nice ring to it.)</p>
<p>Van den Heuvel confirmed that the startup is not disclosing its valuation with this round although a source very close to the deal tells us it&#8217;s around $750 million.</p>
<p>As a point of reference, Shippo &#8212; a U.S. company operating in a similar space but with 100,000 customers to Sendcloud&#8217;s 23,000 &#8212; in June raised money at a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2021/shippo-hits-unicorn-status-with-50m-venture-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 billion valuation</a>.Â Shippo has, however, also raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/shippo-raises-45m-more-at-495m-valuation-as-ecommerce-booms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly more money</a> and will have had its valuation ratcheting up as a result of that, too. On Sendcloud&#8217;s side, our source pointed out that it&#8217;s demonstrated a very strong amount of capital efficiency in its growth.</p>
<p>The gap in the market that Sendcloud (and would-be rivals like Shippo and Stamps.com) is addressing is a very clear one. E-commerce is now a major channel for retailers of all sizes, and as the market continues to mature, customers buying online or in-person but still getting their goods delivered are getting more sophisticated in terms of what they expect in service levels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The issue is that smaller retailers &#8212; realistically, anyone that is not Amazon, but especially those new to the e-commerce arena &#8212; typically don&#8217;t have systems in place to manage that delivery process in an efficient way. The very smallest, Van den Heuvel said, physically go to post offices to mail packages; and the bigger ones may order pick-up and shipping directly from specific carriers but find it costly to scale up from there, and to do so in a flexible way that ensures that they are getting the best prices and the best levels of service and the most options in terms of timings.</p>
<p>Amazon has in many ways set the bar for how shipping and delivery work, and in terms of what customers expect. It makes it easy for customers to expect and get fast and free shipping by way of its Prime membership club. It has a vast network of operations for itself and third parties it works with, and is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55560414#:~:text=Amazon%20has%20bought%20its%20first,customer%20base%22%2C%20it%20said.&amp;text=Experts%20say%20buying%20its%20own,a%20credible%20competitor%20in%20logistics." target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly directly controlling</a> the <a href="https://freightpartner.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different parts of that machine</a>.Â  And, critically, it already provides shipping as a service, plus a wider range of warehousing and other options &#8212; wrapped up in the company&#8217;s Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) product.</p>
<p>Sendcloud essentially is an aggregator and integrator that brings together the longer tail of e-commerce technology providers used by retailers &#8212; it has over 50 integrations with the likes of Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, Amazon and so on &#8212; with the range of companies that carry out shipping and delivery services &#8212; the DHL, UPS, FedEx, DPD and so on, more than 35 in all currently (and growing). It&#8217;s a very fragmented market on both ends of that, and so this is about bringing that together in a seamless way so that retailers can just search for and pick services that work for their needs. And this is all automated and integrated into their check-out: picking shippers and organising it ceases to be a manual effort.</p>
<p>It provides its tools in <a href="https://www.sendcloud.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freemium tiers</a>: a no-cost &#8220;essentials&#8221; for the smallest users, with the next tier at â¬40 per month, then â¬89 and â¬179 per month depending on the size of business.</p>
<p>Sendcloud sits in the same category as startups that have been addressing the physical aspect of e-commerce in other areas like freight forwarding and warehousing, by building cloud-based platforms to knit the many providers of those services together in a way that hadn&#8217;t been digitized previously. Doing so in the area of shipping and delivery, an area that is only getting more ubiquitous and expected by consumers, represents a massive opportunity: the delivery market is expected to grow from $475 billion today to $591 billion in 2024, the company estimates. It may be a pain point that that the average consumer never has to deal with on an organizational level as much as retailers do, but as e-commerce continues to grow, so too will the need for this to work correctly, to keep consumers happy.</p>
<p class="p1">âGrowing parcel volume and demand for flexible delivery have increased the need for smart shipping solutions amongst online merchants,â said Yanni Pipilis, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. âSendcloud has built a leading all-in-one shipping platform that aims to help merchants easily integrate functionalities such as checkout, shipping, tracking, returns, and analytics. We are pleased to partner with Rob and the Sendcloud team to support their mission of fueling the next wave of e-commerce enablement.â<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â </span></p>
<p class="p1">âSendcloudâs scalable, intuitive, and highly localized platform is at the forefront of enabling sophisticated shipping for online merchants across Europe,â added Christopher North, managing partner at <i>L</i> Catterton. âWe are excited to partner with the exceptional Sendcloud team to leverage our consumer-focused e-commerce experience and deep expertise working with high-growth technology and software businesses to drive continued innovation and position the Company for growth globally.â<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â </span></p>
<p class="p1">Sendcloud said that SoftBank Investment Advisors&#8217; Neil Cunha-Gomes and Monika Wilk, and <i>L</i> Cattertonâs Ido Krakowsky, are all joining its board.</p>
