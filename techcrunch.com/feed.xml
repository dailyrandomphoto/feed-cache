										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With most of us locked into a square video box on platforms like Zoom, the desire to break away and perhaps wander around a virtual space is strong. These new ways of presenting people – as small circles of videos placed in a virtual space where they can move around – has appeared in various forms, like ‘virtual bars’ for the last few months during global pandemic lockdowns. Hey, I even went to a few virtual bars myself! Although the drinks from my fridge could have been better&#8230;</p>
<p>The advantage of this spatial approach is it gives a lot more ‘agency’ to the user. You feel, at least, a <em>bit</em> more in control, as you can make a &#8216;physical&#8217; choice as to where you go, even if it is only still a virtual experience.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://spatial.chat/">SpatialChat</a>, one of the first startups with that approach which launched on ProductHunt in April last year, is upping the game with a new design and the feature of persistent chats. The product debuted on ProductHunt on April 20, 2020, and rose to No. 3 app of the day. The web-based platform has been bootstrapped the founders with their own resources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SpatialChat now adding a special tier and features for teams running town hall meetings and virtual offices, and says it now has more than 3,000 organizations as paying customers, with more than 200,000 total monthly active users.</p>
<p>The startup is part of a virtual networking space being populating by products such as<br />
<a href="https://www.teamflowhq.com">Teamflow</a>, <a href="https://gather.town">Gather</a>, and <a href="https://remo.co">Remo</a>. Although it began as a online networking events service, its now trying to re-position as a forum for multi-group discussions, all the way up from simple stand-up meetings to online conferences.</p>
<p>SpatialChat uses a mix of ‘proximity’ video chats, screen sharing, and rooms for up to 50 people. It’s now putting in pricing plans for regular, weekly, and one-time use cases. It says it’s seen employees at Sony, Panasonic, Sega, LinkedIn, Salesforce, and McKinsey, as well as educators and staff at 108 American universities, including Harvard, Stanford, Yale, and MIT, use the platform.</p>
<p>Almas Abulkhairov, CEO and Co-founder of SpatialChat says: “Slack, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams represent a virtual office for many teams but most of our customers say these apps aren’t a good fit for that. They don’t provide the same serendipity of thought you get working shoulder to shoulder and “Zoom fatigue” became a term for a reason. We want to bring the best from offline work.”</p>
<p>Konstantin Krasov, CPO at DataSouls, who used the platform, said: “We had 2500 people in attendance during a 2-day event that we hosted for our community of 50,000 Data Scientists. SpatialChat enabled us to make a cool networking event, Q/A and AMA with thought leaders in data science.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coursera, an online education platform that has seen its business grow amid the coronavirus pandemic, is planning to file paperwork tomorrow for its initial public offering, sources familiar with the matter say. The company has been talking to underwriters since last year, but tomorrow could mark its first legal step in the process to IPO.</p>
<p>The Mountain View-based business, founded in 2012, was last valued at $2.4 billion in the private markets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/edtech-startups-flirt-with-unicorn-style-growth/">during a Series F fundraising event in July 2020.</a> Bloomberg pegs Coursera’s latest valuation<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-04/online-education-firm-coursera-is-said-to-weigh-2021-ipo#:~:text=Coursera%20Inc.%20is%20considering%20an,people%20familiar%20with%20the%20matter.&amp;text=Get%20insights%20from%20reporters%20around%20the%20world%20in%20the%20Fully%20Charged%20newsletter."> at $5 billion. </a></p>
<p>The latest financing event brought its cash balance to $300 million, right around the money that Chegg had before it went public. Coursera CEO Jeff Maggioncalda did confirm then that the company is eyeing an eventual IPO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Coursera has had a busy pandemic. Similar to Udemy, another massive open online course provider planning to go public, Coursera added an enterprise arm to its business. It launched Coursera for Campus to help colleges bring on online courses (credit optional) with built-in exams; more than 3,700 schools across the world are using the software. It is unclear how much money this operation has brought in, but we know that Udemy for Business is nearing $200 million in annual recurring revenue. In February, the company announced that it has received B Corp. certification, which means that it hits high standards for social and environmental performance. It also converted to a public benefit corporation.</p>
<p>GSV, a venture capital firm that exclusively backs edtech companies, had its largest position of its first fund in Coursera. GSV announced a $180 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/gsv-ventures-doubles-assets-managed-with-new-fund-focused-on-global-edtech/">million Fund II yesterday. </a></p>
<p>It makes sense that edtech companies want to go public while the markets remain hot and remote education continues to be a central way that instruction is delivered. Other companies from the sector that have gone public in recent weeks include Nerdy and Skillshare, two companies that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/nerdy-varsity-tutors-spac/?tpcc=ECTW2020"> used a SPAC</a> to make their public debuts. Once &#8211; and if &#8211; Coursera does go public, it will join these newbies as well as the long-time edtech public companies including 2U, Chegg, and K12 Inc, and Zovio Solutions.</p>
<p>Coursera declined to comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When I first wrote about <a href="https://www.whatnot.com">Whatnot</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/whatnot-wants-to-be-the-goat-of-collectible-toys-starting-with-funko-pop-figurines/">February of last year</a>, they were just getting started. Aiming to be the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/goat/">GOAT</a> of collectible toys, they were focusing first on being the go-to trusted spot for buying and selling authenticated Funko Pop figurines.</p>
<p>A few months later, as they expanded into categories like pins and Pokémon cards, the company started to build out a live shopping platform — think of something along the lines of a TV shopping network, but swap out the studios and camera crews for folks at home with iPhones selling to an audience of fellow collectors. The concept had already proven popular in China, and was starting to gain traction amongst buyers of collectibles in the US&#8230; but a good chunk of those US live streams were happening on Instagram Live, which isn&#8217;t really built for things like bidding or handling payments after a sale occurs. Whatnot saw a gap in the market, and wanted to fill it.</p>
<p>It seems that move is working out well for the team. At the end of 2020, Whatnot raised a $4M seed round; just a few months later, building on the momentum of its live shopping platform and looking to expand into many more categories of collectibles, it has raised another $20M.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company tells me that this Series A round was led by Connie Chan of Andreessen Horowitz, and backed by YC, Wonder Ventures, Operator Partners, Scribble Ventures, Steve Aoki, and Chris Zarou.</p>
<p>Whatnot continues to offer a more traditional, non-livestreamed selling platform — but co-founder Grant Lafontaine tells me about &#8220;95%&#8221; of the team&#8217;s focus is on the livestream side of things.</p>
<p>&#8220;People really come to us for the live, but then they&#8217;re like &#8216;Eh, I don&#8217;t want to sell across 10 different platforms&#8217; so we give them the tools to be a one-stop shop,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>As I wrote back in December, one increasingly popular type of livestream on Whatnot is the &#8220;card break&#8221;, wherein:</p>
<blockquote><p>Users pool their money to buy an entire box of trading card packs — often boxes that are no longer being produced and can cost thousands of dollars to obtain. Each user gets a number, each number tied to a pack (or packs) within the box. Each pack is opened on the livestream, its contents sent to the (hopefully?) lucky owner tied to that pack’s number.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why raise more money? Lafontaine tells me it&#8217;s to help them expand into more categories, fast. The company currently focuses primarily on Pokémon cards, Funko Pops, FigPins, and sports cards, but they mention things like comic books, video games, and vintage hardware as natural fits. Diving into a new category means building up a community for it, convincing trusted sellers to hop on their platform and marketing to the right buyers to make it worthwhile. In time, Lafontaine tells me, the team expects to cover 100+ categories.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A lot of our communication these days with each other is digital, and today one of the companies enabling that &#8212; with APIs to build chat experiences into apps &#8212; is announcing a round of funding on the back of some very strong growth.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://getstream.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stream</a>, which lets developers build chat and activity streams into apps and other services by way of a few lines of code, has raised $38 million, funding that it will be using to continue building out its existing business as well as to work on new features.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stream started out with APIs for activity feeds, and then it expanded to chat, which today can be integrated into apps built on a variety of platforms. Currently, its customers integrate third-party chatbots and use Dolby for video and audio within Stream, but over time, these are all areas where Stream itself would like to do more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;End-to-end cryption, chatbots: we want to take as many components as we can,&#8221; said Thierry Schellenbach, the CEO who co-founded the startup with the startup&#8217;s CTO Tommaso Barbugli in Amsterdam in 2015 (the startup still has a substantial team in Amsterdam headed by Barbugli, but its headquarters is now in Boulder, Colorado, where Schellenbach eventually moved).</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2121181" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121181" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2121181" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="502" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg 1929w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=300,221 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=768,567 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=680,502 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=1536,1134 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121181" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://getstream.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stream <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">The company already has amassed a list of notable customers, including Ikea-owned TaskRabbit, NBC Sports, Unilever, Delivery Hero, Gojek, eToro and Stanford University, as well as a number of others that it&#8217;s not disclosing across healthcare, education, finance, virtual events, dating, gaming and social. Together, the apps Stream powers cover more than 1 billion users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This Series B round is being led by Felicis Ventures’ Aydin Senkut, with previous backers GGV Capital and 01 Advisors (the fund co-founded by Twitter’s former CEO and COO, Dick Costolo and Adam Bain) also participating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alongside them, a mix of previous and new individual and smaller investors also participated: Olivier Pomel, CEO of Datadog; Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub; Amsterdam-based Knight Capital; Johnny Boufarhat, founder and CEO of Hopin; and Selcuk Atli, co-founder and CEO of social gaming app Bunch (itself having raised a notable <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200917005244/en/Bunch-Closes-20-Million-Series-A-Financing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">round of $20 million led by General Catalyst</a> not long ago).</p>
<p dir="ltr">That list is a notable indicator of what kinds of startups are also quietly working with Stream.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is not disclosing its valuation but Schellenbach hints that it is &#8220;6x its chat revenues.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Indeed, the Series B speaks of a moment of opportunity: it is coming only about six months after the startup raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/stream-whose-apis-help-product-teams-build-chat-and-activity-feeds-fast-just-raised-a-15-million-series-a-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series A of $15 million</a>, and in fact Stream wasn&#8217;t looking to raise right now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We were not planning to raise funding until later this year but then Aydin reached out to us and made it hard to say no,&#8221; Schellenbach said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;More than anything else, they are building on the platforms in the tech that matters,&#8221; Senkut added in an interview, noting that its users were attesting to a strong return on investment. &#8220;It&#8217;s rare to see a product so critical to customers and scaling well. It&#8217;s just uncapped capability&#8230; and we want to be a part of the story.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">That moment of opportunity is not one that Stream is pursuing on its own.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some of the more significant of the many players in the world of API-based communications services like messaging, activity streams &#8212; those consolidated updates you get in apps that tell you when people have responded to a post of yours or new content has landed that is relevant to you, or that you have a message, and so on &#8212; and chat include SendBird, Agora, PubNub, Twilio and Sinch, all of which have variously raised substantial funding, found a lot of traction with customers, or are positioning themselves as consolidators.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That may speak of competition, but it also points to the vast market there for the tapping.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Indeed, one of the reasons companies like Stream are doing so well right now is because of what they have built and the market demand for it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Communications services like Stream&#8217;s might be best compared to what companies like Adyen (another major tech force out of Amsterdam), Stripe, Rapyd, Mambu and others are doing in the world of fintech.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As with something like payments, the mechanics of building, for example, chat functionality can be complex, usually requiring the knitting together of an array of services and platforms that do not naturally speak to each other.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the same time, something like an activity feed or a messaging feature is central to how a lot of apps work, even if they are not the core feature of the product itself. One good example of how that works are food ordering and delivery apps: they are not by their nature &#8220;chat apps&#8221; but they need to have a chat option in them for when you do need to communicate with a driver or a restaurant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Putting those forces together, it&#8217;s pretty logical that we&#8217;d see the emergence of a range of tech companies that both have done the hard work of building the mechanics of, say, a chat service, and making that accessible by way of an API to those who want to use it, with APIs being one of the more central and standard building blocks in apps today; and a surge of developers keen to get their hands on those APIs to build that functionality into their apps.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What Stream is working on is not to be confused with the customer-service focused services that companies like Zendesk or Intercom are building when they talk about chat for apps. Those can be specialized features in themselves that link in with CRM systems and customer services teams and other products for marketing analytics and so on. Instead, Stream&#8217;s focus are services for consumers to talk to other consumers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What is a trend worth watching is whether easy-to-integrate services like Stream&#8217;s might signal the proliferation of more social apps over time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is already at least one key customer &#8212; which I am now allowed to name &#8212; that is a steadily growing, still young social app, which has built the core of its service on Stream&#8217;s API.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With just a handful of companies &#8212; led by Facebook, but also including ByteDance/TikTok, Tencent, Twitter, Snap, Google (via YouTube) and some others depending on the region &#8212; holding an outsized grip on social interactions, easier, platform-agnostic access to core communications tools like chat could potentially help more of these, with different takes on &#8220;social&#8221; business models, find their way into the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<span class="il">Stream</span>’s technology addresses a common problem in product development by offering an easy-to-integrate and scalable messaging solution,” said Dick Costolo of 01 Advisors, and the former Twitter CEO, in a statement. “Beyond that, their team and clear vision set them apart, and we ardently back their mission.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://hepster.com/">Hepster</a>, an insurtech platform from Germany, has raised $10 million in a Series A funding led by Element Ventures. Also participating was Seventure Partners, MBMV, and GPS Ventures, as well as previous investors. The funds will be used to broaden the Hepster insurance ecosystem and scale up its network, with an emphasis on automation.</p>
<p>The German insurance market is famously slow at adopting new practices, and Hepster is part of a new wave of insurtech startups in the country taking advantage of this. It allows businesses to build insurance policies from scratch, matched specifically to the needs of their individual service or industry. E-commerce players, for instance, can then embed these insurance products into the e-commerce journey.</p>
<p>Its products are therefore better suited to the new sector of, for example, shared e-bike schemes and peer-to-peer rental platforms, which are rarely covered by traditional brokers in Germany. However, it also caters to traditional, established industries as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It now has more than 700 partners, including European bike retailers and rental companies Greenstorm Mobility and Baron Mobility, as well as Berlin-based cargo bike provider Citkar and Munich e-bike startup SUSHI.</p>
<p>Christian Range, Hepster co-founder and CEO, said in a statement: “Hepster is now a key player within the European insurance market. Our state-of-the-art technology with our API-driven ecosystem, as well as our highly service-oriented approach, sets us apart.”</p>
<p>In interview, he told me: “Germany is the toughest market with the most regulations, the most laws. We have a saying in Germany if you can make it in Germany, you can make it everywhere. Also, it&#8217;s a big market in terms of selling insurance products because Germans really like insurance in every regard. So there is huge market potential in Germany I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michael McFadgen, partner at Element Ventures, said: “As new industries and business models emerge, companies need much more flexible insurance propositions than what is currently being offered by traditional brokers. Hepster is the breakout company in the space, and their focus on embedded insurance will pay dividends in years to come.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/speeding-up-release-cycle.html">announced</a> that its Chrome browser is moving to a faster release cycle by shipping a new milestone every four weeks instead of the current six-week cycle (with a bi-weekly security patch). That&#8217;s one way to hasten the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">singularity</a>, I guess, but it&#8217;s worth noting that Mozilla also moved to a four-week cycle for Firefox <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/09/moving-firefox-to-a-faster-4-week-release-cycle/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we have improved our testing and release processes for Chrome, and deployed bi-weekly security updates to improve our <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/security-dev/c/fbiuFbW07vI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch gap</a>, it became clear that we could shorten our release cycle and deliver new features more quickly,&#8221; the Chrome team explains in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>Google, however, also acknowledges that not everybody wants to move this quickly &#8212; especially in the enterprise. For those users, Google is adding a new Extended Stable option with updates that come every eight weeks. This feature will be available to enterprise admins and Chromium embedders. They will still get security updates on a bi-weekly schedule, but Google notes that &#8220;those updates won’t contain new features or all security fixes that the 4 week option will receive.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new four-week cycle will start with Chrome 94 in Q3 2021, and at this faster rate, we&#8217;ll see Chrome 100 launch into the stable channel by March 29, 2022. I expect there will be <a href="https://youtu.be/6ug6Bbc6diA?t=166">cake</a>.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been thinking about creators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am one: I put out an e-book on Gumroad about cold emailing. That is actually the low point of creativity in my whole life, considering I think I have it in me to be a scriptwriter, a stand-up artist or at least a mediocre YouTuber. I created a piece of art about spamming. What a fall!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are successful creators, unlike me. But what makes them succeed, and how should brands work with them? Let’s get the definitions in place first.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creators create and hence have an influence over their fans. Influencers exist. That’s the working definition we’ll go with.</span></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Where brands go astray is when they expect creators to obtain products for their brands in the way that influencers do.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands work with influencers all the time. It doesn’t take a special skill to have a rotund posterior on which a wine glass can be balanced. Most of us don’t try such things. Yet some do, post it on Instagram and build multibillion-dollar fashion brands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s art if an influencer does it. You and I have no business here, but brands embrace such influencers. Influencers monetize eyeballs directly (through brand partnerships) or through platform ad revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creators are morally superior — they earnestly create good, mediocre or bad content/art/internet moments through their good, bad or mediocre skills. That builds a niche fan following. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They monetize through ads, brand partnerships or subscriptions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where brands go astray is when they expect creators to obtain products for their brands in the way that influencers do. Influencers influence. Creators endear themselves to their audience. Creators evolve and their audience base evolves along with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a framework for how brands can think about creator relationships and how to set goals for such relationships.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s call it FFS (Fan Follower Strength <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f926-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🤦‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) Framework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fans of a creator manifest their liking for the creator in one of these ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appreciate</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocate</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adulate</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the scale of the audience base and their fan following strength, creators&#8217; alternative revenue streams could be anywhere between that of a guy who does the opening act at an obscure club&#8217;s stand-up night to that of a cult founder.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120963" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120963" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2120963" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png" alt="fan following strength the fan following framework" width="750" height="520" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120963" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ashwin Ramasamy</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much influence a creator has depends on the distribution of fans they have in these stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more adulation they get, the more they are ready to carry a brand or monetize on their own. While the number of fans decides the scale of an outcome (exposure, sales, etc.), at any scale a creator can monetize if they have more fans in the advocate or adulate stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A brand has to choose its creators both on the scale and the goals they have for the relationship.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="t4argOdQsk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/ribs-the-messaging-framework-for-every-company-and-product/">RIBS: The messaging framework for every company and product</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;RIBS: The messaging framework for every company and product&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/ribs-the-messaging-framework-for-every-company-and-product/embed/#?secret=t4argOdQsk" data-secret="t4argOdQsk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A creator with millions of merely appreciative followers could be good for brand exposure but not immediate sales, whereas a niche creator who receives great adulation from their audience could not just move products but move their audience to visit your store to buy a product they promote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such creators &#8212; if they are able to maintain a high proportion of advocates and adulatory followers as they hit scale &#8212; could launch their own brands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship becomes troublesome when brands simply look at influencer marketing metrics (engagement, clicks, etc.) and ignore the FFS metrics (intensity of fan following as measured from comments, organic shares and engagement for those shares; the shelf life of the content measured by the longevity of comment interaction; fanfic creations around the creator’s content or about the creator, etc.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the understanding of FFS metrics, brands end up partnering with creators at a life stage that could be incompatible with brand goals. A creator with a huge following does not automatically translate to sales if their fan following strength is skewed more toward appreciation than advocacy or adulation.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/tiktoks-new-qa-feature-lets-creators-respond-to-fan-questions-using-text-or-video/">was spotted testing</a> a new Q&amp;A feature that would allow creators to more directly respond to their audience&#8217;s questions using either text or video. Today, the company has <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-q-and-a">announced</a> the feature is now available to all users globally. With the release of TikTok Q&amp;A, as the feature is officially called, creators will be able to designate their comments as Q&amp;A questions, respond to questions with either text comments or video replies, and add a Q&amp;A profile link to their bios, among other things. The feature also works with live videos.</p>
<p>TikTok Q&amp;A grew out of a way that creators were already using the video platform to interact with viewers. Often, after posting a video, viewers would have follow-up questions about the content. Creators would then either respond to those questions in the comments section or, if the response was more involved, they might post a second video instead.</p>
<p>The Q&amp;A feature essentially formalizes this process by making it easier for creators &#8212; particularly those with a lot of fans &#8212; to identify and answer the most interesting questions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>To use Q&amp;A, viewers will first designate their comment as a Q&amp;A question using a new commenting option. To do so, they&#8217;ll tap the Q&amp;A icon to the right side of the text entry field in comments. This will also label their comment with the icon and text that says &#8220;Asked by&#8221; followed by the username of the person asking the question. This makes it easier for creators to see when scanning through a long list of comments on their video.</p>
<p>The feature will also feed the question into the creator&#8217;s new Q&amp;A page where all questions and answers are aggregated. Users can browse this page to see all the earlier questions and answers that have already been posted or add a new question of their own.</p>
<p>Creators will respond to a Q&amp;A question with either text or video replies, just as they did before &#8212; so there isn&#8217;t much new to learn here, in terms of process.</p>
<p>They can also add Q&amp;A comments as stickers in their responses where the new video will link back to the original, where the question was first asked, similar to how they&#8217;re using comment stickers today.</p>
<p>The feature will also be available in TikTok LIVE, making it easier for creators to see the incoming questions in the stream&#8217;s chat from a separate panel.</p>

<p>As a part of this launch, a Q&amp;A profile link can be added to creators&#8217; Profile bios, which directs users to the Q&amp;A page where everything is organized.</p>
<p>During tests, the feature was only made available to creators with public accounts that had more than 10,000 followers and who opted in. Today, TikTok says its available to all users with Creator Accounts.</p>
<p>To enable the feature on your own profile, you&#8217;ll go to the privacy page under Settings, then select &#8220;Creator,&#8221; tap &#8220;Q&amp;A&#8221; and then &#8220;Turn on Q&amp;A.&#8221; (If users don&#8217;t already have a Creator account, they can enable it for themselves under settings.)</p>
<p>The feature is rolling out to users worldwide in the latest version of the TikTok app now, the company says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year ago, Microsoft announced that its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">Edge browser</a> would get vertical tabs and here we are: Microsoft today <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/customer-insights-research/articles/giving-users-an-edge-whats-new-with-microsofts-latest-browser-2/">announced</a> that vertical tabs in Edge are now generally available.</p>
<p>In addition, the Edge team also announced a few under-the-hood changes that will allow the browser to startup significantly faster (up to 41% faster according to Microsoft&#8217;s preliminary tests, to be precise). Since Microsoft can&#8217;t speed up your hard drive or significantly shrink Edge, though, the way the team achieves this is by loading the browser in the background when you sign in and then it&#8217;ll continue running when you close all browser windows. If that&#8217;s not to your liking, you can always turn this feature off, too.</p>
<p>While vertical tabs are available for you to play with now, though, the startup improvements will roll out over the course of this month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2121119" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121119" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2121119" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png" alt="" width="1024" height="651" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png 2253w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=768,488 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=680,432 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=1536,976 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=2048,1302 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2121119" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Vertical tabs, of course, are nothing new. Other browsers have long supported them, either as a built-in feature or through extensions. But it&#8217;s nice to see them finally becoming a reality in Edge, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most websites follow a conventional grid that leaves plenty of whitespace on either end of the page,&#8221; Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcdanelmichele/">Michele McDanel</a> writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;As we began working with our users, we realized that this vertical real estate could be a better location for tabs, rather than the traditional horizontal list of tabs at the top. While vertical tabs may not be an entirely new concept, we saw an opportunity to improve the browser experience and tested several prototypes with our users.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121090" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/W10_20H2_Laptop_Edge_Vertical-Tabs_16x9_en-US.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121090" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2121090" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/W10_20H2_Laptop_Edge_Vertical-Tabs_16x9_en-US.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2121090" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>In its research, Microsoft discovered that users who like vertical tabs also like to switch between them and standard horizontal tabs, so it added an always-visible toggle to do so. And since users sometimes want to reclaim all of their screen estate, the team added the ability to collapse the sidebar, too.</p>
<p>For those of you who use Bing, Microsoft is also adding a few nifty new features to its search engine. There&#8217;s a new <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=fish+tacos+recipes&amp;form=MO12I1&amp;OCID=MO12I1">recipe view</a> for when you&#8217;re once again out of ideas for what to make for dinner, improved visual search results, and the company has spruced up some of its rich sidebar snippets with a more <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=kenya&amp;form=MO12I6&amp;OCID=MO12I6">infographic-like feel</a>. But let&#8217;s face it: <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share">you&#8217;re not using Bing</a>. If perchance you do, you can find more details about the udpates <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/03/04/amp-up-your-performance-with-startup-boost-and-find-information-blazingly-fast-with-microsoft-edge-and-bing/">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Healthcare is one of the most complex industries out there, creating frustration on the consumer side but also the opportunity for huge improvements from, in a way, rather simple methods. <a href="https://www.halodx.com/">Halo Diagnostics</a> (or Dx for short) has raised a $19M series A to improve diagnosis of several serious illnesses by crossing the streams from multiple tests and making the improved process easily available to providers. They&#8217;ve also taken the unusual step of taking out an eight-figure line of credit to buy outright the medical facilities they&#8217;ll need to do it.</p>
<p>As anyone who&#8217;s had to deal with major health concerns can attest, the care you get differs widely from one provider to another depending on many factors, not least of which are what your insurance covers and what methods are already in use by the provider.</p>
<p>For men going in to get a prostate cancer screening, for instance, the common bloodwork and rectal exam haven&#8217;t changed in years, and really aren&#8217;t that great at predicting problems, leading to uncertainty and unnecessary procedures like biopsies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, if you&#8217;re lucky, your provider might offer multiparametric MRIs, which are much better at finding problems —and if you combine that MRI with a urine test that checks for genetic markers, the detection accuracy rises to practically foolproof levels.</p>
<p>But these tests are more expensive, take special facilities and personnel, and may otherwise not fit into the provider&#8217;s existing infrastructure. Halo aims to provide that infrastructure by revamping the medical data stream to allow for this kind of multi-factor diagnosis.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Combining machine learning tools for medical imaging with genetic sequencing nets Sophia Genetics $110M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/combining-machine-learning-tools-for-medical-imaging-with-genetic-sequencing-nets-sophia-genetics-110m/embed/#?secret=Lmc8fLGXa8" data-secret="Lmc8fLGXa8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Basically doctors and imaging centers aren&#8217;t offering latest level of care. If you&#8217;re lucky you might get it, but in community medicine you&#8217;re not going to,&#8221; said Brian Axe, co-founder and chief product officer at Halo Dx. &#8220;As perverse as it sounds, what the healthcare industry needs to adopt the latest medical advancements is better financial alignment in addition to better outcomes. The challenge is the integrated diagnostic solution — how do you get these orders, go to market and talk with primary care providers?&#8221;</p>
<p>An added obstacle is that multi-modal testing isn&#8217;t really the kind of thing medical imaging or testing providers just decide to get into. An imaging center isn&#8217;t going to hear that a urine test improves reliability and think &#8220;well let&#8217;s buy the building next door and start doing that too!&#8221; It&#8217;s costly and complex to build out testing facilities, and getting the expertise to run them and combine the results is another hurdle.</p>
<p>So Halo Dx is parachuting in with tens of millions of dollars and purchasing the imaging and testing centers themselves (four so far), taking over their operations and combining them with other tests.</p>
<p>Assuming that much liability as a young company may seem like folly, but it helps that these imaging centers are strong businesses already — not derelict, half-paid-off MRI machines being operated at a loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;The imaging orders are coming in already; the centers are profitable. They&#8217;re coming on board because they see how technology is coming to disrupt them, and they want to help drive the change,&#8221; said Axe.</p>
<p>Prostate and breast cancers are the first target, but more and better data produce similarly improved diagnosis and treatment planning for more conditions, potentially (these are still being proven out) Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson&#8217;s, and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>With one company running multiple intake, imaging, and testing facilities and integrating the results, it&#8217;s much more likely that providers will sign up. And Halo Dx is trying to bring some of the enterprise-grade software expertise to bear on the historically neglected field of medical data storage and communication.</p>
<p>Axe deferred to the company&#8217;s chief medical officer, Dr John Feller, on the perils of that aspect of the field.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr Feller describes this so well: &#8216;I have this state of the art MRI machine that can see inside your body, but because of the fragmented solutions that are out there, from intake to the storage centers, I feel like I&#8217;m living with pre-dot-com era tech and it&#8217;s crippling,&#8217; &#8221; Axe recalled. &#8220;If you want to look at records or recommend additional tests, software vendors don&#8217;t talk to each other or integrate. You have three providers that need to talk to each other and there&#8217;s a dozen systems between them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Axe compared the company&#8217;s approach here to One Medical&#8217;s — increasing efficiency and using that to make the relationship with the consumer lighter and easier, leading to more interactions.</p>
<p>In some ways it seems like a risky move, taking on nearly a hundred million in obligations and jumping into a hugely complex and highly regulated space. But the team is accomplished, the backers are notable, the potential for growth is there, and the success of the likes of One Medical have likely emboldened all involved.</p>
<p>Zola Global Investors led the round, and a who&#8217;s-who in medical and tech participated: Anne Wojcicki, Fred Moll, Stephen Pomeranz, Bob Reed, Robert Ciardi, Jim Pallotta, and believe it or not Ronnie Lott of 49ers fame.</p>
<p>These and others involved make for a strong statement of confidence in both the model and the specific approach Halo Dx is taking to expanding and advancing care. Here&#8217;s hoping, however, that you won&#8217;t have to make use of their services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re a startup that&#8217;s worried about building your team today for tomorrow&#8217;s successes you&#8217;re not going to want to miss our session with Bain Capital Ventures&#8217; Sarah Smith at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=quorapost">TechCrunch Early Stage on April 1 &amp; 2</a>.</p>
<p>The current Bain Capital Ventures partner who invests in early to mid-stage companies saw what it was like to grow a startup business firsthand as the vice president of human resources at Quora, a position she held from 2012 to 2016.</p>
<p>While at Quora, Sarah built the HR and operations teams responsible for company culture, compensation, benefits, equity refreshers, performance reviews, HRIS/ATS implementation, people development, policy enforcement and content moderation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has clarified that the iOS 14.5 beta is not actually allowing users to select a new default music service, as has been reported. Following the beta&#8217;s release back in February, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/ldzar3/siri_asking_which_music_service_to_use_afterwards/">number</a> of beta testers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/ios-14-5-beta-siri-default-music-service/">noticed</a> that Siri would now ask what music service they would like to use when they asked Siri to play music. But Apple doesn&#8217;t consider this feature the equivalent to &#8220;setting a default&#8221; &#8212; an option it more recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-will-let-users-pick-their-own-default-email-and-browser-apps/">began to allow</a> for email and browser apps.</p>
<p>Instead, the feature is Siri intelligence-based, meaning it can improve and even change over time as Siri learns to better understand your listening habits.</p>
<p>For example, if you tell Siri to play a song, album or artist, it may ask you which service you want to use to listen to this sort of content. However, your response to Siri is not making that particular service your &#8220;default,&#8221; Apple says. In fact, Siri may ask you again at some point &#8212; a request that could confuse users if they thought their preferences had already been set.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Apple also points out th<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ere&#8217;s no specific setting in iOS where users can configure a &#8220;default&#8221; music service, the way there is with email and browser apps. While many earlier reports did note this difference, they still referred to the feature as &#8220;setting a default,&#8221; which is technically incorrect. </span></p>
<p>More broadly, the feature is an attempt to help Siri to learn the listening apps you want to use for different types of audio content &#8212; not just music. Perhaps you want to use Spotify to listen to music, but prefer to keep up with your podcasts in Apple Podcasts or some other third-party podcasts app. And you may want to listen to audiobooks in yet another app.</p>
<p>When Siri asks you the which service you want to use for these sorts of audio requests, it will present a list of the audio apps you have installed for you to choose from.</p>

<p>In addition to Siri&#8217;s understanding of your habits &#8212; which are based on your responses and choices &#8212; app developers can optionally use APIs to provide Siri with access to more intelligence about what people listen to in their app and why. This could allow Siri to fulfill users&#8217; requests with more accuracy. And all this processing takes place on the device.</p>
<p>The audio choice feature, of course, doesn&#8217;t prevent users from requesting a particular service by name, even if it&#8217;s not their usual preference.</p>
<p>For instance, you can still say something like &#8220;play smooth jazz radio on Pandora&#8221; to launch that app instead. However, if you continued to request Pandora by name for music requests &#8212; even though you had initially specified Apple Music or Spotify or some other service when Siri had first prompted you &#8212; then the next time you asked Siri to play music without specifically a service, the assistant may ask you again to choose a service.</p>

<p>Although this may seem like a minor clarification, it has a greater importance given the increased regulatory scrutiny Apple is under these days over how its App Store and app ecosystem work. Spotify, in particular, has alleged that Apple is behaving in anti-competitive ways &#8212; for instance by requiring a commission on Spotify&#8217;s in-app purchases even though Apple runs a rival music service that Spotify claims has first-party advantages.</p>
<p>The audio choice feature <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-ios-14-5-beta-default-music-app-siri-152712457.html">had first</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/ios-14-5-beta-siri-default-music-service/">appeared</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272460/apple-ios-14-5-default-music-streaming-service-siri-spotify">in iOS 14.5 beta 1</a>, but had been pulled in beta 2. It has since returned with the release of beta 3, which again drew <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/02/apple-re-enables-the-option-to-change-default-music-player-for-siri-requests-with-ios-14-5-beta-3/">attention</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykarcz/2021/03/03/ios-145-public-beta-3-lets-you-choose-your-default-music-service/?sh=15a22c4b7d87">headlines</a> &#8212; as well as Apple&#8217;s response.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not technically allowing you to set a &#8220;default,&#8221; the Siri-powered feature could eventually feel like one for users with consistent listening behavior. The iPhone will simply become smarter about how to play what you want to hear, without necessarily forcing you to use Apple&#8217;s own apps if you don&#8217;t want to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://clearglass.com">ClearGlass Analytics</a> has closed a £2.6 million ($3.6M) funding round for its platform, which aims to create greater transparency on fees in the long-term savings market, such as pensions and the wider asset management market. </p>
<p>The £2.6m seed round includes European VC Lakestar and Outward VC, the venture arm of Investec, as well as several angels from both the asset management and pension fund worlds. These include Ruston Smith, a pension trustee; Richard Butcher, Chair of the PLSA (UK pension trade body); Chris Wilcox, former Global Head of JP Morgan Asset Management; and Rob O’Rahilly, Sikander Ilyas and Alex Large, also former JP Morgan employees.</p>
<p>ClearGlass is targeting the £1.5trillion mature &#8216;Defined Benefit&#8217; pension schemes market and claims to now work with over 500 DB pension funds. It will use the funding to expand into the UK Defined Contribution pension market, and consolidate its early footprint in Europe and Africa.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>How ClearGlass works is that it acts as a data interface between asset managers and their clients. Pension funds then use the platform to see all of their investment costs in one place, thus getting more data than usual from more asset managers and other suppliers. This helps the funds see the ‘true cost’ of what they are paying for the management of their investments. ClearGlass claims to be able to uncover the kinds of costs of asset management that, in some instances, can be more than double those expected.</p>
<p>The startup recently did an analysis of the cost and performance of over 400 asset managers. It found that while most UK asset managers were meeting minimum standards for data delivery, quality, and accuracy, 30 (including some powerful players) did not pass their tests.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Dr. Christopher Sier, a World Bank and FCA expert who previously developed the cost transparency standard at the request of the FCA, and co-founders Ritesh Singhania and Kunal Varma.</p>
<p>Sier, founder and CEO, said: “Finding your costs are so much larger is shocking, but also something to be celebrated. These incremental costs were always there, they just weren’t exposed, and now you can identify those and bring about change. You can’t manage what you don’t measure.”</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Ritesh Singhaniam, COO, said getting the data about pension funds is normally “super challenging and complicated. And second of all, even when you got the data, you couldn&#8217;t make head nor tail of it because you can&#8217;t compare it across funds. What we have done is that we have been the line of communication between the manager and the pension fund. So we have built a piece of technology that helps with the communication between the asset managers, and the pension funds to be able to collect that data, check that data. And finally, give them something that doesn&#8217;t require them to spend 20 hours to understand it.”</p>
<p>ClearGlass was incubated by the Founders Factory accelerator.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Colombian startup <a href="https://elenas.co">Elenas</a> says it&#8217;s helping tens of thousands of women make money by selling products online. And today, it announced that it has raised $6 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s on top of the <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/exclusive-elenas-lands-2m-seed-to-expand-commerce-platform-in-latin-america/">$2 million seed round</a> that Elenas announced last fall. Founder and CEO Zach Oschin said that demand continues to grow, particularly with high unemployment levels (<a href="https://www.bbvaresearch.com/en/publicaciones/colombia-effects-of-covid-19-on-september-employment/">particularly among women</a>), while consumers remain nervous about in-person shopping during the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been able to provide opportunities for tens of thousands of women to earn extra income,&#8221; Oschin said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He suggested that Elenas is essentially a reinvention of the direct sales/catalog sales model that 11 million women participate in across the Latin America. The idea is that independent seller/entrepreneurs (often but not always women) can browse a catalog of products in categories like beauty, personal care and electronics, from more than 250 distributors and brands, all available at a discounted wholesale price. They decide what they want to sell, how much they want to mark the price up and then promote the products on social channels like WhatsApp and Facebook.</p>

<p>Besides its digital focus, Oschin said said Elenas is better for the resellers because there&#8217;s less risk: &#8220;We don’t hold inventory for the company, which is very different than traditional direct sales, and our entrepreneurs don&#8217;t ever hold inventory.&#8221; Nor do those entrepreneurs need to get involved in things like payment collection or delivery, because Elenas and its distributor partners handle all of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us, the goal is to provide this backend operating system that gives women everything they need to run their store,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Elenas offers an automated on-boarding process for the sellers, but Oschin said that within the app, &#8220;we do a lot of work to train our sellers how to sell.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/elenas-at-startup-battlefield-latin-america-2018/">participated in our Latin American Startup Battlefield</a> in 2018) says it&#8217;s now paid out more than $7 million to its sellers. It doesn&#8217;t limit participation by gender, but Oschin estimated that more than 95% of sellers are women, with 80% of them under the age of 30 and about a third of them without any previous direct sales experience.</p>
<p>The new funding comes from Leo Capital, FJ Labs, Alpha4 Ventures and Meesho. Oschin said the company&#8217;s investors have a presence across six different continents, reflecting its international vision. Indeed, one of its next steps is expanding across Latin America, starting with Mexico and then Peru.</p>
<p>“Having seen the meteoric growth of social commerce in India and China we are excited to partner with Elenas as they have demonstrated the right product and operating model for the region.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>said Leo Capital co-founder Shwetank Verma in a statement. “The Elenas team has built a solution that&#8217;s inclusive, impactful and is well positioned for exponential growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Porsche is taking its electrification ambitions to two wheels.</p>
<p>The German automaker unveiled two electric bikes Thursday, alongside the global debut of the Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo, the latest variant to its EV flagship.</p>
<p>Both electric bikes are said to be inspired by the Taycan, Porsche&#8217;s first electric vehicle that kicked off its broader EV ambitions. While the underlying inspiration and foundation are the same — both have have full-suspension carbon frames — each bike has a slightly different purpose and customer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The bikes are a collective effort. They were developed in collaboration with e-bike expert Rotwild and use components from well-known bike parts manufacturers Shimano, Magura and <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Crankbrothers. Add high-design touches from Porsche — the spit and polish — and customers get a luxe e-bike priced between $8,500 and $10,700.</span></p>
<p>The Porsche eBikes, both of which are manufactured in Dieburg, Germany, will be available at Porsche dealers and select specialist bicycle outlets this spring, and will come in three frame sizes.</p>
<p>The Porsche eBike Sport is priced at $10,700, while the &#8220;cheaper&#8221; Porsche eBike Cross costs $8,549.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120944" style="width: 3850px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120944" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2120944 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg" alt="Porsche eBike CROSS_side-view-left" width="3840" height="2560" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2120944" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Porsche</p></div></p>
<p>The Porsche eBike Sport is designed as a daily rider. The bike is equipped with a new Shimano EP8 motor, which provides motor support up to 25 km/h (about 15 mph), a Shimano electronic gear shifting system and Magura high-performance brakes that are integrated into the handlebars. The Sport bike also has M99 LED lights from Supernova, which are embedded in the handlebar stem and aerodynamic seat post.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In addition, high-quality suspension components such as the Magura upside-down suspension fork and the Fox rear shock absorber, in combination with smooth-running tires, provide a sporty and balanced ride on asphalt or gentle terrain.</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Porsche eBike Cross is aimed at riders who might be seeking rougher roads. The Cross has a new motor developed by Shimano,<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Magura-MT Trail high-performance brakes with extra-large, heat-resistant brake discs for</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> deceleration and a mechanical Shimano XT 12-fold shifting system for quick gear changes. The seat post is hydraulically adjustable from Crankbrothers</span>. The handlebars also have a Shimano color display, which shows not only speed but also distance and range in real time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 25th of January, Techstars Seattle <a href="https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/2021-techstars-seattle-accelerator-companies">announced its 12th class</a>, featuring 10 startups from different parts of the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accelerator, which has accepted only a handful of African startups, included one from Zimbabwe in this class</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://afriblocks.com/">AfriBlocks</a> is a global pan-African marketplace of vetted African freelance professionals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://zw.linkedin.com/in/tongayi-choto"> Tongayi Choto</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogerroman">Roger Roman</a> in July 2020 and has offices in Harare and Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is trying to address the high unemployment rate that plagues many African countries by making it easier for people to find work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a number of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> international and local freelance websites exist to meet these needs. Still, according to CEO Choto, most of them offer too many options with no adequate vetting process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It can be very hard to find African freelancers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a customer is lucky enough to get past those hurdles and find a freelancer to work with, they often don&#8217;t have the proper collaboration tools to complete the project in a precise and timely manner,&#8221; he told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a global freelance market worth more than $800 billion, AfriBlocks says it is doing this different by equipping African freelancers with intuitive collaboration tools and a secure payment system that makes it easy to get remote contract projects completed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a job </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is posted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on its platform, the company claims that they save the customer the trouble of perusing thousands of freelancers profiles and portfolios</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, they use automation tools to match three freelancers who fit the user&#8217;s qualifications</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, AfriBlocks assigns to the selected freelancer a project manager who manages the project through completion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the job is complete, AfriBlocks collects a transaction fee, and the payment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is released</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from escrow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ensures that expectations are clear and deadlines </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are met</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for freelancers and customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Choto says the company offers community and development resources that help them upskill and remain competitive in the global marketplace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in partnership with edtech company Coursera and African nonprofit Ingressive for Good</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also in talks with online learning platform Datacamp to do the same for data scientists</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121003" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121003" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2121003" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RogerRomanOffice.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RogerRomanOffice.jpeg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RogerRomanOffice.jpeg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RogerRomanOffice.jpeg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RogerRomanOffice.jpeg?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RogerRomanOffice.jpeg?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RogerRomanOffice.jpeg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121003" class="wp-caption-text">Roger Roman (co-founder). Image Cedits: AfriBlocks</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As peculiar to most African startups, funding has been hard to come by for the team. Bootstrapping seemed like the only course of action to take, and it seems to have taken them far. In less than a year, the company has onboarded more than 2,000 freelancers and more than 400 buyers. It has also completed up to 250 jobs generating over $60,000 in revenue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This progress has attracted the likes of Techstars and Google to provide them with funding and networking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve encountered the problems that many Black founders face, such as scarce fundraising sources</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, organizations like Techstars Seattle, Transparent Collective and Google for Startups have helped us by providing mentorship, networking opportunities and investor demo days showcases,&#8221; Roman said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AfriBlocks joins African startups like Farmcrowdy, OnePipe, Risevest, Eversend and OjaExpress, who have participated in different <a href="https://www.techstars.com/portfolio?category=unicorns">Techstars accelerators</a> worldwide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before AfriBlocks, Choto, who grew up in Zimbabwe, served as a product manager at BillMari, a pan-African remittance service leveraging bitcoin technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For Roger, whose upbringing was on the west side of Chicago, he doubles as an active angel investor and a VC scout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is predicted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that freelancers will account for as much as 80% of the entire workforce worldwide by 2030</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelance work has become a viable source of employment and has shifted from being a vocation people engage in to supplement their income to being a full-time source of jobs for Africans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term goal for AfriBlocks is to build the tech infrastructure for the future of work in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, participating in Techstars is the right path to that destination</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In anticipation of the impending global human talent shortage that could result in 85 million jobs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being unfilled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the loss of $85 trillion </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our long-term goal is to make Africa the global hub for technical and creative freelancers by providing the rails for companies to work in Africa and with remote African talent,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Choto said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cryptocurrency exchange company <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com">Bitfinex</a> is launching <a href="https://pay.bitfinex.com">Bitfinex Pay</a>, a cryptocurrency payment gateway. With this new product, online merchants can accept payments in various cryptocurrencies. It should make cross-border transactions easier in particular.</p>
<p>While there are a few crypto payment gateways already, Bitfinex Pay has the advantage of working seamlessly with the company’s exchange. Merchants can create a widget and start accepting payments in Ethereum and bitcoin. Payments are deposited on your exchange wallet.</p>
<p>Bitfinex’s widget works a bit like the “Buy Now with PayPal” button. When you click on the Bitfinex Pay button, you’re redirected to the cryptocurrency company’s website. Once your payment is approved, you’re redirected back to the original merchant website. Payments are capped at the equivalent of $1,000 in cryptocurrencies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You don’t pay any fee with Bitfinex Pay transactions. Of course, there are some network fees involved with sending crypto tokens. Merchants will also end up paying fees if they want to convert their cryptocurrency holdings on the exchange and transfer fiat money out of their account.</p>
<p>Bitfinex Pay also lets you accept Tether payments. Tether is a stablecoin, which means that one unit of Tether is supposed to be worth one USD — it doesn’t fluctuate over time.</p>
<p>That statement has been challenged, as the attorney general in New York <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal?ref">has concluded that</a> Tethers weren’t fully backed by USD sitting in bank accounts at all times. At some point, Bitfinex <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3ac4809e-7c4d-4d9f-83ea-7112bfd3480a">couldn’t access</a> $850 million held in a Panamanian bank.</p>
<p>As a result, Tether and Bitfinex are currently banned in the state of New York. So you’ll have to determine whether you trust Bitfinex enough to use it as part of your checkout process on your website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors is exploring building a second U.S. battery cell manufacturing plant with its joint-venture partner, Seoul, South Korea-based LG Chem.</p>
<p>If the plant moves forward, it would be the latest in a series of investments aimed at building out the auto giant’s portfolio of electric vehicles. The company’s joint venture with LG, Ultium Cells LLC, is already at work <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/gm-starts-construction-on-the-cornerstone-of-its-ev-strategy/">constructing a $2.3 billion battery cell manufacturing facility in Lordstown, Ohio</a>.</p>
<p>The companies hope to have a decision on the factory in the first half of 2021, GM spokesman Dan Flores told TechCrunch. He declined to specify possible locations for the site, but Tennessee is high on the list, according to reporting from The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-looking-to-build-second-battery-factory-in-u-s-11614853806">Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GM has set ambitious targets for decarbonizing its operations and pledged steep investments to get there. Through 2025 alone the company said it would bring to the global market 30 EV models across its brands and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/gm-ups-electric-and-autonomous-vehicle-spending-to-27-billion-through-2025/">spend $27 billion on electrification and automated technology</a> — a 35% increase from 2020 spending. By the mid-2030s, GM said its fleet will be all-EV.</p>
<p>“Clearly, with our commitment to an all-electric future, we will need a lot of battery cells,” Flores said.</p>

<p>He declined to comment on the ongoing shortage of battery cells, which has affected EV manufacturers Tesla and Nikola. President Joe Biden issued an executive order at the end of February instructing federal agencies to identify risks in the supply chains for batteries, semiconductors and other critical items, including where supply chains are dependent on “competitor nations.”</p>
<p>GM CEO Mary Barra said in a <a href="https://investor.gm.com/events/event-details/general-motors-participate-wolfe-research-global-auto-auto-tech-and-mobility">virtual investor presentation last week</a> that the battery shortage is one reason the company is investing in its own battery cell manufacturing. She alluded to plans to grow the company’s battery cell manufacturing operations but did not go into specifics.</p>
<p>“There’s more coming than we’ve announced already,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Global air transport data giant SITA has confirmed a data breach involving passenger data.</p>
<p>The company said <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-statement-about-security-incident/">in a brief statement</a> on Thursday that it had been the &#8220;victim of a cyberattack,&#8221; and that certain passenger data stored on its U.S. servers had been breached. The cyberattack was confirmed on February 24, after which the company contacted affected airlines.</p>
<p>SITA is one of the largest aviation IT companies in the world, said to be serving around 90% of the world&#8217;s airlines, which rely on the company&#8217;s passenger service system Horizon to manage reservations, ticketing and aircraft departures.</p>
<p>But it remains unclear exactly what data was accessed or stolen.</p>
<p>When reached, SITA spokesperson Edna Ayme-Yahil declined to say what specific data had been taken, citing an ongoing investigation. The company said that the incident &#8220;affects various airlines around the world, not just in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>SITA confirmed it had notified several airlines — Malaysia Airlines; Finnair; Singapore Airlines; and Jeju Air, an airline in South Korea — which have already made statements about the breach, but declined to name other affected airlines.</p>
<p>In an email to affected customers seen by TechCrunch, Singapore Airlines said it was not a customer of SITA&#8217;s Horizon passenger service system but that about half a million frequent flyer members had their membership number and tier status compromised. The airline said that the transfer of this kind of data is &#8220;necessary to enable verification of the membership tier status, and to accord to member airlines&#8217; customers the relevant benefits while traveling.&#8221;</p>
<p>The airline said passenger itineraries, reservations, ticketing and passport data were not affected.</p>
<p>SITA is one of a handful of companies in the aviation market providing passenger ticketing and reservation systems to airlines, alongside Sabre and Amadeus.</p>
<p>Sabre reported <a href="https://www.sabre.com/insights/releases/sabre-update-on-cybersecurity-incident/">a major data breach</a> in mid-2017 affecting its hotel reservation system, after hackers scraped over a million customer credit cards. The U.S.-based company agreed in December to a $2.4 million settlement and to make changes to its cybersecurity policies following the breach.</p>
<p>In 2019, a security researcher found a vulnerability in Amadeus&#8217; passenger booking system, used by Air France, British Airways and Qantas among others, which made it easy to alter or access traveler records.</p>
