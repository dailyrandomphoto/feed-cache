										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield">Startup Battlefield</a> — the matriarch of all pitch competitions — is the stuff of tech legend. Heck, it even played a role in the HBO show, “Silicon Valley,” and its influence touches early-stage startups around the globe. Under no circumstance will you find a bigger, better platform for launching your startup to the world.</p>
<p>Battlefield has a long history of producing notable names. Need an example? A little startup by the name of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frsVoYyKpTk">Dropbox competed in the Battlefield at TC50</a> (the precursor to Disrupt) way back in 2008.</p>
<p>TechCrunch is on the hunt for innovative, game-changing startups to take the Startup Battlefield challenge and wrangle with the best-of-the-best at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TC Disrupt 2021</a> in September. Are you game?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">Apply to compete in Startup Battlefield</a> before the deadline closes on <strong>May 13 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The stakes:</strong> A shot at $100,000 in equity-free prize money. Major exposure for all competing startups — think investors eager to find and fund the next big thing, journalists in search of exciting, game-changing startups to cover and potential customers and partners who can help take your business to new levels of success.</p>
<p><strong>The investment:</strong> Your time. Yup, that’s it. Appyling to and participating in Startup Battlefield is 100 percent free. No fees, no equity cut. You simply invest your time — all participating founders receive several weeks of training with the Startup Battlefield team. Your demo and presentation will be, well, pitch perfect when you deliver it to panels of top VC judges. And you’ll be thoroughly prepped to handle the Q&amp;A that follows.</p>
<p><strong>The perks:</strong> In addition to the massive interest from just about all Disrupt attendees, competing startups get exhibition space in the Startup Alley expo area, free passes to future TechCrunch events, a free membership to Extra Crunch and invitations to private events like the Startup Battlefield reception.</p>
<p>You’ll meet members of the Startup Battlefield alumni community — we’re talking about 922 companies (like Vurb, Mint, Yammer and, yes, Dropbox) that have collectively raised $9.5 billion and produced 117 exits. Once Disrupt ends, you’re part of this phenomenal community — just imagine the networking possibilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After inking a deal to work together <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kroger-partners-with-ocado-to-serve-customers-anything-anytime-anywhere-in-us-300650210.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost three years ago</a>, U.S. supermarket chain Kroger and U.K. online grocer Ocado today took the wraps off the first major product of that deal. Kroger has launched a new Ocado-powered customer fulfillment center in Monroe, Ohio, outside of Cincinnati, a gigantic warehouse covering 375,000 square feet and thousands of products for packing and delivering Kroger orders from online shoppers.</p>
<p>Built with a giant grid along the floor, &#8220;the shed&#8221;, as Ocado calls its warehouses, will feature some 1,000 robots alongside 400 human employees to pick, sort and move around items. It is expected to process as much as $700 million in sales annually, the sales of 20 brick-and-mortar stores.</p>
<p>Those orders, in turn, will be delivered in temperature-controlled Kroger Delivery vans, built on the model of Ocado&#8217;s vans in the US and able to store up to 20 orders. These will also be run using Ocado software, mapping algorithms to optimize deliveries along the fastest and most fuel-efficient routes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The partnership was a long time in the making but the focus on what has come out of it is probably at its keenest right now, given the huge boost online shopping has had in the past year. The Covid-19 pandemic, and the resulting push for more social distancing, has driven a lot of people to the internet to shop, opting for deliveries over physical store visits for some or all of their food and other weekly essentials.</p>
<p>In call today with journalists, Rodney McMullen, Kroger&#8217;s chairman and CEO, said that delivery had grown 150% for Kroger last year. While some of that may well melt back into physical shopping as and when Covid-19 cases wane (fingers crossed), many in the industry believe that the genie has been let out of the bottle, so to speak: many consumers introduced to shopping online will stay, at least in part, and so this is about building infrastructure to meet that new demand.</p>
<p>(And there is some data that backs that up: Ocado CEO and co-founder Tim Steiner noted that at Ocado, pre-pandemic the average order value for the company was £105 ($144). That grew to £180 last year, and are at £120.)</p>
<p>Kroger, like many brick-and-mortar players, has been building out multiple fronts in its digital strategy. Alongside Ocado, the company has also been investing in technology to boost the efficiency of its in-store operations (for example by working with companies like <a href="https://www.shelfengine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shelf Engine</a>), and it has a grocery delivery partnership with Instacart.</p>
<p>That partnership with Instacart will remain in place, not least because it covers a much wider geography than the Ocado approach, which is live now in Cincinnati, and sounds like it will also expand to Florida. While Kroger today said that CFCs will vary in size and be built on the concept of &#8220;modules&#8221; (the Monroe facility is built on seven modules), this is still a capital intensive approach compared to the Instacart model, so might overall face a slower rollout and perhaps only make sense in Kroger&#8217;s denser markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two partnerships are critical to Kroger and our customers,&#8221; said Yael Cosset, Kroger&#8217;s CIO, in the call today. &#8220;We expect to work very closely in strategic partnership with Instacart and with Ocado.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ocado, an early player that started out in the UK back in 2000, is seen by many as the industry standard for how to build and run an online-only grocery business.</p>
<p>The company has been expanding its reach by way of taking the technology that it has built for itself and turning it into a product &#8212; a process that is still very much in development, with the company working now on robotic pickers and other autonomous systems, along with other technology to power and make its delivery service more efficient.</p>
<p>Ocado&#8217;s &#8220;AWS&#8221; strategy of turning tech that it has built for itself into a product to sell to others has born fruit: it now has partnerships to power online grocery services, and specifically fulfillment centers, in Japan (with <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Retail/Aeon-to-build-smart-warehouse-with-aid-of-UK-grocer-Ocado" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aeon</a>), France (with <a href="https://www.retail-week.com/grocery/ocados-first-international-depot-goes-live-in-france/7034480.article?authent=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Casino</a>) and Canada (with <a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/media/press-releases/year/2019/ocado-announces-second-sobeys-cfc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sobeys</a>). That means the Kroger rollout is now a tested model, but it&#8217;s still a very notable move for the company to break into the U.S. while at the same time giving Kroger a much-needed bit of infrastructure to better compete with bigger players in the country like Walmart and Amazon.</p>
<p>In that regard, it will be interesting to see how and if Kroger leverages its much bigger Ocado-powered infrastructure for its other projects. The company is <a href="https://blog.mirakl.com/kroger-leads-the-digital-grocery-revolution-with-mirakl-powered-marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working with Mirakl</a> to develop its own marketplace for third-party retailers, going head to head with similar offerings from &#8212; yes &#8212; Amazon and Walmart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Making deepfake videos used to be hard. Now all you need is a smartphone. <a href="https://avatarify.ai/">Avatarify</a>, a startup that allows people to make deepfake videos directly on their phone rather than in the cloud, is soaring up the app charts after being used by celebrities such as Victoria Beckham.</p>
<p>However, the problem with many deepfake videos is that there is no digital watermark to determine that the video has been tampered with. So Avatarify says it will soon launch a digital watermark to prevent this from happening.</p>
<p>Run out of Moscow but with a U.S. HQ, Avatarify launched in July 2020 and since then has been downloaded millions of times. The founders say that 140 million deepfake videos were created with Avatarify this year alone. There are now 125 million views of videos with the hashtag #avatarify on TikTok. While its competitors include the well-funded Reface, Snapchat, Wombo.ai, Mug Life and Xpression, Avatarify has yet to raise any money beyond an angel round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite taking only $120,000 in angel funding, the company has yet to accept any venture capital and says it has bootstrapped its way from zero to almost 10 million downloads and claims to have a $10 million annual run rate with a team of less than 10 people.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to see why. Avatarify has a freemium subscription model. They offer a 7-day free trial and a 12-month subscription for $34.99 or a weekly plan for $2.49. Without a subscription, they offer the core features of the app for free, but videos then carry a visible watermark.</p>
<p>The founders also say the app protects privacy, because the videos are processed directly on the phone, rather than in the cloud where they could be hacked.</p>
<p>Avatarify processes user&#8217;s photos and turns them into short videos by animating faces, using machine learning algorithms and adding sounds. The user chooses a picture they want to animate, chooses the effects and music, and then taps to animate the picture. This short video can then be posted on Instagram or TikTok.</p>
<p>The Avatarify videos are taking off on TikTok because teens no longer need to learn a dance or be much more creative than finding a photo of a celebrity to animate to.</p>
<p>Avartify says you can’t use their app to impersonate someone, but there is of course no way to police this.</p>
<p>Co-founders Ali Aliev and Karim Iskakov wrote the app during the COVID-19 lockdown in April 2020. Ali spent two hours writing a program in Python to transfer his facial expressions to the other person’s face and use a filter in Zoom. The result was a real-time video, which could be streamed to Zoom. He joined a call with Elon Mask&#8217;s face and everyone on the call was shocked. The team posted the video, which then went viral.</p>
<p>They posted the code on Github and immediately saw the number of downloads grow. The repository was published on 6 April 2020, and as of 19 March 2021 had been downloaded 50,000 times.</p>
<p>Ali left his job at Samsung AI Centre and devoted himself to the app. After Avatarify’s iOS app was released on 28 June 2020, viral videos on TikTok, created with the app, led it to App Store’s top charts without paid acquisition. In February 2021, Avatarify was ranked first among Top Free Apps worldwide. Between February and March, the app 2021 generated more than $1 million in revenue (Source: AppMagic).</p>
<p>However, despite Avartify’s success, the ongoing problems with deepfake videos remain, such as using these apps to make nonconsensual porn, using the faces of innocent people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There’s no doubt this past year has been a major watershed moment for the robotics industry. Warehouse and logistics have been a particular target for an automation push, as companies have worked to keep the lights on amidst stay at home orders and other labor shortages.</p>
<p>MIT spinoff <a href="https://www.picklerobot.com/">Pickle</a> is one of the latest startups to enter the fray. The company launched with limited funding and a small team, though it’s recently changed one of these, telling TechCrunch this week that it has raised $5.57 million in funding during this hot investment streak. The seed round was led by Hyperplane and featured Third Kind Venture Capital, Box Group and Version One Ventures, among others.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-IwGbEIU08?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s making some pretty big claims around the efficacy of its first robot named, get this, “Dill” (the company clearly can’t avoid a clever name). It says the robot is capable of 1,600 picks per hour from the back of a trailer, a figure it claims is “double the speed of any competitors.”</p>
<p>CEO Andrew Meyer says collaboration is a key to the company’s play. “We designed people into the system from the get-go and focused on a specific problem: package handling in the loading dock. We got out of the lab and put robots to work in real warehouses. We resisted the fool’s errand of trying to create a system that could work entirely unsupervised or solve every robotics problem out there.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Von Tobel outlines steps to stay out of debt, build credit and accumulate wealth to ensure financial peace of mind as you take on the most stressful venture of your life: Starting a company.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few people are more knowledgable on the topic of how founders should manage their finances than Alexa von Tobel. She is a certified financial planner, started her own company in the midst of the recession (which happened to be a wildly successful personal finance startup that sold for hundreds of millions of dollars) and is now a VC who invests and advises founders.</p>
<p>At Early Stage 2021, she gave a presentation on how founders should think about managing their own wealth. Startup founders can often put all their money into their venture and end up paying more attention to the finances of their company than their own bank account.</p>
<p>Von Tobel outlined the various steps you can take to stay out of debt, build credit and accumulate wealth through investments to ensure you have financial peace of mind as you take on the most stressful venture of your life: Starting a company.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Know your numbers</h2>
<p>The first step in getting organized and being proactive is often taking inventory. Von Tobel believes that knowing your numbers and getting organized digitally is the first step to having financial peace of mind.</p>
<blockquote><p>Know all your numbers. Know your net worth. What are your assets? What&#8217;s your debt? What does your total financial picture look like? Get everything online. You should have all the mobile apps downloaded so that, in minutes, you can actually see your full financial life. And keep it simple. Fewer accounts are better. I always tell people, if you have seven credit cards, plus three savings accounts, that&#8217;s a lot. You&#8217;re never going to be as good at managing your finances. Simplify your accounts. <em><strong>(Time stamp — 2:50)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Manage your credit and debt</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2021/04/changes-to-feedburner?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20blogspot%2FamDG%20(Google%20Search%20Central%20Blog)">announced</a> that it is moving FeedBurner to a new infrastructure but also deprecating its email subscription service.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an internet user of a certain age, chances are you used Google&#8217;s <a href="https://feedburner.google.com/">FeedBurner</a> to manage the RSS feeds of your personal blogs and early podcasts at some point. During the Web 2.0 era, it was the de facto standard for feed management and analytics, after all. Founded in 2004, with Dick Costolo as one of its co-founders (before he became Twitter&#8217;s CEO in 2010), it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2007/05/23/100-million-payday-for-feedburner-this-deal-is-confirmed/">acquired by Google</a> in 2007.</p>
<p>Ever since, FeedBurner lingered in an odd kind of limbo. While Google had no qualms shutting down popular services like Google Reader in favor of its ill-fated social experiments like Google+, FeedBurner just kept burning feeds day in and day out, even as Google slowly deprecated some parts of the service, most notably <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/28/the-feedburner-deathwatch-continues-google-kills-adsense-for-feeds/">its advertising integrations</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="b687WFxHB6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2007/05/23/100-million-payday-for-feedburner-this-deal-is-confirmed/">$100 Million Payday For Feedburner &#8211; This Deal Is Confirmed</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;$100 Million Payday For Feedburner &#8211; This Deal Is Confirmed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2007/05/23/100-million-payday-for-feedburner-this-deal-is-confirmed/embed/#?secret=b687WFxHB6" data-secret="b687WFxHB6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I don&#8217;t know that anybody spent a lot of time thinking about the service and RSS has slowly (and sadly) fallen into obscurity, yet the service was probably easy enough to maintain that Google kept it going. And despite everything, shutting it down would probably break enough tools for publishers to create quite an uproar. The TechCrunch RSS feed, to which you are surely subscribed in your desktop RSS reader, is <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/">http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/</a>, after all.</p>
<p>So here we are, 14 years later, and Google today announced that it is &#8220;making several upcoming changes to support the product&#8217;s next chapter.&#8221; It&#8217;s moving the service to a new, more stable infrastructure.</p>
<p>But in July, it is also shutting down some non-core features that don&#8217;t directly involve feed management, most importantly the FeedBurner email subscription service that allowed you to get emailed alerts when a feed updates. Feed owners will be able to download their email subscriber lists (and will be able to do so after July, too). With that, Blogger&#8217;s FollowByEmail widget will <a href="https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/10477563">also be deprecated</a> (and hey, did you start this day thinking you&#8217;d read about FeedBurner AND Blogger on TechCrunch without having to travel back to 2007?).</p>
<p>Google stresses that other core FeedBurner features <a href="https://support.google.com/feedburner/answer/10483501">will remain in place</a>, but given the popularity of email newsletters, that&#8217;s a bit of an odd move.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today shares of Coinbase began to trade after the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/">executed a direct listing</a>. From a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/coinbase-sets-direct-listing-reference-price-at-250-share-valuing-the-company-at-as-much-as-65b/">reference price of $250</a>, Coinbase shares opened at $381 today, a change of around 52%. At its open Coinbase was valued at $99.6 billion on a fully diluted basis. As of the time of writing Coinbase has appreciated further to just over $400 per share, valuing the company at a touch more than $104 billion.</p>
<p>Coinbase was worth $65.3 billion at its reference price, on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s debut has been hotly anticipated, thanks to its position inside the greater crypto economy and, from a purely startup perspective, its huge value unlock. Private investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/coinbase-is-now-valued-at-8b-after-closing-new-300m-round/">poured capital into the company</a> during its life as a private company, valuing it as high as $8 billion.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s new valuation dwarfs that prior figure, implying strong returns for its long-term backers. Today even regular folks could get a scratch at the company&#8217;s equity, and they were willing to pay up for the privilege. TechCrunch asked its audience about the debut, pre-trading results that served as an anti-indicator of where the crypto-unicorn&#8217;s shares would trade:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Would you pay more or less than $250/share for Coinbase? (read up on today&#39;s direct listing: <a href="https://t.co/xd8xP4YwWX">https://t.co/xd8xP4YwWX</a>)</p>
<p>&mdash; Extra Crunch (@ExtraCrunch) <a href="https://twitter.com/ExtraCrunch/status/1382333411898101760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 14, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>For Coinbase the road ahead is interesting. The company is richly capitalized and posted monster profits in its most recent quarter. However, Coinbase has yet to chart a future sufficiently delinked from the impacts of cryptocurrency price levels and resulting trading volume to be immune to a potential setback in growth and income if the value of bitcoin, et al. dropped.</p>
<p>But for crypto believers, watching Coinbase list is a win; it is ironic that a traditional company listing on an old-fashioned exchange is a key moment for the crypto economy, but most things come in steps. Perhaps the next major crypto company trading debut will be on a decentralized exchange.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Banking tech startup <a href="https://www.zeta.tech/in">Zeta</a> is inching closer to the much sought-after unicorn status as it talks to investors to finalize a new round, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>SoftBank Vision Fund 2 is in talks to lead a ~$250 million Series D round in the five-year-old startup, the sources said. The investment proposal values the Indian startup, co-founded by high-profile entrepreneur Bhavin Turakhia, at over $1 billion, up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/zeta-300m-sodexo/">$300 million in its maiden external funding (Series C) in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>The round has yet to close, a third person said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A SoftBank spokesperson declined to comment.</p>
<p>Five-year-old Zeta helps banks launch modern retail and fintech products. The thesis is that banks &#8212; largely operating on antiquated technologies &#8212; today don&#8217;t have the time and expertise to offer the best experience to hundreds of millions of customers and fintech firms they serve.</p>
<p>Zeta is attempting to help banks either use the startup&#8217;s cloud-native, API-first banking stack as its core framework or build services atop it to offer better a experience to all customers &#8212; think of improved mobile app and debit and credit features. It also offers API, SDKs and payment gateways to banks to work more efficiently with fintech firms.</p>
<p>The startup has amassed clients in several Asian and Latin American markets.</p>
<p>Turakhia, with his brother Divyank, started his first venture in 1998. Along the way, they sold four web companies to Endurance for $160 million. Zeta is the third startup Bhavin has co-founded since then &#8212; the other being business messaging platform Flock and Radix.</p>
<p>If finalized, Zeta could become the seventh Indian startup to turn a unicorn this month. Last week, social commerce Meesho &#8212; also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/indian-social-commerce-meesho-raises-300m-at-2-1b-valuation-softbank/">backed by SoftBank Vision Fund 2</a> &#8212; fintech firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">CRED</a>, e-pharmacy firm PharmEasy, millennials-focused <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">Groww</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/messaging-platform-gupshup-raises-100-million-at-1-4-billion-valuation/">business messaging platform Gupshup</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/sharechat-valued-at-2-1b-in-502-million-fundraise/">social network ShareChat</a> attained the unicorn status.</p>
<p><em>The story was updated to note that the round hasn&#8217;t closed.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Would be TikTok competitor Triller, operated by parent company TrillerNet, is gaining a new CEO, the company announced today. The short-form video app said it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/trillernet-acquires-leading-ai-powered-customer-engagement-platform-amplifyai-for-completion-of-trillers-launch-of-internet-3-0-301269016.html">acquiring</a> an A.I.-based customer engagement platform, Amplify.AI, whose co-founder Mahi de Silva will now become TrillerNet&#8217;s CEO. Existing CEO Mike Lu will transition to president of TrillerNet and will focus on investor relations. The company separately announced the <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/triller-parent-company-buys-combat-sports-streaming-service-fite-tv/">acquisition</a> of FITE TV, a live event and pay-per-view combat sports streaming platform.</p>
<p>New CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdesilva/">Mahi de Silva</a> had been closely involved with Triller before today. The company&#8217;s press release today says he&#8217;s been serving as non-executive chairman since 2016, but his LinkedIn notes the year was 2019 (which would be following Triller&#8217;s 2019 <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/triller-announces-record-breaking-growth-new-funding-by-proxima-media-and-acquisition-of-ai-music-platform-300944115.html">funding</a> by Proxima Media, when the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/triller-announces-record-breaking-growth-new-funding-by-proxima-media-and-acquisition-of-ai-music-platform-300944115.html">press release at the time</a> noted he was assuming the role of &#8220;chairman.&#8221;)  These are both wrong, the company discovered when we reached out for clarity. The correct year is 2018.</p>
<p>Ahead of the acquisition, de Silva had been serving as CEO and co-founder to Amplify.AI since 2017, and before that was CEO of Opera Mediaworks, the marketing and advertising arm of Opera Software, and co-founder and CEO of Botworx.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amplify.AI, which works with brands in CPG, financial services, automotive, telecom, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/business/startups/news/amplify-ai-the-conversational-ai-startup-founded-by-two-south-asians-has-scored-big-with-brands-and-governments/articleshow/80443958.cms">politics</a> and digital media, among others, will continue to operate as a subsidiary of TrillerNet following the deal. Other team members include former RSA and VeriSign executive Ram Moskovitz who helped design and develop the digital certificates for SSL and code signing; and Amplify.ai co-founder and CTO Manoj Malhotra, a pioneer in B2C SMS messaging, the company notes.</p>
<p>TrillerNet also today announced it&#8217;s acquiring another strategic property to help shift its business further into the direction of live events: FITE TV. This deal gives Triller more of a foothold in the live events and pay-per-view streaming market, it says. As a result, FITE, which touts 10 million users, will become the exclusive digital distributor of all Triller Fight Club boxing events going forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Acquiring FITE is part of the larger Triller strategy to bring together content, creators and commerce for the first time and the only place where they truly interact,&#8221; said Triller&#8217;s Ryan Kavanaugh, the former head of movie studio Relativity Media (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/triller-wants-to-be-the-next-tiktok-its-backers-want-a-second-act-11602255601">and controversial figure</a>) whose Proxima Media <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/triller-tiktok/">became</a> Triller&#8217;s majority investor in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/triller-announces-record-breaking-growth-new-funding-by-proxima-media-and-acquisition-of-ai-music-platform-300944115.html">2019.</a> &#8220;We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and believe we have created a better more efficient e-commerce content platform,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The acquisition follows several others TrillerNet has made to expand into live events, now that becoming a TikTok replacement in the U.S. is no longer a viable option, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tiktoks-forced-sale-to-oracle-is-put-on-hold/">the Trump ban was put on hold</a> by the Biden administration. Triller also in March acquired live music streaming platform Verzuz, founded by Swizz Beats and Timbaland. And it operates Triller Flight Club in partnership with Snoop Dogg, as well as a streaming platform Triller TV.</p>
<p>While specific deal terms were not revealed, Triller told TechCrunch it&#8217;s spent $250 million in the aggregate on its acquisitions, including Halogen, Mashtraxx, Verzuz, FITE and Amplify today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin has launched its New Shepard rocket for the second time this year, and the 15th time overall. The mission profile saw the reusable spacecraft fly to suborbital space, and then return for a parachute-assisted landing at Blue Origin&#8217;s launch facility in West Texas.</p>
<p>This flight was a little different than its usual missions, because it included a rehearsal component with people standing in for what will eventually be Blue Origin&#8217;s paying private astronaut customers. What that means is that they actually went through the process of flight preparations, including transporting to the pad, and even climbing in to the New Shepard vehicle and getting seated as if they were going along for the ride.</p>
<p>The crucial difference between this and an actual passenger flight is that Blue Origin then paused the countdown, and the mock crew disembarked, before the countdown was resumed and the flight proceeded as planned — without any passengers, save for Mannequin Skywalker, the Blue Origin test dummy who flies on these preparation missions to take crucial readings during the launch and return.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>New Shepard returned and touched down without any issue, and in fact showed off one of its smoothest landings yet. This was the second launch and landing for this particular booster stage. The capsule also touched down as planned, with a soft landing facilitated by the spacecraft&#8217;s parachute descent system.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2138511" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ns-15-landing-blue-origin.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2138511" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2138511 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ns-15-landing-blue-origin.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="552" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2138511" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blue Origin</p></div></p>
<p>Next up, Blue Origin is going to do a dry run of what would be the ending stage of the mission for an actual human crew, by bringing out those rehearsal astronauts and putting them back into the capsule, then rehearsing in full the astronaut recovery and departure process that would occur during a live tourist flight.</p>
<p>All of today&#8217;s activities showed off what Blue Origin hopes to accomplish sometime this year with people on board. It&#8217;s yet another way paying private astronauts can get to space, in a growing roster of options that now includes SpaceX Dragon flights, and hopefully soon, Virgin Galactic launches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Labor activists challenging Uber over what they allege are &#8216;robo-firings&#8217; of drivers in Europe have trumpeted winning a default judgement in the Netherlands &#8212; where the Court of Amsterdam <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:1415&amp;showbutton=true&amp;keyword=ECLI%3aNL%3aRBAMS%3a2021%3a1415">ordered</a> the ride-hailing giant to reinstate six drivers who the litigants claim were unfairly terminated &#8220;by algorithmic means.&#8221;</p>
<p>The court also ordered Uber to pay the fired drivers compensation.</p>
<p>The challenge references Article 22 of the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; which provides protection for individuals against purely automated decisions with a legal or significant impact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The activists say this is the first time a court has ordered the overturning of an automated decision to dismiss workers from employment.</p>
<p>However the judgement, which was issued on February 24, was issued by default &#8212; and Uber says it was not aware of the case until last week, claiming that was why it did not contest it (nor, indeed, comply with the order).</p>
<p>It had until March 29 to do so, per the litigants, who are being supported by the App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union (ADCU) and Worker Info Exchange (WIE).</p>
<p>Uber argues the default judgement was not correctly served and says it is now making an application to set the default ruling aside and have its case heard &#8220;on the basis that the correct procedure was not followed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It envisages the hearing taking place within four weeks of its Dutch entity, Uber BV, being made aware of the judgement &#8212; which it says occurred on April 8.</p>
<p>“Uber only became aware of this default judgement last week, due to representatives for the ADCU not following proper legal procedure,&#8221; an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for WIE denied that correct procedure was not followed but welcomed the opportunity for Uber to respond to questions over how its driver ID systems operate in court, adding: &#8220;They [Uber] are out of time. But we&#8217;d be happy to see them in court. They will need to show meaningful human intervention <em>and</em> provide transparency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uber pointed to a separate judgement by the Amsterdam Court <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/dutch-court-rejects-uber-drivers-robo-firing-charge-but-tells-ola-to-explain-algo-deductions/">last month</a> &#8212; which rejected another ADCU- and WIE-backed challenge to Uber&#8217;s anti-fraud systems, with the court accepting its explanation that algorithmic tools are mere aids to human &#8220;anti-fraud&#8221; teams who it said take all decisions on terminations.</p>
<p>&#8220;With no knowledge of the case, the Court handed down a default judgement in our absence, which was automatic and not considered. Only weeks later, the very same Court found comprehensively in Uber’s favour on similar issues in a separate case. We will now contest this judgement,&#8221; Uber&#8217;s spokesperson added.</p>
<p>However WIE said this default judgement &#8220;robo-firing&#8221; challenge specifically targets Uber&#8217;s Hybrid Real-Time ID System &#8212; a system that incorporates facial recognition checks and which labor activists recently found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/uber-under-pressure-over-facial-recognition-checks-for-drivers/">misidentifying drivers in a number of instances</a>.</p>
<p>It also pointed to a separate development this week in the U.K. where it said the City of London Magistrates Court ordered the city&#8217;s transport regulator, TfL, to reinstate the licence of one of the drivers revoked after Uber routinely notified it of a dismissal (also triggered by Uber&#8217;s real time ID system, per WIE).</p>
<p>Reached for comment on that, a TfL spokesperson said: “The safety of the travelling public is our top priority and where we are notified of cases of driver identity fraud, we take immediate licensing action so that passenger safety is not compromised. We always require the evidence behind an operator’s decision to dismiss a driver and review it along with any other relevant information as part of any decision to revoke a licence. All drivers have the right to appeal a decision to remove a licence through the Magistrates’ Court.”</p>
<p>The regulator has been applying pressure to Uber since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/22/uber-loses-its-license-to-operate-in-london/">2017</a> when it took the (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/23/uber-only-has-itself-to-blame-for-london-license-loss/">shocking to Uber</a>) decision to revoke the company&#8217;s licence to operate &#8212; citing safety and corporate governance concerns.</p>
<p>Since then Uber has been able to continue to operate in the U.K. capital but the company remains under pressure to comply with a laundry list of requirements set by TfL as it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/uber-wins-latest-london-licence-appeal/">tries to regain a full operator licence</a>.</p>
<p>Commenting on the default Dutch judgement on the Uber driver terminations in a statement, James Farrar, director of WIE, accused gig platforms of &#8220;hiding management control in algorithms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the Uber drivers robbed of their jobs and livelihoods this has been a dystopian nightmare come true,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They were publicly accused of ‘fraudulent activity’ on the back of poorly governed use of bad technology. This case is a wake-up call for lawmakers about the abuse of surveillance technology now proliferating in the gig economy. In the aftermath of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">recent U.K. Supreme Court ruling</a> on worker rights gig economy platforms are hiding management control in algorithms. This is misclassification 2.0.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Yaseen Aslam, president of the ADCU, added: &#8220;I am deeply concerned about the complicit role Transport for London has played in this catastrophe. They have encouraged Uber to introduce surveillance technology as a price for keeping their operator’s license and the result has been devastating for a TfL licensed workforce that is 94% BAME. The Mayor of London must step in and guarantee the rights and freedoms of Uber drivers licensed under his administration<em>.&#8221;  </em></p>
<p>When pressed on the driver termination challenge being specifically targeted at its Hybrid Real-Time ID system, Uber declined to comment in greater detail &#8212; claiming the case is &#8220;now a live court case again&#8221;.</p>
<p>But its spokesman suggested it will seek to apply the same defence against the earlier &#8220;robo-firing&#8221; charge &#8212; when it argued its anti-fraud systems do not equate to automated decision making under EU law because &#8220;meaningful human involvement [is] involved in decisions of this nature&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few weeks ago, we wrote about fintech Pilot raising </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/jeff-bezos-investment-fund-is-backing-a-startup-hoping-to-be-the-aws-for-smb-accounting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $100 million Series C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that doubled the company’s valuation to $1.2 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bezos Expeditions — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ personal investment fund — and Whale Rock Capital joined the round, adding $40 million to a $60 million raise led by Sequoia about one month prior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That raise came after </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/index-ventures-stripe-back-bookkeeping-service-pilot-with-40m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $40 million Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in April 2019 co-led by Stripe and Index Ventures that valued the company at $355 million.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both raises were notable and warranted coverage. But sometimes it’s fun to take a peek at the stories behind the raises and dig deeper into the numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here we go.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uLylNiO7FV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/jeff-bezos-investment-fund-is-backing-a-startup-hoping-to-be-the-aws-for-smb-accounting/">Jeff Bezos&#8217; investment fund is backing a startup hoping to be the AWS for SMB accounting</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jeff Bezos&#8217; investment fund is backing a startup hoping to be the AWS for SMB accounting&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/jeff-bezos-investment-fund-is-backing-a-startup-hoping-to-be-the-aws-for-smb-accounting/embed/#?secret=uLylNiO7FV" data-secret="uLylNiO7FV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First off, San Francisco-based Pilot &#8212; which has a mission of affordably providing back-office services such as bookkeeping to startups and SMBs &#8212; apparently had term sheets that offered “2x the $40M” raised in its Series B. But it chose not to raise so much capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also heard that the same investor that ended up leading a now defunct competitor&#8217;s $60 million raise first asked to invest $60 million in Pilot as a follow-on to that Series B prior to making the other investment. While I don’t know for sure, I can only presume that what is being referred to is ScaleFactor’s</span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/scalefactor-raises-third-round-60m-in-13-months-after-700-arr-growth-in-2018/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $60 million Series C raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August 2019 that was led by Coatue Management. (ScaleFactor </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/07/20/scalefactor-raised-100-million-in-a-year-then-blamed-covid-19-for-its-demise-employees-say-it-had-much-bigger-problems/?sh=5fdc8e1f2928"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crashed and burned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CFO Paul Jun: “There were many periods when Pilot turned away new customers and growth capital instead of absolutely maximizing short-term growth&#8230;Pilot prioritized building the foundational investments needed for scalability, reliability and high velocity. When it was presented with the opportunity for additional funding towards further growth in 2019, it declined to do so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CEO Waseem Daher elaborates, pointing out that the first company that Pilot&#8217;s founding team ran, Ksplice, was bootstrapped before getting acquired by Oracle in 2011. (It&#8217;s also worth noting that the founding team are all MIT computer scientists.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ultimately, the reason to raise money is you believe that you can deploy the capital, to grow the company or to basically cause the company to grow at the rate you&#8217;d like to grow. And it doesn&#8217;t make sense to raise money if you don&#8217;t need it, or don&#8217;t have a good plan for what to do with it,” Daher told TechCrunch. “Too much capital can be bad because it sort of leads you to bad habits&#8230;When you have the money, you spend the money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So despite what he describes as “a great deal of institutional interest” in 2019, Pilot opted to raise just $40 million, instead of $80 million to $100 million, because it was the amount of capital the company had confidence that it could deploy successfully.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pilot claims to have had a cash burn of $800,000 per month in 2020 against a starting balance of $40 million.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup touts a 60% GAAP gross margin. Daher notes: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We feel really good about having long-term unit economics that will work for this business without resorting to offshoring or outsourcing in a way that could compromise quality and compromise relationships.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line is companies don&#8217;t have to accept all the capital that&#8217;s offered to them. And maybe in some cases, they shouldn&#8217;t.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">School closures due to the pandemic have interrupted the learning processes of millions of kids, and without individual attention from teachers, reading skills in particular are taking a hit. <a href="https://www.amiralearning.com/">Amira Learning</a> aims to address this with an app that reads along with students, intelligently correcting errors in real time. Promising pilots and research mean the company is poised to go big as education changes, and it has raised $11 million to scale up with a new app and growing customer base.</p>
<p>In classrooms, a common exercise is to have students read aloud from a storybook or worksheet. The teacher listens carefully, stopping and correcting students on difficult words. This &#8220;guided reading&#8221; process is fundamental for both instruction and assessment: It not only helps the kids learn, but the teacher can break the class up into groups with similar reading levels so she can offer tailored lessons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guided reading is needs-based, differentiated instruction and in COVID we couldn&#8217;t do it,&#8221; said <span style="color: #000000;">Andrea Burkiett, director of Elementary Curriculum and Instruction at the Savannah-Chatham County Public School System. Breakout sessions are technically possible, &#8220;but when you&#8217;re talking about a kindergarten student who doesn&#8217;t even know how to use a mouse or touchpad, COVID basically made small groups nonexistent.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amira replicates the guided reading process by analyzing the child&#8217;s speech as they read through a story and identifying things like mispronunciations, skipped words and other common stumbles. It&#8217;s based on research going back 20 years that has tested whether learners using such an automated system actually see any gains (and they did, though generally in a lab setting).</p>
<p>In fact I was speaking to Burkiett out of skepticism — &#8220;AI&#8221; products are thick on the ground and while it does little harm if one recommends you a recipe you don&#8217;t like, it&#8217;s a serious matter if a kid&#8217;s education is impacted. I wanted to be sure this wasn&#8217;t a random app hawking old research to lend itself credibility, and after talking with Burkiett and CEO Mark Angel I feel it&#8217;s quite the opposite and could actually be a valuable tool for educators. But it needed to convince educators first.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jbcU74AaY1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/outschool-series-c-unicorn/">Outschool is the newest edtech unicorn</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Outschool is the newest edtech unicorn&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/outschool-series-c-unicorn/embed/#?secret=jbcU74AaY1" data-secret="jbcU74AaY1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Not a replacement but a force multiplier</h2>
<p>&#8220;You have to start by truly identifying the reason for wanting to employ a tech tool,&#8221; said Burkiett. &#8220;There are a lot of tech tools out there that are exciting, fun for kids, etc., but we could use all of them and not impact growth or learning at all because we didn&#8217;t stop and say, this tool helps me with this need.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amira was decided on as one that addresses the particular need in the K-5 range of steadily improving reading level through constant practice and feedback.</p>
<p>&#8220;When COVID hit, every tech tool came out of the woodwork and was made free and available,&#8221; Burkiett recalled. &#8220;With Amira you&#8217;re looking at a 1:1 tutor at their specific level. She&#8217;s not a replacement for a teacher — though it has been that way in COVID — but beyond COVID she could become a force multiplier,&#8221; said Burkiett.</p>
<p>You can see the old version of Amira in action below, though it&#8217;s been updated since:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/KRto8CIxb7Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Testing Amira with her own district&#8217;s students, Burkiett replicated the results that have been obtained in more controlled settings: As much as twice or three times as much progress in reading level based on standard assessment tools, some of which are built into the teacher-side Amira app.</p>
<p>Naturally it isn&#8217;t possible to simply attribute all this improvement to Amira — there are other variables in play. But it appears to help and doesn&#8217;t hinder, and the effect correlates with frequency of use. The exact mechanism isn&#8217;t as important as the fact that kids learn faster when they use the app versus when they don&#8217;t, and furthermore this allows teachers to better allocate resources and time. A kid who can&#8217;t use it as often because their family shares a single computer is at a disadvantage that has nothing to do with their aptitude — but this problem can be detected and accounted for by the teacher, unlike a simple &#8220;read at home&#8221; assignment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Outside COVID we would always have students struggling with reading, and we would have parents with the money and knowledge to support their student,&#8221; Burkiett explained. &#8220;But now we can take this tool and offer it to students regardless of mom and dad&#8217;s time, mom and dad&#8217;s ability to pay. We can now give that tutor session to every single student.&#8221;</p>
<h2>&#8220;Radically suboptimal conditions&#8221;</h2>
<p>This is familiar territory for CEO Mark Angel, though the AI aspect, he admits, is new.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the Amira team came from Renaissance Learning. bringing fairly conventional edtech software into elementary school classrooms at scale. The actual tech we used was very simple compared to Amira — the big challenge was trying to figure out how to make applications work with the teacher workflow, or make them friendly and resilient when 6-year-olds are your users,&#8221; he told me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to make it trite, but what we&#8217;ve learned is really just listen to teachers — they&#8217;re the superusers,&#8221; Angel continued. &#8220;And to design for radically suboptimal conditions, like background noise, kids playing with the microphone, the myriad things that happen in real-life circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once they were confident in the ability of the app to reliably decode words, the system was given three fundamental tasks that fall under the broader umbrella of machine learning.</p>
<p>The first is telling the difference between a sentence being read correctly and incorrectly. This can be difficult due to the many normal differences between speakers. Singling out errors that matter, versus simply deviation from an imaginary norm (in speech recognition that is often American English as spoken by white people) lets readers go at their own pace and in their own voice, with only actual issues like saying a silent k noted by the app.</p>
<p>(On that note, considering the prevalence of English language learners with accents, I asked about the company&#8217;s performance and approach there. Angel said they and their research partners went to great lengths to make sure they had a representative dataset, and that the model only flags pronunciations that indicate a word was not read or understood correctly.)</p>
<p>The second is knowing what action to take to correct an error. In the case of a silent k, it matters whether this is a first grader who is still learning spelling or a fourth grader who is proficient. And is this the first time they&#8217;ve made that mistake, or the tenth? Do they need an explanation of why the word is this way, or several examples of similar words? &#8220;It&#8217;s about helping a student at a moment in time,&#8221; Angel said, both in the moment of reading that word, and in the context of their current state as a learner.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2138059" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amira-assessment.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2138059" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2138059 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amira-assessment.png" alt="Screenshot of a reading assessment in the app Amira." width="1024" height="667" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amira-assessment.png 1182w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amira-assessment.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amira-assessment.png?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amira-assessment.png?resize=768,500 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amira-assessment.png?resize=680,443 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amira-assessment.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2138059" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amira Learning</p></div></p>
<p>Third is a data-based triage system that warns students and parents if a kid may potentially have a language learning disorder like dyslexia. The patterns are there in how they read — and while a system like Amira can&#8217;t actually diagnose, it can flag kids who may be high risk to receive a more thorough screening. (A note on privacy: Angel assured me that all information is totally private and by default is considered to belong to the district. &#8220;You&#8217;d have to be insane to take advantage of it. We&#8217;d be out of business in a nanosecond.&#8221;)</p>
<p>The $11 million in funding comes at what could be a hockey-stick moment for Amira&#8217;s adoption. (The round was led by <span id="m_-6083167058463108285gmail-docs-internal-guid-347fe175-7fff-45d4-1b28-f8097a400b8b">Authentic Ventures II, LP, with participation from Vertical Ventures, Owl Ventures and Rethink Education.</span>)</p>
<p>&#8220;COVID was a gigantic spotlight on the problem that Amira was created to solve,&#8221; Angel said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve always struggled in this country to help our children become fluent readers. The data is quite scary — more than two-thirds of our fourth graders aren&#8217;t proficient readers, and those two-thirds aren&#8217;t equally distributed by income or race. It&#8217;s a decades-long struggle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having basically given the product away for a year, the company is now looking at how to convert those users into customers. It seems like, just like the rest of society, &#8220;going back to normal&#8221; doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean going back to 2019 entirely. The lessons of the pandemic era are sticking.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t have the intention to just go back to the old ways,&#8221; Angel explained. &#8220;They&#8217;re searching for a new synthesis — how to incorporate tech, but do it in a classroom with kids elbow to elbow and interacting with teachers. So we&#8217;re focused on making Amira the norm in a post-COVID classroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of that is making sure the app works with language learners at more levels and grades, so the team is working to expand its capabilities upward to include middle-school students as well as elementary. Another is building out the management side so that success at the classroom and district levels can be more easily understood.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2138069" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Amira_Onboarding.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2138069" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2138069 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Amira_Onboarding.jpeg" alt="Cartoon illustration of an adventurous looking woman in front of a jungle and zeppelin." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Amira_Onboarding.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Amira_Onboarding.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Amira_Onboarding.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Amira_Onboarding.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Amira_Onboarding.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Amira_Onboarding.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2138069" class="wp-caption-text">Amira&#8217;s appearance got an update in the new app as well. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amira Learning</p></div></p>
<p>The company is also launching a new app aimed at parents rather than teachers. &#8220;A year ago 100% of our usage was in the classroom, then three weeks later 100% of our usage was at home. We had to learn a lot about how to adapt. Out of that learning we&#8217;re shipping Amira and the Story Craft that helps parents work with their children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hundreds of districts are on board provisionally, but decisions are still being kicked down the road as they deal with outbreaks, frustrated parents and every other chaotic aspect of getting back to &#8220;normal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps a bit of celebrity juice may help tip the balance in their favor. A new partnership with Miami Dolphins (former Houston Texans) linebacker Brennan Scarlett has the NFL player advising the board and covering the cost of 100 students at a Portland, OR school through his education charity, the Big Yard Foundation — and more to come. It may be a drop in the bucket in the scheme of things, with a year of schooling disrupted, but teachers know that every drop counts.<span id="m_-6083167058463108285gmail-docs-internal-guid-347fe175-7fff-45d4-1b28-f8097a400b8b"></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York City Department of Transportation, which originally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/the-scooter-battle-for-new-york-city-is-on/">released a request for proposals in October</a> for the pilot that was meant to start in early March, made its selections public Wednesday. The three companies are expected to begin operations in the Bronx by early summer with 1,000 electric scooters each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After a competitive selection process, Bird, Lime and Veo unveil e-scooter models and pricing plans that will allow most rides for under $5,” said NYC DOT in a statement.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “New bicycle lanes planned for pilot zone over the next two years will also enhance e-scooter mobility and safety.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micromobility operators have been competing fiercely to win a dwindling number of city concessions. If you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere, says Frank Sinatra, and winning the Big Apple plays a massive role in determining which operators will survive as the rideshare industry consolidates under a few powerful players. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird is already in over 100 cities around the United States, Europe and the Middle East, while Lime is ubiquitous, with around 130 cities in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and Australia under its belt. This win calcifies the clout the two already have in the industry. Chicago-based VeoRide is arguably the underdog of the trio, with service in around 20 U.S. cities, so getting the chance to operate in New York could be a game-changer for the </span><a href="https://veo-mobility.medium.com/sorry-boys-the-first-profitable-micromobility-company-was-veo-not-lime-97b6b279243f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already profitable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> company. This is especially true in a city where people are simultaneously still wary of coronavirus and eager to get out and catch up with friends and family this summer. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The scooter battle for New York City is on&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/the-scooter-battle-for-new-york-city-is-on/embed/#?secret=Or4DoJ542K" data-secret="Or4DoJ542K" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This e-scooter pilot program couldn’t come at a better time, as New York focuses on providing low-cost transportation options that allow residents to travel socially-distanced in the open air,” Lime CEO Wayne Ting said in a statement. “In welcoming a new mode of transportation to its streets, New York demonstrates its dedication to shepherding a sustainable recovery from COVID-19 — one that isn’t hampered by the crippling traffic congestion that depresses growth.”</span></p>
<p>Superpedestrian and Spin are among the companies that weren&#8217;t selected for participation in the program. Superpedestrian CEO Assaf Biderman said in a statement that the company was proud of the proposal it presented. &#8220;We know this is just a beginning, and there are more communities in every corner of the city that are calling out for new, safe and sustainable transportation options&#8211;something we can deliver,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite general fanfare, there may be a limit to how far operations can spread beyond the Bronx in the future. The first phase of the pilot covers neighborhoods in the East Bronx spanning from Eastchester to Van Nest; the second phase extends south to Soundview and east to Edgewater with another 4,000 to 6,000 scooters. The DOT said it chose these geographic boundaries to reach transit deserts that are unserved by existing bike-share programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That last bit is important to note. Lyft-owned Citi Bike has a monopoly over shared micromobility in NYC, with bike docks all over Manhattan and in parts of Brooklyn, Queens and the South Bronx. While </span><a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3763648&amp;GUID=05DFE6C0-4E1E-4E49-A95C-BDD1F9C44555&amp;Options=ID%7CText%7C&amp;Search=1266"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 legislation that allowed for the introduction of dockless e-scooters in NYC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to “prioritize” neighborhoods with no access to Citi Bike, the pilot zones were designed specifically to avoid overlap with Bronx neighborhoods targeted by the docked bike share’s expansion plans. </span></p>
<h2>What to expect from the e-scooter pilot in the Bronx</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from operating in alignment with NYC’s Vision Zero and equity goals, the DOT chose companies that would play ball with the city’s strong enforcement mechanisms, and that very much includes managing sidewalk clutter with dedicated parking corrals and fleet management software, a DOT spokesperson told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lime intends to combine its corral and lock-to parking strategies for the first time in NYC to ensure its Gen 3 and Gen 4 scooters don’t become a bother to the community. It’ll also rely on its backend fleet management software and a “tidy crew” that will patrol the pilot area to rebalance scooters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At high-traffic locations like transit stations, riders must park in physical parking corrals enforced using Lime’s industry-leading geofence technology,” Phil Jones, Lime’s senior government relations director told TechCrunch. Lime uses a combination of onboard and cloud computing to determine the locations of geofences, so it’ll be interesting to see how this tech holds up in such a dense city, where even Google Maps often has trouble placing individuals. “Using our LimeLocks, riders must lock their e-scooters at bike racks or other places where traditional bike parking is permitted.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://veo-mobility.medium.com/getting-scooters-right-for-new-yorkers-541cad84de3d"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veo also plans to implement lock-to parking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to keep scooters from falling over or blocking sidewalks.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pilot will cover an 18-square-mile area that’s home to 570,000 residents, 80% of whom are Black or Latino. The median household income in the Bronx is $40,088, with a poverty rate of 26.2%, according to the </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/bronxcountybronxboroughnewyork"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Census Bureau</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so equity was top of mind for the city when evaluating operators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird already has an Access program that offers unlimited rides for $5 a month to low-income residents who are on government assistance, and even allows riders to pay with cash and unlock vehicles via SMS.</span><b> </b><a href="https://www.veoride.com/veo-access/#:~:text=Veo%20Access,state%2C%20or%20federal%20assistance%20program.">Veo has an access program, but the terms are unclear</a><b>. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lime’s Access Program is similar, in that it offers 50% off rides to those on public assistance, but with NYC the program will see a rebrand as Lime Aid and expand to cover </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">frontline healthcare workers, teachers and people in the performing arts, nonprofit and hospitality sectors — those who have been most affected by the pandemic. Lime also has agreements with employment offices like BronxWorks and the Center for Employment Opportunities to source employees for the pilot locally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 11% of Bronx residents under the age of 65 have a disability, so the DOT also evaluated operators based on accessibility. Victor Calise, commissioner of the mayor’s office for people with disabilities, was one of the people on the grading panel, so Lime made a point of focusing on accessibility for the disabled community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lime recently launched a program in San Francisco that allows people with disabilities to order an accessible scooter delivered to their house with 24-hours advance notice, and the company intends to try out the same service in New York. In preparation for the Bronx pilot, Lime designed and built seven vehicle types to meet various physical abilities, including a three-wheeled, sit-down vehicle for someone who has challenges balancing; a two-wheeled sit-down for someone who can’t stand for long periods of time; a tandem scooter of sorts so someone who has trouble seeing or is blind can have a partner with full vision with them; and a tricycle with a shopping basket. These vehicles are available on demand and will be delivered directly to users upon request. </span></p>
<p>[gallery ids="2138246,2138250,2138242"]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn’t want to just think what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">might</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a disabled person want, but to actually go to the New York disabled community and learn from them,” said Jones, noting that Lime worked with New York’s Center for Independence of the Disabled, as well as other advocacy groups, prior to submitting its bid. “There’s a vocal and vibrant community here, and we are not just addressing their concerns around parking on the street, but how they can actually use our devices so we can provide a meaningful service to them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veo will offer its stand-up Astro e-scooter and its futuristic-looking Cosmo seated e-scooter because seated rides are more accessible for many, especially those taking longer trips. The company has also stated that it’s committed to ADA compliance and will make available upon request electric-powered attachments that allow private non-motorized wheelchairs to operate as motorized devices.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of reducing traffic congestion and air pollution, Veo also touts its waterproof, durable, swappable batteries, which don’t require a gas-guzzling van to replace batteries but which can be done via cargo bike or even the Cosmo. Lime also has swappable batteries, but according to a </span><a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/understanding-risks-swappable-e-scooter-batteries/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">November blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Bird has still not implemented this technology in full. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To enhance safety, Bird recently launched Beginner Mode as a new feature built for the Bird Two, alongside autonomous emergency braking and skid detection. This gives new riders a gentle acceleration option so they can gradually work their way up to full speed.  </span></p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>For the past few years, our company has put very promising candidates into the annual H-1B lottery. None of them have been selected — and none of them meet the requirements for other work visas like an O-1A. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We lost out again in this year’s H-1B lottery. Are there <em>any</em> other ways we can obtain H-1Bs for our team members?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Soldiering On in Sunnyvale</strong></p>
<p>Dear Soldiering:</p>
<p>Thank you for your timely question &#8212; you are not alone! Many employers face the same frustration given that the number of <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-09-what-makes-a-strong-h-1b-petition/">H-1B visas</a> the government issues each year is capped at 85,000, while typically more than twice that number are sought by employers annually.</p>
<p>At my Silicon Valley immigration law firm, we’ve been delighted for the opportunity to collaborate with the nonprofit <a href="https://www.openavenuesfoundation.org/">Open Avenues Foundation</a> to support private companies with a Plan B: a cap-exempt, concurrent H-1B for their employees, without needing to go through the H-1B lottery.</p>
<p>It’s a timely, predictable solution that supports teams whether the beneficiary is currently outside <em>or</em> inside the United States.</p>

<p>I recently <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/066-cap-exempt-h-1bs-with-danielle-goldman/">interviewed</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellesgoldman/">Danielle Goldman</a>, co-founder and executive director of Open Avenues, on my podcast. Through the <a href="https://www.openavenuesfoundation.org/global-talent">Global Talent Fellowship</a> program, the foundation offers a unique solution for employers like you to have a Plan B for H-1Bs: It’s possible to obtain an H-1B visa for an existing or prospective employee without going through the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/060-h-1b-lottery-planning-part-2/">H-1B lottery</a> process — or the randomness and timing restrictions that come with it. Goldman refers to the program as “innovation within legislation.”</p>
<p>So how does that work? Well, first off, you should know that four categories of employers are exempt from the annual H-1B lottery, meaning they can apply for an H-1B visa at any time of year and their pool of H-1B visas is not capped. The four categories of employers that are eligible for cap-exempt H-1Bs include:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Automakers shifting to all-electric and tech-laden vehicles have discovered that software — and more aptly software that is free of bugs and can be updated wirelessly — has become a consistent speed bump on the road to attracting customers. It is an issue that plagued Volkswagen&#8217;s launch of its all-electric VW ID.3, the 2022 Volvo XC40 Recharge and the Ford Mustang Mach-E. </span></p>
<p>Apex.AI, a startup founded by Bosch veterans and automated systems engineers Jan Becker and Dejan Pangercic, has spent four years rewriting the robot operating system that will give automakers the tools to integrate software within the vehicle and make sure all the applications run reliably. Now, freshly armed with a safety certification that validates its software development kit (SDK) is sophisticated enough to be used in production vehicles, Apex.AI has landed Toyota and Japanese tech startup Tier IV as partners.</p>
<p>Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet Group is integrating the Apex.OS SDK into its own vehicle development platform, called Arene. The Apex SDK will handle the safety-critical applications and aims to speed up autonomous software development and ultimately bring it to production vehicles. In a separate deal announced Wednesday, <a href="https://tier4.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tier4.jp/en/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618356688676000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXt4mZajNIXkusnbI_B5KZFKfzxg">Tier IV,</a> a startup in Japan known as the original creator of open-source software for autonomous driving, called Autoware, said it will use Apex.AI&#8217;s software stack for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;A trend that has become obvious in the past year, is in order to beat Tesla, car companies are aiming for what they call a software-defined vehicle,&#8221; Becker said in a recent interview. Automakers are moving away from distributing 100 electric control units (computers) throughout a vehicle and instead are having just a few high-performance computers with all the functions being implemented by the software, Becker explained.</p>
<p>That shift might mean hundreds or even thousands of software developers might be working on one vehicle. &#8220;And that really only works if they are all using the same interface, and not in silos,&#8221; Becker said. &#8220;And this is exactly what this SDK now enables. So it&#8217;s the first time, with Apex.OS that there&#8217;s this common abstraction layer or SDK, which can address practically all functions in a vehicle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apex&#8217;s toolkit has attracted the attention of private and strategic investors. In 2018, the company raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/15/apex-ai-raises-15-5-million-for-autonomous-vehicle-software/">Series A round of $15.5 million</a>. Since then, the company has taken <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/05/volvo-invests-in-autonomous-vehicle-operating-system-startup-apex-ai-though-its-vc-arm/">strategic investment</a> from Airbus, JLR&#8217;s InMotion Ventures, Toyota and Volvo Group. Becker wouldn&#8217;t disclose the amounts of those investments, but noted the company is now raising for a Series B.</p>
<p>The roots of Apex.OS are the open-source Robot Operating System known as ROS that is commonly used for R&amp;D projects and the development of autonomous vehicles. Apex&#8217;s aim was to rewrite the code to handle functional safety and real-time processing. The SDK was recently certified by TÜV NORD for functional safety. This means the technology is verified for use in production vehicles.</p>
<p>It was a longstanding belief that open-source code was not certifiable, according to Becker. The company spent a year working on the certification.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a software crash happens on your laptop it&#8217;s inconvenient, but if software crashes in any safety-critical function of a vehicle it can be catastrophic,&#8221; Becker said. &#8220;This is why we set out to write reliable software that protects against system crashes or operation failures. The certification proves we accomplished our goal as our software targets failure rates so low that they cannot be expressed statistically.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Manhunt, a gay dating app that claims to have 6 million male members, has confirmed it was hit by a data breach in February after a hacker gained access to the company&#8217;s accounts database.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20615089-mhnextllc2021-04-01">a notice</a> filed with the Washington attorney general&#8217;s office, Manhunt said the hacker &#8220;gained access to a database that stored account credentials for Manhunt users,&#8221; and &#8220;downloaded the usernames, email addresses and passwords for a subset of our users in early February 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>The notice did not say how the passwords were scrambled, if at all, to prevent them from being read by humans. Passwords scrambled using weak algorithms can sometimes be decoded into plain text, allowing malicious hackers to break into their accounts.</p>
<p>Following the breach, Manhunt force-reset account passwords and began alerting users in mid-March. Manhunt did not say what percentage of its users had their data stolen or how the data breach happened, but said that more than 7,700 Washington state residents were affected.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s attorneys did not reply to an email requesting comment.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But questions remain about how Manhunt handled the breach. In March, the company <a href="https://twitter.com/Manhunt/status/1370012193056493568 ">tweeted</a> that, &#8220;At this time, all Manhunt users are required to update their password to ensure it meets the updated password requirements.&#8221; The tweet did not say that user accounts had been stolen.</p>
<p>Manhunt was launched in 2001 by Online-Buddies Inc., which also offered gay dating app Jack&#8217;d before it <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2019/07/10/perry-street-owner-of-scruff-buys-jackd.html">was sold</a> to Perry Street in 2019 for an undisclosed sum. Just months before the sale, Jack&#8217;d had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/02/indecent-disclosure-gay-dating-app-left-private-exposed-to-web/">a security lapse</a> that exposed users&#8217; private photos and location data.</p>
<p>Dating sites store some of the most sensitive information on their users, and are frequently a target of malicious hackers. In 2015, Ashley Madison, a dating site that encouraged users to have an affair, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/have-i-been-pwned/">was hacked</a>, exposing names, and postal and email addresses. Several people <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/24/ashley-madison-offering-500000-reward-for-info-on-hack-now-linked-to-two-suicides/">died by suicide</a> after the stolen data was posted online. A year later, dating site AdultFriendFinder was hacked, exposing <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/adultfriendfinder-network-hack-exposes-secrets-of-412-million-users/">more than 400 million user accounts</a>.</p>
<p>In 2018, same-sex dating app Grindr <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/azeenghorayshi/grindr-hiv-status-privacy">made headlines</a> for sharing users&#8217; HIV status with data analytics firms.</p>
<p>In other cases, poor security — in some cases none at all — led to data spills involving some of the most sensitive data. In 2019, Rela, a popular dating app for gay and queer women in China, left a server unsecured with no password, allowing anyone to access sensitive data — including sexual orientation and geolocation — on more than 5 million app users. Months later, Jewish dating app JCrush <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/04/jcrush-exposed-data-messages/">exposed</a> around 200,000 user records.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This is Amazon&#8217;s latest hardware product: The redesigned Alexa earbuds. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/amazons-alexa-earbuds-return-with-a-smaller-design-and-wireless-charging/">TechCrunch covered the announcement here</a>, where the specs and capabilities are listed. I&#8217;m sure they work fine, too, but the case design is a blatant rip-off of Apple&#8217;s AirPod Pros.</p>
<p>This is just lazy.</p>
<p>Amazon has a long history of selling and promoting lookalikes, copycats and clones of other products. Likewise, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/amazon-and-valentino-team-up-in-joint-lawsuit-against-new-york-counterfeiter-over-rockstud-knock-offs/">the retailer sued</a> third-party sellers for doing the same thing. Amazon also has been accused of investing in companies and later producing clones of the products. In 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/bezos-cant-guarantee-no-anti-competitive-activity-as-congress-catches-him-flat-footed/">CEO Jeff Bezos testified on this subject</a> in front of a congressional hearing where he couldn&#8217;t guarantee the company would end this process. Often the products Amazon copies come from small startups without the resources to fight a giant like Amazon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last month California-based <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbxWGjQ2szQ">Peak Design took to YouTube to protest Amazon&#8217;s unabashed copy of one of Peak&#8217;s top products</a>. As Peak points out, Amazon&#8217;s take is a cheap knockoff made from lower-quality materials and without Peak Design&#8217;s ethical manufacturing. The video quickly went viral, amassing over 4.5 million hits and highlighting Amazon&#8217;s shady practices.</p>
<p>For the latest Echo Buds, Amazon copied a market leader instead of a small startup. To recap, Amazon, a company worth over a trillion dollars, just released a product that looks essentially identical to a top-selling product from Apple, a company worth 2 trillion dollars.</p>
<p>The Echo Buds are much less expensive than Apple&#8217;s $250 AirPod Pros, too. The standard Echo Buds costs $100, and the version with wireless charging runs $120. It&#8217;s important to note the wireless buds themselves do not look like AirPods. Amazon only copied the ubiquitous AirPod Pro case.</p>
<p>The consumer is the loser here. With more resources than many countries, Amazon can produce world-class products, yet it decided to copy a rival&#8217;s market-leading product. In the end, it&#8217;s easier (and cheaper) to follow trends than become a trendsetter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://meati.com/">Meati</a>, a company turning mycelium (the structural fibers of fungi) into healthier meat replacements for consumers, is prepping for a big summer rollout.</p>
<p>Co-founder Tyler Huggins expects to have the first samples of its whole-cut steak and chicken products in select restaurants around the country &#8212; along with their first commercial product, a jerky strip.</p>
<p>For Huggins, the product launch is another step on a long road toward broad commercial adoption of functional fungi foods as a better-for-you alternative to traditional meats.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Use this as a conversation starter. About 2 ounces of this gives you 50% of your protein; 50% of your fiber; and half of your daily zinc. There really is nothing that can compare to this product in terms of nutritionals,&#8221; Huggins said. </span></p>
<p>And moving from meat to mushrooms is a better option for the planet.</p>
<p>Meati expects to turn on its pilot plant this summer and is joining a movement among mushroom fans that includes milk replacements, from <a href="https://perfectdayfoods.com/">Perfect Day</a>, more meat replacements from <a href="https://www.atlastfood.co/">Atlast</a>, and leather substitutes from <a href="https://ecovativedesign.com/mycoflex">Ecovative</a> and <a href="https://www.mycoworks.com/">MycoWorks</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re definitely all in this together,&#8221; said Huggins of the other mob of mycelium-based tech companies bringing products to market.</p>
<p>However, not all mycelium is created equally, Huggins said. Meati has what Huggins said was a unique way of growing its funguses (not a real word) that &#8220;keep it in its most happy state.&#8221; That means peak nutritional content and peak growth efficiency, according to the company.</p>
<p>For Huggins, whose parents own a bison ranch and who grew up in cattle country, the goal is not to replace a T-bone or a rib-eye, but the cuts of meat and chicken that find their ways into a burrito supreme or other quick-serve meat cuts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2138406" style="width: 426px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2138406" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2138406" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meati_Summer_2020-43.jpg" alt="" width="416" height="624" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meati_Summer_2020-43.jpg 3689w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meati_Summer_2020-43.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meati_Summer_2020-43.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meati_Summer_2020-43.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meati_Summer_2020-43.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meati_Summer_2020-43.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meati_Summer_2020-43.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meati_Summer_2020-43.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2138406" class="wp-caption-text">Rendering of Meati mushroom meats in a Banh Mi. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Meati</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Head to head with that kind of cut, we win,&#8221; Huggins said. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather pick a fight there now and buy ourselves some time. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to go super high end to start.&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, the company&#8217;s cap table of investors already includes some pretty heady culinary company. <a href="http://acre.vc/#company-info-full">Acre Venture Partners</a> (which counts Sam Kass &#8212; President Barack Obama&#8217;s senior policy advisor for nutrition policy, executive director for First Lady Michelle Obama&#8217;s Let&#8217;s Move! campaign, and an assistant chef in the White House &#8212; among its partnership) is an investor. So is Chicago&#8217;s fine dining temple, Alinea.</p>
<p>But Huggins wants Meati to be an everyday type of meat replacement product. &#8220;I want to make sure that people think this is an everyday protein,&#8221; Huggins said.</p>
<p>Meati thinks its future meat replacements will be cost competitive with conventional beef and chicken, but to whet consumers&#8217; appetites, the company is starting with jerky.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Meati’s delicious jerky,&#8221; said Huggins. &#8220;It provides this blank canvas. We’ll start with these beef-jerky-like flavors. But I want to come out of the gate and say that we’re mycelium jerky.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The company currently has 30 people on staff led by Huggins and co-founder Justin Whiteley. The two men initially started working on Meati as a battery replacement. Based on their research (Huggins with mycelium and Whiteley with advanced batteries) the two men received a grant for a mycelium-based electrode for lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were trying to tweak the chemical composition of the mycelium to make a better battery. What we found was that we were making something nutritious and edible,&#8221; said Huggins.</p>
<p>Also … the battery companies didn&#8217;t want it.</p>
<p>Now, backed by $28 million from Acre, Prelude Ventures, Congruent Ventures and Tao Capital, Meati is ready to go to market. The company also has access to debt capital to build out its vast network of mycelium growing facilities. It&#8217;s just raised a $18 million debt round from Trinity and Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Two years ago … most companies in this space … there wasn’t this ability to take on debt to put steel in the ground,&#8221; said Huggins. &#8220;It’s an exciting time to be in food tech given that you can raise VC funding and there’s this ready available market for debt financing. You’ll start seeing faster and more rapid development because of it.&#8221;</span></p>
