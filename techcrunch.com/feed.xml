										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, Clubhouse is rolling out Wave, a feature that makes it easier to start private rooms with friends when you see that they&#8217;re online. Available globally on iOS and Android, Wave will replace starting a private room with friends. You can wave at multiple people at once, so long as they follow you, and anyone who accepts will join your private room as a speaker.</p>
<p>To send a wave, navigate to the Hallway by swiping right or tapping the dots icon on the bottom left of the screen. Then, tap the wave button next to the names of the people you want to chat with. Those people will get a notification that you invited them to a room &#8212; if they deny the request, you won&#8217;t know. If they accept, they can be added to a private room with you and anyone else who accepted your invitation.</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re waiting for friends to connect with you, you can still browse around the app and join other rooms &#8212; you&#8217;ll be notified when someone joins your private room from your Wave. While you browse, a small Wave bar will appear on the screen, making it easier to cancel your Wave if you become engrossed in another conversation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207508" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207508" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207508" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03_tap-for-hello.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207508" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clubhouse</p></div></p>
<p>These private rooms can still be reported to Clubhouse if someone is breaking the rules. Clubhouse told TechCrunch that if someone waves to people that have blocked each other, then the first person to join will have access, but the next person won&#8217;t be allowed in, since a user in the room has them blocked.</p>
<p>The feature will start rolling out today, but users need to have the latest version of Clubhouse downloaded to gain access. Wave was <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1438931407322042369">first spotted</a> by app researcher Jane Manchun Wong last week &#8212; Clubhouse <a href="https://twitter.com/Clubhouse/status/1439638356334452741">played along</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207509" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207509" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207509" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05_room.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207509" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clubhouse</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though Clubhouse said in a blog post that more than 700,000 rooms are created on the app each day, the pressure is on the startup to compete with more established companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Spotify</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a>, which have invested in their own live audio products.</p>
<p>Clubhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/clubhouse-android-app-launch/">launched for Android</a> in May and came <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/clubhouse-invite-open-to-everyone-exits-beta/">out of beta</a> in July &#8212; but according to estimates from app analytics firm SensorTower, Clubhouse only saw about 1.7 million global installs last month, down 35% month-over-month from about 2.6 million in July. Its best month on record was in February, when it gained 9.6 million downloads. To date, SensorTower estimates that Clubhouse has been downloaded 32.2 million times.</p>
<p>Clubhouse has recently unveiled upgrades like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/clubhouse-dms-backchannel/">Backchannel</a>, a messaging feature, and support for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/29/clubhouse-spatial-audio/">spatial audio</a>, which offers a more life-like experience of being in a room full of people. But the app still doesn&#8217;t have live captioning, making it inaccessible to users who are Deaf or hard of hearing. Facebook Live Audio Rooms and Twitter Spaces already support this feature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;The pandemic made it visible that there was a missing piece in the customer journey: video chat,&#8221; says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-moya-b9b52b66/">Fernando Moya</a>, CEO of early-stage Chilean startup <a href="https://ocularsolution.com/">Ocular Solution</a>.</p>
<p>According to Moya, COVID-19 made it obvious that live chat and chatbots were not enough, as people were still hoping to interact face-to-face with customer agents – just like they do offline.</p>
<p>This is what Ocular Solution, which participated in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/">Startup Alley</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt, is hoping to solve in the digital world, with a platform that helps clients add a video chat element to their site and integrate it with their existing tools, from HubSpot to Pipedrive.</p>
<p>Video chat can come in handy for customer support, but also for onboarding and sales. The latter is especially true if the service is a good fit for consultative selling, in which the end user is hoping to get questions answered before proceeding.</p>
<p>This desire to talk to a real person explains why Moya sees video chat as an efficient way to reduce cart abandonment rate – a major issue for e-commerce. Aggregating data from 44 studies, UX research institute Baymard <a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate">estimated</a> the average documented online shopping cart abandonment rate to near 70 percent.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for site visitors not to turn into customers, but Ocular found out that offering video chat can help boost conversions. The startup&#8217;s customers boast an average service-related net promoter score of 8, Moya told TechCrunch, with conversion rates starting at 15 percent and peaking at 250 percent during Chile&#8217;s e-commerce promotion event <a href="https://www.cyber.cl/index.html#information/preguntas-frecuentes">CyberDay</a>.</p>
<p>Ocular launched in Chile, where Moya had previously co-founded another company, <a href="https://www.wingsoft.com/">Wingsoft</a>, which Ocular spun out of. But the startup is already looking beyond borders: It plans to keep its team remote, albeit with small hybrid hubs; and it already has clients in other Latin American countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Latin America&#8217;s e-commerce <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/chart/247777/digital-buyer-penetration-worldwide-by-region-2021-of-internet-users">hasn&#8217;t reached the same penetration levels </a>than in North America and Western Europe, but <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/news/business/argentina-was-the-country-where-e-commerce-grew-the-most-in-2020/">sales are increasing at a faster pace than in other regions</a>. These new online consumers are arguably more likely to look for an experience that is more similar to in-person shopping. &#8220;The quantity of people requiring video assistance is growing very fast,&#8221; Moya said.</p>
<p>Customer satisfaction and sales aside, Ocular is also hoping to help its clients improve their internal processes. As a result, it provides companies with data to help them track key metrics related to customer service, while helping attendants do their job. &#8220;We train your agents so that they deliver the best service experience and can get the most out of the tools,&#8221; its site explains.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that agents play a key role in the use of our technology; they humanize this new customer service channel,&#8221; Moya said. &#8220;Therefore, our efforts are focused on generating tools that allow them to improve day by day, that motivate them, and generate profits as the result of them performing well, within an entertaining and challenging environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moya expects more people to want to become video chat attendants, and predicts an upcoming &#8216;uberization&#8217; of this segment. This could help answer growing demand for these services: &#8220;Use cases for video support are varied, and new ways of applying it are appearing every day.&#8221;</p>

It includes a bunch of intriguing features, such as audible directions, remote kill and an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) sensor.</p>
<p>You can play your own music or podcasts using the built-in Bluetooth speaker and hear turn-by-turn directions to help you get where you&#8217;re going. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-28-unagi-electric-scooter.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><ins>Unagi</ins></a>teamed up with Google to bring the navigation feature to its iOS and Android app. After you&#8217;ve selected your destination and put your phone away, you&#8217;ll hear direction prompts through the audio system and see directional signals on the display.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-09%2Fecce1450-1c76-11ec-a97f-d8b5fd430fd6&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=805b73035861f7418e3bef023175fa8dc04f6665" alt="Unagi Model Eleven smart scooter" data-uuid="d29c9afb-2869-33db-893f-5120d7922fef" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Unagi Scooters</div>
</figure>
<p>On the security end, there&#8217;s a motion sensor alarm to deter potential thieves, as well as GPS tracking. You&#8217;ll be able to kill a stolen scooter remotely from within the app.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Model Eleven&#8217;s most eye-catching feature is that ADAS sensor in the higher-end version. Unagi says the scooter can tell the difference between people, stop signs, stoplights, cars and other objects. It can warn you of a potential collision through both the audio system and the touchscreen display.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-09%2F32f3fee0-1c77-11ec-bc5d-9084a73ae74d&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=da9f40969a21546b8f28687b390a0a5d02c47bc5" alt="Unagi Model Eleven smart scooter" data-uuid="0e4f320c-5337-331f-9a10-25e86b84f098" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Unagi Scooters</div>
</figure>
<p>Unagi enlisted industrial designer Yves Béhar to help create the Model Eleven, which it says is the lightest, full suspension scooter on the market in part thanks to its use of long carbon fiber. The foldable scooter features Unagi&#8217;s existing dual motor system, a swappable battery system and what the company claims are puncture-proof tires you can easily change when needed.</p>
<p>The standard Model Eleven costs $2,440. For the ASAS model, you&#8217;ll need to fork over $2,860. Unagi is initially offering pre-orders through an <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/unagi-model-eleven-the-smartest-scooter-on-earth" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><ins>Indiegogo campaign</ins></a>, but with the likes of Best Buy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-buy-starts-selling-e-bikes-electric-scooters-171330423.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><ins>now selling the company&#8217;s scooters</ins></a>, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to see the Model Eleven at retailers in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When founder Somdip Dey was a computer science masters student at the University of Manchester, his parents got in a terrible car accident. He sent all of his money back to his parents in India to help with their medical bills, but then he faced a problem familiar to too many: If he wasn&#8217;t going to get paid for another week, how was he supposed to feed himself?</p>
<p>&#8220;Luckily, this happened around when the summer holiday started, so a lot of students were moving out and literally throwing away unopened food,&#8221; Dey remembered. &#8220;I realized that there&#8217;s too much waste that could be used by other people who might need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>This helped him stay fed in a time of crisis, but as an AI researcher, he started to think about how technology could help reduce food waste and get hungry people fed. As Dey finished his masters and moved on to pursue a PhD at the University of Essex, he developed a company called <a href="https://nosh.tech/">Nosh Technologies</a> alongside co-founder Suman Saha.</p>
<p>With almost 13,000 users across Android and iOS, the Nosh app helps users log their groceries&#8217; expiration dates to remind them to use what they bought before it goes bad.</p>
<p>Using AI, the app learns about user&#8217;s consumption and waste habits, producing weekly analytics that help the user reduce their waste and save money at the grocery store. The app can scan barcodes and even grocery receipts directly into the app, but users can also input data manually. Then, once the contents of a user&#8217;s pantry and fridge are loaded into the app, they can search for existing recipes online that will help them use up their stock before it goes to waste.</p>
<p>In the future, Dey wants to offer a premium subscription, which would include access to an AI that would generate new, personalized recipes based on what food you have at home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our current users reported that using the app, they ended up saving almost 40 to 50 pounds every month, which they might have wasted,&#8221; Dey told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/">Startup Alley</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt, Nosh is unveiling its newest features, which fall more in line with Dey&#8217;s original inspiration for the company. These include <a href="https://noshdaily.com/">Nosh Daily</a>, a companion blog to the app, and Nosh Shop, which allows restaurants to sell food that might go bad soon at a discounted rate.</p>
<p>By charging a 10% service charge, the startup can begin earning some money &#8212; right now, it has only raised £33,000 in pre-seed money and has nine employees. From that service charge, Dey says about 3% will be donated to charities combatting food waste.</p>
<p>To Good To Go, also based in Europe, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/too-good-to-go-raises-31-million-to-fight-food-waste/">raised $31.1 million</a> to achieve the same goal as Nosh Shop. But Dey says that Nosh differentiates itself by allowing restaurants to sell their food at a higher price than To Good To Go. This would motivate more restaurants to use their app (and in return, reduce food waste) since they can turn a better profit. To Good To Go sells food at one-third its original price, but Nosh Shop would allow restaurants to price their soon-to-be-spoiled meals at up to 70% of the original price.</p>
<p>While this might help restaurants, it&#8217;s up to consumers to decide if they&#8217;ll pay for that food at less of a discount. To start, Nosh Shop will roll out locally in selected places in the U.K.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter&#8217;s slate of new product announcements is not slowing down. The company today introduced a number of new initiatives aimed at better serving the conversations and community using its platform, including support for tipping with crypto, NFT authentication, and plans for other experiments designed to provide more context about a conversation to those just joining in. The company also said it&#8217;s preparing to launch its own creator fund in a few weeks to provide audio creators with access to financial, technical, and marketing support.</p>
<p>While Twitter was not yet ready to details specifics like the fund size or expected reach, in terms of creator participants, it&#8217;s a clear shot across the bow of a top competitor in social audio, Clubhouse, whose own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/clubhouse-promises-its-accelerator-participants-either-brand-deals-or-5k-per-month-during-the-program/">creator &#8220;accelerator&#8221;</a> offered to connect its participants with brand deals or $5,000 per month during their participation in its program.</p>
<p>Similarly, Twitter views its creator fund as one not aimed at rewarding creators for the content they produce &#8212; like some rival funds running across Facebook, Instagram, Snap, and elsewhere &#8212; but rather at helping creators get started with audio productions on Twitter Spaces.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2207551" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spaces-Recording-and-Replay.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spaces-Recording-and-Replay.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spaces-Recording-and-Replay.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spaces-Recording-and-Replay.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spaces-Recording-and-Replay.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spaces-Recording-and-Replay.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spaces-Recording-and-Replay.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spaces-Recording-and-Replay.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;The goal of it really is to provide that technical and marketing expertise,&#8221; noted Twitter Product Lead for Creator Monetization, Esther Crawford. &#8220;We think of it as kind of a stopgap solution. We want to onboard these folks into other long-term monetization features. But we want to give them an initial boost,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Spaces hosts will also be able to record and replay their programs &#8212; a move likely meant to counteract the threat of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/callin-david-sacks-social-podcasting-app-launches-and-announces-a-12m-series-a-round/">competitive platforms</a> which tout recording as a key differentiator. This will launch in a &#8220;few months,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Twitter also today announced a few new products and expansions to recently launched features.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One of these is a new feature that would allow its app to better serve creators working with NFTs, or non-fungible tokens &#8212; a way to certify digital assets, stored on the blockchain. Artists are now creating NFTs of their work which are sold across NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation, SuperRare, and others.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2207555" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Twitter-NFTs.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Twitter-NFTs.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Twitter-NFTs.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Twitter-NFTs.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Twitter-NFTs.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Twitter-NFTs.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Twitter-NFTs.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Twitter-NFTs.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Twitter says it&#8217;s planning to &#8220;soon&#8221; explore support for NFT authentication. This would allow NFT creators to connect their crypto wallets to Twitter, in order to track and showcase their NFTs on the platform. This particular plan is still in the early stages as Twitter couldn&#8217;t yet articulate how this would work. The company said it was testing different ideas for making creators with authenticated collections stand out more visually somehow &#8212; perhaps with something like a profile badge or differently-shaped avatar.</p>
<p>When pressed for further details on its broader NFT roadmap, Twitter declined to comment.</p>
<p>Another new feature in the crypto space is support for Bitcoin tipping. Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">first introduced its &#8220;Tip Jar&#8221; feature</a> in May as a beta product, allowing users to send and receive one-time payments via third-party services like PayPal, Venmo, Patreon, Cash App, Bandcamp, and others. Now the feature will expand to global audiences on iOS with Android coming soon, and will add support for tipping with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>There will be a couple of ways Bitcoin tips can work. Users will be able to add a Bitcoin Lightning wallet or their Bitcoin address in order to start receiving Bitcoin tips. Lightning wallets are popular among users in the crypto community due to their lower transaction fees, the company said. Twitter&#8217;s implementation of this uses <a href="https://strike.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://strike.me/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1632501355086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcAeEdW3knDeLYNiCctYM9QiUfng">Strike,</a> a payments application built on the Bitcoin Lightning Network that allows people to send and receive Bitcoin free and instantly, it said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2207561" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-1.01.34-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="311" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-1.01.34-PM.jpg 1248w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-1.01.34-PM.jpg?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-1.01.34-PM.jpg?resize=300,137 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-1.01.34-PM.jpg?resize=768,351 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-1.01.34-PM.jpg?resize=680,311 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-1.01.34-PM.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>In fact, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey this summer <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1403172297586925572">tweeted</a> that it was &#8220;only a matter of time&#8221; before Twitter built in support for the Lightning Network, a layer atop the Bitcoin blockchain, into its platform. At the time, there was some <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/11/jack-dorsey-suggests-twitter-likely-to-integrate-lightning-network/">speculation</a> that users would first see this sort of support in a micropayments product, which has now been proven correct.</p>
<p>The Tip Jar will also add a couple other services as well, including GoFundMe and Brazilian mobile payments service PicPay.</p>
<p>Another new experiment called &#8220;Heads Up&#8221; (for the time being), is the first that will help to give users a sense of a conversation&#8217;s vibe before they wade in.</p>
<p>One of Twitter&#8217;s thorniest issues is its inability to help people feel safe sharing their thoughts and opinions on its network, which has served as a breeding ground for cancel culture, and where armies of trolls can descend on marginalized voices or others they disagree with at any time &#8212; like activists, women in tech (as was made famous with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_(harassment_campaign)">Gamergate</a> scandal), or female journalists.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2207553" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heads-Up-1.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heads-Up-1.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heads-Up-1.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heads-Up-1.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heads-Up-1.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heads-Up-1.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heads-Up-1.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heads-Up-1.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>In this area, Twitter has worked to create new features like those that enable users to limit who can reply to their tweets, which it says has contributed to a decline in abuse reports over the past four weeks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-safety-mode-harassment/">launched Safety Mode into beta</a>, which offers a sort of automated level of protection against harassment during a time of heightened abuse. It created a way for people to quietly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-tests-a-safety-feature-on-web-to-remove-followers-without-blocking-them/">remove followers</a> as an alternative blocking. And today, Twitter says it will soon launch a new feature that will allow users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/twitter-is-eyeing-new-anti-abuse-tools-to-give-users-more-control-over-mentions/">remove themselves from a conversation</a> they&#8217;re mentioned in and is experimenting with a new feature called &#8220;word filters&#8221; that would let users stop abusive tweets that don&#8217;t cross the line into being against Twitter policy.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2207554" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Word-Filters.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Word-Filters.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Word-Filters.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Word-Filters.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Word-Filters.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Word-Filters.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Word-Filters.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Word-Filters.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Twitter didn&#8217;t fully explain how it will measure a conversation&#8217;s vibe in the coming &#8220;Heads Up&#8221; feature, in order to warn newcomers about the nature of the discussion. But said it was considering leveraging data from its emoji reactions (which are only now in testing) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/twitter-rolls-out-improved-reply-prompts-to-cut-down-on-harmful-tweets/">reply prompts</a>, which warn users when they&#8217;re about to post something potentially offensive.</p>
<p>The company has been launching new products at an incredibly fast clip in recent months, with additions that have included a rapidly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">improved</a> Twitter Spaces audio chat platform, the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-communities/">interest-based &#8220;Communities</a>,&#8221; creator platform <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-super-follows">Super Follows</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/twitter-is-already-working-on-integrating-newsletters-on-its-site-following-revue-acquisition/">newsletters</a> via its acquisition of Revue, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">tipping</a>, a premium subscription service called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/twitter-blue-a-3-monthly-subscription-service-could-be-coming-soon/">Twitter Blue</a>, crowdsourced fact-checking with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/twitter-starts-rolling-out-birdwatch-fact-checks-inside-tweets/">Birdwatch</a>, new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/twitter-tests-new-e-commerce-features-for-tweets/">e-commerce</a> features, new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/twitter-to-revamp-user-profiles-with-about-tab-support-for-pronouns-confirmed-status-and-more/">profiles</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/twitter-introduces-a-new-label-that-allows-the-good-bots-to-identify-themselves/">labels</a>, a reopened account <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/twitter-re-opens-its-account-verification-process-after-another-pause/">verification</a> system, conversation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/twitter-change-who-can-reply/">controls</a>, Direct Message <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/twitter-rolls-out-a-series-of-improvements-to-its-direct-message-system/">improvements</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Today, it offered a few updates on a handful of these products.</p>
<p>It said it&#8217;s working on more Spaces discovery tools that would make it easier to find Spaces at the top of the timeline, and elsewhere in the app &#8212; a likely reference to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-redesigns-its-mobile-app-to-make-spaces-the-center-tab/">dedicated Spaces tab on mobile</a>. It&#8217;s also expanding access to Ticketed Spaces, improving the discovery of newsletters, launching a new creator earnings dashboard, and working on more account labels &#8212; like those brands and those that would help memorialize the accounts of the deceased &#8212; among other things.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2207556" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dashboard.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dashboard.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dashboard.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dashboard.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dashboard.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dashboard.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dashboard.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dashboard.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Twitter noted, too, how it plans to handle moderation within its Communites feature, saying that these interest-based destinations would have their own moderators and norms specific to that community, above and beyond the <span class="il">Twitter</span> Rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our first step into decentralizing moderation, so that your Twitter is your space,&#8221; explained Twitter&#8217;s Product Lead for Conversational Safety, Christine Su, adding that Communities would open up to more people &#8220;soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>More broadly, Twitter attempted to explain its strategy, which is increasingly looking like &#8220;throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks.&#8221; In fact, it admitted &#8212; to some extent &#8212;  it may be doing just that.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll keep seeing us push towards this vision through experimentation and iteration,&#8221; explained Twitter Head of Consumer Product, Kayvon Beykpour. &#8220;You&#8217;ll see us share our progress publicly along the way, as we have over the last few years. And you won&#8217;t see us stay tied to the things that aren&#8217;t working. We&#8217;ve done that with Fleets and you&#8217;ll continue to see that with other explorations we test out. We believe that if we&#8217;re not winding things down every once in a while, then we&#8217;re not taking big enough bets,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s announcements were detailed this morning at a press briefing and Q&amp;A session, ahead of the publication of some of its <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/bringing-tips-to-everyone">news</a> to its corporate blog.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A host of features are being added to Google&#8217;s Android Auto experience, and the company&#8217;s Automotive OS will come to more cars including, for the first time, Honda vehicles from 2022 onwards.</p>
<p>Google introduced its Android Auto app in 2015, enabling drivers to run a tethered connection between their smartphone and their vehicle’s stereo system to play music from the device, have Maps’ turn-by-turn directions be read aloud, and take calls through the sound system. In the six years since, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-auto-google-maps-ui-right-hand-drive-cars-181544539.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">both Android Auto</a> and the infotainment systems they operate on have gotten a whole lot smarter. On Thursday, Google announced that it will be rolling out even more features and capabilities to drivers, whether they run Android Auto on their phones or directly through their cars.</p>
<div id="max-player-injector" class="vmmi-si" data-maxi="0">
<div class="vdb_player">
<div><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While Android Auto has been designed to minimize distractions to the driver when on the road, initially connecting the phone to the infotainment or stereo system has to date been a whole thing. You’d have to make sure the Bluetooth radio was live on your phone, then cajole the vehicle into recognizing and pairing with the device, then remember the myriad various oral commands to incite Android Auto into doing what you actually wanted it to. But no longer! Drivers will soon be able to effectively automate the tethering process just by saying “Hey Google, let’s drive.” </span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>What’s more, Google has redesigned the Auto UI to enable access to a bevy of content sources including Amazon Music, Audible, iHeartRadio, JioSaavn, Pandora, Podcast Addict, SoundCloud, and YouTube Music with one-tap accessibility as well as have the system read incoming text messages aloud and allow the driver to respond by voice. Expect to see these new features arrive over the next few weeks in English-speaking markets as well as Germany, Spain, Mexico, France and Italy.</p>
<p>And for international travelers using dual-SIM phones, Android Auto will allow you to establish separate Work and Personal profiles and have their relevant contact lists and calendar appointments display, depending on when and why they’re behind the wheel.</p>
<p>For vehicles with in-car displays, Android Auto (the mirroring version, not what you’d find on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">Polestar 2</a> or the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvos-c-40-recharge-knocks-the-ass-off-its-xc-40-predecessor-and-we-love-them-for-it-163057786.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">XC40 Recharge</a>) will soon boast a few new features, such as games. Google is partnering with GameSnacks to offer drivers quick and fun diversions to play while the vehicle is parked. Finally, an end to doom-scrolling while sitting in public charging lots. Conversely, Google is making paying for gas less interactive. Just say “Hey Google, pay for gas” to have the vehicle’s infotainment system complete a contactless payment with Google Pay. You do have to select the fuel grade and, you know, actually pump the gas but, still. The feature will be available at Exxon and Mobil gas stations to start with support for Shell, Conoco, Phillips 66 and 76 stations coming soon.</p>
<p>As for the integrated Android Automotive OS (like what you’d find in select Ford, GM, and Volvo vehicles), get ready to see it in a whole bunch of new makes and models. Google announced on Thursday that its latest partner is Honda, which will begin producing vehicles with built-in AAOS come the 2022 model year, and will soon be available in both the Chevy Silverado and the Renault Mégane E-Tech.</p>

They&#8217;re designed to be carried around by the wind and could be used in numerous applications including disease and air pollution tracking, according to a paper published by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03847-y.epdf?sharing_token=H_ir9bfrqhQ2lsW0udPg7tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NHZkfDUEKmhjTX15axDSP-EqNRoRAgjNvE6EgxUSns1ObKU5SUSYUOHSWqZ9JANy9Q6W9_XUSRUaunfaoZagd0JEEDFEcyG2SX3x8NHC-DnDrqqnfXavjw1lkDTh94pHLKNh-JhwCeItdJXrbLXUTKVw1qqCBB4z7eIWvQjUOatQ%3D%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.vice.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em>Nature</em></a>. At the same time, they could be made from biodegradable materials to prevent environmental contamination.</p>
<p>The design of the flyers was inspired by spinning seeds from cottonwood and other trees. Those fall slowly by spinning like helicopters so they can be picked up by the wind and spread a long distance from the tree, increasing the range of the species.</p>
<p>The team from Northwest University ran with that idea but made it better, and smaller. &#8220;We think we&#8217;ve beaten biology&#8230; we&#8217;ve been able to build structures that fall in a more stable trajectory at slower terminal velocities than equivalent seeds,&#8221; said lead Professor John A. Rogers. &#8220;The other thing&#8230; was that we were able to make these helicopter flyer structures that are much smaller than seeds you would see in the natural world.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3me68t6Kh0I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>They&#8217;re not so small that the aerodynamics starts to break down, though. &#8220;All of the advantages of the helicopter design begin to disappear below a certain length scale, so we pushed it all the way, as far as you can go or as physics would allow,&#8221; Rogers told <em>Vice</em>. &#8220;Below that size scale, everything looks and falls like a sphere.&#8221;</p>
<p>The devices are also large enough to carry electronics, sensors and power sources. The team tested multiple versions that could carry payloads like antenna so that they could wireless communicate with a smartphone or each other. Other sensors could monitor things like air acidity, water quality and solar radiation.</p>
<p>The flyers are still concepts right now and not ready to deploy into the atmosphere, but the team plans to expand their findings with different designs. Key to that is the use of biodegradable materials so they wouldn&#8217;t persist in the environment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t think about these devices&#8230; as a permanent monitoring componentry but rather temporary ones that are addressing a particular need that’s of finite time duration,&#8221; Rogers said. “That&#8217;s the way that we&#8217;re envisioning things currently: you monitor for a month and then the devices die out, dissolve, and disappear, and maybe you have to redeploy them.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lot has changed for <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo.</a> The language learning company launched nearly a decade ago on the Disrupt stage with no monetization plans. Today, that scrappy app has matured into a well-known consumer brand and a business that makes a ton of money. This growth fueled the startup’s recent decision to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/31/5-lessons-from-duolingos-bellwether-edtech-ipo-of-the-year/"> go public</a>, which is rare for a consumer edtech company.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder<a href="https://twitter.com/luisvonahn?lang=en"> Luis von Ahn</a> returned to TechCrunch Disrupt this year to explain how the sophistication of public markets impacts the company&#8217;s strategy. Armed with fresh capital from the IPO and attention from the public markets, Duolingo is drawing its line on what’s next and what’s never going to be on its roadmap.</p>
<p>Part of becoming a listed company is opening yourself up to critique from the public markets, which are full of investors rooting for viable businesses that know how to make money and appreciate in value. But what happens if optimizing for money isn’t what a company wants to do?</p>
<p>Duolingo’s early days were defined by an allergy to monetization because its mission was to scale free education. When the company eventually introduced monetization through subscriptions, it didn’t paywall any learning content. Instead, its subscription product is built around enhancing the user experience — from avoiding advertisements altogether to allowing for unlimited mistakes. Today, about 95% of Duolingo’s users consume the product for free.</p>
<p>Von Ahn defended the idea that Duolingo may be tempted to begin paywalling learning features for its subscription service now that it&#8217;s in the eye of retail investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Audio startup <a href="https://syngspace.com/">Syng</a> has been building on quite a bit more hype than the average fresh hardware startup, largely because of the team behind it. Founder and CEO Chris Stringer was Jony Ive&#8217;s first hire at Apple and worked at the company for 21 years. In an interview, Stringer referred to the first time he heard stereo audio was &#8220;the most impressive product demo ever,&#8221; and that his company is looking to build on that wonder by building &#8220;triphonic&#8221; audio hardware that can transform the home-listening experience with spatial audio.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about transforming the stage from that stage/audience static experience that&#8217;s essentially just an image on the wall, to actually making the stage the square footage of your home,&#8221; Stringer tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Syng has closed a $48.75 million &#8220;combined&#8221; Series A from investors led by Palo Alto-based Eclipse Ventures, the startup tells TechCrunch. Other investors include Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger, Lionel Richie, and Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia. The company has now raised $50 million to date to build out an audio hardware startup with a hefty focus on design and advanced tech.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s hardware relies on computational audio technology similar to tech that consumers have seen in products like the HomePod, which allows speakers to adjust to the spaces that they&#8217;re in. But Syng&#8217;s products are designed for spatial audio first-and-foremost. The company&#8217;s first product &#8212; the Syng Cell Alpha &#8212; is a high-end $1,799 speaker that looks like it belongs in a mid-century modern spaceship. The Apple design ethos is strong in the product which channels a bit of the Jony Ive-designed Harman Kardon SoundSticks, inside a package that Stringer says is meant to be treated more like a piece of furniture than the brutalistic tower speakers that currently carve out the ultra high-end of audio.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t gotten a chance to listen to the hardware myself, so I&#8217;ll reserve any judgments there, but while $1,799 is certainly quite pricey for a single speaker, it&#8217;s also clear that most users will not be getting the most out of the tech by buying just one. The Cell Alpha speakers are meant to interact with each other, taking in feedback while creating a dynamic soundstage for users. A big selling point of this auto-adjustment is less rigid speaker placement and the ability to let your design interests dictate where speakers are placed more than a room&#8217;s natural acoustics. This is likely only true up to a certain point, obviously, but Stringer hopes that this leads to fewer audio systems fixated around a giant TV on the wall and more people really enjoying music in their homes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207506" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207506" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207506 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cell_Alpha_Table_recordplayer.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cell_Alpha_Table_recordplayer.jpg 6570w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cell_Alpha_Table_recordplayer.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cell_Alpha_Table_recordplayer.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cell_Alpha_Table_recordplayer.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cell_Alpha_Table_recordplayer.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cell_Alpha_Table_recordplayer.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cell_Alpha_Table_recordplayer.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cell_Alpha_Table_recordplayer.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207506" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Syng</p></div></p>
<p>The company currently supports up to 4 speakers in a single room. The Cell Alpha only comes in a single variation at the moment, but Stringer hints at future products down the road in different price points and sizes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Getting an ultra-high-end audio setup in your home has typically meant hiring a contractor and creating a weave of complex speakers, cables, receivers, amps and universal remotes that can be an awful lot for anyone to handle. Syng&#8217;s model brings a more Sonos-like approach, treating devices more like home objects than utilitarian objects to be disguised and hidden, into the mix.</p>
<p>Hardware is hard &#8212; as they say &#8212; and consumer audio can be an especially difficult place to play as a newcomer. Legacy is more important in internet-connected audio than most other realms of hardware, as people can often keep premium home audio products running for decades &#8212; or at least much longer than other tech devices. Betting on the reliability of a lifetime of firmware updates for a new startup can be a tricky bet for consumers, especially with a price tag like the Cell Alpha&#8217;s. Another challenge for the startup is that most users have scant options for playing spatial audio,  most music streaming services barely support it. As executive Chris Stringer notes, this likely won&#8217;t be the case for long as major players like Apple start pushing the technology more aggressively, but hardware startups and market timing have always had a complicated relationship.</p>
<p>Other investors in the startup include Bridford Group, SIP Global Partners, Renegade Partners, Animal Capital, Schusterman Family Investments, Vince Zampella and Alex Rigopolous.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Treasury is wading into the fight against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> by sanctioning virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> exchange Suex for its role in facilitating ransomware payments.</p>
<p>The sanctions are the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0364">first of its kind</a> against a cryptocurrency exchange, and prohibit Americans from doing business with the company.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest action as part of a U.S. government-wide effort to counter the rise of ransomware — including a cross-agency taskforce and a $10 million bounty for information on state-backed cybercriminals — that has so far seen mixed results. Just this week, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">BlackMatter ransomware group</a> demanded $5.9 million in ransom from a hacked Iowa farm services provider.</p>
<p>But experts believe that the Treasury’s action against Suex, and the U.S. government’s apparent decision to employ the age-old tactic of following the money rather than the criminals themselves, will come as a major blow to many of the biggest ransomware operators. While the sanctions won’t end ransomware attacks for good, dismantling the mechanisms for ransomware groups to cash out their cryptocurrency could be vital in slowing them down.</p>
<p>Chanalysis, which aided the U.S. in its investigation of Suex, has lauded the move as a “big win”, labeling the exchange as one of the worst-offenders of cryptocurrency-based money laundering. In <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/ofac-sanction-suex-september-2021">a blog post</a>, the blockchain analysis firm said Suex netted almost $13 million from ransomware operators like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/universal-health-services-ransomware/">Ryuk</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/maze-ransomware-group-shutting-down/">Maze</a> since the exchange was founded in 2018. Chanalysis also said the exchange took in more than $24 million from crypto scam operators.</p>

	</p>
<p>The Treasury said that over 40% of known Suex transactions were associated with bad activity.</p>
<p>Gurvais Grigg, Chainalysis’s global public sector and chief technology officer, believes the U.S. will continue to target exchanges, yet his analysis shows that illicit activity is largely concentrated to just a few services.</p>
<p>“A group of just five received 82% of all ransomware funds from 2020, based on our data at the time,” he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Paul Sibenik, lead case manager at blockchain forensics company CipherBlade, said the U.S. is likely to also go after lesser-known nested services and over-the-counter (OTC) brokers — where trading happens directly between two parties but utilizes a major exchange for liquidity. Suex, for example, uses the infrastructure of a larger exchange to handle its transactions.</p>
<p>“The usage of a rogue OTC like Suex can be an effective workaround so that an attacker need not have an account at the applicable exchange, but ultimately it&#8217;s fair to say that the exchange is still facilitating the transaction from the ransomware attacker,” Sibenik tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Exchanges have an obligation to monitor suspicious transactions going into applicable accounts, but it&#8217;s also critically important for exchanges to ensure that whatever rogue OTCs and nested services they do business with are compliant themselves,” said Sibenik. “Otherwise, there can absolutely be a threat of enforcement actions, and arguably legal liability as well.”</p>
<p>The Treasury’s latest sanctions — and the threat of more — will undoubtedly see ransomware actors change their tactics, just as some have done by shifting to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/">double extortion techniques</a>. Rather than just encrypting files, double extortion ransomware exfiltrates the data first and threatens to publish the files if the ransom isn&#8217;t paid.</p>
<p>Sibenek has already seen some threat actors moving from Bitcoin to Monero, which he describes as “untraceable in any meaningful and practical way.” Even this is less viable for ransomware groups moving to cash out, with many exchanges having delisted so-called privacy coins due to regulatory guidance.</p>
<p>“Cryptocurrency is only useful if you can buy and sell goods and services or cash out into fiat, and that is much more difficult with privacy coins,&#8221; Grigg says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Making smartphones more accessible is always a good idea, and Google&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/making-android-more-accessible">latest features</a> bring quick actions and navigation to people whose expressions are their primary means of interacting with the world. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.vision.switches">Project Activate</a> and <a href="http://g.co/cameraswitches">Camera Switches</a> let users perform tasks like speaking a custom phrase, or navigating using a switch interface, through facial gestures alone.</p>
<p>The new features rely on the smartphone&#8217;s front-facing camera, which can watch the user&#8217;s face in real time for one of six expressions: a smile, raised eyebrows, opened mouth, and looking left, right, or up. It relies entirely on local computing and no image data is saved, nor is it doing what is generally understood as &#8220;facial recognition&#8221; — this type of machine learning can focus specifically on, for example, identifying the eyebrows and sending a signal whenever they move past a certain, customizable threshold.</p>
<p>Each expression can be assigned a different role. Camera Switches integrates with Android&#8217;s existing switch compatibility, by which people who use assistive tech like a joystick or blow tube can navigate the phone&#8217;s OS. Now that can be done without any peripheral device at all, and users can pick various facial gestures for iterating through selections, confirming a choice, backing out, and so on.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206267" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206267" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2206267" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="550" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg 1772w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=768,412 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=680,365 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=1536,824 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2206267" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Using Project Activate, expressions can be tied to self-contained actions like speaking a phrase. Many people with disabilities rely on caretakers for a variety of reasons, but one thing you can&#8217;t ask a caretaker to do is get your caretaker&#8217;s attention! So one useful application might be assigning (say) an extended eyebrow raise to have the device speak the phrase &#8220;hey!&#8221; or &#8220;I need help with something,&#8221; or &#8220;thanks!&#8221;</p>
<p>The gestures can also be used to play an audio file, or text or call a predetermined number. More expressions and more capabilities are on the way, as well as more languages — of course faces don&#8217;t have languages, but the app and support documentation do, so Project Activate will start with English-speaking countries and move out from there. Camera Switches, on the other hand, will be available in 80 languages from the start.</p>
<p>Note that these can&#8217;t both be used at once, since they both require access to the camera and expression recognition thing. So users should make sure they have a backup method for navigation. Both should run on pretty much any Android phone from the last five years or so.</p>

<p>Lastly, an update to Google&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/googles-lookout-app-for-vision-impaired-now-scans-food-labels-and-long-documents/">Lookout</a> app, which reads labels for people with visual impairments, adds the ability to scan and read out handwritten content the way it can with printed things. That&#8217;s useful for sticky notes, &#8220;gone fishing&#8221; type signs on the doors of stores, and things like greeting cards with notes from the sender. The app has seen big increases in usage over the last year so they&#8217;re building it out. (Support for identifying euro and Indian rupee banknotes should help fuel that growth too.)</p>
<p>All the new stuff should be available later this week free of charge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla broke ground on its &#8220;Megafactory,&#8221; a new production facility in California, so christened because it will produce the company’s large-scale battery system Megapack.</p>
<p>News of the previously unannounced factory was confirmed by the Lathrop Mayor Sonny Dhaliwal, in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sonny.dhaliwal.5">Facebook post</a> that was deleted and re-posted. “We are proud to be the home of the Megafactory, Tesla’s most recent expansion here,” he said. “The future of green energy will be produced right here in our community.”</p>
<p>The factory, in the small northern California city of Lathrop, is near Tesla’s automotive plant in Fremont. Lathrop is also home to Tesla’s 870,000-square-foot distribution center.</p>
<p>Megapacks, as well as Tesla’s other energy storage products, were being manufactured at the electric automaker’s so-called &#8220;Gigafactory” in Sparks, Nevada. This is the first facility dedicated to the Megapack, though it’s unclear if production of Tesla&#8217;s other storage products – which include Powerwall and Powerpacks – will shift to the new factory.</p>
<p>The new factory is a positive signal for the automaker’s growing Energy division. As opposed to the Powerwall, which is a home consumer battery product, the Megapack is meant for utility-scale energy storage. Utilities building solar and wind farms are increasingly pairing these with large batteries to store excess energy to discharge to the grid later. Just last week, the Arizona electric utility Salt River Project brought online a 100 megawatt-hour Megapack project.</p>
<p>In a second-quarter earnings call in June, CEO Elon Musk confirmed that there was “significant unmet demand” for these storage products, adding that the Megapack was “basically sold out through next year.&#8221; He also estimated demand for Powerwall to be in excess of 1 million units per year.</p>
<p>Much of the bottleneck isn’t merely due to production capacity – Musk also told investors that cell supply and the global semiconductor shortage were creating production ceilings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We use a lot of the same chips in the Powerwall as you do in a car, so it&#8217;s like, which one do want to make?” he said. “Cars or Powerwalls? So we need to make cars, so that will &#8212; Powerwall production has been reduced.”</p>
<p>The chip shortage, however, seems to show no signs of abating; in fact, the White House on Thursday will be hosting its second summit with semiconductor manufacturers and purchasers to address the ongoing effects on the technology and auto industries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How’s this for a bit of regional synchronicity? This week, a pair of Chinese robotics firms secured $200 million rounds. It’s all part of a booming ecosystem that we get some insight into every so often. There are so many players in China’s robotics space it can be hard to keep track of some of the innovation over there, but these sorts of large funding rounds are a surefire way to make some waves.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is anticipated to be a major acceleration point for the country, on the tail of some major manufacturing shortages that brought the world’s supply chains to a standstill. But this week’s pair of big raises point toward an adoption of automation that moves beyond manufacturing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124338" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124338" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2124338" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6049932f64b5c.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124338" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hai Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>Hai Robotics grabbed the bigger headlines of the two with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/hai-robotics-picks-up-200m-for-its-warehouse-robot/">announcement of a joint Series C and D that amount to $200 million</a>. The company’s Shenzhen location puts it smack in the heart of China’s manufacturing zone, but the company’s specialty is warehouse/fulfillment robotics. It already has a decent-sized international footprint with deployment in 30 countries, including a recent deal with Booktopia, a large Australian online book retailer.</p>
<p>5Y Capital and Capital Today led the C and D, respectively. The rounds also featured Sequoia Capital China, Source Code Capital, VMS, Walden International and Scheme Capital. The funding will be used to further Hai’s international expansion and build out its existing presence in China.</p>

The round was led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, with participation from CICC ALPHA and Prosperity7 Ventures. The company specializes in service robots &#8212; not dissimilar from the sorts of robo-waiters we’ve seen from California-based Bear Robots. It’s a sizable industry on its own, though the company has already begun expanding its use cases, including hotels and hospitals.</p>

<p>Keenon says its robots have been deployed in the U.S., Europe, South Korea and Singapore, and the funding will go toward further expanding that footprint.</p>
<p>“We believe robotic solutions can have a profound impact across the services industry by assisting with repetitive, tedious workflows,” SoftBank’s Kentaro Matsui said in a release. “Using AI and machine learning, combined with advanced manufacturing capabilities, Keenon is building innovative robotics to help increase productivity for restaurants, hotels, and hospitals in China and globally.”</p>

<p>Newly flush with cash, Locus Robotics (which seems to make its way into this roundup more often than not), <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/locus-robotics-acquires-waypoint-robotics-301380031.html">has agreed to acquire Waypoint Robotics</a>. Waypoint more or less operates in the same warehouse category as Locus. Its flagship product is Vector, an autonomous omnidirectional robot capable of moving around up to a 300-pound payload.</p>
<p>&#8220;Locus is the proven leader in the development of highly productive and innovative AMR technology that efficiently solves our customers&#8217; needs for total warehouse optimization,&#8221; Locus CEO Rick Faulk said in a release. &#8220;As order fulfillment and labor shortages continue to grow around the world, the acquisition of Waypoint Robotics will accelerate our ability to meet these global needs in just months rather than years, helping us drive the digital transformation of the warehouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Locus announced a $150 million Series E in February and an additional $50 million this month. The company is clearly looking to build a robust fulfillment ecosystem it hopes can probably compete with Amazon’s offering.</p>

<p>The first fruits of Boston Dynamics’ acquisition by Hyundai <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/boston-dynamics-owner-hyundai-deploys-spot-for-factory-safety-monitoring/">are finally arriving</a>. The drably-named “Factory Safety Service Robot” is effectively a bespoke Spot robot designed to patrol factories, starting with a pilot at the Hyundai-owned Kia Plant in Seoul. The robot comes equipped with lidar and a thermal camera and can patrol the factory floor autonomously or be controlled remotely through a browser.</p>

<p>This week, Nvidia and Open Robotics announced a partnership that looks to be beneficial for both parties. Essentially, the agreement is designed to make Nvidia’s Jetson development platform and Open Robotics’ ROS 2 software work together. The deal is designed to speed up development time for roboticists using Nvidia’s perception technology.</p>
<p>“As more ROS developers leverage hardware platforms that contain additional compute capabilities designed to offload the host CPU, ROS is evolving to make it easier to efficiently take advantage of these advanced hardware resources,” Open Robotics CEO Brian Gerkey <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ai-perception-coming-to-ros-developers/">said in a release</a>. “Working with an accelerated computing leader like NVIDIA and its vast experience in AI and robotics innovation will bring significant benefits to the entire ROS community.”</p>

<p>And hey, happy Disrupt week! Shout-out to RoboDeck, the deck maintenance robot. The company is competing in this week’s Startup Battlefield with a product they assure us is more than just “Roomba, but for resealing your deck” (to quote Greg’s piece). The system applies sealant and uses built-in mapping technology to determine the edges of the surface to avoid falling off.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2201759" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2201759" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2201759" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RoboDeck.jpg" alt="Picture of a RoboDeck device designed to keep your house's deck looking good" width="1024" height="596" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RoboDeck.jpg 1072w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RoboDeck.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RoboDeck.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RoboDeck.jpg?resize=768,447 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RoboDeck.jpg?resize=680,396 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RoboDeck.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2201759" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> RoboDeck</p></div></p>
<p>The company has a prototype at the moment, capable of handling 500 square feet of deck in a charge. RoboDeck plans to offer the devices as an RaaS rental model when it comes to market. The company has thus far raised $500,000, with most of the funding coming from SOSV.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The battle to win Startup Battlefield began long before TechCrunch Disrupt kicked off Tuesday. Startup founders from all over the world applied to what has been described as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/announcing-the-startup-battlefield-companies-pitching-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/">most competitive batch in TechCrunch history</a>. Twenty startups competed this week on the TechCrunch virtual stage for $100,000 in equity-free prize money and last night, we announced the finalists: <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://adventr.io/">Adventr</a>, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.cellinobio.com/">Cellino</a>, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.withkoa.com/">Koa</a>, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://nthcycle.com/">Nth Cycle</a> and <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://tatum.io/">Tatum</a>.</p>
<p>The stakes stretch beyond prize money, however. The winner will become known to investors and potential partners and customers, thanks to global press coverage the event enjoys. It&#8217;s a hefty award and one that requires a panel of expert judges to help determine who should receive it. It&#8217;s a critical appointment — while brief — that can have a lasting impact on the founders who win, as well as help maintain TechCrunch&#8217;s reputation as an outlet that finds innovative tech and entrepreneurs behind it.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are the five judges who will pick the 2021 Startup Battlefield winner:</p>
<p><b>Kirsten Green</b> is the founder and managing partner of Forerunner Ventures, a San Francisco-based VC firm she formed in 2010. Green has built her career as a VC by becoming an expert within the fields in which she invests, beginning in the consumer space and expanding to health and wellness, durable supply chains and more. Before starting Forerunner, the UCLA business economics graduate and licensed CPA was an equity research analyst and investor at Banc of America Securities, formerly Montgomery Securities, covering publicly traded retail and consumer stocks.</p>
<p>Green, who has collected a series of accolades, including being honored in Time’s 100 Most Influential People and named a Top 20 Venture Capitalists by The New York Times, currently serves as a board member on several portfolio companies, including Glossier, Faire, Hims-Hers, Curated, Ritual and Modern Fertility. She is also on the board of Nordstrom and previously served on the boards of Dollar Shave Club and Bonobos.</p>
<p><strong>Jim Lanzone </strong>was named earlier this month as the next <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/jim-lanzone-breaks-up-with-tinder-swipes-right-to-take-the-ceo-job-at-yahoo-renate-nyborg-takes-tinder-ceo-role/">CEO of Yahoo Inc</a>. (formerly Verizon Media and new TechCrunch corporate parent), a job he will officially begin September 27. The appointment comes <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">less than two weeks after Apollo Global completed its acquisition of the media group from Verizon for $5 billion. Lanzone is leaving his current CEO position at dating app Tinder to take this new role.</span></p>
<p>Lanzone has a long history in media and as an entrepreneur. He worked at Ask.com (formerly Ask Jeeves), a division of IAC/InterActiveCorp., for seven years, eventually leading the internet company. He went on to found Clicker, <span id="m_2435934466641439592m_4193223825249713276:2hy.2" role="menuitem" aria-haspopup="true">an</span> internet video search and programming guide. Clicker, which launched at the TechCrunch50 conference in 2009, was acquired by CBS Interactive. He rose through the ranks at CBSi, holding the chief digital officer role until eventually becoming president and CEO. During his time at CBSi, Lanzone led the creation, launch and growth of streaming services CBS All Access, <span id="m_2435934466641439592m_4193223825249713276:2hy.1" role="menuitem" aria-haspopup="true">CBSN</span> and CBS Sports HQ.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Luciana Lixandru</strong> is a partner at Sequoia, where she focuses on enterprise and consumer technology companies across Europe.

					<description><![CDATA[The lesson appears to be that revenue growth matters more than near-term margins for fintech companies, allowing them to secure valuations that far surpass their final private marks.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startups are having one hell of a week.</p>
<p>On the heels of Boston-based software-and-payments company Toast&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/indications-of-a-hot-market-abound-as-freshworks-toast-price-ipos/">strong IPO pricing</a>, Remitly <a href="https://ir.remitly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/remitly-announces-pricing-initial-public-offering">priced</a> shares in its own debut above its proposed range yesterday evening. The Seattle-based fintech company sold 12,162,777 shares (7,000,000 primary) at $43 apiece. The company had previously targeted a $42 per-share max price for its IPO equity.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>At $43 per share, Remitly is valued less like a fintech company with gross margins in the 50% to 60% range and more like a middle-tier public SaaS firm, flush with recurring revenues and net-dollar retention north of 100%.</p>
<p>Toast, after seeing its shares rise sharply after starting to trade yesterday, sports a similar revenue multiple despite far weaker blended gross margins.</p>
<p>The lesson from today&#8217;s public markets appears to be that revenue growth matters more than near-term margins for fintech companies, allowing them to secure valuations that far surpass their final private marks. It&#8217;s an incredibly bullish set of results for fintech startups; they are worth more than they might have thought, or than their investors previously were willing to pay.</p>

It&#8217;s just perhaps even <em>better </em>than that for fintech upstarts.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do the math, and then ask when the hell Chime and Klarna are going to get off their duffs and go public.</p>
<h2>Fintech is the new SaaS?</h2>
<p>In the second quarter of 2021, Toast <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001650164/000119312521276664/d166297ds1a.htm#tx166297_1">reported revenues</a> of $424.7 million and revenue costs of $336.3 million, giving the company a blended gross margin of just under 21%. Toast has high-margin SaaS revenues, low-margin fintech revenues and then smaller business lines that float around breakeven. It shakes out to a somewhat modest figure.</p>
<p>And worth $30.856 billion this morning, according to Yahoo Finance data, Toast has a run-rate multiple of 18.2x. Per <a href="https://cloudindex.bvp.com/">Bessemer data</a>, that&#8217;s roughly on par with the median revenue multiple for public SaaS companies.</p>
<p>Our read of the Toast revenue multiple is that public markets are valuing it far more on growth than margins, which means that fintech startups can accrete SaaS multiples no matter their gross margins, provided sufficient near-term revenue upside. Notable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">California Governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/09/22/governor-newsom-signs-nation-leading-legislation-expanding-protections-for-warehouse-workers/">this week signed a bill</a> aimed at protecting warehouse workers from unsafe quotas. The bill, which cites issues around bathroom breaks, rest periods and other safety laws, has been seen as a repudiation of longstanding complaints against workplace conditions at Amazon fulfillment centers.</p>
<p>Introduced by Assembly Member Lorena Gonzalez in February,<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB701"> the bill</a> is designed to increase the transparency of quotas imposed on employees at warehouse distribution centers. Under the law, employers are required to inform workers of speed quotas. The legislation is also designed to mitigate punitive retaliation for not meeting quotas, including skipping breaks.</p>
<p>“This bill would provide that if a current or former employee believes that meeting a quota caused a violation of their right to a meal or rest period or required them to violate any occupational health and safety law or standard,” it reads, in part, “they have the right to request, and the employer is required to provide, a written description of each quota to which the employee is subject and a copy of the most recent 90 days of the employee’s own personal work speed data.”</p>
<p>The legislation was the most prominent in a list of 33 bills signed by the embattled Governor, along with a pair of vetoes. In statement tied to the news, Newsom commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>We cannot allow corporations to put profit over people. The hardworking warehouse employees who have helped sustain us during these unprecedented times should not have to risk injury or face punishment as a result of exploitative quotas that violate basic health and safety. I’m proud to sign this legislation giving them the dignity, respect and safety they deserve and advancing California’s leadership at the forefront of workplace safety.</p></blockquote>
<p>For her part, Gonzalez has been more direct about the bill’s intended impact on Amazon, citing the company’s track record in <a href="https://a80.asmdc.org/press-releases/20210922-governor-signs-gonzalez-bill-creating-nations-first-protections-against">a statement released</a> following the governor’s signing.</p>
<p>“Amazon’s business model relies on enforcing inhumane work speeds that are injuring and churning through workers at a faster rate than we’ve ever seen. Workers aren’t machines. We’re not going to allow a corporation that puts profits over workers’ bodies to set labor standards back decades just for ‘same-day delivery,’ ” Gonzales writes. “This bill is simply about giving workers some basic dignity back and empowering them to keep themselves safe.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In recent years, Amazon fulfillment centers have been a flash point for worker unionization efforts. Most recently, workers at one of the company’s Alberta fulfillment centers filed to hold a union vote, with a representative for Teamsters Canada<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/canadian-amazon-facility-files-union-vote-union-2021-09-14/"> calling the company</a>, “profoundly anti-worker.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new forecast on the state of the app economy indicates the third quarter will see record-breaking revenues spent on apps and games. According to <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/q3-2021-biggest-quarter-yet/">App Annie</a>, consumers worldwide will spend $34 billion on apps and games in Q3, a 20% year-over-year increase on spending. The increase indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s impact on consumer habits and behavior is having a lasting effect when it comes to how people are now using apps for entertainment, shopping, work, education and more.</p>
<p>App Annie, we should note, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/">made headlines last week</a> for having massaged its data in earlier years using confidential sources, then misrepresented this to its trading firm clients as having been statistically modeled with internal controls to prevent such a thing from occurring. This resulted in a $10+ million securities fraud settlement with the SEC, as firms used the data to make investment decisions, as a result.</p>
<p>But App Annie data today still remains a fairly accurate representation of the mobile market, despite these manipulations, and for now is still one of many top companies that supply large app publishers, marketers and investors with information related to the mobile ecosystem.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2LY4zmEv2h"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/">App Annie and co-founder charged with securities fraud, will pay $10M+ settlement</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;App Annie and co-founder charged with securities fraud, will pay $10M+ settlement&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/embed/#?secret=2LY4zmEv2h" data-secret="2LY4zmEv2h" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The firm said that the largest contributor to app revenue in Q3 continues to be in-game spending and mobile subscriptions &#8212; the latter, a focus of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/fortnite-likely-isnt-coming-back-to-the-app-store-anytime-soon/">lawsuits</a> and increased regulation as both Apple and Google fight to retain their right to a cut of the purchases flowing through their app store platforms. Gaming continues to account for the majority of consumer spend, though non-gaming spending has grown its share over the past few years, thanks to subscriptions.</p>
<p>Android also still continues to outpace iOS on downloads, but the reverse is true when it comes to consumer spending.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207456" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207456" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207456" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207456" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Downloads in Q3 will have grown by 10% year-over-year to reach a record high of 36 billion, driven by Google Play and particularly downloads in emerging markets like India and Brazil. The strongest growth was also seen in Brazil, the Philippines and Mexico, and the Latin American market has begun to catch the attention of global publishers now, as well, as one with growth potential.</p>
<p>Industries driving download growth include travel, education and medical &#8212; all three of which have had pandemic impacts. Travel app downloads grew 35% quarter-over-quarter on Google Play and 15% on iOS as the summer travel season has picked up amidst widespread vaccine rollout. Medical and education apps, of course, have pandemic ties, as users turned to mobile technology to keep up with online learning and with doctors&#8217; appointments, COVID testing and vaccine appointments.</p>
<p>But iOS still reigns when it comes to revenue generated by mobile apps, accounting for 65% of app stores&#8217; consumer spending globally, which is in line with the past four quarters.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207455" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207455" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207455" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207455" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>Consumer spending on iOS apps grew 15% year over year to $22 billion, and 15% year-over-year on Google Play to reach around $12 billion. Most of this revenue is generated by gaming apps, which account for 66% of the spend across both apps stores. In terms of non-gaming apps, iOS commands 76% of consumer spending. Much of the growth outside of gaming, across both platforms, comes from entertainment apps, photo and video apps, social media and dating apps, the firm says.</p>
<p>The U.S. and China are the largest iOS markets for consumer spending, with Japan, the U.S. and Taiwan accounting for the strongest growth. On Google Play, the U.S., Japan and South Korea were the largest markets by consumer spend, but Japan, Russia and Australia drove the growth.</p>
<p>While examinations of revenue and downloads have historically helped to paint a broad picture of the state of the mobile economy, as markets mature there&#8217;s greater interest in user engagement with apps &#8212; like those consumers already have installed on their devices.</p>
<p>A report from an App Annie competitor <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/state-of-app-engagement-report-2021">Sensor Tower, also out today</a>, dives into active users, sessions and retention metrics for games and non-games alike. The firm found that the top 500 apps worldwide now average 91.7 million monthly active users and this number has grown by 8.4% year-over-year during the second quarter, up from 84.6 million in Q2 2020.</p>

<p>Business apps saw the highest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between Q1 2018 and Q2 2021, climbing nearly 42% over that time frame, Sensor Tower said. Meanwhile, consumers in Q2 2021 spent the most time in entertainment apps, with each of the top 100 seeing nearly 29 minutes of daily usage, on average.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207461" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207461" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207461" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg 2304w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207461" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>Among games, shooter genre games &#8212; like PUBG Mobile and Garena Free Fire &#8212; saw the most daily active users in Q2, as the top 50 games in this genre averaged 7.6 million daily active users. In terms of weekly actives, however, hypercasual games came out on top.</p>
<p>Sensor Tower also credits earlier increases in active users across apps to the COVID-19 pandemic as users who turned to mobile devices during lockdowns. But after a slight dip in Q3 2020, growth in active users has now returned to pre-pandemic levels, it said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors has now joined a slew of other major automakers, including Toyota, Chinese state-backed SAIC Motor and Mercedes-Benz AG, in putting its chips behind Chinese autonomous driving startup Momenta.</p>
<p>GM, the largest automaker in the U.S. in terms of vehicle sales, said Tuesday it will invest $300 million in Momenta to accelerate the development of AV tech for future GM vehicles in China. Julian Blissett, executive VP of GM and president of GM China, said in a statement that the investment will help the automaker bring “solutions tailor-made for [GM’s] consumers in China.”</p>
<p>The news comes less than six months after Momenta closed a nearly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/momenta-500-million-fundraise/">$500 million</a> funding round, which saw participation from SAIC, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz AG and Bosch. As TechCrunch’s Rita Liao notes, “mega-fundraising has become common in the capital-intensive autonomous vehicle world.” But it appears that the startup is moving closer to commercialization as it aims to mass-produce cars equipped with its software by the end of this year.</p>
<p>This is just the latest aggressive investment into next-gen technology from GM, which said in June it had earmarked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/">$35 billion</a> for electric and AV ventures through 2025. Here in the U.S., GM’s interest in autonomous technology is best-known via its self-driving subsidiary, Cruise, which recently tapped a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cruise-secures-5b-credit-line-to-buy-electric-autonomous-cruise-origin-vehicles-from-gm/">$5 billion</a> line of credit from the automaker’s financial firm.</p>
<p>But GM has also established a strong series of partnerships in China, as it seeks to take a firm foothold in the world’s largest EV market. The country’s best-selling electric vehicle, a tiny city car called the Wuling Mini EV, is manufactured by SAIC-GM-Wuling &#8212; as the name suggests, a joint venture between GM, SAIC and Wuling Motors. SAIC-GM-Wuling also manufactures the popular brand Baojun.</p>
<p>Chinese municipal governments have also taken a notably progressive stance toward autonomous driving, Chinese AV startup executives noted at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/the-rise-of-robotaxis-in-china/">TC Mobility in June</a>.</p>
<p>“In China, each local government is incentivized to really act like entrepreneurs like us,” Huan Sun, Europe general manager at Momenta, said during the event. “They are very progressive in developing the local economy… What we feel is that autonomous driving technology can greatly improve and upgrade the [local governments’] economic structure.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>While GM declined to state when drivers would see Momenta tech in its Chinese vehicles, a spokesperson for the automaker confirmed that the partnership between the two companies would not extend to GM vehicles manufactured and sold in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous vehicle company Motional is expanding its operations and employee headcount in Las Vegas, including tripling the size of its testing facility, in the run up to its planned 2023 commercial deployment of robotaxis.</p>
<p>The company, the product of a $4 billion joint venture between Aptiv and Hyundai, has been in Las Vegas for nearly four years. Motional first began testing it autonomous vehicle in Las Vegas through a partnership with Lyft. The two companies kicked off with what was supposed to be a weeklong pilot program to offer rides in autonomous vehicles on the Lyft network in Las Vegas during the 2018 CES tech trade show.</p>
<p>The partnership predates the joint venture with Hyundai. At the time, Motional was known as Aptiv Autonomous Mobility Group. That temporary experiment, which has always included a human safety driver, was extended and still exists today. As of February 2020, the program had given more than 100,000 paid self-driving rides in Aptiv’s — now Motional’s — self-driving vehicles, per the Lyft app. Motional has not provided an updated number on the number of paid rides taken through the Lyft app.</p>
<p>Motional&#8217;s operations in Nevada extend beyond its partnership with Lyft. The company also tests on public roads on an ongoing basis in Nevada.</p>
<p>The expansion plans at its Las Vegas facility also include doubling its operations center. What this actually means is that the company is now using its entire 130,000-square-foot technical center that Motional opened several years ago to house its fleet of autonomous vehicles as well as an engineering team dedicated to research and development of software and hardware systems, validation and mapping.</p>
<p>As part of this expansion, Motional is also hiring more than 100 new employees. The company currently employs more than 250 people in Las Vegas.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FkTuGlpZqQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/motional-ceo-hints-at-an-autonomous-future-in-logistics/">Motional CEO hints at an autonomous future in logistics</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Motional CEO hints at an autonomous future in logistics&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/motional-ceo-hints-at-an-autonomous-future-in-logistics/embed/#?secret=FkTuGlpZqQ" data-secret="FkTuGlpZqQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Motional&#8217;s growing operations in Las Vegas — and notably a closed track that will allow four times the volume of testing — are in preparation for its next-generation robotaxi based on the all-electric Hyundai Ioniq 5. Motional&#8217;s President and CEO Karl Iagnemma said the expansion will allow the company to accelerate testing ahead of the commercial deployment of its fully driverless robotaxis in 2023.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas announcement comes a month after Motional <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/motional-to-begin-testing-autonomous-vehicles-in-la-as-part-of-california-expansion-plan/">expanded operations in California</a>. The company said in August it is opening a new operations facility in Los Angeles to support testing on public roads, hiring more engineers and adding an office in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The investment into California and this latest plan to grow operations in Nevada follows a hiring spree that has pushed Motional’s total headcount to more than 1,000 people, an expansion into Seoul and its announcement last December to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/motional-and-lyft-target-2023-to-deploy-driverless-robotaxi-services-in-major-u-s-cities/">fully driverless robotaxi services</a> in major U.S. cities in 2023 using the Lyft ride-hailing network.</p>
<p>Motional didn&#8217;t disclose its investment into the California expansion, nor has it shared financial details of its plans for the Las Vegas facility. A company spokesperson said it &#8220;does represent Motional’s largest investment in our Nevada operations.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Clarification: Motional announced it was doubling its operations. It is not doubling the size of its facility, instead it is using the entire center and adding more than 100 employees. </em></p>
