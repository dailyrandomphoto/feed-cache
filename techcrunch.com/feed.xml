					<description><![CDATA[Facebook&#8217;s lead data supervisor in the European Union has opened an investigation into whether the tech giant violated data protection rules vis-a-vis the leak of data reported earlier this month.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s lead data supervisor in the European Union has opened an investigation into whether the tech giant violated data protection rules vis-a-vis the leak of data reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/answers-being-sought-from-facebook-over-latest-data-breach/">earlier this month</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the Irish Data Protection Commission&#8217;s statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Data Protection Commission (DPC) today launched an own-volition inquiry pursuant to section 110 of the Data Protection Act 2018 in relation to multiple international media reports, which highlighted that a collated dataset of Facebook user personal data had been made available on the internet. This dataset was reported to contain personal data relating to approximately 533 million Facebook users worldwide. The DPC engaged with Facebook Ireland in relation to this reported issue, raising queries in relation to GDPR compliance to which Facebook Ireland furnished a number of responses.</p>
<p>The DPC, having considered the information provided by Facebook Ireland regarding this matter to date, is of the opinion that one or more provisions of the GDPR and/or the Data Protection Act 2018 may have been, and/or are being, infringed in relation to Facebook Users’ personal data.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Commission considers it appropriate to determine whether Facebook Ireland has complied with its obligations, as data controller, in connection with the processing of personal data of its users by means of the Facebook Search, Facebook Messenger Contact Importer and Instagram Contact Importer features of its service, or whether any provision(s) of the GDPR and/or the Data Protection Act 2018 have been, and/or are being, infringed by Facebook in this respect.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Facebook has been contacted for comment.</p>
<p>The move comes after the European Commission intervened to apply pressure on Ireland&#8217;s data protection commissioner. Justice commissioner, Didier Reynders, <a href="https://twitter.com/dreynders/status/1381663631981617163">tweeted</a> Monday that he had spoken with Helen Dixon about the Facebook data leak.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Commission continues to follow this case closely and is committed to supporting national authorities,&#8221; he added, going on to urge Facebook to &#8220;cooperate actively and swiftly to shed light on the identified issues&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today I spoke with Helen Dixon <a href="https://twitter.com/DPCIreland?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DPCIreland</a> about the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FacebookLeak?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FacebookLeak</a>. The Commission continues to follow this case closely and is committed to supporting national authorities. We also call on <a href="https://twitter.com/Facebook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Facebook</a> to cooperate actively and swiftly to shed light on the identified issues.</p>
<p>&mdash; Didier Reynders (@dreynders) <a href="https://twitter.com/dreynders/status/1381663631981617163?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Commission confirmed the virtual meeting between Reynders and Dixon, saying: &#8220;Dixon informed the Commissioner about the issues at stake and the different tracks of work to clarify the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;They both urge Facebook to cooperate swiftly and to share the necessary information. It is crucial to shed light on this leak that has affected millions of European citizens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is up to the Irish data protection authority to assess this case. The Commission remains available if support is needed. The situation will also have to be further analyzed for the future. Lessons should be learned,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The revelation that a vulnerability in Facebook&#8217;s platform enabled unidentified &#8216;malicious actors&#8217; to extract the personal data (including email addresses, mobile phone numbers and more) of more than 500 million Facebook accounts up until September 2019 &#8212; when Facebook claims it fixed the issue &#8212; only emerged in the wake of the data <a href="https://twitter.com/UnderTheBreach/status/1378314424239460352">being found</a> for free download on a hacker forum earlier this month.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">All 533,000,000 Facebook records were just leaked for free.</p>
<p>This means that if you have a Facebook account, it is extremely likely the phone number used for the account was leaked.</p>
<p>I have yet to see Facebook acknowledging this absolute negligence of your data. <a href="https://t.co/ysGCPZm5U3">https://t.co/ysGCPZm5U3</a> <a href="https://t.co/nM0Fu4GDY8">pic.twitter.com/nM0Fu4GDY8</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Despite the European Union&#8217;s data protection framework (the GDPR) baking in a regime of data breach notifications &#8212; with the risk of hefty fines for compliance failure &#8212; Facebook did not inform its lead EU data supervisory when it found and fixed the issue. Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) was left to find out in the press, like everyone else.</p>
<p>Nor has Facebook individually informed the 533M+ users that their information was taken without their knowledge or consent, saying last week it has no plans to do so &#8212; despite the heightened risk for affected users of spam and phishing attacks.</p>
<p>Privacy experts have, meanwhile, been swift to point out that the company has still not faced any regulatory sanction under the GDPR &#8212; with a number of investigations ongoing into various Facebook businesses and practices and no decisions yet issued in those cases by Ireland&#8217;s DPC. (It has so far only issued one cross-border decision, fining<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/"> Twitter</a> around $550k in December over a breach it disclosed back in 2019.)</p>

<p>Last month the European Parliament adopted a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0111_EN.html">resolution</a> on the implementation of the GDPR which expressed &#8220;great concern&#8221; over the functioning of the mechanism &#8212; raising particular concern over the Irish data protection authority by writing that it &#8220;generally closes most cases with a settlement instead of a sanction and that cases referred to Ireland in 2018 have not even reached the stage of a draft decision pursuant to Article 60(3) of the GDPR&#8221;.</p>
<p>The latest Facebook data scandal further amps up the pressure on the DPC &#8212; providing further succour to critics of the GDPR who argue the regulation is unworkable under the current foot-dragging enforcement structure, given the major bottlenecks in Ireland (and Luxembourg) where many tech giants choose to locate regional HQ.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">After the <a href="https://twitter.com/EP_Justice?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EP_Justice</a> and other EU DPAs raised concerns, the Irish Parliament is now also planning to look into the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/DPCIreland?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DPCIreland</a> in a hearing on April 27th. </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>On Thursday Reynders made his concern over Ireland&#8217;s response to the Facebook data leak public, <a href="https://twitter.com/dreynders/status/1380182173739847681">tweeting</a> to say the Commission had been in contact with the DPC.</p>
<p>He does have reason to be personally concerned. Earlier last week <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-leaders-facebook-data-leak-cybersecurity-didier-reynders/">Politico</a> reported that Reynders&#8217; own digits had been among the cache of leaked data, along with those of the Luxembourg prime minister Xavier Bettel &#8212; and &#8220;dozens of EU officials&#8221;. However the problem of weak GDPR enforcement affects everyone across the bloc &#8212; some 446M people whose rights are not being uniformly and vigorously upheld.</p>
<p>&#8220;A strong enforcement of GDPR is of key importance,&#8221; Reynders also remarked on Twitter, urging Facebook to &#8220;fully cooperate with Irish authorities&#8221;.</p>
<p>Last week <a href="https://www.gpdp.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9572143">Italy&#8217;s data protection commission</a> also called on Facebook to immediately offer a service for Italian users to check whether they had been affected by the breach. But Facebook made no public acknowledgment or response to the call. Under the GDPR&#8217;s one-stop-shop mechanism the tech giant can limit its regulatory exposure by direct dealing only with its lead EU data supervisor in Ireland.</p>
<p>A two-year Commission review of how the data protection regime is functioning, which reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">last summer</a>, already drew attention to problems with patchy enforcement. A lack of progress on unblocking GDPR bottlenecks is thus a growing problem for the Commission &#8212; which is in the midst of proposing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">a package</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/">additional</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais/">digital regulations</a>. That makes the enforcement point a very pressing one as EU lawmakers are being asked how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/eu-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-set-fines-as-high-as-4-of-global-turnover-per-leaked-draft/">new digital rules</a> will be upheld if existing ones keep being trampled on?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly notable that the EU&#8217;s executive has proposed a different, centralized enforcement structure for<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/"> incoming pan-EU legislation</a> targeted at digital services and tech giants. Albeit, getting agreement from all the EU&#8217;s institutions and elected representatives on how to reshape platform oversight looks challenging.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile the data leaks continue: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8dj5/facebook-phone-number-data-breach-telegram-bot">Motherboard</a> reported Friday on another alarming leak of Facebook data it found being made accessible via a bot on the Telegram messaging platform that gives out the names and phone numbers of users who have liked a Facebook page (in exchange for a fee unless the page has had less than 100 likes).</p>
<p>The publication said this data appears to be separate to the 533M+ scraped dataset &#8212; after it ran checks against the larger dataset via the breach advice site, <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">haveibeenpwned</a>. It also asked Alon Gal, the person who discovered the aforementioned leaked Facebook dataset being offered for free download online, to compare data obtained via the bot and he did not find any matches.</p>
<p>We contacted Facebook about the source of this leaked data and will update this report with any response.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://twitter.com/dreynders/status/1380182173739847681">tweet</a> about the 500M+ Facebook data leak last week, Reynders made reference to the Europe Data Protection Board (EDPB), a steering body comprised of representatives from Member State data protection agencies which works to ensure a consistent application of the GDPR.</p>
<p>However the body does not lead on GDPR enforcement &#8212; so it&#8217;s not clear why he would invoke it. Optics is one possibility, if he was trying to encourage a perception that the EU has vigorous and uniform enforcement structures where people&#8217;s data is concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the GDPR, enforcement and the investigation of potential violations lies with the national supervisory authorities. The EDPB does not have investigative powers per se and is not involved in investigations at the national level. As such, the EDPB cannot comment on the processing activities of specific companies,&#8221; an EDPB spokeswoman told us when we enquired about Reynders&#8217; remarks.</p>
<p>But she also noted the Commission attends plenary meetings of the EDPB &#8212; adding it&#8217;s possible there will be an exchange of views among members about the Facebook leak case in the future, as attending supervisory authorities &#8220;regularly exchange information on cases at the national level&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="http://sundayapp.com">Sunday</a>, a new startup that is going to attract some headlines as it has raised a $24 million seed round at a $140 million post-money valuation. That’s a lot of money for a company that started just a few months ago but that’s because Sunday wants to move quickly.</p>
<p>Sunday is getting noticed because it is founded by Victor Lugger, Tigrane Seydoux and Christine de Wendel —&nbsp;Lugger and Tigrane have been working together for several years as they’re the founders of <a href="https://www.bigmammagroup.com">Big Mamma</a>. Christine de Wendel headed <a href="https://www.zalando.fr">Zalando</a> in France before joining <a href="https://www.manomano.fr">ManoMano</a> as COO.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Big Mamma, they’ve launched a dozen Italian restaurants in France. They also manage La Felicità, the food court at <a href="https://stationf.co">Station F</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some people love those restaurants because the food is good and it’s relatively affordable. Some people hate it because Big Mamma is also particularly well known for its long queues and the fact that you always feel like you have to eat quickly for the next group. But it’s clear that it’s been working well for the past few years.</p>
<p>Managing Big Mamma during a pandemic led to Sunday, a spin-off company incorporated in the U.S. The restaurant company wanted to offer a way to check the menu and pay without touching anything. Like many restaurants, they put QR codes on the tables to that customers can scan them with their phones and load a website.</p>
<p>But Sunday didn’t stop at the menu as it also connects directly to the cash register system. Sunday supports Oracle Micros, Brinks, Tiller, Zelty, Revo, CashPad, etc. This way, clients can also scan the QR code, check their tab and pay directly from their phone. When they’re done eating, they can pay by themselves, stand up and leave.</p>
<p>After trying Sunday in Big Mamma restaurants, the company saw some encouraging results. 80% of customers chose to pay using the QR code, which means that restaurants saved 15 minutes in wait time on average leading to a better table turnover rate.</p>
<p>And this is key to understanding Sunday. It’s easy to sell a new payment system to a restaurant if it leads to more revenue. Popular restaurants that feel like they’re always looking for empty tables could greatly benefit from Sunday.</p>
<p>It also opens up some new possibilities. For instance, guests can split the bill directly at the table —&nbsp;everyone loads up Sunday and pay. Sunday is based on QR codes right now, but the company isn’t attached to QR codes specifically. You could imagine loading your bill using RFID chips, a tablet, etc.</p>
<p>The vision is clear —&nbsp;Sunday wants to build the <a href="https://www.fast.co">Fast Checkout</a> of restaurants. The startup thinks online checkout is going to merge with offline, brick-and-mortar checkout.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lPOmIpmY1E"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/fast-raises-102m-as-the-online-checkout-wars-continue-to-attract-huge-investment/">Fast raises $102M as the online checkout wars continue to attract huge investment</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fast raises $102M as the online checkout wars continue to attract huge investment&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/fast-raises-102m-as-the-online-checkout-wars-continue-to-attract-huge-investment/embed/#?secret=lPOmIpmY1E" data-secret="lPOmIpmY1E" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Sunday customers don’t pay any monthly subscription fee or setup fee. You only pay processing fees based on usage. And those fees tend to be lower than the card machine you’re currently using.</p>
<p>The startup’s seed round was led by Coatue with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/new-wave/">New Wave</a> participating. New Wave is a new European seed fund led by Pia d’Iribarne and backed by Xavier Niel. Multiple hospitality and tech investors are also participating.</p>
<p>The idea is to raise a lot of money, sign up a lot of restaurants and take over the market right now while there’s an opportunity during the pandemic. They have hired 40 people already and they’re signing deals with restaurants even though most of them are still closed in Europe.</p>
<p>Sunday isn’t a tech achievement <em>per se</em> — it’s an execution play. The company that can roll out this kind of checkout experience faster than the others is going to take over the market.</p>
<p>When restaurants are going to be open again, you may notice Sunday QR codes in France at Eataly, PNY, Paris Society, Eric Frechon, Groupe Bertrand’s restaurants (Burger King France, Hippopotamus, Groupe Flo…). Similarly, in the U.K., Sunday is partnering with JKS Group (Hoppers, Brigadiers, Gymkhana…), Corbin &amp; King and others. Sunday is also talking with companies in the U.S. and Spain.</p>
<p>Overall, there are more than a thousand restaurants currently adopting Sunday.</p>
<p>“We follow the same model as the one we used when launching restaurants with Big Mamma. Seven years ago, we invested three times more than the others to compress fixed costs and deliver a better product,” Sunday co-founder and CEO Victor Lugger told me.</p>
<p>The startup already has an ambitious product roadmap. Eventually, you could imagine having your own Sunday account that remembers your past bills, tracks your allergies, saves your favorite payment method, etc. Once again, it’ll come down to execution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When ZeroAvia’s six-seater aircraft completed an eight-minute flight from Cranfield Airfield in the U.K. last September, the company claimed a “major breakthrough” with the first-ever hydrogen fuel cell flight of a commercial-size aircraft.</p>
<p>The modified Piper Malibu propeller plane was now the largest hydrogen-powered aircraft in the world, wrote the company. “While some experimental aircraft have flown using hydrogen fuel cells, the size of this aircraft shows that paying passengers could be boarding a truly zero-emission flight very soon,” added Val Miftakhov, ZeroAvia’s CEO.</p>
<p>But just how hydrogen-powered was it, and how close is ZeroAvia to flying passengers?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“[In] this particular setup, not all the energy is coming from hydrogen,” said Miftakhov at a press conference directly afterwards. “There is a combination of the battery and hydrogen. But the way the battery and hydrogen fuel cells combine is such that we are able to fly purely on hydrogen.”</p>
<p>Miftakhov’s comments don’t quite tell the whole story. TechCrunch has learned that batteries provided the majority of the power required for the landmark flight, and will continue to feature heavily in ZeroAvia’s longer flights and new aircraft. And while the Malibu is technically still a passenger aircraft, ZeroAvia has had to replace four of the Malibu’s five passenger seats to accommodate bulky hydrogen tanks and other equipment.</p>
<p>In less than four years, ZeroAvia has gone from testing aircraft parts in pickup trucks to gaining the support of the U.K. government, and attracting investment from the likes of Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and &#8212; just last week &#8212; British Airways. Now the question is whether it can continue on its claimed trajectory and truly transform aviation.</p>

<h2>Take off</h2>
<p>Aviation currently accounts for 2.5% of humanity’s carbon emissions, and could grow to a quarter of the planet’s carbon budget by 2050. Biofuels can displace trees or food crops, while batteries are too heavy for anything more than short hops. Hydrogen, by contrast, can be generated using solar or wind power, and packs quite an energetic punch.</p>
<p>Fuel cells combine hydrogen with oxygen from the air in an efficient reaction that produces only electricity, heat and water. But that doesn’t mean you can simply drop a fuel cell into an existing aircraft. Fuel cells are heavy and complex, hydrogen requires bulky storage and there are many technical problems for startups to solve.</p>
<p>Russian-born Miftakhov arrived in America in 1997 to study for a physics doctorate. In 2012, after starting several companies and a stint at Google, he founded eMotorWerks (aka EMW) to produce electric conversion kits for the BMW 3-series.</p>
<p>But in 2013, BMW accused EMW of infringing its trademarks. Miftakhov agreed to change its logo and marketing materials, and to refrain from suggesting it was affiliated with the carmaker. He also found demand from BMW owners to be sluggish.</p>
<p>EMW then pivoted to providing chargers and a smart energy management platform. The new direction succeeded, and in 2017 Italian energy company Enel acquired EMW for a reported $150 million. But Miftakhov faced legal difficulties here, too.</p>
<p>George Betak, an EMW vice president, filed two civil lawsuits against Miftakhov alleging, among other things, that Miftakhov had left his name off patents, withheld money and even faked a document to make it seem as though Betak had assigned his intellectual property rights to EMW. Betak later withdrew some claims. The cases were quietly settled in the summer of 2020.</p>
<p>Weeks after selling EMW in 2017, Miftakhov incorporated ZeroAvia in San Carlos, California with the stated aim of “zero emissions aviation.” He was counting on the aviation industry being more interested in electrifying existing aircraft than BMW drivers had been.</p>
<h2>First step: batteries</h2>
<p>The first public outing for ZeroAvia was in October 2018 at Hollister Airport, 50 miles southwest of San Jose. Miftakhov mounted a propeller, an electric motor and batteries in the bed of a 1969 El Camino and took it up to 75 knots (85mph) on electric power.</p>
<p>In December, ZeroAvia bought a Piper PA-46 Matrix, a six-seater propeller plane very similar to the one it would later use in the U.K. Miftakhov’s team installed the motor and about 75kWh of lithium ion batteries &#8212; about the same as in an entry-level Tesla Model Y.</p>
<p>In February 2019, two days after the FAA granted it an experimental airworthiness certificate, the all-electric Piper took to the air. By mid-April, the Matrix was flying at its top speed and maximum power. It was ready to upgrade to hydrogen.</p>
<p>Import records show that ZeroAvia took delivery of a carbon fiber hydrogen tank from Germany in March. One company photo exists of the Matrix with a tank on its left wing, but ZeroAvia never released a video of it flying. Something had gone wrong.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Corporate sustainability initiatives may open doors for carbon offset startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/corporate-sustainability-initiatives-may-open-doors-for-carbon-offset-startups/embed/#?secret=g3SJltAtsg" data-secret="g3SJltAtsg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In July, ZeroAvia’s R&amp;D director posted a message on a forum for Piper owners: “We have damaged a wing of our Matrix, which we loved and pampered so much. The damage is so bad that it has to be replaced. Is anyone aware of [a suitable aircraft] that is going to be sold for parts any time soon?”</p>
<p>Miftakhov confirmed that the damage, not previously reported, occurred while ZeroAvia was reconfiguring the aircraft. That aircraft has not flown since, and ZeroAvia’s time as a Silicon Valley startup was coming to an end.</p>
<h2>Moving to the UK</h2>
<p>With ZeroAvia’s U.S. flight tests on hold, Miftakhov turned his attention to Britain, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson is banking on ”a new green industrial revolution.”</p>
<p>In September 2019, Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), a U.K. government-supported company, funded a ZeroAvia-led project called HyFlyer, with £2.68 million ($3.3 million). Miftakhov committed to deliver a hydrogen fuel cell Piper that could fly more than 280 miles, within a year. Sharing the money would be Intelligent Energy, a fuel cell maker, and the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), which would provide hydrogen fueling tech.</p>
<p>“ZeroAvia had proved the concept of retrofitting an electric power train into an aircraft and instead of powering it by batteries, they wanted to power it with hydrogen,” said Richard Ainsworth, EMEC’s hydrogen manager at the time. “That was the whole purpose of the HyFlyer project.”</p>
<p>Gary Elliott, CEO of ATI, told TechCrunch that it was “really important” to ATI that ZeroAvia was using fuel cells rather than a battery system: “You need to spread your investment profile, so that you&#8217;ve got as much likelihood of success as you can.”</p>
<p>ZeroAvia set up in Cranfield and in February 2020, bought a six-seater Piper Malibu, similar to the damaged Matrix. Although the company fitted and flew it with batteries by June, the government still needed reassuring. “I&#8217;d be happy to catch up and think about what we can do to address the concerns that are nagging away at the ATI,” wrote an official, according to an email obtained by TechCrunch under a freedom of information request.</p>
<p>Intelligent Energy CTO Chris Dudfield told TechCrunch that the HyFlyer program went smoothly, but that his company is still years away from flying a larger fuel cell and that he never even saw ZeroAvia’s plane.</p>
<p>ZeroAvia’s partnership with Intelligent Energy might have helped it secure U.K. government funding but it wasn’t going to help power the Malibu. ZeroAvia needed to find a fuel cell supplier &#8212; fast.</p>
<h2>Second step: Fuel cell power</h2>
<p>In August, ZeroAvia wrote to government officials that “we are now gearing up for our first hydrogen-powered flight,” and invited the Secretary of State to attend.</p>
<p>Miftakhov said that ZeroAvia’s demonstration flight used a 250 kilowatt hydrogen fuel cell powertrain &#8212; the largest ever in an aircraft. This is comparable in power to the internal combustion engine that Pipers typically use, giving a healthy margin of safety for the most demanding phase of flight: take off.</p>
<p>ZeroAvia never identified its fuel cell supplier, nor detailed how much of the 250kW came from the fuel cell.</p>
<p>However, the day after the demonstration flight, a Swedish company called PowerCell issued a press release stating that one PowerCell MS-100 fuel cell was “an integral part of the powertrain.”</p>
<p>The MS-100 generates a maximum power of just 100kW, leaving 150kW unaccounted for. This means the majority of the power needed for take-off could only have come from the Piper’s batteries.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Miftakhov acknowledged that the Piper could not have taken off on fuel cell power alone in the September flight. He said the plane’s batteries were probably operational for the entire demonstration flight, and provided “some additional safety margin for the aircraft.”</p>
<p>Many fuel cell vehicles use batteries, either to smooth out fluctuations or to boost power briefly, although some manufacturers have been more transparent about their sources of power. One problem with relying on batteries for take off is that the plane then has to carry them for the whole flight.</p>
<p>“The fundamental challenge for hydrogen fuel cell aircraft is weight,” said Paul Eremenko, CEO of Universal Hydrogen, which is collaborating on a 2000kW fuel cell powertrain for another aircraft. &#8220;One of the ways we save weight is having a much smaller battery that is only used when a pilot guns the throttle.&#8221;</p>
<p>In February, ZeroAvia’s vice president, Sergey Kiselev, said that the company’s goal was to do without batteries altogether. “Batteries may be used to provide an extra oomph during take off,” he told the Royal Aeronautical Society. “But if you use different types of propulsion or energy storage on the aircraft, the certification effort will be significantly harder.”</p>
<p>Relying heavily on batteries allowed ZeroAvia to pull off its high-profile demonstration flight for investors and the U.K. government, but could ultimately delay its first flights with paying passengers.</p>
<h2>The problem of heat</h2>
<p>Without an exhaust to expel waste heat, fuel cells usually need a complex air or liquid cooling system to avoid overheating</p>
<p>“This is really the key intellectual property, and why it isn&#8217;t just a matter of buying a fuel cell, buying a motor and plugging them together,” says Eremenko.</p>
<p>The German Aerospace Center in Cologne has been flying hydrogen fuel cell aircraft since 2012. Its current aircraft, the custom-designed HY4, can carry four passengers up to 450 miles. Its 65kW fuel cell has a liquid cooling system that uses a large, aerodynamically optimized channel for the cooling air flow (see picture).</p>
<p>A similar 100kW system would generally need a cooling intake longer and a third bigger than the HY4’s. ZeroAvia’s Piper Malibu has no additional cooling intakes at all.</p>
<p>“The openings look way too small for the air speed at take off, and even for cruise speed,” said an aviation fuel cell engineer who asked not to be named because they deal with some of the same companies as ZeroAvia.</p>

<p>“We had to experiment with the location and configuration of the heat exchangers… but we did not have to redesign the shape of the aircraft to handle the heat,” countered Miftakhov. He claims the fuel cell was operating at between 85 and 100kW during the flight.</p>
<p>Following TechCrunch’s interview with ZeroAvia, the company released a video that appears to show the Piper’s fuel cell operating at up to 70kW during a ground test, which could equate to a higher power level when airborne.</p>
<p>Although this still needs to be demonstrated with long-distance flights, ZeroAvia may have solved the heat problem that has dogged other engineers for years.</p>
<h2>The next plane: bigger and better?</h2>
<p>In September, aviation minister Robert Courts was at Cranfield to watch the demonstration flight. “It&#8217;s one of the most historic moments in aviation for decades, and it is a huge triumph for ZeroAvia,” he said after the flight. Time magazine named ZeroAvia’s technology as one of the best inventions of 2020.</p>
<p>Even with the HyFlyer extended flight still to come, in December the U.K. government announced HyFlyer 2 &#8212; a £12.3 million ($16.3 million) project for ZeroAvia to deliver a 600kW hydrogen-electric powertrain for a larger aircraft. ZeroAvia agreed to have a 19-seat plane ready for commercialization in 2023. (It now says 2024.)</p>
<p>On the same day, ZeroAvia announced its $21.3 million Series A investor lineup, including Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Ventures Fund, Jeff Bezos’ Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, Ecosystem Integrity Fund, Horizon Ventures, Shell Ventures and Summa Equity. It announced another $23.4 million raise from these investors, without Amazon but with British Airways, in late March.</p>
<p>Miftakhov said the Malibu has now completed about a dozen test flights, with the long-distance U.K. flight pushed to later this year, due to COVID delays. And as for HyFlyer 2, Miftakhov now says that this will initially use half batteries and half fuel cells, although “the final certifiable flight configuration will get its full 600kW from the fuel cells.”</p>
<p>There is no doubt that ZeroAvia is facing a steep climb to deliver its promised aircraft, starting with the 19-seater, then a 50-seater plane in 2026, and a 100-seater by 2030.</p>

<p>Hydrogen fuel cells still have a whiff of snake oil about them, thanks to Nikola, a startup that exaggerated a public demonstration of a hydrogen fuel cell truck, triggering a collapse in its share price and investigation by the SEC. The best option for ambitious start-ups like ZeroAvia is to be more transparent about their current technology and the challenges that lie ahead, even if that means tempering the expectations of investors and a public excited by the prospect of sustainable air travel.</p>
<p>“I desperately want ZeroAvia to be successful,” says Paul Eremenko. “I think we have very complementary business models and together we help complete the value chain to make hydrogen aviation happen.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fontinalis.com/">Fontinalis</a>, the 12-year-old, Detroit-based early stage venture firm, is known for being among the very first investing outfits to focus squarely on mobility as an overarching theme. It wasn&#8217;t a surprising mandate, given that the outfit&#8217;s cofounders include Bill Ford, the great grandson of Henry Ford and the executive chairman of Ford Motor Company.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the firm has used its ties to the traditional automotive industry to effectively compete against, and invest alongside, many Silicon Valley venture firms in the intervening years, creating an interesting portfolio along the way. It had stakes in Postmates, acquired in an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/">all-stock deal</a> by Uber, and in Lyft, for example. It also backed the self-driving startup nuTonomy, which sold to auto supplier Delphi Automotive in 2017 for $450 million. Some of its newer bets include <a href="https://gatik.ai/">Gatik</a>, a startup developing an autonomous vehicle stack for B2B short-haul logistics; <a href="https://www.robust.ai/">Robust.AI</a>, a startup at work on an industrial-grade cognitive platform for robots; and <a href="https://www.helm.ai/">Helm.ai</a>, a maker of driverless car AI.</p>
<p>To get a better sense of what make a deal attractive to Fontinalis, as well as to understand how a venture firm in Detroit ensures that it&#8217;s top of mind for the founders it most wants to work with, we talked recently with Dan Ratliff, an investor with Fontinalis who joined the firm nearly seven years ago. Our chat has been edited lightly for length.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><strong>TC: Are you a native of Detroit?</strong></p>
<p>DR: I am a native Michigander. I grew up in the metro region; I went to Michigan State. I&#8217;ve been here my entire life, except for a year spent in Nashville for grad school, and when I graduated, I moved straight downtown [in Detroit].</p>
<p><strong>TC: From where does the name Fontinalis come?</strong></p>
<p>DR: It&#8217;s a Latin name and the name of an outside nature preserve club where Bill [Ford] cultivated a lot of his thoughts on conservation and spent a lot of his youth fly fishing. He also joked that there was no way this name was taken.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How much of the firm&#8217;s funding is from Ford Motor Co.?</strong></p>
<p>DR: Fontinalis is very much separate by design. We wanted to be independent and not a strategic VC or Bill&#8217;s family office, so from day one, we went to outside LPs and we pulled in 20 to 30 LPs in our first fund, including high-net worth [individuals], family offices, and some institutions. Ford wasn&#8217;t even an LP. The company has since come on, but not in a majority position. We also now have a handful of corporate investors, including an OEM that hasn&#8217;t been announced yet, and insurance companies. And we have family offices with ties to mobility and the transportation industry and which have a keen interest in how mobility evolves and impacts their businesses. We&#8217;ve raised $260 million to date across our funds.</p>
<p><strong>TC: That&#8217;s a surprisingly conservative amount in the current market. On the coasts, obviously, we&#8217;re seeing a money grab like no other.</strong></p>
<p>DR: We see this as multi-decade opportunity, but there is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem in the Midwest. There&#8217;s not as [ample] a base of angel investors. There are a handful of venture funds but not like on the coasts, where you have a lot of founders or people who&#8217;ve been part of companies where they&#8217;ve made a lot of money and understand the risk-reward profile. Here, [people are] more conservative; they might have made their wealth in more traditional, versus high-growth startup-type, industries.</p>
<p>I do think with Duo Security selling to Cisco [for $2.35 billion in 2018] and StockX&#8217;s awesome rise, we&#8217;re developing the right tailwinds to set up an ecosystem, but it requires a lot of different things, including people who are used to being at high-growth companies and are willing to take risks [in the form of equity grants and less] salary.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Fontinalis has a wide range of bets, including on a cognitive platform for robots? What&#8217;s the through-line?</strong></p>
<p>DR: The mission of the firm at a high level is to invest in companies and tech that impact the efficient movement of people and goods. Automotive is a component, but so are supply chains and logistics and AI and big data and their impact. So we&#8217;ll invest in all modes of transportation &#8212; road, rail, bike, air. We also invest in vertical technologies like cybersecurity and additive manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong>TC: These are mostly seed and Series A checks?</strong></p>
<p>DR: We invest in the A and B range, as well as in seed-stage startups and later-stage investments. We view ourselves as bringing the same value that a strategic investor might bring without necessarily the strings that might be attached because we work with a lot of the other corporate VCs and mobility-focused VCs, and we try to see if we can help on the [business development] side to get the startup in front of the right person at the right companies.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is there any special emphasis on trying to fund startups in Detroit and the broader Midwest?</strong></p>
<p>DR: Our mandate is not geographic specific. We have investments on both coasts, in Northeast Boston, in Tennessee [where Fontinalis&#8217;s portfolio company, FreightWaves, the market forecasting and analytics platform is based]. We have deals in Switzerland and Israel. We do look globally; we&#8217;re more concerned with making sure we can add value.</p>
<p><strong>TC: One of Fontinalis&#8217;s other founding partners, Chris Cheever, is in Boston. Has the firm ever considered relocating outside of Detroit?</strong></p>
<p>DR: No, two of our founding partners are based here. A lot of companies we&#8217;ve funded are coming, too, because of the infrastructure here on the manufacturing side and things like the Michigan Mobility Center and we can both facilitate a lot of those introductions as well as be a permanent &#8216;man on the ground&#8217; for companies that aren&#8217;t based here.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Does Detroit have the professional services businesses in place to accommodate startups?</strong></p>
<p>DR: In the last five years, we&#8217;ve seen a number of law firms [that work with startups] plant flags in Ann Arbor, and it&#8217;s encouraging to see.</p>
<p>Also, from a business standpoint, you have the University of Michigan&#8217;s Research Corridor and the automotive industry and OEM suppliers and access to mechanical and electrical engineers whose skill sets are as strong and competitive as anywhere in the country. Over the past five years, too, there has been a huge emphasis, including by city and state policymakers, [to strengthen Michigan&#8217;s positioning] including through the Office of Future Mobility and Electrification and Detroit&#8217;s economic development arm, which is bringing startups into the city. There are a lot of resources going in on the back of what you&#8217;ve seen on the real estate side and all that [billionaire investor] Dan Gilbert has done [for the city], including buying up skyscrapers and making them Class A office space and putting them back on the market.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I had the opportunity to talk with Dan about the quality of life there and he&#8217;s obviously a big proponent. </strong></p>
<p>DR: Michigan and Detroit are super unique. The suburbs feature really strong school systems, and living in Detroit proper is awesome. It feels like a startup of its own, with new restaurants opening up and new construction and people everywhere on patios, even while Detroit maintains its historic feel, with many buildings that are 100 years old. You also have the Great Lakes and skiing and the outdoors. You can draw comparisons to other startup hotbeds, but there are definite diamond-in-the-rough aspects to being in Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Anecdotally, does it feel like people who grew up there are staying, rather than heading off in other directions?</strong></p>
<p>DR: When I was an undergrad, 75% of people said, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to Chicago or New York.&#8217; That has changed. Now people are moving to downtown Detroit. There&#8217;s high-end real estate, a walkability aspect, and if you&#8217;re a sports or music fan, the access you have to things like that is unrivaled. You don&#8217;t have to plan anything because there are 10 different things to choose from on a Friday night, from theaters to stadiums to art galleries. There are a lot of things pulling in different types of people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European Union lawmakers who are drawing up rules for applying artificial intelligence are considering fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover (or €20M, if greater) for a set of prohibited use-cases, according to a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZaBPsfor_aHKNeeyXxk9uJfTru747EOn/view">leaked draft</a> of the AI regulation &#8212; reported earlier by <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/134201">Politico</a> &#8212; that&#8217;s expected to be officially unveiled next week.</p>
<p>The plan to regulate AI has been on the cards for a while. Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais/">February 2020</a> the European Commission published a white paper, sketching plans for regulating so-called &#8220;high risk&#8221; applications of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>At the time EU lawmakers were toying with a sectoral focus &#8212; envisaging certain sectors like energy and recruitment as vectors for risk. However that approach appears to have been rethought, per the leaked draft &#8212; which does not limit discussion of AI risk to particular industries or sectors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead, the focus is on compliance requirements for high risk AI applications, wherever they may occur (weapons/military uses are specifically excluded, however, as such use-cases fall outside the EU treaties). Although it&#8217;s not abundantly clear from this draft exactly how &#8216;high risk&#8217; will be defined.</p>
<p>The overarching goal for the Commission here is to boost public trust in AI, via a system of compliance checks and balances steeped in &#8220;EU values&#8221; in order to encourage uptake of so-called &#8220;trustworthy&#8221; and &#8220;human-centric&#8221; AI. So even makers of AI applications not considered to be &#8216;high risk&#8217; will still be encouraged to adopt codes of conduct &#8212; &#8220;to foster the voluntary application of the mandatory requirements applicable to high-risk AI systems&#8221;, as the Commission puts it.</p>
<p>Another chunk of the regulation deals with measures to support AI development in the bloc &#8212; pushing Member States to establish regulatory sandboxing schemes in which startups and SMEs can be proritized for support to develop and test AI systems before bringing them to market.</p>
<p>Competent authorities &#8220;shall be empowered to exercise their discretionary powers and levers of proportionality in relation to artificial intelligence projects of entities participating the sandbox, while fully preserving authorities’ supervisory and corrective powers,&#8221; the draft notes.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s high risk AI?</h2>
<p>Under the planned rules, those intending to apply artificial intelligence will need to determine whether a particular use-case is &#8216;high risk&#8217; and thus whether they need to conduct a mandatory, pre-market compliance assessment or not.</p>
<p>&#8220;The classification of an AI system as high-risk should be based on its intended purpose &#8212; which should refer to the use for which an AI system is intended, including the specific context and conditions of use and &#8212; and be determined in two steps by considering whether it may cause certain harms and, if so, the severity of the possible harm and the probability of occurrence,&#8221; runs one recital in the draft.</p>
<p>&#8220;A classification of an AI system as high-risk for the purpose of this Regulation may not necessarily mean that the system as such or the product as a whole would necessarily be considered as ‘high-risk’ under the criteria of the sectoral legislation,&#8221; the text also specifies.</p>
<p>Examples of &#8220;harms&#8221; associated with high-risk AI systems are listed in the draft as including: &#8220;the injury or death of a person, damage of property, systemic adverse impacts for society at large, significant disruptions to the provision of essential services for the ordinary conduct of critical economic and societal activities, adverse impact on financial, educational or professional opportunities of persons, adverse impact on the access to public services and any form of public assistance, and adverse impact on [European] fundamental rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several examples of high risk applications are also discussed &#8212; including recruitment systems; systems that provide access to educational or vocational training institutions; emergency service dispatch systems; creditworthiness assessment; systems involved in determining taxpayer-funded benefits allocation; decision-making systems applied around the prevention, detection and prosecution of crime; and decision-making systems used to assist judges.</p>
<p>So long as compliance requirements &#8212; such as establishing a risk management system and carrying out post-market surveillance, including via a quality management system &#8212; are met such systems would not be barred from the EU market under the legislative plan.</p>
<p>Other requirements include in the area of security and that the AI achieves consistency of accuracy in performance &#8212; with a stipulation to report to &#8220;any serious incidents or any malfunctioning of the AI system which constitutes a breach of obligations&#8221; to an oversight authority no later than 15 days after becoming aware of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;High-risk AI systems may be placed on the Union market or otherwise put into service subject to compliance with mandatory requirements,&#8221; the text notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mandatory requirements concerning high-risk AI systems placed or otherwise put into service on the Union market should be complied with taking into account the intended purpose of the AI system and according to the risk management system to be established by the provider.</p>
<p>&#8220;Among other things, risk control management measures identified by the provider should be based on due consideration of the effects and possible interactions resulting from the combined application of the mandatory requirements and take into account the generally acknowledged state of the art, also including as reflected in relevant harmonised standards or common specifications.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe sets out plan to boost data reuse and regulate &#8216;high risk&#8217; AIs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais/embed/#?secret=hX8dRFmbtU" data-secret="hX8dRFmbtU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Prohibited practices and biometrics</h2>
<p>Certain AI &#8220;practices&#8221; are listed as prohibited under Article 4 of the planned law, per this leaked draft &#8212; including (commercial) applications of mass surveillance systems and general purpose social scoring systems which could lead to discrimination.</p>
<p>AI systems that are designed to manipulate human behavior, decisions or opinions to a detrimental end (such as via dark pattern design UIs), are also listed as prohibited under Article 4; as are systems that use personal data to generate predictions in order to (detrimentally) target the vulnerabilities of persons or groups of people.</p>
<p>A casual reader might assume the regulation is proposing to ban, at a stroke, practices like behavioral advertising based on people tracking &#8212; aka the business models of companies like Facebook and Google. However that assumes adtech giants will accept that their tools have a detrimental impact on users.</p>
<p>On the contrary, their regulatory circumvention strategy is based on claiming the polar opposite; hence Facebook&#8217;s talk of &#8220;relevant&#8221; ads. So the text (as written) looks like it will be a recipe for (yet) more long-drawn out legal battles to try to make EU law stick vs the self-interested interpretations of tech giants.</p>
<p>The rational for the prohibited practices is summed up in an earlier recital of the draft &#8212; which states: &#8220;It should be acknowledged that artificial intelligence can enable new manipulative, addictive, social control and indiscriminate surveillance practices that are particularly harmful and should be prohibited as contravening the Union values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that the Commission has avoided proposing a ban on the use of facial recognition in public places &#8212; as it had apparently been considering, per a leaked draft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/eu-lawmakers-are-eyeing-risk-based-rules-for-ai-per-leaked-white-paper/">early last year</a>, before last year&#8217;s White Paper steered away from a ban.</p>
<p>In the leaked draft &#8220;remote biometric identification&#8221; in public places is singled out for &#8220;stricter conformity assessment procedures through the involvement of a notified body&#8221; &#8212; aka an &#8220;authorisation procedure that addresses the specific risks implied by the use of the technology&#8221; and includes a mandatory data protection impact assessment &#8212; vs most other applications of high risk AIs (which are allowed to meet requirements via self-assessment).</p>
<p>&#8220;Furthermore the authorising authority should consider in its assessment the likelihood and severity of harm caused by inaccuracies of a system used for a given purpose, in particular with regard to age, ethnicity, sex or disabilities,&#8221; runs the draft. &#8220;It should further consider the societal impact, considering in particular democratic and civic participation, as well as the methodology, necessity and proportionality for the inclusion of persons in the reference database.&#8221;</p>
<p>AI systems &#8220;that may primarily lead to adverse implications for personal safety&#8221; are also required to undergo this higher bar of regulatory involvement as part of the compliance process.</p>
<p>The envisaged system of conformity assessments for all high risk AIs is ongoing, with the draft noting: &#8220;It is appropriate that an AI system undergoes a new conformity assessment whenever a change occurs which may affect the compliance of the system with this Regulation or when the intended purpose of the system changes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For AI systems which continue to ‘learn’ after being placed on the market or put into service (i.e. they automatically adapt how functions are carried out) changes to the algorithm and performance which have not been pre-determined and assessed at the moment of the conformity assessment shall result in a new conformity<br />
assessment of the AI system,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>The carrot for compliant businesses is to get to display a &#8216;CE&#8217; mark to help them win the trust of users and friction-free access across the bloc&#8217;s single market.</p>
<p>&#8220;High-risk AI systems should bear the CE marking to indicate their conformity with this Regulation so that they can move freely within the Union,&#8221; the text notes, adding that: &#8220;Member States should not create obstacles to the placing on the market or putting into service of AI systems that comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU lawmakers are eyeing risk-based rules for AI, per leaked white paper&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/eu-lawmakers-are-eyeing-risk-based-rules-for-ai-per-leaked-white-paper/embed/#?secret=1HMCJtLL53" data-secret="1HMCJtLL53" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Transparency for bots and deepfakes</h2>
<p>As well as seeking to outlaw some practices and establish a system of pan-EU rules for bringing &#8216;high risk&#8217; AI systems to market safely &#8212; with providers expected to make (mostly self) assessments and fulfil compliance obligations (such as around the quality of the data-sets used to train the model; record-keeping/documentation; human oversight; transparency; accuracy) prior to launching such a product into the market and conduct ongoing post-market surveillance &#8212; the proposed regulation seeks shrink the risk of AI being used to trick people.</p>
<p>It does this by suggesting &#8220;harmonised transparency rules&#8221; for AI systems intended to interact with natural persons (aka voice AIs/chat bots etc); and for AI systems used to generate or manipulate image, audio or video content (aka deepfakes).</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain AI systems intended to interact with natural persons or to generate content may pose specific risks of impersonation or deception irrespective of whether they qualify as high-risk or not. In certain circumstances, the use of these systems should therefore be subject to specific transparency obligations without prejudice to the requirements and obligations for high-risk AI systems,&#8221; runs the text.</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular, natural persons should be notified that they are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious from the circumstances and the context of use. Moreover, users, who use an AI system to generate or manipulate image, audio or video content that appreciably resembles existing persons, places or events and would falsely appear to a reasonable person to be authentic, should disclose that the content has been artificially created or manipulated by labelling the artificial intelligence output accordingly and disclosing its artificial origin.</p>
<p>&#8220;This labelling obligation should not apply where the use of such content is necessary for the purposes of safeguarding public security or for the exercise of a legitimate right or freedom of a person such as for satire, parody or freedom of arts and sciences and subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of third parties.&#8221;</p>

<h2>What about enforcement?</h2>
<p>While the proposed AI regime hasn&#8217;t yet been officially unveiled by the Commission &#8212; so details could still change before next week &#8212; a major question mark looms over how a whole new layer of compliance around specific applications of (often complex) artificial intelligence can be effectively oversee and any violations enforced, especially given ongoing weaknesses in the enforcement of the EU&#8217;s data protection regime (which begun being applied back in 2018).</p>
<p>So while providers of high risk AIs are required to take responsibility for putting their system/s on the market (and therefore for compliance with all the various stipulations, which also include registering high risk AI systems in an EU database the Commission intends to maintain), the proposal leaves enforcement in the hands of Member States &#8212; who will be responsible for designating one or more national competent authorities to supervise application of the oversight regime.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen how this story plays out with the General Data Protection Regulation. The Commission itself has conceded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">GDPR enforcement is not consistently or vigorously applied</a> across the bloc &#8212; so a major question is how these fledgling AI rules will avoid the same <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/lack-of-big-tech-gdpr-decisions-looms-large-in-eu-watchdogs-annual-report/">forum-shopping fate</a>?</p>

<p>&#8220;Member States should take all necessary measures to ensure that the provisions of this Regulation are implemented, including by laying down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for their infringement. For certain specific infringements, Member States should take into account the margins and criteria set out in this Regulation,&#8221; runs the draft.</p>
<p>The Commission does add a caveat &#8212; about potentially stepping in in the event that Member State enforcement doesn&#8217;t deliver. But there&#8217;s no near term prospect of a different approach to enforcement, suggesting the same old pitfalls will likely appear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the objective of this Regulation, namely creating the conditions for an ecosystem of trust regarding the placing on the market, putting into service and use of artificial intelligence in the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union,&#8221; is the Commission&#8217;s back-stop for future enforcement failure.</p>
<p>The oversight plan for AI includes setting up a mirror entity akin to the GDPR&#8217;s European Data Protection Board &#8212; to be called the European Artificial Intelligence Board &#8212; which will similarly support application of the regulation by issuing relevant recommendations and opinions for EU lawmakers, such as around the list of prohibited AI practices and high-risk systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been about a year and a half since Amazon released the first Echo Buds. I reviewed them when they arrived, and they were, I don’t know, fine, I guess. They were a bit on the cheap side, facing some stiff competition in the category and, honestly, the idea of wearing Alexa on my head still isn’t super exciting to me.</p>
<p>But for a first attempt at the space, they weren’t bad. And now the company’s giving it a second go, with some tweaks to the original formula. Top of the list is a redesign that shrinks them 20% and makes them a bit lighter weight. The nozzle is smaller, which should make them more comfortable for longer periods, coupled with four ear tip sizes. The headphones are rated IPX4 for sweat and weather resistance.</p>

<p>Amazon has moved on from the predecessor’s Bose noise canceling to its own proprietary tech, which it says can effectively double V1. There’s also an optional case that supports wireless charging via Qi, à la AirPods. The white case, in particular, looks&#8230;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/apples-airpods-pro-set-a-pricey-new-standard-for-earbuds/">rather familiar</a>.</p>
<p>That case runs an extra $20 over the $120 asking price for the USB-C case. Though Amazon’s running a limited-time deal to get the standard for $100 and the wireless charging version for $120. They’re also throwing in six months of Amazon Music Unlimited and Audible Plus. The new buds are also available in white. They’re up for preorder today and start shipping in May.</p>

<p>Future software updates will bring a new VIP Filter to the headphones. Introduced on the Echo Frames, the feature lets users filter notifications from select senders. In addition to Alexa, the buds can also be set to access Siri or Google Assistant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Streaming media software maker <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a> announced today it has raised a $50 million growth equity round from existing investor Intercap ahead of its planned business expansion into rentals, purchases and subscription content. This is the first financing Plex has taken on since 2014 and is being partly used to purchase shares and options from Plex&#8217;s early seed investors and shareholders from prior acquisitions, and to give the company&#8217;s earliest employees a bit of liquidity. Of the $50 million raised, $15 million will be put to work as new growth capital.</p>
<p>The company declined to disclose its valuation as a result of the funding &#8212; technically Plex&#8217;s Series C &#8212; but says it resulted in a relatively low dilution for its existing investors who have stayed in, including Kleiner Perkins and Nexstar, for example. Meanwhile, some of its earliest investors were able to get a 10x return or greater on their shares.</p>
<p>As part of the round, Intercap chairman and CEO Jason Chapnik joined the board of directors as chairman, and Intercap president James Merkur also joined the board. Including this financing, Plex has raised more than $60 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To date, Plex has been cautious about fundraising because, as Plex CEO Keith Valory says, &#8220;we really hadn&#8217;t had to.&#8221; That is, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/29/plex-is-launching-its-own-ad-supported-video-service-starting-with-content-from-warner-bros-tv/">has been profitable</a> on its own.</p>
<p>But things have been changing at Plex in recent years. Though it has always catered to the home media enthusiast with its software for organizing movies, TV, music and photos on users&#8217; home networks, Plex more seriously began to go after the larger market of cord cutters with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/plex-becomes-a-low-cost-diy-streaming-tv-service/">its 2017 launch of a low-cost, DIY streaming TV service</a>. In the years since, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/plex-launches-a-free-ad-supported-streaming-service-in-over-200-countries/">expanded into free, ad-supported streaming</a> and last year took on rivals like ViacomCBS-owned Pluto TV with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/plex-launches-a-live-tv-service-with-over-80-free-channels-most-available-worldwide/">own launch of a live TV service</a>, also supported by ads.</p>

<p>Today, Plex now offers more than 20,000 free on-demand movies and shows and over 150 free live TV channels in 193 countries, alongside access to other content, including personal media libraries, streaming music and podcasts.</p>
<p>As it expanded the types of services it offers, it also lowered the barriers to entry for Plex newcomers. Users now no longer have to sign up for an account to access the ad-supported video or <a href="https://www.plex.tv/watch-free-tv/">live linear streaming</a> service, which impacts Plex&#8217;s business model.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137984" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137984" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137984" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="342" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg 3336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg?resize=768,386 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg?resize=680,342 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg?resize=1536,772 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1029 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137984" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Plex</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;That is much more tailored towards paid marketing &#8212; like getting integrated into the search capabilities for devices like Roku, Fire TV or Vizio, etc. But then, also, using [search engine marketing] and Facebook and other, even on-device paid marketing programs to get people to get in and start watching something,&#8221; says Valory. &#8220;We found that the kind of paid marketing and customer acquisition costs for that business is really efficient. We&#8217;ve been able to get profitable on that marketing investment really, really quickly,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>That model is what prompted Plex to consider raising capital to grow this aspect of its business and expand in new areas, as well.</p>
<p>That included managing subscription content and offering rentals and purchases &#8212; something<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/media-streamer-plex-to-add-subscription-channels-rentals-and-more/"> Plex began to talk about last year</a> as part of its roadmap, saying they could potentially arrive in 2020. But then COVID hit, and though streaming itself grew &#8212; particularly ad-supported video in April through June or July &#8212; some Plex employees were hit harder than others by the pandemic. And Plex also needed more time to ready the infrastructure involved.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now preparing to launch these efforts this year, perhaps initially with a video rental marketplace or a subscription aggregator. (Plex says it&#8217;s not sure which will get out of the gate first because both are being built simultaneously.)</p>
<p>With the subscription play, Plex isn&#8217;t looking just at selling subscriptions the way that say, Amazon or Apple do through Prime Video Channels or Apple TV Channels. It&#8217;s also considering deep linking technology to get users to their favorite streaming apps, including those from the big-name brands that otherwise wouldn&#8217;t want to be a part of someone else&#8217;s service. This could position Plex as a competitor to services like <a href="https://reelgood.com/">Reelgood</a>, which today allows users to track what they&#8217;re watching and get recommendations across all their streaming apps, not just within each individual app.</p>
<p>Plex&#8217;s video rental (and maybe purchases) marketplace, meanwhile, will be much like any other, offering users a chance to pay for content they couldn&#8217;t find a way to stream.</p>
<p>Both ideas fit in with Plex&#8217;s larger goal to become a one-stop shop for all your media needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always had a fairly audacious mission. You shouldn&#8217;t have to go to 20 different apps to get the content you care about. You should be able to go to one place and we should be able to do all that for you,&#8221; notes Valory.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1920030" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1920030" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1920030" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg 5120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1920030" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Plex</p></div></p>
<p>To fuel its growth on both this front and for its ad-supported businesses, Plex plans to use the funds to expand its now 100-person team with investments in marketing and monetization teams, as well as on the development side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, there&#8217;s still way more work to do in terms of amplifying the efforts on our performance and growth marketing and engagement,&#8221; Valory says. &#8220;I mean, the business is growing super fast, so we&#8217;ve done a pretty good job, to date, of building out the muscles to get new users in the pipeline for the AVOD business. There&#8217;s still a ton of work to do there, but a lot of the muscles that we&#8217;re building there will help in terms of the top-of-funnel and increasing engagement for the whole product,&#8221; he adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital transformation has been one of the biggest catchphrases of the past year, with many an organization forced to reckon with aging IT, a lack of digital strategy, or simply the challenges of growth after being faced with newly-remote workforces, customers doing everything online and other tech demands.</p>
<p>Now, a startup called <a href="https://upstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upstack</a> that has built a platform to help those businesses evaluate how to grapple with those next steps &#8212; including planning and costing out different options and scenarios, and then ultimately buying solutions &#8212; is announcing financing to do some growth of its own.</p>
<p>The New York startup has picked up funding of $50 million, money that it will be using to continue building out its platform and expanding its services business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is coming from <a href="https://www.berkshirepartners.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berkshire Partners</a>, and it&#8217;s being described as an &#8220;initial investment&#8221;. The firm, which makes private equity and late-stage growth investments, typically puts between $100 million and $1 billion in its portfolio companies so this could end up as a bigger number, especially when you consider the size of the market that Upstack is tackling: the cloud and internet infrastructure brokerage industry generates annual revenues &#8220;in excess of $70 billion,&#8221; the company estimates.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re asking about the valuation, but PitchBook notes that the median valuation in its deals is around $211 million. Upstack had previously raised around $35 million.</p>
<p>Upstack today already provides tools to large enterprises, government organizations, and smaller businesses to compare offerings and plan out pricing for different scenarios covering a range of IT areas, including <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">private, p</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ublic and hybrid cloud deployments; data center investments; network connectivity; business continuity and mobile services, and the plan is to bring in more categories to the mix, including unified communications and security.</span></p>
<p>Notably, Upstack itself is profitable and names a lot of customers that themselves are tech companies &#8212; they include Cisco, Accenture, cloud storage company Backblaze, Riverbed and Lumen &#8212; a mark of how digital transformation and planning for it are not necessarily a core competency even of digital businesses, but especially those that are not technology companies. It says it has helped complete over 3,700 IT projects across 1,000 engagements to date.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upstack was founded to bring enterprise-grade advisory services to businesses of all sizes,&#8221; said Christopher Trapp, founder and CEO, in a statement. &#8220;Berkshire&#8217;s expertise in the data center, connectivity and managed services sectors aligns well with our commitment to enabling and empowering a world-class ecosystem of technology solutions advisors with a platform that delivers higher value to their customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The core of the Upstack&#8217;s proposition is a platform that system integrators, or advisors, plus end users themselves, can use to design and compare pricing for different services and solutions. This is an unsung but critical aspect of the ecosystem: We love to hear and write about all the interesting enterprise technology that is being developed, but the truth of the matter is that buying and using that tech is never just a simple click on a &#8220;buy&#8221; button.</p>
<p>Even for smaller organizations, buying tech can be a hugely time-consuming task. It involves evaluating different companies and what they have to offer &#8212; which can differ widely in the same category, and gets more complex when you start to compare different technological approaches to the same problem.</p>
<p>It also includes the task of designing solutions to fit one&#8217;s particular network. And finally, there are the calculations that need to be made to determine the real cost of services once implemented in an organization. It also gives users the ability to present their work, which also forms a critical part of the evaluating and decision-making process. When you think about all of this, it&#8217;s no wonder that so many organizations have opted to follow the &#8220;if it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; school of digital strategy.</p>
<p>As technology has evolved, the concept of digital transformation itself has become more complicated, making tools like Upstack&#8217;s more in demand both by companies and the people they hire to do this work for them. Upstack also employs a group of about 15 advisors &#8212; consultants &#8212; who also provide insight and guidance in the procurement process, and it seems some of the funding will also be used to invest in expanding that team.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, the model of balancing technology with human experts is one used by other enterprise startups that are built around the premise of helping businesses procure technology: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/enterprise-cybersecurity-startup-bluevoyant-raises-82-5m-at-a-430m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlueVoyant</a>, a security startup that has built a platform to help businesses manage and use different security services, also retains advisors who are experts in that field.)</p>
<p>The advisors are part of the business model: Upstack&#8217;s customers can either pay Upstack a consulting fee to work with its advisors, or Upstack receives a commission from suppliers that a company ends up using, having evaluated and selected them via the Upstack platform.</p>
<p>The company competes with traditional systems integrators and consultants, but it seems that the fact that it has built a tech platform that some of its competitors also use is one reason why it&#8217;s caught the eye of investors, and also seen strong growth.</p>
<p>Indeed, when you consider the breadth of services that a company might use within their infrastructure &#8212; whether it&#8217;s software to run sales or marketing, or AI to run a recommendation for products on a site, or business intelligence or RPA &#8212; it will be interesting to see how and if Upstack considers deeper moves into these areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upstack has quickly become a leader in a large, rapidly growing and highly fragmented market,&#8221; said Josh Johnson, principal at Berkshire Partners, in a statement. “Our experience has reinforced the importance of the agent channel to enterprises designing and procuring digital infrastructure. Upstack&#8217;s platform accelerates this digital transformation by helping its advisors better serve their enterprise customers. We look forward to supporting Upstack&#8217;s continued growth through M&amp;A and further investment in the platform.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://outschool.com/#abkn97lfgv">Outschool</a>, a marketplace providing small-group, virtual after-school activities for children has raised a $75 million Series C led by Coatue and Tiger Global Management. TechCrunch first learned of the round from sources familiar with the transaction; the company confirmed the deal to TechCrunch later today.</p>
<p>The new funding values Outschool’s at $1.3 billion, around 4 times higher than its roughly $320 million valuation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/outschool-newly-profitable-raises-a-45m-series-b-for-virtual-small-group-classes/">set less than a year ago.</a></p>
<p>To date, Outschool has raised $130 million in venture capital to date, inclusive of its new round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s valuation growth curve is steep for any startup, let alone an edtech concern that saw the majority of its growth during the pandemic. But while CEO and co-founder Amir Nathoo says his company’s new valuation is partially a reflection of today’s fundraising frenzy, he thinks revenue sustainability is a key factor in his company&#8217;s recent fundraise.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wZrfGDde1B"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/how-is-edtech-spending-its-extra-capital/">How is edtech spending its extra capital?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How is edtech spending its extra capital?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/how-is-edtech-spending-its-extra-capital/embed/#?secret=wZrfGDde1B" data-secret="wZrfGDde1B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new unicorn’s core product is after school classes for entertainment or supplemental studies, on an ongoing or one-off basis. As the company has grown, ongoing classes have grown from 10% of its business to 50% of its business, implying that the startup is generating more reliable revenue over time.</p>
<p>The change from one-off classes to enduring engagements could be good for the company and its students. On the former, recurring revenue is music to investor ears. On the latter, students need repetition to develop close relationships with a course and a group. Ongoing classes about debate or a weekly zombie dance class makes for a stickier experience.</p>
<p>Nathoo says everyone always asks what the most popular classes are, but said it continues to change since its main clientele &#8211; kids &#8211; have evolving favorites. One week it might be math, the other it might be minecraft and architecture.</p>
<p>Its changing revenue profile helped Outschool generate more than $100 million in bookings in 2020, compared to $6 million in 2019 and just $500,000 in 2017. Nathoo declined to share the company’s expectations for 2021 beyond “projecting to grow aggressively.”</p>
<p>Outschool reached brief positive cash flow last year as a result of massive growth in bookings, but Nathoo shared that that has since changed.</p>
<p>“My goal is to always stay within touching distance of profit,” he said. “But given the fast change in the market, it makes sense to invest aggressively into opportunities that will make sense in the long-term.”</p>
<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nathoo expects to grow Outschool’s staff from 110 people to 200 by the end of the year, with a specific focus on international growth. In 2020, Outschool launched in Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the UK, so hiring will continue there and elsewhere.</p>
<p>On the flip side, Outschool isn&#8217;t  teachers at the same clip it was at the height of the pandemic in the United States. When the pandemic started, Outschool had 1,000 teachers on its platform. Within months, Outschool grew to host 10,000 teachers, a screening process that the founder explained was resource-heavy but vital. Outschool makes more money if teachers join the platform full-time: teachers pocket 70% of the price they set for classes, while Outschool gets the other 30% of income. But, Nathoo views the platform as more of a supplement to traditional education. Instead of scaling revenue by convincing teachers to come on full-time, the CEO is growing by adding more part-time teachers to the platform.</p>
<p>Similar to how Airbnb created a <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/update-on-the-airbnb-host-endowment-and-our-commitment-to-communities/">host endowment fund</a> to share its returns with the people who made its platform work, Outschool has dedicated 2% of its fundraise to creating a similar program to reward teachers on its platform in the event of liquidity.</p>
<p>One of Outschool&#8217;s most ambitious goals is, ironically, to go in school. While some startups have found success selling to schools amid the pandemic, district sales cycles and tight budgets continue to be a difficult challenge for scaling purposes. Still, the startup wants to make its way into students’ lives through contracts with schools and employers, which could help low income families access the platform. Nathoo says enterprise sales is a small part of its business, but the strategy began just last year as part of COVID-19 response. It is currently piloting its B2B offering with a number of schools.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Teachers are leaving schools. Will they come to startups next?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teachers-are-leaving-schools-will-they-come-to-startups-next/embed/#?secret=LE0dqSlett" data-secret="LE0dqSlett" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Outschool will also consider acquiring early-stage startups focused on direct-to-consumer learning in international markets. While no acquisitions have been made by the startup to date, consolidation in the edtech sector broadly is heating up.</p>
<p>Nathoo stressed that Outschool’s continued growth, even as schools reopen, has de-risked the company from post-pandemic worries.</p>
<p>“There’s going to be a big spike of in-person activities because everyone is going to want to do that at once,” he said. “But then we’re going to settle at some more even distribution because the future of education is hybrid.”</p>
<p>He added that Outschool’s ethos around online learning hasn’t changed since conception. The company has never seen opportunity in the for-credit, subject-matter digital education sector, and instead has focused more on supplemental ways to support students after school.</p>
<p>“That’s the piece of the education system that is underserved and that was missing,” he said. “The advantages of online learning will remain in the convenience, the cost, and the variety of what you can get that isn’t always available locally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Hampus Jakobsson, Heidi Lindvall, and Joel Larsson, all well-known players in the European venture ecosystem, began talking about their new firm <a href="https://www.paleblue.vc/#section-0">Pale Blue Dot</a>, they began by looking at the problems with venture capital.</p>
<p>For the three entrepreneurs and investors, whose resumes included co-founding companies and accelerators like The Astonishing Tribe (Jakobsson) and Fast Track Malmö (Lindvall and Larsson) and working as a venture partner at BlueYard Capital (Jakobsson again), the problems were clear.</p>
<p>Their first thesis was that all investment funds should be impact funds, and be taking into account ways to effect positive change; their second thesis was that since all funds should be impact funds, what would be their point of differentiation &#8212; that is, where could they provide the most impact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The three young investors hit on climate change as the core mission and ran with it.</p>
<p>As it was closing on €53 million ($63.3 million) last year, the firm also made its first investments in <a href="https://www.phytoformlabs.com/">Phytoform</a>, a London headquartered company creating new crops using computational biology and synbio; <a href="https://www.usepatch.com/">Patch</a>, a San Francisco-based carbon-offsetting platform that finances both traditional and frontier “carbon sequestration” methods; and <a href="http://www.20tree.ai/">20tree.ai</a>, an Amsterdam-based startup, using machine learning and satellite data to understand trees to lower the risk of forest fires and power outages.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XlsrsctA8e"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/pale-blue-dot/">Pale Blue Dot is a new early-stage fund backing &#8216;climate-focused&#8217; startups in Europe</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pale Blue Dot is a new early-stage fund backing &#8216;climate-focused&#8217; startups in Europe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/pale-blue-dot/embed/#?secret=XlsrsctA8e" data-secret="XlsrsctA8e" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now they&#8217;ve raised another €34 million and seven more investments on their path to doing between 30 and 35 deals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These investments primarily focus on Europe and include <a href="https://www.veat.se/">Veat</a>, a European vegetarian prepared meal company; <a href="https://madefrom.io/">Madefrom</a>, a still-in-stealth company angling to make everyday products more sustainable; <a href="https://www.hackyourcloset.com/">HackYourCloset</a>, a clothing rental company leveraging fast fashion to avoid landfilling clothes; <a href="https://hier.in/">Hier</a>, a fresh food delivery service; <a href="https://www.cirplus.com/en">Cirplus</a>, a marketplace for recycled plastics trading; and <a href="https://www.overstory.ai/">Overstory</a>, which aims to prevent wildfires by giving utilities a view into vegetation around their assets. </span></p>
<p>The team expects to be primarily focused on Europe, with a few opportunistic investments in the U.S., and intends to invest in companies that are looking to change systems rather than directly affect consumer behavior. For instance, a Pale Blue Dot investment likely wouldn&#8217;t include e-commerce filters for more sustainable shopping, but potentially could include investments in sustainable consumer products companies.</p>
<p>The size of the firm&#8217;s commitments will range up to €1 million and will look to commit to a lot of investments. That&#8217;s by design, said Jakobsson. &#8220;Climate is so many different fields that we didn&#8217;t want to do 50% of the fund in food or 50% of the fund in materials,&#8221; he said. Also, the founders know their skillsets, which are primarily helping early stage entrepreneurs scale and making the right connections to other investors that can add value.</p>
<p>&#8220;In every deal we&#8217;ve gotten in co-investors that add particular, amazing, value while we still try to be the shepherds and managers and sherpas,&#8221; Jakobsson said. &#8220;We&#8217;re the ones that are going to protect the founder from the hell-rain of investor opinions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another point of differentiation for the firm are its limited partners. Jakobsson said they rejected capital from oil companies in favor of founders and investors from the tech community that could add value. These include <a href="https://primamateria.com/">Prima Materia</a>, the investment vehicle for Spotify founder Daniel Ek; the founders of Supercell, Zendesk, TransferWise and DeliveryHero are also backing the firm. So too, is Albert Wenger, a managing partner at <a href="https://www.usv.com/people/albert-wenger/">Union Square Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>The goal, simply, is to be the best early stage climate fund in Europe.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to be <em>the</em> European climate fund,&#8221; Lindvall said. &#8220;This is where we can make most of the difference.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.connectedcannabisco.com">Connected Cannabis Co.</a> was founded in 2009 and has since grown to become a leading cultivator of designer cannabis strains. Today, the company announced $30 million in debt and equity financing. This comes after the company raised a $25 million Series A in 2019. The new round was led by existing investors including Navy Capital and One Tower Group. Emerald Park Capital, an affiliate of Bryant Park Capital, and Presidio View Capital also participated.</p>
<p>Currently, Connected Cannabis Co. operates cultivation and retail facilities in California and Arizona. With the additional financing, it intends to expand elsewhere. The company says it plans on focusing on states with robust cannabis cultures and promising outlook for growth such as Nevada and Michigan.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to bring Emerald Park Capital and Presidio into the Connected family and welcome back our long-term partners that have supported our company’s mission from the very beginning,” said Sam Ghods, CEO of Connected. “We are steadfast in our development of new, best-in-class genetics and our production of top-quality flower that has resulted in impressive growth and unwavering customer loyalty. That same commitment and quality that we’ve prided ourselves on from day one will stay with us as we enter additional states. We look forward to bringing our true product and brand to consumers in new markets &#8211; that is our highest priority every time we look at expansion.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Connected Cannabis is among a growing number of cannabis-focused companies amassing a war chest ahead of expanding outside of select regions. As more states in the United States legalize cannabis, more companies are exploring expansion options. Strict federal regulations often slow the process and make it cumbersome for cultivators like Connected to operate in different states, which often have different regulations and federal law prohibits interstate commerce.</p>
<p>Growing cannabis is easy. The plant is hardy is hearty and forgiving. Growing cannabis at scale is anything but hearty and forgiving, which is why Connected turned to additional funding to fuel its national growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sheer volume of people migrating to Austin from all over the country, but particularly from the San Francisco Bay Area, has been making headlines for a while now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One result of this continued migration is a steady surge in housing prices due to increased demand and low inventory that </span><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2021/02/25/abor-report-austin-housing-inventory-almost-zero.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dropped to nearly zero</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year. Now, </span><a href="https://www.homebound.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homebound</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Santa Rosa, California-based tech-enabled homebuilding startup, is entering the Austin market with the goal of helping ease some of the pain felt in the city by offering an alternative to buying existing homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homebound has raised about $73 million over the years from the likes of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Ventures, Fifth Wall, Khosla, Sound Ventures, Atomic and Thrive Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It raised </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/homebound-a-tech-enabled-general-contractor-raises-35m-to-rebuild-after-wildfires/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $35 million Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last April and then closed on a $20 million convertible note late last year. CEO Nikki Pechet and Atomic managing partner </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jack-abraham"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack Abraham</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> founded the company in 2017 after Abraham lost his home to wildfires.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially serving as a virtual general contractor, Homebound combines technology and a network for “vetted” and licensed building “experts” to manage the new home construction from the design phase to completion. The startup has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">developed tools to track and manage hundreds of unique tasks associated with building a home.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="f3siV0jcPT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/this-is-a-good-time-to-start-a-proptech-company/">This is a good time to start a proptech company</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;This is a good time to start a proptech company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/this-is-a-good-time-to-start-a-proptech-company/embed/#?secret=f3siV0jcPT" data-secret="f3siV0jcPT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until this point, Homebound has been focused on helping homeowners navigate the challenges and complexities of rebuilding after wildfires in California. But this month, Homebound will be expanding to Austin, its first non-disaster market, with the goal of taking learnings from those rebuilds and applying the same “streamlined, tech-enabled building process” to make custom homebuilding an option for local homeowners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked with Homebound&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, Nikki Pechet, to learn more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Homebound, she said, the company is out to serve as a “next gen” homebuilder to make it possible “for anyone, anywhere to build a home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin’s housing market is definitely overheated, with homes going 10-30% above asking in some cases (I should know, I live here).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Homeowners have been reaching out to us from across the country asking us to come to their market,” Pechet said. “We’re already seeing Austin grow faster than any of our other markets did in their early days. It’s going to be a huge market for us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a model Pechet envisions replicating in other cities with similar housing supply issues such as Miami, Tampa, Raleigh and Charlotte.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is just the start,” Pechet said. “We’re taking the platform to markets across the country to help exactly with this issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company starts by helping a potential homeowner identify land they want to build on, or help them find a lot among the inventory Homebound has already built up. From there, it can help with everything from architectural plans to design to actual construction via its platform. Homebound offers a set of plans for people to choose from, with varying levels of customization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building costs for a typical single-family home in the Austin area will start around $300,000 depending on the size, complexity of house, lot size and location. That does not include land cost. Some people are opting to build second units on existing properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In most cases, people can build a new home for less than they can pay for an existing home just because of the dynamics,” Pechet said.</span></p>

<p><strong>So this is your chance to <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">put your cities on the Techcrunch Map</a>!</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re like to hear from founders and investors. We are particularly interested in hearing from <strong>diverse</strong> founders and investors. These are our humble suggestions for the cities we&#8217;d most like to hear from:</p>
<p>Birmingham<br />
Brighton<br />
Bristol &amp; Bath<br />
Cambridge<br />
Cardiff<br />
Liverpool<br />
Manchester<br />
Newcastle<br />

<p>The more founders/investors we hear from in a particular city, the more likely it is that city will be featured in TechCrunch.</p>
<p>This is the follow-up to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/the-great-techcrunch-survey-of-europes-vcs-be-featured-in-our-survey/">huge survey of investors</a> (see also below) we’ve done over the last six or more months, largely in capital cities.</p>
<p>These formed part of a broader series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys">surveys we’re doing regularly for ExtraCrunch</a>, our subscription service that unpacks key issues for startups and investors.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">first wave of surveys</a>, the cities we wrote about were largely capitals. You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">see them listed here</a>.</p>
<p>This time, we will be surveying founders and investors in Europe’s other cities to capture how European hubs are growing, from the perspective of the people on the ground.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how your city’s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and generally how your city will evolve.</p>
<p>We leave submissions mostly unedited and are generally looking for at least one or two paragraphs in answers to the questions.</p>
<p><strong>So if you are a tech startup founder or investor in one of these cities please <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">fill out our survey form here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email <a href="mailto:mike@techcrunch.com">mike@techcrunch.com</a> and/or reply on Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/mikebutcher">@mikebutcher</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Offering a respite from processed foods for the richest 20% of Americans, <a href="https://simplefeast.com/us">Simple Feast</a> has landed on U.S. shores with a mission to expand its presence on the back of $45 million in financing from investors.</p>
<p>The European startup is looking to take a page from the shouty LIVEKINDLY Collective playbook and take on the U.S. market with gourmet prepared meals that come with a gourmet price tag and a mission to make Americans eat less meat by proffering more tasty and delicious vegetarian options.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a strategy that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/livekindly-screams-its-way-to-the-top-of-new-plant-brands-with-the-close-of-a-335-million-round/">netted LIVEKINDLY Collective&#8217;s business $335 million</a> in a recent round of funding, making it one of the most well capitalized new entrants in the vegetarian food brand category.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XFeOl15a0e"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/livekindly-screams-its-way-to-the-top-of-new-plant-brands-with-the-close-of-a-335-million-round/">LIVEKINDLY screams its way to the top of new plant brands with the close of a $335 million round</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;LIVEKINDLY screams its way to the top of new plant brands with the close of a $335 million round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/livekindly-screams-its-way-to-the-top-of-new-plant-brands-with-the-close-of-a-335-million-round/embed/#?secret=XFeOl15a0e" data-secret="XFeOl15a0e" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a general health problem that&#8217;s coming mostly from what we put in our mouth,&#8221; said Jakob Jønck, the company&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive.</p>
<p>For folks in the U.S. who can afford it, Simple Feast is offering packaged meal kits with menus developed by chefs from some of the world&#8217;s highest end restaurants &#8212; place like French Laundry in California or Noma in Norway, where meals can run roughly $350 per-person.</p>
<p>A selection of three prepared meals for two-to-three people will run customers around $98 per-week and for a family of four or five that number jumps to $159 per-week.</p>
<p>Simple Feast&#8217;s foray into the US market represents just a small portion of the company&#8217;s total offerings. In the Nordic region the company offers about 30 different products all targeting people who want to reduce the amount of meat they eat.</p>
<p>Investors certainly love the company&#8217;s offering, because, as Jønck says, the products probably represent the highest margin in the meal kit category.</p>
<p>Those financiers include firms like the European venture capitalists Balderton Capital and Kinnevik, and New York-based 14W.</p>
<p>As for the company&#8217;s customers, they&#8217;re mostly moms with kids whose income puts them in the top 20% of the population. While they may be far more wealthy than the hoi polloi, Jønck said they still suffer from exposure to the worst aspects of America&#8217;s industrial food machine &#8212; highly processed foods that are causing an explosion in chronic health conditions like diabetes and obesity.</p>
<p>Data from places like the Rand Institute indicate that in America, the burden of insufficient nutrition and the chronic conditions that stem from that are disproportionately affecting low income and middle income families.</p>
<p>Health is a problem in the U.S. with $794 billion per year estimated to be lost in productivity between 2016 and 2030. <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20170817.061561/full/">An article from HealthAffairs</a> cited research from the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies estimates stating that <a href="http://jointcenter.org/sites/default/files/Economic%20Burden%20of%20Health%20Inequalities%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">health inequities and premature death cost the US economy $309.3 billion a year</a>.</p>
<p>However, these costs are primarily born by the poorest Americans, particularly minorities. &#8220;People of color <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/state-local-programs/reach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">face higher rates of diabetes, obesity, stroke, heart disease, and cancer</a> than whites,&#8221; the HealthAffairs article says.</p>
<p>Simple Feast is working to correct that, says Jønck. The company&#8217;s European packaged prepared meals available in retail stores cost around $15, he said, and the company will offer salaries far above the minimum wage in the U.S. to do its part in ameliorating some of the wealth disparity in the country.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a general play on an industry that needs to change for the ground up. This system needs to change,&#8221; Jønck said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://slicelife.com">Slice</a>, a startup that helps independent pizzerias build an online business, has raised another $40 million in Series D funding.</p>
<p>The round was led by Cross Creek, with participation from KKR, GGV Capital and Primary Ventures, as well as Twitter&#8217;s former CEO Dick Costolo and former COO Adam Bain (through their firm 01 Advisors).</p>
<p>Last spring, the startup announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/slice-series-c/">a $43 million Series C</a>. Why not raise more money this time? Founder and CEO Ilir Sela described this as &#8220;a quick round&#8221; to get Costolo and Bain  on-board as investors. He also suggested there may be additional fundraising conversations in the not-too-distant future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Slice has emerged as the leader in powering these types of small businesses that have been serving our communities for decades,” Bain said in a statement. “We look forward to working with Ilir and the incredible team at Slice to marry our significant operating and business-scaling experience with Slice&#8217;s focus on enabling economic growth in this category.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slice has built a mobile app and website for ordering from local pizzerias, but it also provides tools so they can build their own websites, run marketing campaigns, improve their search engine optimization and more. Slice only charges those pizzerias a fixed $2.25 per order, and last fall it even <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201028005373/en/Slice-Becomes-First-to-Remove-Fees-to-Shops-on-Orders-Under-10-Challenges-All-Online-Ordering-Services-to-Create-Fairer-Fee-Structures">removed the fee for orders under $10</a>.</p>

<p>The company continues to expand its products and services with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/slice-is-launching-a-point-of-sale-system-for-pizzerias/">the recent launch of a point-of-sale system for pizzerias called Slice Register</a>, as well as a cross-pizzeria loyalty program called Slice Rewards.</p>
<p>Some of this might sound a bit niche — a POS system, just for pizzerias? — but when I brought this up with Sela, he replied, &#8220;I love it when people say that, because then they continue to stay out of the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slice already has 15,000 pizzerias on the platform, with plans to increase that number to 20,000 at the end of the year. He added that although the current addressable market consists of 57,000 independent and small chain U.S. shops, with <a href="https://www.accelerate.slicelife.com">the Slice Accelerate program </a>(where the startup provides select pizzerias with $15,000 worth of technology and services) &#8220;there could be 100,000 in the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Accelerate, we’re taking inefficient pizza shops who are predominantly offline and helping them realize their vision for their brand,&#8221; he continued. That might mean improving an existing location, or it might mean launching new ones. In fact, he said the new program has already helped to revamp <a href="https://slicelife.com/restaurants/ny/staten-island/10305/pizza-mia-staten-island/menu">Pizza Mia in Staten Island</a> and will work with Crown Heights-based <a href="https://slicelife.com/restaurants/ny/brooklyn/11225/billy-s-pizza-pasta/menu">Billy&#8217;s Pizza &amp; Pasta</a> to open a second location.</p>
<p>&#8220;I definitely think that long term, there’s a big question whether our very unique model could be applied to other verticals,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think it can, but it would be a mistake to move into those verticals today, because of the opportunity that it exists in pizza.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://wire.com/en/">Wire</a>, the end-to-end encrypted messaging app and service, has raised a $21 million Series B funding round led by UVC Partners. As the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/messaging-app-wire-confirms-8-2m-raise-responds-to-privacy-concerns-after-moving-holding-company-to-the-us/">said</a> a couple of years ago, the company is focusing on the enterprise market more than ever.</p>
<p>While Wire started as a consumer app, it never managed to attract hundreds of millions of customers like other messaging apps. That doesn’t mean that Wire is a bad product.</p>
<p>The app lets you securely talk with other people using text messages, photos, videos and voice messages. You can also start a video call and send files with other users. Wire supports both one-to-one conversations as well as rooms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Everything is end-to-end encrypted by default, which means that the company can’t decrypt your conversations, can’t hand them over to a court or can’t expose your conversations to a potential hacker. You can also view the source code <a href="https://github.com/wireapp">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>In 2019, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/messaging-app-wire-confirms-8-2m-raise-responds-to-privacy-concerns-after-moving-holding-company-to-the-us/">told TechCrunch</a> that it would open a holding company in the U.S. to raise some funding. The idea was to double down on enterprise customers to find a clear path toward profitability. And this focus hasn’t changed since then.</p>
<p>“If I think back on the evolution of the business &#8211; three years ago we had zero revenue and zero customers &#8211; whereas today we’re announcing a B round and we have clearly established a well-recognised enterprise brand amongst the likes of Gartner, which is one of the things I am extremely proud of,” Wire’s CEO Morten Brogger told me.</p>
<p>“I also think that with the focus on a revenue-generating, enterprise business, we avoid situations like WhatsApp, where the only model you can ultimately turn to is monetising data,” he added.</p>
<p>And it seems to be working well when it comes to revenue growth. Right now, Wire has 1,800 customers. The number of customers has increased by almost 50% over the past year.</p>
<p>The company focuses on large customers, such as big corporations and government customers with a ton of potential users. Five G7 governments are currently using Wire. Overall, revenue has tripled in 2020.</p>
<p>In addition to working on Messaging Layer Security (MLS), Wire has been focused on improving conference calls and real-time interactions. The company believes messaging apps and real-time collaboration apps are slowly converging. And the startup wants to offer a service that works well across various scenarios.</p>
<p>You can also expect more end-to-end encrypted services in the collaboration space. Wire is still relatively small with 90 employees, which means it has room to grow and iterate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://stndenergy.com/">Standard Energy</a>, a vanadium ion battery developer, announced today it has raised a $8.9 million Series C from SoftBank Ventures Asia. The South Korea-based company says its batteries’ advantages over lithium ion include less risk of ignition and the ease of sourcing vanadium. The latter is an important selling point, as electric vehicle makers <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/08/the-us-is-facing-a-lithium-ion-battery-shortage-with-ev-growth.html">face a potential shortage of lithium ion batteries</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of serving as a replacement for lithium ion batteries, however, Standard Energy chief executive officer Bu Gi Kim said they complement each other. Vanadium ion batteries have high energy, performance and safety, but they are not as compact as lithium ion batteries.</p>
<p>Lithium ion batteries will continue to be used in hardware that needs to be mobile, such as electric vehicles or consumer devices like smartphones, but vanadium ion batteries are suited to “stationary” customers, like wind and solar power plants or ultra-fast charging stations for electric vehicles (Kim said Standard Energy is scheduled to ship its batteries to an ultra-fast charging station in Seoul soon).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Founded in 2013 by researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Standard Energy has raised a total of $22.5 million. One of its main potential customers is the energy storage systems (ESS) sector, which the company says is expected to grow from $8 billion to $35 billion in the next five years.</p>
<p>“A large number of renewable energy projects have slowed or even stopped in many places due to the unstable battery performance of lithium ion. VIB cannot be as compact as lithium ion. However, ESS projects or solutions including renewable energy plants provide enough space for our products to be integrated into their systems,” said Kim.</p>
<p>Standard Energy has already performed a total of over one million battery testing hours, including in a lab, at a certified battery performance test site and in actual operations. Kim said the company is confident its performance data will convince customers to adopt vanadium ion batteries.</p>
<p>In a press statement, SoftBank Ventures Asia senior partner Daniel Kang said, “The existing ESS market was in a state of imbalance due to the rapidly growing demand, and safety and efficiency issues of products. Standard Energy is expected to create new standards for the global ESS market through its innovative material and design technology with massive manufacturing capabilities.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a continent with such stark inequality, Africa has seen limited innovation to increase access to healthcare and reduce healthcare delivery costs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, there has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been continued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investment in traditional care models despite the overwhelming evidence of inefficiency and escalating costs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic also laid these problems bare, exposing the vulnerabilities of the continent&#8217;s healthcare system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health tech startup <a href="https://www.quromedical.co.za/">Quro Medical</a> is trying to scale alternative models for African healthcare starting from its home country, South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which provides services to manage ill patients in the comfort of their homes, is emerging from stealth to announce the close of its $1.1 million round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kenya-based Enza Capital and South African VC firm Mohau Equity Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quro Medical </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/dr-vuyane-mhlomi-mbchb-mba-dphil-b4a31537"> Dr Vuyane Mhlomi</a>, <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/zikho-pali-b2254b68">Zikho Pali</a> and <a href="https://jrmcornish.github.io/">Rob Cornish</a> in 2018. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Mhlomi understood the pressing need for South African healthcare innovation from his own experience before and after he became a doctor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that hospitals in Africa experience excessive demands, which places strain on bed capacity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the same time, it hinders effective patient treatment and recovery. Raised in Cape Town by his parents, Mhlomi experienced this firsthand. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">His parents suffered from chronic health conditions and he had to spend hours in clinics and hospitals waiting to see doctors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, an opportunity to study medicine took him to the University of Oxford. Upon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> completion, he returned to South Africa where he knew the problem he faced </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was one to solve, hence Quro Medical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were connected by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our belief that the private healthcare sector can and should be doing more to shoulder the burden of healthcare provision in this country and on the continent generally,&#8221; Mhlomi told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These escalating costs are the primary barrier to accessing healthcare in the private sector, leaving an overwhelming burden on our public health system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO argues that acute patient care at home leads to better clinical outcomes and improved patient experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the principle on which Quro Medical is established. In the long run, it wants to build the largest virtual hospital ward in Africa, with superior clinical outcomes to conventional care at a lower cost</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2138225 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-142.png?w=680" alt="Quro Medical" width="680" height="294" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-142.png 1311w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-142.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-142.png?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-142.png?resize=768,332 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-142.png?resize=680,294 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-142.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike hospitals, getting healthcare at home can feel safer, which is an extra proposition for Quro Medical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to COO Pali, apart from hospitals&#8217; high costs, patients are also at risk of getting hospital-acquired infections and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while it might </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">appear that Quro Medical is offering the same old traditional home care with a mix of telemedicine service, that&#8217;s not precisely the case</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pali says the company incorporates clinical data and remote healthcare monitoring to provide real-time, data-driven clinical interventions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are admitted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the company&#8217;s care in lieu of a general ward hospital admission</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Quro Medical makes revenue from filing a claim with medical aid and insurance companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">paid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via reimbursement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The healthtech startup also collects out-of-pocket payments from patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic reinforced the company&#8217;s importance in offering remote patient monitoring services, a significant aspect of its business that garnered a check from Enza Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As our collective healthcare systems struggle to care for patients beyond the walls of a hospital, which we’ve seen exacerbated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote patient monitoring and healthcare delivery will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">undoubtedly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> form a core part of the lasting solution,” said <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/mikemompi">Mike Mompi</a>, partner and CEO at the firm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, this period has also seen health tech startups offering out-of-hospital services struggle to have their services reimbursed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So how has Quro fared? Pretty well,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">apparently. The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">claims to successfully convert most of its major medical schemes (health insurance) in South Africa as clients. They a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ccount for more than 90% of the total medical scheme market in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quro Medical has grown to work with about 150 doctors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mhlomi believes his company is a first mover in Africa, meaning that he expects other players&#8217; arrival in line with the trends in other markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company that has grown to work with 150 doctors now has plans to accelerate its hospital-at-home services and scale its operations across the country to meet its growing client base&#8217;s demands</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also wants to attract and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> talent and extend into other African markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on the investment for Mohau Equity Partners, CEO <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/penny-moumakwa-31b5a8169">Dr Penny Moumakwa</a> said, “We are very excited to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be invested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Quro, they are a dynamic management team, building out a global medical solution, that will showcase the ability of entrepreneurs on the African continent in advanced digital healthcare.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk famously said any company relying on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/anyone-relying-on-lidar-is-doomed-elon-musk-says/">lidar is &#8220;doomed.&#8221;</a> Tesla instead believes automated driving functions are built on visual recognition and is even working to remove the radar. China&#8217;s Xpeng begs to differ.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Xpeng is one of China&#8217;s most celebrated electric vehicle startups and went public when it was just six years old. Like Tesla, Xpeng sees automation as an integral part of its strategy; unlike the American giant, Xpeng uses a combination of radar, cameras, high-precision maps powered by Alibaba, localization systems developed in-house, and most recently, lidar to detect and predict road conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lidar will provide the 3D drivable space and precise depth estimation to small moving obstacles even like kids and pets, and obviously, other pedestrians and the motorbikes which are a nightmare for anybody who&#8217;s working on driving,&#8221; Xinzhou Wu, who oversees Xpeng&#8217;s autonomous driving R&amp;D center, said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;On top of that, we have the usual radar which gives you location and speed. Then you have the camera which has very rich, basic semantic information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Xpeng is adding lidar to its mass-produced EV model P5, which will begin delivering in the second half of this year. The car, a family sedan, will later be able to drive from point A to B based on a navigation route set by the driver on highways and certain urban roads in China that are covered by Alibaba&#8217;s maps. An older model without lidar already enables assisted driving on highways.</p>
<p>The system, called Navigation Guided Pilot, is benchmarked against Tesla&#8217;s Navigate On Autopilot, said Wu. It can, for example, automatically change lanes, enter or exit ramps, overtake other vehicles, and maneuver another car&#8217;s sudden cut-in, a common sight in China&#8217;s complex road conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The city is super hard compared to the highway but with lidar and precise perception capability, we will have essentially three layers of redundancy for sensing,&#8221; said Wu.</p>
<p>By definition, NGP is an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) as drivers still need to keep their hands on the wheel and take control at any time (Chinese laws don&#8217;t allow drivers to be hands-off on the road). The carmaker’s ambition is to remove the driver, that is, reach Level 4 autonomy two to four years from now, but real-life implementation will hinge on regulations, said Wu.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not worried about that too much. I understand the Chinese government is actually the most flexible in terms of technology regulation.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The lidar camp</h2>
<p>Musk&#8217;s disdain for lidar stems from the high costs of the remote sensing method that uses lasers. In the early days, a lidar unit spinning on top of a robotaxi could cost as much as $100,000, said Wu.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, [the cost] is at least two orders low,&#8221; said Wu. After 13 years with Qualcomm in the U.S., Wu joined Xpeng in late 2018 to work on automating the company&#8217;s electric cars. He currently leads a core autonomous driving R&amp;D team of 500 staff and said the force will double in headcount by the end of this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our next vehicle is targeting the economy class. I would say it&#8217;s mid-range in terms of price,&#8221; he said, referring to the firm&#8217;s new lidar-powered sedan.</p>
<p>The lidar sensors powering Xpeng come from Livox, a firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/tesla-rival-xpeng-lidar-dji/">touting more affordable lidar</a> and an affiliate of DJI, the Shenzhen-based drone giant. Xpeng&#8217;s headquarters is in the adjacent city of Guangzhou about 1.5 hours&#8217; drive away.</p>

<p>Xpeng isn&#8217;t the only one embracing lidar. Nio, a Chinese rival to Xpeng targeting a more premium market, <a href="https://www.nio.com/news/nio-launches-first-autonomous-driving-model-et7">unveiled a lidar-powered car</a> in January but the model won&#8217;t start production until 2022. Arcfox, a new EV brand of Chinese state-owned carmaker BAIC, recently said it would be launching an electric car equipped with Huawei&#8217;s lidar.</p>
<p>Musk recently hinted that Tesla may<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1380606694816800768"> remove radar from production</a> outright as it inches closer to pure vision based on camera and machine learning. The billionaire founder isn&#8217;t particularly a fan of Xpeng, which he <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329806748375527430">alleged</a> owned a copy of Tesla&#8217;s old source code.</p>
<p>In 2019, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Cao Guangzhi alleging that the former Tesla engineer stole trade secrets and brought them to Xpeng. XPeng has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Cao no longer works at Xpeng.</p>
<h2>Supply challenges</h2>
<p>While Livox claims to be an independent entity &#8220;incubated&#8221; by DJI, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/tesla-rival-xpeng-lidar-dji/">a source told TechCrunch previously</a> that it is just a &#8220;team within DJI&#8221; positioned as a separate company. The intention to distance from DJI comes as no one&#8217;s surprise as the drone maker is on the U.S. government&#8217;s Entity List, which has cut key suppliers off from a multitude of Chinese tech firms including Huawei.</p>
<p>Other critical parts that Xpeng uses include NVIDIA&#8217;s Xavier system-on-the-chip computing platform and Bosch&#8217;s iBooster brake system. Globally, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/biden-white-house-semiconductor-summit/">ongoing semiconductor shortage</a> is pushing auto executives to ponder over future scenarios where self-driving cars become even more dependent on chips.</p>
<p>Xpeng is well aware of supply chain risks. &#8220;Basically, safety is very important,&#8221; said Wu. &#8220;It&#8217;s more than the tension between countries around the world right now. Covid-19 is also creating a lot of issues for some of the suppliers, so having redundancy in the suppliers is some strategy we are looking very closely at.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech and auto execs tackle global chip shortage at White House summit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/biden-white-house-semiconductor-summit/embed/#?secret=KRwx3FWx7b" data-secret="KRwx3FWx7b" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Taking on robotaxis</h2>
<p>Xpeng could have easily tapped the flurry of autonomous driving solution providers in China, including Pony.ai and WeRide in its backyard Guangzhou. Instead, Xpeng becomes their competitor, working on automation in-house and pledges to outrival the artificial intelligence startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;The availability of massive computing for cars at affordable costs and the fast dropping price of lidar is making the two camps really the same,&#8221; Wu said of the dynamics between EV makers and robotaxi startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The robotaxi companies] have to work very hard to find a path to a mass-production vehicle. If they don&#8217;t do that, two years from now, they will find the technology is already available in mass production and their value become will become much less than today&#8217;s,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know how to mass-produce a technology up to the safety requirement and the quarantine required of the auto industry. This is a super high bar for anybody wanting to survive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Xpeng has no plans of going visual-only. Options of automotive technologies like lidar are becoming cheaper and more abundant, so &#8220;why do we have to bind our hands right now and say camera only?&#8221; Wu asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of respect for Elon and his company. We wish them all the best. But we will, as Xiaopeng [founder of Xpeng] said in one of his famous speeches, compete in China and hopefully in the rest of the world as well with different technologies.&#8221;</p>
<p>5G, coupled with cloud computing and cabin intelligence, will accelerate Xpeng&#8217;s path to achieve full automation, though Wu couldn&#8217;t share much detail on how 5G is used. When unmanned driving is viable, Xpeng will explore &#8220;a lot of exciting features&#8221; that go into a car when the driver&#8217;s hands are freed. Xpeng&#8217;s electric SUV is already available in Norway, and the company is looking to further expand globally.</p>
