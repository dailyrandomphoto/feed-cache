										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security researchers say a powerful new Android malware masquerading as a critical system update can take complete control of a victim&#8217;s device and steal their data.</p>
<p>The malware was found bundled in an app that had to be installed outside of Google Play, the app store for Android devices. Once installed by the user, the app hides and stealthily exfiltrates data from the victim&#8217;s device to the operator&#8217;s servers.</p>
<p>Researchers at mobile security firm Zimperium, which discovered the malicious app, said once the victim installs the malicious app, the malware communicates with the operator&#8217;s Firebase server to remotely control the device.</p>
<p>The spyware can steal messages, contacts, device details, browser bookmarks and search history, record calls and ambient sound from the microphone and take photos using the phone&#8217;s cameras. The malware also tracks the victim&#8217;s location, searches for document files, and grabs copied data from the device&#8217;s clipboard.</p>
<p>Zimperium CEO Shridhar Mittal said it was likely a targeted attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a lot of time and effort was spent on creating this app. We believe that there are other apps out there like this, and we are trying our very best to find them as soon as possible,&#8221; said Mittal.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130628" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130628" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2130628" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-malware-jpg.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="662" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-malware-jpg.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-malware-jpg.jpg?resize=150,132 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-malware-jpg.jpg?resize=300,265 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-malware-jpg.jpg?resize=768,678 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-malware-jpg.jpg?resize=680,600 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-malware-jpg.jpg?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130628" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot of the malware masquerading as a system update running on an Android phone. The malware can take full control of an affected device. (Image: Zimperium)</p></div></p>
<p>Tricking someone into installing a malicious app is a simple but effective way to compromise a victim&#8217;s device. It&#8217;s why Android devices warn users not to install apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/millions-dozens-android-apps-adware/">from outside of the app store</a>. But many older devices don&#8217;t run the latest apps, forcing users to rely on older versions of their apps from bootleg app stores.</p>
<p>Zimperium said the malware hides itself from the victim, and tries to evade being caught by not using up too much network data by uploading thumbnails to the attacker&#8217;s servers rather than the full image. The malware also captures the most up-to-date data, including location and photos.</p>
<p>Mittal confirmed that the malicious app was never installed on Google Play. When reached, a Google spokesperson would not comment on what steps the company was taking to prevent the malware from entering Google Play. Google has seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/x-mode-location-google-apple-ban/">malicious apps</a> slip through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/23/google-removes-3-android-apps-for-children-with-20m-downloads-between-them-over-data-collection-violations/">its filters</a> before.</p>
<p>But the researchers don&#8217;t know what the malware is for, or who is behind it, or who it&#8217;s targeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easily the most sophisticated we&#8217;ve seen,&#8221; said Mittal.</p>
<p>This kind of malware that has far-reaching access to a victim&#8217;s device comes in a variety of forms and names, but largely does the same thing. In the early days of the internet, remote access trojans, or RATs, let snoops spy on victims through their webcams. Nowadays, child monitoring apps are often repurposed to spy on a person&#8217;s spouse, known as stalkerware or spouseware.</p>
<p>Last year, TechCrunch reported on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/">the KidsGuard stalkerware</a> — ostensibly a child monitoring app — that used a similar &#8220;system update&#8221; to infect victims&#8217; devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are starting to see an increasing number of RATs on mobile devices. And the level of sophistication seems to be going up, it seems like the bad actors have realized that no mobile devices have just as much information on them and as much access and they are less protected than the traditional endpoints.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/dd2e1285-3892-47ea-a12f-444edd9bee40?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> were all here to chat through the week’s biggest tech happenings. News was right back up to a dull roar this week, so we did our best to trim and hone and just bring you the most important things.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>David Dobrik stepped down from Dispo, the photo-sharing app he co-created, this past week after allegations came out about him. We talked about the venture capital angle, since early-stage investors in the app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">reactively distanced</a> from their investments. Could this set precedent or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/early-investors-in-dispo-to-donate-any-profits-from-the-photo-sharing-app/">have a chilling effect on celebrity-startups</a>?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/robinhood-files-confidentially-to-go-public/">Robinhood filed privately to go public</a>! So, it&#8217;s happening everyone. At long last, one of Silicon Valley&#8217;s hottest companies is kicking off its IPO process. We&#8217;re hype, you&#8217;re hype, and we had some jokes.</li>
<li>And in other mega-unicorn news, it appears that Microsoft is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/discords-10b-exit-compass-and-intermedia-cloud-communications-set-ipo-price-ranges/">tempted to plonk down $10 billion for Discord</a>. Why, you ask? Well why not. It&#8217;s just $10 billion from Microsoft&#8217;s $1,780 billion valuation. Or around half a percent.</li>
<li>Sticking to the $10 billion-and-greater category, Plaid could be raising <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/altimeter-to-lead-plaid-deal-after-scrapped-visa-merger">$600 million at a valuation of $10 billion to $15 billion</a>. That&#8217;s a lot of money. Danny, however, has some doubts.</li>
<li>Also, Plaid has announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/plaid-accelerator-announces-inaugural-cohort-of-fintech-startups/?tpcc=ECTW2020">the inaugural cohort of its FinRise accelerator</a>, a program focused on helping fintech startups led by underrepresented founders.</li>
<li>And then there were a few rounds to chat about. Namely the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/bevy-raises-40m-series-c-with-20-coming-from-black-investors/">intensely interesting Bevy deal</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/ro-raises-500m-to-grow-its-remote-and-in-home-primary-care-platform/">Ro raising $500 million at a $5 billion</a>  valuation.</li>
<li>And to wrap, Natasha and Alex shared their favs from TechCrunch&#8217;s massive Y Combinator demo day coverage. Which you can read <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-1/">here</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-2/">here.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s all get some rest!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com">Chainalysis</a>, a blockchain analysis company, announced Friday it has closed on $100 million in Series D financing, doubling its valuation to over $2 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The round comes just four months after the company secured a $100 million <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chainalysis-raises-100-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation-to-expand-its-global-regulatory-platform-for-surging-cryptocurrency-market-301179156.html?tc=eml_cleartime">Series C round</a> at a $1 billion valuation. Paradigm led the latest funding event while existing backers Addition and Ribbit doubled down on their investment in the company. TIME Ventures, Marc Benioff’s investment fund, also participated in the latest financing, which brings Chainalysis’ total raised to $265 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This latest round marks Chainalysis’ fourth raise in less than two years. Previous backers in the company also include Accel and Benchmark.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Chainalysis was founded in 2014 as the official investigators into <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mt-gox.asp">the hack of Mt. Gox</a>, then the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Today, the New York-based company provides data, software, services and research to government agencies, exchanges, financial institutions and insurance and cybersecurity companies in more than 60 countries. Among its 400 customers are fintechs such as Square, financial institutions like Barclays and cryptocurrency businesses like Gemini, Bitstamp and BitPay.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2130527" style="width: 611px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130527" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2130527" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chainalysis_DK38926.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="601" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chainalysis_DK38926.jpg 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chainalysis_DK38926.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chainalysis_DK38926.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chainalysis_DK38926.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chainalysis_DK38926.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chainalysis_DK38926.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130527" class="wp-caption-text">Co-founders Michael Gronager and Jonathan Levin; Image courtesy of Chainalysis</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">Chainalysis’ self-described mission is “to build trust in blockchains to promote more financial freedom with less risk.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company says its data platform powers investigation, compliance and risk management tools “that have been used to solve some of the world&#8217;s most high-profile cyber criminal cases and grow consumer access to cryptocurrency safely.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chainalysis operates under the belief that eventually every company will use the blockchain to conduct their business, according to co-founder and CEO Michael Gronager.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve collected more information about what happens on blockchains than anyone in the cryptocurrency industry,” he said. “That information enables our customers to make better data-driven decisions.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the past year, the company says it has achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Increased its annual recurring revenue (ARR) by more than 100% year-over-year</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Doubled its client base to include government agencies in over 30 countries and private sector businesses in over 60 countries</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Grown its support to cover over 100 digital assets across 10 native blockchains, encompassing an estimated approximate 90% of cryptocurrency economic activity</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Doubled its number of employees over the past year to 233 today</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Expanded its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chainalysis-debuts-partnership-program-to-expand-cryptocurrency-compliance-301038075.html">partnership program</a>, which now consists of more than 50 companies, including Fireblocks and Flashpoint</li>
<li dir="ltr">Looking ahead, Chainanalysis said it plans to hire hundreds over the course of 2021; it also plans to use its new funds primarily to expand its enterprise data offering</li>

<p dir="ltr">“We’ll continue to invest in investigations and compliance software, but we’ll also build out new data products both for our existing customer base and new audiences,” Gronager said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is particularly focused on building out its presence in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Cryptocurrency is global, and so is Chainalysis,” said Gronager.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To Chainalysis, cryptocurrencies present unprecedented transparency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They are the first global payment systems outside of any one organization’s control, but their blockchains create public, permanent records of all transactions, including illicit activity,” Gronager told TechCrunch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Blockchain analysis comes in by helping people interpret those public blockchain ledgers. Chainalysis tools aim to help government agencies, cryptocurrency businesses and financial institutions understand which real-world entities transact with each other.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“For example, we can show that a given transaction took place between two different cryptocurrency exchanges, or between a cryptocurrency exchange and an illicit entity, such as a darknet market or a sanctioned organization,” Gronager said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Paradigm co-founder Fred Ehrsam said his firm was drawn to the way Chainalysis provides key data infrastructure and software for the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The team knows the regulatory landscape better than anyone, has been refining their tools for years, and deeply know what their customers want. This is not an overnight success story &#8211; rather a team that has built with a long run vision, through multiple crypto cycles, that has created a market leading position for themselves, with the opportunity to compound,” he added. “As cryptocurrency adoption grows, so will demand for Chainalysis offerings.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As further evidence of a cryptocurrency boom, <a href="http://www.blockfi.com/">BlockFi </a>earlier this month announced it closed on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/blockfi-lands-a-350m-series-d-at-3b-valuation-for-its-fast-growing-crypto-lending-platform/">massive $350 million Series D funding</a> at a $3 billion valuation. The financial services company for crypto market investors offers a retail and institutional-facing suite of products.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Notably, BlockFi is also a Chainalysis customer. In a written statement, CEO and co-founder Zac Prince said that <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainalysis provides BlockFi with data &#8220;that delivers insights beyond compliance that can help inform our business development activities, tailor our offerings, and identify new revenue streams.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning, well-known robotic process automation (RPA) unicorn <a href="https://www.uipath.com/">UiPath</a> has filed to go public.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s S-1 filing comes after it <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/uipath/company_financials">raised billions</a> of dollars while private, making it amongst the best-funded startups in history. Over the last year, for example, the company&#8217;s rapid-fired fundraising included its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/uipath-reels-in-another-225m-as-valuation-soars-to-10-2b/"> Series E</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">Series F</a> rounds of capital, both of which came inside the last 12 months.</p>
<p>UiPath&#8217;s filing details a rapidly growing company. From its fiscal year ending January 31, 2020, to its fiscal year ending January 31, 2021, UiPaths&#8217;s revenues grew from $336.2 million to $607.6 million, which translates to just under 81% growth. That top-line expansion brought with it GAAP net income of <b>&#8211;</b>$519.9 million in its year ending in early 2020, and -$94.7 million in the year ending January 31 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>UiPath was valued privately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/uipath-reels-in-another-225m-as-valuation-soars-to-10-2b/">at $10.2 billion</a> in mid-2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">and $35 billion</a> in early 2021.</p>
<p>For the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/uipath/company_financials">27 known</a> investors, the IPO filing is a critical moment. If UiPath can defend its rich private valuation, its IPO could be viewed as a success. However, investors in that final round &#8212; Alkeon Capital and Coatue, the investors that also led its Series E &#8212; will want to see its market value appreciate.</p>
<p>If UiPath can reach a public valuation of more than $35 billion remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s financials paint the picture of a high-growth company that got its costs in line after a very expensive fiscal year ending January 31, 2020. UiPath cut its sales and marketing costs, its research and development spend, and even its general and administrative budget in its most recent fiscal year. The result is that its gross profit scaled against a smaller cost base. And the result of that was dramatically improved profitability, and cash generation.</p>
<p>As the S-1 notes: &#8220;[UiPath&#8217;s]<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> operating cash flows were $(359.4) million and $29.2 million and our free cash flows were $(380.4) million and $26.0 million in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.&#8221; </span>That&#8217;s a massive turnaround, perhaps one that&#8217;s even more impressive than the company&#8217;s improving GAAP net margins.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more to come from UiPath, namely a dive into its quarterly results, which the company says will come in a &#8220;subsequent amendment to [its] prospectus.&#8221;</p>
<p>All told, UiPath&#8217;s most recent fiscal year shows material operating leverage — something that not every software company going public can brag about.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve seen a lot of trend lines moving throughout 2020 and into 2021 around automation, workflow, robotic process automation (RPA) and the movement to low-code and no-code application building. While all of these technologies can work on their own, they are deeply connected and we are starting to see some movement towards bringing them together.</p>
<p>While the definition of process automation is open to interpretation, and could include things like industrial automation, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/257170/global-automation-market-revenue-by-end-market/">Statista estimates that the process automation</a> market could be worth $74 billion in 2021. Those are numbers that are going to get the attention of both investors and enterprise software executives.</p>
<p>Just this week, Berlin-based <a href="https://camunda.com">Camunda</a> announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/camunda-snares-98m-series-b-as-process-automation-continues-to-flourish/">a $98 million Series B</a> to help act as a layer to orchestrate the flow of data between RPA bots, microservices and human employees. Meanwhile UIPath, the pure-play RPA startup that&#8217;s going to IPO any minute now, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210323005238/en/UiPath-Acquires-Cloud-Elements-to-Deliver-Expanded-API-Based-Automation-Capabilities">acquired Cloud Elements</a>, giving it a way to move beyond RPA into API automation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not enough proof for you? How about ServiceNow announcing this week that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/servicenow-takes-rpa-plunge-by-acquiring-india-based-startup-intellibot/">it is buying Indian startup Intellibot</a> to give it — you guessed it — RPA capabilities. That acquisition is part of a broader strategy by the company to move into full-scale workflow and automation, which it discussed just<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/servicenow-adds-new-no-code-capabilities/"> a couple of weeks ago</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile at the end of last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/sap-is-buying-berlin-business-process-automation-startup-signavio/">SAP bought a different Berlin process automation startup</a>, Signavio, for $1.2 billion after announcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/sap-latest-enterprise-software-giant-to-offer-low-code-workflow/">new automated workflow tools and an RPA tool</a> at the beginning of December. Microsoft is in on it too, having acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/microsoft-acquires-robotic-process-automation-platform-softomotive/">process automation startup Softmotive</a> last May, which it then combined with its own automation tool <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsofts-power-automate-desktop-is-now-free-for-all-windows-10-users/">PowerAutomate</a>.</p>
<p>What we have here is a frothy mix of startups and large companies racing to provide a comprehensive spectrum of workflow automation tools to empower companies to spin up workflows quickly and move work involving both human and machine labor through an organization.</p>
<p>The result is hot startups getting prodigious funding, while other startups are exiting via acquisition to these larger companies looking to buy instead of build to gain a quick foothold in this market.</p>

<p>Cathy Tornbohm, Distinguished Research Vice President at Gartner, says part of the reason for the rapidly growing interest is that these companies have stayed on the sidelines up until now, but they see an opportunity and are using their checkbooks to play catch up.</p>
<p>&#8220;IBM, SAP, Pega, Appian, Microsoft, ServiceNow all bought into the RPA market because for years they didn’t focus on how data got into their systems when operating between organizations or without a human. [Instead] they focused more on what happens inside the client&#8217;s organization. The drive to be digitally more efficient necessitates optimizing data ingestion and data flows,&#8221; Tornbohm told me.</p>
<p>For all the bluster from the big vendors, they do not control the pure-play RPA market. In fact, Gartner found that the top three players in this space are UIPath, Automation Anywhere and Blue Prism.</p>
<p>But Tornbohm says that, even as the traditional enterprise vendors try to push their way into the space, these pure-play companies are not sitting still. They are expanding beyond their RPA roots into the broader automation space, which could explain why UIPath came up from its pre-IPO quiet period to make the Cloud Elements announcement this week.</p>

<p>Dharmesh Thakker, managing partner at Battery Ventures, agrees with Tornbohm, saying that the shift to the cloud, accelerated by COVID-19, has led to an expansion of what RPA vendors are doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;RPA has traditionally focused on automation-UI flow and user steps, but we believe a full automation suite requires that ability to automate processes across the stack. For larger companies, we see their interest in the category as a way to take action on data within their systems. And for standalone RPA vendors, we see this as validation of the category and an invitation to expand their offerings to other pillars of automation,&#8221; Thakker said.</p>
<p>The activity we have seen across the automation and workflow space over the last year could be just the beginning of what Thakker and Tornbohm are describing, as companies of all sizes fight to become the automation stack of choice in the coming years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vibrant, a medical technology company that’s developed a disposable vibrating pill to treat chronic constipation, today announced its Series E for $7.5 million. The company is based in Tel Aviv and is lead by Lior Ben-Tsur, a startup veteran. Since its founding in 2007, the company has raised a total of $25 million. This round is being led by Unorthodox Ventures with participation by Sequoia.</p>
<p>Vibrant, which is going through its third and final round of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) testing, plans to launch in the U.S. in the next year. The capsules are about the size of a multi-vitamin, Ben-Tsur said.</p>
<p>“Patients are used to taking drugs day in and day out, so this wouldn’t be a different experience in that regard, but this pill doesn’t have any medication,” Ben-Tsur said. While Ben-Tsur is not a founder, he was brought on about 10 years ago to serve as the company’s CEO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(12)01544-2/fulltext?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2F">study published in the American Gastroenterological Association</a>, about 16% of American adults suffer from constipation, and the number jumps to 33.5% in adults between the ages of 60-101. Also, constipation is 1.5 times more common in women than in men.</p>
<p>The most common way to treat constipation is through the use of over-the-counter or prescription drugs, most of which target the nerves in the colon which in turn prompt a bowel movement. The Vibrant Capsule, however, “once swallowed, kickstarts the natural impulses of your intestinal wall to contract, relax and get things moving again — without the use of chemicals,” the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>In addition to being medication-free, the value of Vibrant over laxatives, according to the company, is that the bowel movements are more controlled, whereas laxatives can cause unexpected diarrhea and long-term side effects. Also, while laxatives are meant to be taken on a daily basis, the disposable capsule can be used anywhere from 2-5 times per week. The capsules connect to an app that automatically records when you take a pill, and upon having a bowel movement, the person notes it in the app which then sends a monthly report to the patient’s doctor, allowing them to monitor and adjust the treatment protocol as necessary.</p>
<p>In a 2019 human trial organized by Vibrant, 250 patients were enrolled in a double-blind study (Vibrant Capsule = 133, placebo = 117). The results showed that those who took the Vibrant Capsule were more likely to experience a bowel movement within three hours. The trial details and the results were <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D3B6CbIc4N3YfE2t0WWH2edf_lFg6fJhGhv5rXBUFe4/edit?usp=sharing">published in the journal of Neurogastroenterology and Motility</a>.</p>
<p>Several years ago a group of doctors and engineers performed a test in a live pig’s colon, and accidentally pinched the side of the colon wall. As a result, they noticed that the pig promptly had a bowel movement. The test was actually about something totally unrelated to constipation, and the results were a random discovery. To replicate the effects, the team created a vibrating belt that when worn for about three hours, would also cause a bowel movement.</p>
<p>“The problem is no one wants to shake for three hours to have a bowel movement,” said Ben-Tsur. With this information in hand, the group set out to develop a treatment for constipation in humans that would produce similar results but where the vibrations couldn’t be felt. There were other mechanical capsules already on the market such as the <a href="https://www.medtronic.com/covidien/en-us/products/motility-testing/smartpill-motility-testing-system.html">Smart Pill</a>, a mechanical diagnostic capsule that reports on generalized motility through the entire digestive tract and aids doctors in diagnosing motility disorders, so the team knew that people could safely swallow and excrete capsules.</p>
<p>According to Ben-Tsur, there hasn’t been any development in the treatment of constipation in the last 20 years — the treatment protocol has continued to focus on medication. When he learned about the market size, the lack of innovation in the space, and the potential, he was convinced that he wanted to lead Vibrant.</p>
<p>Vibrant plans on using this round of funding to take the capsule to market in the U.S. — its first market. The company is currently speaking with healthcare providers and insurance companies so that the capsule will be covered by insurance starting at the time of launch. The Smart Pill, while only used once as a diagnostic test, is still not covered and costs, on average, about $1,400 out of pocket. Ben-Tsur and his team aim to offer a product that is accessible. “From day one we were on a mission to build something that wouldn’t be more expensive than existing drugs,” he said.</p>

<p>One-year-old <a href="https://dotpe.in">DotPe</a>, a Gurgaon-based startup, said on Friday it has raised $27.5 million in its Series A financing round. The round was led by PayU, with participation from existing investor Info Edge Ventures and Google.</p>
<p>The young startup, now valued at about $90 million, helps brick and mortar stores sell to customers online and collect payments digitally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s a problem that scores of startups in India are solving today, but DotPe has some additional hooks. It helps merchants scan their inventories and quickly establish a log online.</p>
<p>Once the catalog is ready, a business can then make it available on WhatsApp and reach customers there. WhatsApp is the most popular smartphone app in India with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/youtube-and-whatsapp-inch-closer-to-half-a-billion-users-in-india/">over 450 million users</a>. DotPe says it also helps businesses get visibility on Google Search.</p>
<p>The startup, co-founded by Shailaz Nag, formerly co-founder and managing director of PayU, also enables neighborhood stores to collect payments from walk-in customers and features tools to offer loyalty points and discounts to customers to boost engagement.</p>
<p>“This new partnership will empower businesses to be more discoverable, expand business avenues and conduct commerce like never before,” said Nag. “Pandemic or not, we are here to reimagine the way offline businesses work and bring the digital revolution to the doorstep of every entrepreneur.”</p>

<p>DotPe says its platform, which doesn’t require businesses to install an app, has amassed over 5 million merchants in the last six months. These merchants are seeing over 38% of daily orders from repeat customers, the startup said.</p>
<p>“In a very short time, DotPe has acquired a promising merchant base with its impeccable product experience and innovation,” said Anirban Mukherjee, CEO, PayU India.</p>
<p>Sanjay Gupta, VP and Country Head of Google India, said in a statement that the company’s investment in DotPe is illustrative of Google’s belief in “working with India’s start-up ecosystem towards the goal of building a more inclusive digital economy that will benefit everyone.”</p>
<p>Google announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">$10 billion fund</a> for India last year, its biggest market by users. The Android-maker has invested in several startups in the country including hyperlocal delivery firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/google-backs-indias-dunzo-in-40-million-funding-round/">Dunzo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">InMobi Group&#8217;s Glance, and DailyHunt</a>.</p>
<p>DotPe said it will deploy the fresh capital to reach more merchants in India and scale its technology stack to meet the growing demand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you browse Instagram, you are probably familiar with the term &#8220;link in bio.&#8221; Links aren’t allowed in post captions, and users are only allowed one URL in their bios, so many create a simple website with multiple links for their followers. <a href="https://linktr.ee/">Linktree</a>, one of the most popular &#8220;link in bio&#8221; services with more than 12 million users, announced today it has raised $45 million in Series B funding. The round was co-led by Index Ventures and Coatue, with participation from returning investors AirTree Ventures and Insight Partners.</p>
<p>Coatue chairman Dan Rose will join Linktree’s board of directors. The Sydney, Australia-based startup’s last round was a $10.7 million Series A announced in October 2020. Linktree’s latest funding will be used on tools that make social commerce easier.</p>

<p>Linktree says about a third, or 4 million, of its users signed up within the last three months. This is in partly because people have been spending more time on social media and e-commerce shopping during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, Linktree now competes with a roster of &#8220;link in bio&#8221; services, including Shorby, Linkin.bio and the recently launched Beacons.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we launched Linktree, we created an entirely new category. We were first to market and, with over 12 million users globally, still hold 88% of market share,&#8221; founder and chief executive officer Alex Zaccaria told TechCrunch. &#8220;Inevitably we’ve seen plenty of competitors pop up as a result, but part of the uniqueness of Linktree is its deceptively simple design.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zaccaria added that one of Linktree&#8217;s differentiators is its adoption by users in a wide range of categories, including health and wellness, real estate, sports, music, politics, publishing and food. It&#8217;s used for bio links by Shopify, Facebook, TikTok, YSL, HBO and Major League Baseball, and celebrities like Jonathan Van Ness, Jamie Oliver and Pharrell.</p>
<p>&#8220;We might have started as a link-in-bio tool, but over time Linktree has evolved and the platform has become a social identity layer of the internet. Our vision for how the platform will sit at the intersection of digital self-expression and action means we’re thinking boldly when it comes to our roadmap.&#8221;</p>

<p>The home ownership rate in Vietnam is <a href="https://vneconomictimes.com/article/property/millennials-finding-home-ownership-difficult"> about 90%</a>, but many millennials are struggling to join that number. Rising property prices in cities, coupled with a lack of financing options, mean more people <a href="https://vneconomictimes.com/article/property/millennials-finding-home-ownership-difficult">have to delay buying their first homes</a> unless they have family support.</p>
<p>Part of Y Combinator’s latest batch,<a href="https://homebase.com.vn/"> Homebase</a> was founded in 2019 to give prospective buyers in Vietnam an alternative to traditional financing. Homebase acts as a co-investor, buying a share of property with customers, who then have the option of purchasing equity from Homebase until they take full ownership, or selling the property for their portion of the proceeds. In the meantime, buyers pay rent to Homebase that corresponds to the company’s stake, and have full usage rights to the home, so they can live in or rent it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Co-founders Junyuan Tan and Phillip An originally started Homebase in Singapore, but decided to focus on Vietnam because Tan had lived there while working on his previous startups, RePrice Technologies and Atlantis Lab. Tan wanted to buy a home, but found bank mortgages charged high interest rates even on short-term loans.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at the whole of Southeast Asia, compared to Europe or the U.S., there are really no other solutions, like government schemes or rent-to-own financing solutions,&#8221; Homebase chief operating officer Phillip An told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Its model is similar to Divvy Homes and ZeroDown in the United States and, in fact, leaders from both startups have invested in Homebase (Divvy Homes co-founder Brian Ma and ZeroDown’s former COO Troy Steckenrider). Homebase’s <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/garage/singapore-vc-firm-1982-ventures-invests-in-vietnams-homebase">other backers</a> include VinaCapital Ventures, Class 5 Global, Pegasus Technology Ventures, 1982 Ventures, Antler and Darius Cheung, the founder and CEO of 99.co.</p>

<p>Most of Homebase’s transactions are currently in Ho Chi Minh City and Saigon, and it plans to expand into Hanoi and Danang by the end of this year. Ultimately, Homebase’s goal is to enter other Southeast Asian markets where home owners also face a dearth of financing options, like Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, <a href="ttps://datatopics.worldbank.org/financialinclusion/country/vietnam">about 70% of adults are “unbanked,”</a> meaning they don’t have a bank account, which makes it difficult to apply for mortgages. An said some of Homebase’s customers use the service because they are unbanked. Other customers have financial accounts, but see Homebase as a faster, more flexible option to bank loans.</p>
<p>Its contracts range from one to 10 years, and at the end, customers have the option of buying all the equity in the property or selling it with Homebase to get back their investment. The amount of equity customers buy at the start also varies. For example, home buyers who are using Homebase as an alternative to mortgages typically take an initial 20% to 30% stake in the property, while real estate investors often start with a 50% stake.</p>
<p>Homebase finances its stake in properties in part by working with third-party financial institutions, including private high-net worth individuals and family offices who see it as an opportunity to diversify their holdings into a new asset class. An said the company is also talking to different types of funds, including equity, hedge, real estate debt and emerging market debt, from Europe, the United States and Singapore.</p>
<p>To screen applicants, Homebase has an internal checklist and onboarding process, and it also works with real estate agents, developers and other partners in Vietnam.</p>
<p>For those third parties, Homebase serves as a value-add tool that helps them close more deals by providing a way for customers to get financing. Homebase also performs due diligence on potential properties, including examining documentation and permits, and has built an asset valuation model based on existing property data, transaction data and information from developers.</p>
<p>An said this valuation service, which Homebase is expanding, is a key part of the business because it provides assurance to buyers that the company’s incentives are aligned with theirs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We stand to risk our investment, too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Many customers are also first-time buyers and they want more help to find a good property.&#8221;</p>

According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/990/global-advertising-market/">Statista</a>, North America spends the most on advertising, with second place going to Asia and Western Europe. The rest of Europe, Africa and the Middle East lag behind.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>However, the Middle East embodies great potential. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/990/global-advertising-market/">Statista</a>, it boasts the highest growth, with a 600% increase in digital advertising in the MENA region between 2010 and 2015. Although consumers in the region used to prefer traditional advertising channels, the internet took over in 2020, with 44.2% of the total ad expenditures, while TV dropped to 30%.</p>
<p>Here are several essential characteristics of digital advertising in the Middle East region:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to a <a href="https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/publications/time-for-consumer-centred-metrics.html">PwC report</a>, 39% of shoppers in the Middle East use social media to find inspiration for purchases, compared to the global average of 29%.</li>
<li>Due to the existence of a shadow economy, political regulations and unofficial business, the amount of digital ad spending in the MENA region ranged from <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/799847/mena-internet-advertising-spending/">$1 billion</a> to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-ae/mena-advertising-expenditure-dissected">$1.2 billion</a> in 2020.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-advertising/saudi-arabia">Paid social</a> is the leading category in digital advertising expenditures in the MENA region. Saudi Arabia and Egypt are the largest in terms of active YouTube users.</li>
<li>There are more than 500 digital agencies listed in the region. UAE is leading in terms of big advertising agencies, while Egypt and Saudi Arabia are famous for small- and medium-size agencies. Most digital marketing talent and creative resources reside in Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan, while most adtech startups are born in Israel, UAE and Qatar, according to digital marketing consultant <a href="https://consultyasser.com/stats-digital-advertising-in-the-mena/">Yasser Ahmad</a>.</li>
<li>E-commerce is driving growth, hitting $17 billion in the Middle East in 2020, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1147942/mena-value-of-e-commerce-market-by-country/">Statista</a>, with many online shoppers increasing the frequency of purchases during the pandemic.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bbgventures.com/">BBG Ventures</a>, an eight-year-old, New York-based seed- and early-stage venture firm that only backs founding teams which feature at least one woman, just locked down $50 million in capital for its third fund, a major leap over its first two funds, both sized at $10 million.</p>
<p>One determining factor in the bigger fund is that BBGV, formerly backed exclusively by AOL (now Verizon Media), now has a broader pool of institutional and individual investors, including the State of Michigan Retirement Systems, the George Kaiser Family Foundation and Verizon Ventures, along with Poshmark cofounder Tracy Sun, ClassPass cofounder Payal Kadakia, and venture capitalists Aileen Lee, Theresia Gouw, and Jennifer Fonstad.</p>
<p>The young firm also has a track record to which to point. Though an investment in the coworking space The Wing may have taken an <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/02/what-happened-to-the-wing.html">unexpected turn</a>, hurt by a national lockdown and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/style/the-wing-ceo-audrey-gelman-resigns.html">internal turmoil</a>, other bets have been growing, including the e-commerce platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/zola-the-650m-wedding-portal-taps-the-travel-market-with-an-expansion-into-honeymoons/">Zola</a>; the feminine hygiene brand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/12/lola-just-raised-24m-for-a-subscription-service-that-ships-tampons-pads-and-now-condoms/">Lola</a>; and <a href="https://www.springhealth.com/">Spring Health</a>, a mental health benefits platform for employers that recently closed on <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/spring-health-scores-76m-investment-as-demand-for-virtual-mental-health-soars">$76 million</a> in Series B funding led by Tiger Global Management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s saying nothing of the vast and underserved opportunity to invest in women-led teams that BBGV&#8217;s founders, Susan Lyne and Nisha Dua, believe most venture firms still don&#8217;t fully appreciate.</p>
<p>We talked earlier today about why that is with Lyne, who is a former ABC president, former Martha Stewart Living CEO and former CEO of AOL Brand Group; and Dua, who is a former lawyer, management consultant, chief of staff to Lyne, and founder. Our conversation has been edited for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC You&#8217;ve raised $50 million. What size checks will you be writing? Are you looking to take bigger positions or do you have a more diverse approach?</strong></p>
<p>ND: We&#8217;re looking at writing $500,000 to $1 million checks. We look for 7.5% to 10% ownership, and we&#8217;re open to co-leading, but we prefer to lead. We&#8217;ve been leading rounds already with this with this fund. We&#8217;ll likely do about 30 companies from the fund, backing a mix of pre-seed and seed-stage startups, with reserves for follow-on funding.</p>
<p>SL: We&#8217;ve actually done 11 investments; we started investing after the first close.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve invested in nearly 80 startups over the years. What has been your biggest investment to date?</strong></p>
<p>ND: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/with-another-2-5-million-in-funding-julia-collins-planet-fwd-launches-climate-friendly-snack-brand/">Planet Forward</a>, which was founded by Zume cofounder Julia Collins.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Have you &#8212; or would you &#8212; ever form a special purpose vehicle to invest more in a startup than your fund enables?</strong></p>
<p>SL: We didn&#8217;t do it for our last funds, but we did our first SPV for this fund, in a company called <a href="https://starface.world/">Starface</a>, which is skincare company that takes a very different approach to the acne problem. You&#8217;ve probably seen the gold stars [that its customers apply to their pimples] on social media. They&#8217;ve been growing very fast and did a Series A recently and we took part of it ourselves but we also opened an SPV for one of our LPs.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What themes interest you right now?</strong></p>
<p>SL: We&#8217;ve done a lot of investing thus far in health and well being. That&#8217;s our largest category. The second is the future of work and education; the third is climate-friendly commerce; and the fourth is really underestimated, or emerging consumers. In all of those areas, we have actually found there are many, many, many female founders who are active and building great companies</p>
<p>ND: Also, we [have historically] described ourselves as a consumer fund, but we are doing more B2B in this fund, where we think that the B2B approach could solve a bigger consumer problem, including for many millions of consumers.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s an example of what you mean?</strong></p>
<p>SL: <a href="https://www.withgrayce.com/">Grayce</a>, which is doing eldercare and actually selling to employers as an employee benefit. If you look at the cost to companies because of the number of hours and days that many people invest in taking care of an aging parent or trying to figure out what the next step is for them [you appreciate the need for this kind of service]. This platform not only allows you to connect with someone who can help you plan but also points you to the resources you need, including financial resources, legal resources, and living resources.</p>
<p>ND: Another is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/15/full-harvest-series-a/">Full Harvest</a>, a marketplace and logistics platform that takes all the excess food on a farm that doesn&#8217;t meet cosmetic standards and resells it to juice and salad makers and other food brands and manufacturers.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You mentioned Julia Collins. Do you know how many first-time founders you&#8217;ve backed versus repeat entrepreneurs?</strong></p>
<p>ND: There&#8217;s a mix. We don&#8217;t have a preference.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you have a geographic focus?</strong></p>
<p>SL: I would say, New York City is definitely our primary source for for companies for a lot of reasons, including that there&#8217;s a very rich and active female founder community here. This is the headquarters for many different kinds of industries, so you get a range of talent here. But we&#8217;ve also invested in San Francisco companies, companies in Los Angeles, in Milwaukee, in San Diego. [We see] opportunity in at least a dozen cities across the country.</p>
<p><strong>TC Have have your syndicate partners changed over time, if at all?</strong></p>
<p>ND: That&#8217;s been one of the most exciting things of the past few years. We love to partner with women GPs &#8212; folks like Kara Norton of Upfront Ventures and Jess Lee of Sequoia. There is a great spiderweb of women GPs emerging at these top venture funds who can create these strong relationships and are ultimately leads for follow-on rounds.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do think women-led teams are receiving the valuations they would if they were all-male teams? I was horrified to read earlier today that the wage gap between men and women has improved by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/us/equal-pay-day-explainer.html">8 cents</a> over the last 25 years. </strong></p>
<p>SL: I can&#8217;t speak authoritatively about whether women are getting lower valuations across the board. We certainly know that they are getting a vastly lower percentage of the venture capital investment. If you <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-to-female-founders/">look at the stats</a> about the amount of funding for women in 2020 versus men, it&#8217;s definitely disturbing and shows the vast majority of venture capital is still going to all all male teams. I think some of that is due to the megarounds that we&#8217;ve seen, but not enough of it to make a significant difference.</p>
<p>ND: I think it was Harvard Business Review that did some really <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/male-and-female-entrepreneurs-get-asked-different-questions-by-vcs-and-it-affects-how-much-funding-they-get">interesting research</a> at a [2017] TechCrunch Disrupt event that overwhelmingly suggested that men are judged on their potential and women are often judged on their current expertise, and we [might] surmise that [these factors] could have something to do with valuations.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why we&#8217;re leading rounds. We see the opportunities that these female-led teams are going after &#8212; and we have the opportunity to assess them on their exact merits.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: Zuckerberg defends Facebook over role in Capitol attack</strong></p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter&#8217;s Jack Dorsey and Google&#8217;s Sundar Pichai appeared at a hearing today with the House Energy and Commerce Committee on the theme of misinformation, particularly the role that their platforms may have played in the Capitol attack by allowing lies and extremism to spread.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In his opening statement, Zuckerberg advocated for reforms to Section 230 and said that Facebook &#8220;did our part&#8221; to protect last year&#8217;s presidential election, putting the blame for the Capitol riots squarely on former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Pressed by Rep. Mike Doyle (D-PA) on whether Facebook bears some responsibility,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/facebook-capitol-riot-zuckerberg-sandberg-comments-hearing/"> Zuckerberg replied</a>, &#8220;I think the responsibility lies with the people who took the actions to break the law and do the insurrection. Secondarily, also with the people who spread that content, including the president but others as well, with repeated rhetoric over time, saying that the election was rigged and encouraging people to organize, I think that those people bear the primary responsibility as well.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If Congress wants to write laws that effectively regulate companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, it needs to change the ways it interacts with those companies, because these hearings ain&#8217;t it. They&#8217;re a waste of everyone&#8217;s time, and no one is even pretending otherwise. To truly put Big Tech on the spot, future hearings need to do — at the very least — these three things.</p>
<h2>Change the format</h2>
<p>Five minutes of free-form questioning by 60 or 70 representatives sequentially is the current format for House hearings, and it&#8217;s a disaster — especially on Zoom or Bluejeans or whatever Congress uses.</p>
<p>Over and over again we get representatives who spend three-fourths of their time on de facto opening statements that are as likely as not to be pandering bloviations redundant with what&#8217;s already been said. Once that&#8217;s finished, the short remaining time forces them to require yes or no answers to poorly posed questions about complex topics.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tech-hearing-zuckerberg-pichai-dorsey.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2130511" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tech-hearing-zuckerberg-pichai-dorsey.jpg" alt="Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai, and Jack Dorsey in video calls with Congress." width="1024" height="277" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tech-hearing-zuckerberg-pichai-dorsey.jpg 2208w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tech-hearing-zuckerberg-pichai-dorsey.jpg?resize=150,41 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tech-hearing-zuckerberg-pichai-dorsey.jpg?resize=300,81 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tech-hearing-zuckerberg-pichai-dorsey.jpg?resize=768,208 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tech-hearing-zuckerberg-pichai-dorsey.jpg?resize=680,184 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tech-hearing-zuckerberg-pichai-dorsey.jpg?resize=1536,416 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tech-hearing-zuckerberg-pichai-dorsey.jpg?resize=2048,555 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tech-hearing-zuckerberg-pichai-dorsey.jpg?resize=50,14 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>Because there&#8217;s nothing compelling these CEOs to actually respond with yes or no, they always, always respond with a longer answer. Have done for years, yet representatives still complain about it, even when their questions can&#8217;t conceivably be answered with a yes or no without over-committing or self-incrimination.</p>
<p>When you ask, and this was an actual question, &#8220;Do you think the law should allow you to be the arbiters of truth, as they have under section 230?&#8221; — you cannot seriously expect a yes or no answer. It&#8217;s the tech equivalent of &#8220;Have you stopped beating your dog?&#8221;</p>
<p>Faced with pointless or impossible questions, Zuckerberg maintained a sort of perpetually aggrieved countenance, looking more like the dog than the beater. Pichai tuned out, missing questions or offering obvious platitudes when called on. Dorsey, plainly bored, <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1375152199433527296">tweeted</a> his way through the hearing and answered in monosyllables even when it was not required of him.</p>

Seeing that nothing worthwhile can be said or done in these five-minute abuse sessions, the highly visible chief goal of the CEOs is to run out the clock — safe and incredibly easy to do. Sometimes they appeared to be barely paying attention, secure in the knowledge that they can respond &#8220;these are nuanced issues&#8230; we take this very seriously, Congresswo—&#8221; before being cut off. Begging off based on being &#8220;unsure about the exact details&#8221; and saying you&#8217;ll follow up is another zero-commitment option.</p>
<p>The format needs to be changed to allow for substantive discussion, firstly by extending each member&#8217;s questioning time limit to eight or 10 minutes at least; secondly, by providing some kind of guideline for answering, for instance guaranteeing 10 seconds but silencing them after 30. So much is lost to crosstalk in these video hearings that ultimately it&#8217;s better to allow a bad answer to go for 20 seconds than to object to it for 25.</p>
<p>It may also pay to limit the participants, allowing the leaders of the Committee to allocate time as they see fit to a smaller number of representatives who have more than boilerplate outrage to put on the record. How exactly this could be accomplished is probably subject to a raft of rules and procedural things, but seriously, there&#8217;s no point in having most of these people involved. Keep it fair, keep it bipartisan and let each party either exclude its cranks or own them.</p>
<p>Real consequences or legally extracted promises need to exist as well. Representative Bobby Rush (D-IL) brought up an independent audit Jack Dorsey promised — on the record, to Congress — in 2018. It never took place, with Dorsey saying they decided to do something else instead. So it wasn&#8217;t a promise, it wasn&#8217;t a requirement and there was no legal compulsion to do anything at all. Why even bother asking if all you&#8217;re doing is asking for a favor? Lawmakers need bite to back up their bark, and if that doesn&#8217;t exist, they should refrain from barking so much.</p>
<h2>Have a real agenda</h2>
<p>If the format changes, the agenda needs to as well. Because if we simply allow these clueless lawmakers more time to read their scripts, the scripts will, like legislative goldfish, expand to fill the time allotted to them.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen hearings that have made a difference, usually because the people involved have evidence to present and arguments to accompany it. Vice President Kamala Harris was great at this, having a background as a prosecutor — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/sen-harris-puts-zuckerberg-between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place-for-not-disclosing-data-misuse/">she made it pretty hot for Zuckerberg back in 2018</a>. Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and David Cicilline (D-RI) made Jeff Bezos look like he was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/bezos-cant-guarantee-no-anti-competitive-activity-as-congress-catches-him-flat-footed/">either ignorant or had something to hide</a> last year by confronting him with incriminating testimony and requiring a real answer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we can&#8217;t trust our legislators to be informed (or truthful) on these issues or really to even care. Most of the time their questions come off like something anyone could throw together an hour before the hearing with some quick background searches. Some of it (like hammering on the long-settled NY Post/Hunter Biden debacle) is so out of date that it proves beyond a doubt that the questioner had no intention of addressing the issues ostensibly at hand. Why let them waste everyone&#8217;s time on irrelevant topics?</p>
<p>Subpoena power comes with its own problems — no one wants to fight a court battle every time they want to ask a few questions — but if Congress is not going to use the tools available to it in the pursuit of legislating these issues, what exactly do they bring to the table?</p>
<p>If hearings don&#8217;t have a driving force behind them, such as an event, investigation or document release, they are almost by definition just a way for representatives to generate sound bites and appear concerned to their constituency. Today&#8217;s event is very much an example of this.</p>
<h2>Bring in principals, not figureheads</h2>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai and Jack Dorsey are very smart. Very well-informed. Very important. But their roles as figureheads as well as decisionmakers in their companies and industries makes it nearly impossible for them to say anything that hasn&#8217;t been drafted and cleared ahead of time, and they are also free to not remember or defer to an absent colleague.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no blood to squeeze from these stones, so invite someone else. This was a hearing about disinformation — these companies have people making everyday decisions and directly overseeing projects on that topic. <em>They</em> should be the ones being asked to answer Congress&#8217;s questions.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s conceivable, if almost certainly untrue, that Zuckerberg &#8220;doesn&#8217;t recall&#8221; conversations about hiding abuse of Facebook data from users. Getting him to take that position is a victory of a sort, but it would be better to have the person whose responsibility this actually was, someone who can&#8217;t take refuge in hysterical ignorance.</p>
<p>Certainly these VPs and heads of what have you would also be media trained and prepped with canned statements, but it&#8217;s better than the alternative. These CEOs are Teflon-coated and this isn&#8217;t their first time in front of the shouting squad. They no longer care about anything but keeping the hearings as boring as possible and avoiding a news cycle. (Dorsey&#8217;s weird clock was a great blow-off valve for this. Pichai&#8217;s aggressively ordinary background gave you nothing to focus on but his answers — wrong play. And Zuckerberg&#8217;s high-quality camera setup only made him look more damp and robotic.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Every time one of these hearings takes place, the overwhelming impression one gets from them is of a lost opportunity. Here are elected lawmakers given a chance to speak directly to some of the most powerful people in the tech industry, and perhaps nine out of 10 use that time to retread old topics, thrust dubious information into the record, or simply relish their chance to push around someone like Mark Zuckerberg. The temptation is understandable but legislators must put the country first.</p>
<p>Though some representatives raised important issues today, the format prevented them from extracting substantive answers; the lack of a cohesive agenda or central documents meant they had no compelling evidence to put forth; the subjects of their questioning were bored and had no reason to say anything beyond what they put in their carefully prepared opening statements. If future hearings — concerning this or other industries — don&#8217;t change things up, no one should be surprised if they, like this one, yield nothing but hot air.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Porsche has added its first all-electric vehicle, the Taycan sports sedan, to its subscription and short-term rental program as part of a broader expansion that aims to build a new customer base of U.S. owners.</p>
<p>The German automaker said Thursday it is also expanding the Porsche Drive subscription and rental programs to five more cities — up from four. It&#8217;s now offered to customers living in Atlanta, Houston and Phoenix, and in California in Irvine, Los Angeles, Monterey, San Diego, San Francisco and San Jose. Porsche said it plans to continue its expansion in the United States throughout this year and into 2022.</p>
<p>Porsche&#8217;s programs are all about flexibility — and that comes with a price. The Taycan 4S model, which will initially only be available under the single-vehicle subscription or rental plans, cost about 20% more than the monthly cost of a comparable two-year lease. The Taycan 4S fee is $3,250 per month and the Taycan rear-wheel drive will be $2,500 monthly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Renting a Taycan 4S under the short-term plan costs $335 per day for one to three days and $295 a day for more than four days. All prices exclude taxes and fees and any subscriber has to pay a $595 activation fee. Porsche is adding the Taycan rear-wheel drive model later this spring.</p>
<p>Despite the eye-popping price of these programs, they have been popular enough to warrant an expansion. Porsche Drive is booked out one to two months ahead in most markets, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>The automaker views these programs as a complement to selling and leasing cars, not a replacement, according to Porsche Cars North America President and CEO Kjell Gruner. About 80% of Drive customers are new to Porsche, Gruner said.</p>
<p>Porsche first piloted a subscription program in 2017 and has been tinkering ever since. There are now three plans, or tiers, that are all housed under its Porsche Drive vehicle subscription program, which was rebranded in 2020. The most robust plan is Porsche Drive – Multi-Vehicle Subscription, which offers customers the ability to swap through a variety of vehicles on a monthly basis. Porsche Drive-single vehicle subscription gives access to one vehicle for one or three months with an option to extend. Then there’s Porsche Drive – Rental, which as the name indicates, offers shorter-term rentals that are targeted to those who want access to the brand&#8217;s luxury sports cars and SUVs for a week or just a weekend.</p>
<p>All of these plans are accessed by the Porsche Drive app. Users can pick their vehicle and schedule concierge service for vehicle delivery and pick-up through the app. The subscription plans are all based on a flat monthly fee that covers vehicle maintenance and insurance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey got called out by Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-NY) for tweeting during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/house-big-tech-hearing-energy-commerce-misinformation-extremism/">today&#8217;s congressional hearing on disinformation and extremism.</a> The tech exec&#8217;s tweet was likely expressing frustration with the format of the hearing, which once again saw the tech CEOs forced to boil down their answers to complicated questions into simple &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; answers &#8212; or otherwise be cut off from responding. Cryptically, Dorsey this afternoon <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1375152199433527296">tweeted</a> out a Twitter poll with just one question: &#8220;?&#8221; that had only two answers to choose from: either a &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>His post &#8212; or social commentary, if you will &#8212; did not go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Before Rice moved into her line of questioning, which focused on platforms&#8217; ability to radicalize U.S. veterans&#8217; and military service members, she asked the Twitter CEO about his tweet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dorsey, what is winning &#8212; yes or no &#8212; on your Twitter account&#8230;poll?,&#8221; asked Rice, who sat in front of colorful wallpaper covered with flowers, butterflies, bugs and maybe snakes (??), which we agree was one of the better web conferencing backgrounds of the day &#8212; perhaps even besting Dorsey&#8217;s decision to Zoom from his kitchen with a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/heres-the-weird-clock-on-jack-dorseys-kitchen-counter-1846553535">cleverly placed blockchain clock behind him</a>.

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Dorsey answered simply, in the same monotone he used throughout the hearing, which tends to give the impression of someone who just can&#8217;t get worked up over yet another congressional dog-and-pony show.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmm,&#8221; Rice admonished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your multitasking skills are <em>quite</em> impressive,&#8221; she snarked, in a tone that did not seem to indicate she was actually impressed.</p>
<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering, &#8220;Yes&#8221; was winning then and continues to win now, with 65.7% of the 65,626 total votes so far, compared with the just 34.3% who voted &#8220;No,&#8221; as of the time of writing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Matt Salzberg, who co-founded and served as CEO of meal kit startup Blue Apron <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/30/blue-apron-loses-its-ceo/">until 2017</a>, is back in the startup business with a new venture studio called <a href="https://materialcompanies.com/">Material</a>.</p>
<p>Along with Salzberg, Material is led by partners Andy Salamon (formerly a general partner at Atomic Labs who backed Hims and Terminal) and Danielle David Parks (co-founder of Jane Strategy). The studio has been operating for the past year and just closed its first $25 million fund.</p>
<p>Salzberg told me that Material will have &#8220;a very slow and deliberate approach to company creation.&#8221; That means deeply researching an industry (&#8220;We do more private-equity-style due diligence than venture-capital-style diligence&#8221;), identifying an opportunity and recruiting an executive to found the company alongside the Material team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We act as their co-founders, literally, whether with respect to talent and recruiting or resources at our fund, we help very much with investor connections, we help with strategy, we help with relationships,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We let the co-founding CEOs handle the day-to-day decisions and as they bring in outside capital in future rounds, we transition into being more like board members.&#8221;</p>
<p>Salzberg added that his goal &#8220;isn’t to be a factory that churns out five companies a year, six or seven companies a year,&#8221; he said. And instead of being slightly involved in a lot of companies,&#8221;We like to have a lot to do with very few companies.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Blue Apron loses its CEO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/30/blue-apron-loses-its-ceo/embed/#?secret=dtFL1pLugO" data-secret="dtFL1pLugO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Specifically, the Material team plans to launch two new startups every year. For the most part, Salzberg said the ideas for these companies will &#8220;almost always&#8221; originate within Material, because the goal is to start the companies &#8220;from scratch&#8221; rather than make seed investments. He admitted that this approach allows him to &#8220;derive personal satisfaction&#8221; from the process, but he argued that it&#8217;s financially sound as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s also the right investment strategy to create great risk-adjusted returns,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We de-risk the startup process with better vetted ideas, more experienced founders and we&#8217;re giving them a good amount of capital, $2 million to $4 million, from day one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Startups launched from Material include delivery-focused restaurant startup <a href="https://www.kitchentokitchen.com/">Kitchen to Kitchen</a> (led by former FreshDirect CEO Dean Furbish), an Amazon brand acquirer called <a href="https://www.sumabrands.com">Suma Brands</a> (led by former Dolls Kill COO Andrew Savage) and a sales startup that&#8217;s still in stealth mode.</p>
<p>New Material startups could be in any industry, but Salzberg said the team is particularly interested in e-commerce (not too surprising, given his background and Salamon&#8217;s) and the future of work.</p>

<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The NFT market is just getting started, but where is it headed?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/the-nft-market-is-just-getting-started-but-where-is-it-headed/embed/#?secret=igG0xKr8P1" data-secret="igG0xKr8P1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“I’ve been using cryptocurrency before this,” Tolokonnikova told TechCrunch, noting Pussy Riot members have been interested in blockchain technology since around 2015. “Masha [<a href="https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot/status/1354978494585815041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1354978494585815041%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Felcocoliche.com%2Fpussy-riots-masha-alekhina-arrested-again-for-protesting-against-putin%2F">Alyokhina</a>, Pussy Riot co-founder] had problems with her bank accounts. Whenever she would open one, the government would shut it down because she would use some of her money for protestors. Right now she can’t even have her own credit card.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now Tolokonnikova is raising hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of ether this month by dropping a <a href="https://foundation.app/PussyRiot">four-part series of NFTs</a> for the group’s newest music video, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdw0xjjVFpI">Panic Attack</a>.” She says these profits will be donated to a clandestine <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/pussy-riots-first-nft-sales-will-benefit-victims-of-domestic-violence">women’s shelter</a> in Eastern Europe, which caters to women who violated social norms.</p>
<p>“Women in this region are still being treated as property. There’s a stigma. A lot of these women are queer or did something like smile at a stranger, things that are associated with shame on the whole family. If we publicized the location of this shelter, it would motivate people to find the shelter and try to destroy it,” Tolokonnikova said. “As an activist, it’s really exciting to see a tool that’s not controlled by any government.”</p>
<p>It might be easy to dismiss this NFT initiative as a publicity stunt for Pussy Riot’s first studio album, “<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/pussy-riot-new-song-rage-political-prisoners-aleksei-navalny-1121685/">Rage</a>,” scheduled for release in May. Plus, the NFT platform the group is using, <a href="https://foundation.app/PussyRiot">Foundation</a>, could censor the group and make it <a href="https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372165292751732740">difficult</a> for buyers to view or trade NFTs. Crypto collectibles, and any corresponding cryptocurrency earnings, are only censorship resistant when held in a creator’s personal wallet, not on a private company’s platform.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tolokonnikova said her “interest in the technology is long-lasting,” and that she’s already exploring ways to utilize crypto tools to subvert <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-work-female-artists-valued-work-male-artists">sexist power structures</a>. In addition to donating cryptocurrency to activists, Pussy Riot is also sponsoring an <a href="https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot/status/1373323275762167809">NFT scholarship program</a> to cover the Ethereum transaction fees for feminist artists.</p>
<p>“Right now it’s now only for activists and political art works,” she said. “It’s also about educating the Pussy Riot community … we are looking at ways to make NFTs more accessible at a lower price point.”</p>

Smith/Getty Images)</p></div></p>
<p>In the meantime, the group is working on collaborations with other <a href="https://foundation.app/ViktoriaModesta/spike-dance-5549">NFT artists</a> like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/20/-sp-amputee-pop-star-viktoria-modesta">Viktoria Modesta</a>, known for avant-garde fashions for people with disabilities. From Tolokonnikova’s perspective, NFTs offer a way for women artists to gain recognition from the traditional art world. She said that because Pussy Riot focused on performance art and digital art, traditional galleries and collectors rarely took her work seriously. Now, with crypto collectibles, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/even-nycs-highfalutin-guggenheim-museum-is-looking-at-nfts-job-posting-suggests">museums</a> and <a href="https://time.com/5947720/nft-art/">galleries</a> are taking note.</p>
<p>“That is a game-changing dynamic for so many artists who, for the first time in their careers, will be recognized as artists,” Tolokonnikova said. “Before, as part of Pussy Riot, I would use speaking fees or other types of event fees and use that to fund the performance art. I was never paid for the art directly. Now I’m focused on these NFT drops and I’m treating it really seriously.”</p>
<p>While many of the NFT boom’s breakaway stars are white men with traditional credentials and years of professional experience, like <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-beeple-crashed-the-art-world">Beeple</a> and <a href="https://www.trevorjonesart.com/nfts.html">Trevor Jones</a>, women like Tolokonnikova are a fast-growing segment of the crypto ecosystem. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/only-15-of-bitcoin-traders-are-women-broker-study-shows">Crypto exchange surveys</a> show women make up roughly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/meet-the-entrepreneurs-bringing-bitcoin-to-institutions/">15% to 50%</a> percent of tallied users, depending on the region. Organizations like <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/as-interest-in-nft-art-rises-a-look-at-whats-next-on-metakovans-list/articleshow/81653483.cms?from=mdr">Metapurse</a>, <a href="https://she256.org/mentorship/">She256</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/meta-gamma-delta/meta-gamma-delta-grants-round-f12c4b17e035">Meta Gamma Delta</a> offer some mentorship and funding opportunities for women, as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Metapurse is already doing some of this work, but we want to make our own tiny steps to bring more female and queer artists in the space,” Tolokonnikova concluded. “I think it provides amazing tools for the business of the creators’ market. It’s more than just for art. It enhances a creator’s power.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Wednesday, a coalition of a dozen state attorneys general <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/ag_letter_to_tech_ceos.pdf">called on Facebook and Twitter</a> to step up their enforcement of their community guidelines to curtail the spread of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation on their platforms. Their letter specifically identified 12 &#8220;anti-vaxxer&#8221; accounts that were responsible for a sizable 65% of public anti-vaccine content on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. In today&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/house-big-tech-hearing-energy-commerce-misinformation-extremism/">House hearing on disinformation and extremism</a>, Twitter and Facebook&#8217;s CEOs, along with Google CEO Sundar Pichai, were directly asked if they would be willing to take down these 12 accounts.</p>
<p>Their answers were a mixed bag and a demonstration of social media execs&#8217; unwillingness to take a simple action &#8212; taking down a handful of disinformation sources &#8212; that could have a significant impact on Americans&#8217; willingness to get vaccinated to end the pandemic.</p>
<p>Over the course of the hearing, Congressman Mike Doyle (D-PA) pointed out that nearly 550,000 Americans had lost their lives to COVID-19, and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53820225">an independent study</a> found that Facebook users in five countries, including the U.S., had been exposed to COVID-19 disinformation 3.8 billion times. Now that the U.S. is rushing to get shots into people&#8217;s arms to reduce the spread of the deadly virus, it&#8217;s still having to deal with social media sites continuing to promote and recommend content leading to vaccine hesitancy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;My staff found content on YouTube telling people not to get vaccines, and was recommended to similar videos. The same was true on Instagram, where it was not only easy to find vaccine disinformation, but platforms recommended similar posts,&#8221; said Doyle. &#8220;The same thing happened on Facebook, except they also had anti-vax groups to suggest, as well. And Twitter was no different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can take this content down,” Doyle said. “You can reduce the vision. You can fix this, but you choose not to,&#8221; he told the CEOs.</p>
<p>He later directly asked the CEOs if they would be willing to take down the 12 <a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/544712-twelve-anti-vaxxers-are-responsible-for-two">accounts</a> the attorneys general had identified <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/ag_letter_to_tech_ceos.pdf">in their letter</a> as the so-called &#8220;super-spreaders&#8221; of misinformation.</p>
<p>The coalition <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/ag_letter_to_tech_ceos.pdf">had written</a> that both Facebook and Twitter had yet to remove the accounts of 12 prominent anti-vaxxers, who repeatedly violated the company&#8217;s terms of service. These users&#8217; accounts, associated organizations, groups and websites were responsible for 65% of public anti-vaccine content across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, as of March 10, the letter noted.</p>
<p>In response to the question of taking down these dozen accounts, Zuckerberg hedged. He said that Facebook&#8217;s team would have to first look at the exact examples being referenced, leading to Doyle cutting him off.</p>
<p>Pichai tried to start his answer by noting that YouTube had removed more than 850,000 videos with misleading coronavirus information, but was also cut off as Doyle re-asked the question as to whether or not YouTube would take down the accounts of the 12 super-spreaders.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have policies to take down content,&#8221; Pichai said, but added that &#8220;some of the content is allowed, if it&#8217;s people&#8217;s personal experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was posed the same question, he said, &#8220;yes, we remove everything against our policy&#8221; &#8212; a better answer, but also one that&#8217;s not necessarily a confirmation that Twitter would, indeed, remove those specific 12 accounts.</p>
<p>Dorsey, earlier in the hearing, had also spoken broadly about Twitter&#8217;s long-term vision for dealing with misinformation, &#8220;Bluesky,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/">its vision for a decentralized future</a>. He explained how Bluesky would leverage a base, open-source protocol that&#8217;s shared, allowing for &#8220;increased innovation around business models, recommendation algorithms, and moderation controls which are placed in the hands of individuals, rather than private companies,&#8221; Dorsey said. The answer indicated Twitter&#8217;s vision for moderation was ultimately about handing off the responsibility to others &#8212; something Facebook has also done in recent months with its Oversight Committee, an external body that will weigh in on the hardest moderation decisions.</p>
<p>These moves indicate that social networks have decided for themselves that they&#8217;re not capable of handling the responsibilities of content moderation on their own. But whether the U.S. government will actually step in to regulate them as result still remains to be seen.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Thursday’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/house-big-tech-hearing-energy-commerce-misinformation-extremism/">hearing with the House Energy and Commerce committee</a>, lawmakers circled back to Sandberg’s denial, but Facebook still didn&#8217;t have a good answer.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his opening statements, Zuckerberg said that Facebook “did our part” to protect the U.S. election and placed the blame on the actions of former President Donald Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I believe that the former </span>president<span style="font-weight: 400;"> should be responsible for his words and that the people who broke the law should be responsible for their actions,” Zuckerberg wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if Facebook “bears some responsibility” for spreading election misinformation and the Stop the Steal movement, Zuckerberg deflected, declining to answer directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How is it possible for you not to at least admit that Facebook played a leading role in the recruitment, planning and execution of the attack on the capitol?&#8221; Rep. Mike Doyle (D-PA) asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pressed again, Zuckerberg passed the buck. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the responsibility lies with the people who took the actions to break the law and do the insurrection,” he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Secondarily, also with the people who spread that content, including the president but others as well, with repeated rhetoric over time, saying that the election was rigged and encouraging people to organize, I think that those people bear the primary responsibility as well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doyle wasn’t having it, arguing that Facebook “supercharged” the dangerous rhetoric, which spread like wildfire on the platform before the January 6 attack. As Doyle pointed out, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">FBI showed that insurrectionists used Facebook during the “recruitment, planning and execution” stages of the attack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) brought up the Sandberg interview specifically, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My question for you is, will you admit today that Facebook groups in particular played a role in fomenting the extremism that we saw, and that led to the Capitol siege?” Schakowsky asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The comment that Sheryl made, what I believe that we were trying to say and what I stand behind is what was widely reported at the time … &#8221; Zuckerberg began, before Schakowsky told him to get to the point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Certainly there was content on our services,” Zuckerberg said vaguely. “And from that perspective, I think that there&#8217;s further work we need to do to make our services and moderation more effective.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the fact that the Stop the Steal movement<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-takes-down-stop-the-steal-2020-group-organizing-around-false-claims-of-election-chicanery/"> swelled to enormous numbers in Facebook groups</a>, insurrectionist leaders relied on Facebook to communicate and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/capitol-siege-far-right-rioters-used-facebook-to-hunt-lawmakers-fbi-2021-1">hunt for lawmakers on the day of the attack</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That shouldn’t have come as a surprise to the company: The militia members who hatched a plot to capture or kill Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-takes-down-stop-the-steal-2020-group-organizing-around-false-claims-of-election-chicanery/">also relied on the platform to organize and communicate</a>, according to FBI affidavits. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric vehicle manufacturers are pushing back against a decision to delay penalty increases for automakers who fail to meet fuel efficiency standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lobbying group representing legacy automakers — many of whom are now making substantial investments in zero-emissions vehicles — said the increase would have a significant economic impact during a time when the industry is facing mass disruption from the COVID pandemic. But new EV entrants say the penalty mechanism is a powerful performance incentive to decrease tailpipe emissions and encourage investment in lower- or zero-emissions technology.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision, issued in January by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), postpones imposing a penalty increase from the beginning of model year 2019 to model year 2022. Tesla is petitioning the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to review the ruling, saying that the delay “inflicts ongoing, irreparable injury” on the company and creates an “uneven playing field” by reducing the consequences of nonadherence.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) penalty has been increased just once — from $5 to $5.50 for every 0.1 mile per gallon that doesn’t meet the standard — since its instatement in 1975. Congress acted to rectify the effects of inflation on the penalty by raising it to $14 in 2015, but NHTSA and the courts have ping-ponged about the increase ever since. A decision from the Second Circuit last August seemed to settle the issue in favor of instating the higher penalty starting with model year 2019, but automakers last October successfully petitioned that the increase be delayed.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GM reveals an EV for (almost) every purse and purpose&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/07/gm-reveals-an-ev-for-almost-every-purse-and-purpose/embed/#?secret=CHvKmO3g2a" data-secret="CHvKmO3g2a" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CAFE penalty can be a huge boon for zero emissions automakers, who receive credits that they can then sell to other OEMs who fail to meet the fuel efficiency target. In a</span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report to regulators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Tesla said it earned $1.58 billion from selling regulatory credits to other automakers in 2020, up from $594 million in 2019. Delaying the increase harms companies that have made economic decisions on the basis of an increase to the credit, Tesla said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV startups Rivian and Lucid Motors told TechCrunch they also oppose any delay to increasing the CAFE penalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The credit market is very beneficial for the entire EV industry, so every company that is looking to start building EVs, either as a startup or the existing manufacturers, when they build EVs it’s to their benefit to have robust credits,” Kevin Vincent, Lucid Motor’s Associate General Counsel, told TechCrunch. “A lot of existing manufacturers end up selling credits themselves, so it benefits the forward-thinking companies that are improving fuel economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Chen, Rivian’s VP of Public Policy and Chief Regulatory Counsel, said in a statement to TechCrunch that any rollback of the CAFE or other emission standard “only sets the U.S. backward in terms of emission reductions ([greenhouse gas] and criteria pollutants), increased fuel efficiency, reduction of dependence on foreign oil, technology leadership and EV proliferation.” He added that the company “strongly supports efforts to bolster EV adoption that includes more stringent emission standards and higher penalties for failure to meet those standards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NHTSA postponed the increase on the grounds that the penalty should not be retroactively applied to model years that had already been manufactured. As manufacturers have no way to increase the fuel economy level in these vehicles, “it would be inappropriate to apply the adjustment to model years that could have no deterrence effect and promote no additional compliance with the law,” NHTSA said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automakers, in a petition filed by the lobbying group Alliance for Automotive Innovation and in supplemental comments, also cited economic hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mercedes-Benz told NHTSA that the pandemic caused disruptions to its supply chain, workforce and production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that retroactively applying an increased penalty rate in such a tenuous financial climate is unconscionable and inconsistent with this administration’s efforts to promote regulatory relief in light of the economic consequences of COVID-19,” the automaker said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla maintained in its court filing that relying on the COVID pandemic “falls flat” in the absence of specific evidence as to why it warrants the delay.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney generals from 16 states, including California and New York, as well as environmental groups Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, have also objected to the delay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NHTSA decision was issued in docket no. NHTSA-2021-0001. Tesla filed with the second circuit under case no. 21-593.</span></p>
