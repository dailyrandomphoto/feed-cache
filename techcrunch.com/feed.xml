										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>I have a theory. The debate around accreditation in education often focuses on two extremes: the people who don’t believe in the necessity of a four-year degree and the people who think accreditation, and an Ivy-laden stamp of approval, is the only way to succeed. But, nearly two years into covering edtech, I’ve realized that grouping these cohorts into two very separate buckets may be an oversimplification. In fact, as I spoke <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/tigers-den-of-due-diligence/">about on Equity this week</a>, there is more of an overlap than you’d imagine when it comes to how entrepreneurs are viewing the future of education.</p>
<p>Let me explain. When it comes to fundraising or types of capital, optionality has been the term du jour in the current tech environment. And the same goes when we’re talking about the types of education pathways that a student should have access to.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233706" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For example, Woolf founder Joshua Broggi thinks that many tech bootcamps, or newer colleges, will eventually need to provide an accredited option in order to continue attracting customers. He raised millions to prove how important accreditation as a service will be to future educators. Meanwhile, Strive School, led by Tobia De Angelis, was launched in response to the outdated STEM course material taught in European industries. Even though a majority of universities in Europe are low cost or free to attend, he argued that accessibility doesn’t equate to effectiveness. He raised millions of dollars <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/strive-school-wants-to-increase-the-number-of-job-ready-software-engineers-in-europe/">to prove why an alternative is needed</a>.</p>
<p>The similarity between these two entrepreneurs is that they think students need a high-quality education that is actually effective; they just differ in the strategies on how to get there. Ethos-wise, both camps agree that it’s important to offer students a variety of resources, because traditional, one-size-fits-all learning isn’t effective.</p>
<p>For my full take on this topic, check out my TechCrunch+ column: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/13/woolf-accrediting-as-a-service-and-the-future-of-alternative-degrees/">Accrediting as a service and the future of alternative degrees.</a> We’ll go down a whole slew of rabbit holes, including income-share agreements, the nuances of accessibility and why collaboration may be the boring answer to innovation.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about M&amp;A, crypto earnings and startup risk. As always, you can follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a> or direct message me on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/natashathereporter/">@natashathereporter.</a></p>

<p>Off the heels of a $150 million Series B fundraise, New York-based investing platform Republic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/republic-acquires-crowdfunding-media-agency-arora-project-in-multi-million-dollar-deal/">has acquired Arora Project</a>, an equity crowdfunding media agency that helps startups create and launch campaigns (or in other words, serves as a management consultant).</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Republic has always been a more curated platform due to its focus, but Arora Project and future acquisitions could help it find better ways to answer some of these questions — either by introducing a new cohort of investors to its platform or by helping more startups launch campaigns that balance transparency with ambition. Still, given last week’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/06/all-things-in-moderation-including-moderation/">deep dive into the future of moderation</a>, it’s noteworthy that Arora boasts a rigorous vetting process about the upstarts it works with and accepts less than 10% of applications that it receives every month.</p>

<p>Evergrow! Fresh out of stealth and a $7 million seed raise, the climate fintech startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/evergrow-climate-fintech-7m-seed-round-from-xyz-capital-congruent-capital-firstround/">announced its plans</a> to be the “world’s first dedicated carbon offtake company” reports <a href="https://twitter.com/NeeshaTambe">Neesha Tambe</a>. The business is going to fund climate developer projects, and then create long-term offtake agreements for those same budding business plans.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> The startup’s differentiator is its sheer willingness to operate in such a thorny environment. Climate projects often have to show offtake contracts, a guarantee purchase of carbon credits created by the project, to banks before they underwrite any financing. It’s not exactly how venture capital speed works, forcing companies to learn how to balance their cap table with insurance, debt investors and other developers.</p>

<p>Since Coinbase is perhaps the largest, and most known, player in the crypto space, its Q3 financial results came with a certain weight. So, we did an emergency Equity shot on Friday to talk about the numbers<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/13/wall-street-still-doesnt-get-crypto/"> and Wall Street’s confusing reaction.</a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Navigating a volatile market, even if you know it is volatile, is scary for Wall Street, which sent Coinbase’s share price plummeting after a not-super-bright earnings report. It’s a reminder that even amid the hype and certainty that crypto isn’t disappearing overnight, the asset class still has a lot of work to do on education.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233084" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<p>A federal judge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-ordered-to-comply-with-courts-decision-in-epic-games-case-over-in-app-payments/">ruled this week</a> that Apple can’t push back the deadline to update its App Store policies, as previously ordered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">in the court’s decision</a> on California’s Epic Games v. Apple lawsuit. Though Apple largely won that case when the judge declared that Apple was not acting as a monopolist (as Epic Games had alleged), the court sided with the Fortnite maker on the matter of Apple’s anti-steering policies regarding restrictions on in-app purchases.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The original ruling stated that Apple would no longer be allowed to prohibit developers from pointing to other means of payment besides Apple’s own payment systems. But Apple wanted that decision put on hold until its appeals case was decided — a delay that would have effectively pushed back the App Store changes by a matter of years.</p>
<p>The judge heard Apple&#8217;s requests for a stay on the injunction that was ordered, which would have pushed back the December 9 deadline which forces Apple to start allowing links to alternative payment options inside apps.</p>
<p>The question is now whether or not Apple will actually comply (in the way developers are imagining) and if so, how exactly it will interpret the ruling. In South Korea, Apple was ordered to do something similar but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-targets-apple-over-new-app-store-regulation-2021-10-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said it believed it was already in compliance</a> due to how the law was written, leading to further discussions between it and regulators. Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/google-play-to-support-alternative-billing-systems-in-south-korea-following-new-law/">Google complied with the South Korean law</a> but noted it still requires commissions for third-party payments, just at a reduced rate. While it&#8217;s a major step to see any of these app stores open up at all, these moves indicate that the language used to direct changes across the app store has to be precise, or else the companies will find a loophole.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Apple says it intends to ask the Ninth Circuit for a stay as it believes &#8220;no additional business changes should be required to take effect until all appeals in this case are resolved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1458311586456670208" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out</a> the judge&#8217;s ruling was good for developers, not necessarily good for Epic itself, as Apple plans to block Fortnite from the App Store throughout the appeal process.</p>

<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/apple-says-app-store-wont-close-to-developers-over-holidays-as-in-previous-years/">to keep App Store Connect open</a> over the holidays.</strong> In a change from previous years, Apple said it will keep the App Store open to developer submissions over the 2021 holidays. However, it cautioned that during the dates of November 24 to 28 and from December 23 to 27, submissions may take longer &#8212; signaling it&#8217;s running with a reduced staff.</li>

<li><strong>Apple <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=yeyd5xuh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reminded developers</a></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><strong> that a COVID-era deferral on in-app purchases related to virtual group events is nearing its end.</strong> In 2020, Apple temporarily deferred the requirement to offer paid online group event services (one-to-few and one-to-many real-time services) through its in-app purchase system. This included businesses like online tutoring, medical consultations, real estate tours, virtual fitness and more. As COVID raged on, Apple deferred that deadline twice more, to June 2021 and then to December 2021, with the goal of supporting businesses impacted by the pandemic. But it now says the deadline will not be pushed again and apps will have to implement IAP by December 31, 2021, or they won&#8217;t be approved.</span></li>

<li><strong>Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/netflix-to-launch-a-short-form-video-feature-for-its-kids-profiles-on-ios/">added a short-form video feature</a> to Kids&#8217; profiles in its iOS app.</strong> The company said it&#8217;s testing a new feature that would introduce kids to its content library by way of short, auto-playing clips. The new addition has some resemblance to the TikTok-inspired Fast Laughs feature for adult profiles, except that these videos are horizontal, not vertical, and a timer counts down how many clips are left to watch.</li>
<li><strong>YouTube expanded its test that launches mobile users directly into its TikTok-like product, YouTube Shorts,</strong> if that was the area of the app users had last visited. The feature is being tested globally on iOS and is now expanding to Android, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/youtube-to-expand-test-that-reopens-mobile-app-directly-in-its-tiktok-rival-shorts/">TechCrunch confirmed</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></li>
<li><strong>Clubhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/clubhouse-adds-clips-replays-for-asynchronous-listening-better-search-and-spatial-audio-for-android/">announced</a> the launch of a new feature called Replays on iOS and Android that makes its live audio programs available to listen to after the fact.</strong> The app&#8217;s public rooms can optionally be recorded as they happen and then saved to a club or user profile. The Replays will also be downloadable so that anyone hosting a room can share it externally, beyond Clubhouse, “as a podcast, a clip on YouTube, an Instagram story, a TikTok video, or anywhere else,&#8221; the company said.</li>

The feature is notable as most video apps block any sort of sharing and even make screenshots come out all black.</span></li>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Hello and happy weekend! Today we’re talking insurtech, SPACs and how well direct listings can manage the IPO pricing question. But first, crypto.</p>
<p>The crypto beat was busy this week, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/crypto-volatility-continues-to-flummox-wall-street/">Coinbase earnings</a> giving us a good look into just how busy trading activity was for the asset class in the third quarter. If you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/robinhoods-nasty-quarter-shows-the-ups-downs-of-trading-incomes/">recall Robinhood’s earnings</a>, what Coinbase had on offer won’t prove a surprise. After the American equity investment platform’s crypto revenues fell sharply, Coinbase also posted declines in its aggregate trading volumes and revenues compared to the second quarter of the year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233669" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In related news, FTX’s U.S. operations <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-us-reports-third-quarter-2021-trading-results-and-provides-operational-update-301422005.html">disclosed some of its own performance data</a>, indicating that growth is still possible in the crypto trading market despite a general downward trend in the three-month period wrapping up this September.</p>
<p>All that’s to say that the crypto market continues to evolve — molt? — rapidly. From one quarter to the next, activity surrounding major chains and smaller coins can fluctuate rather sharply. For companies like Coinbase, this means variable revenues and profits.</p>
<p>But as Coinbase is cash rich, near-term ups and downs aren’t that big of a deal, so long as the long-term trajectory of crypto activity remains positive.</p>
<p>Another set of companies betting on a long-term upward trend are crypto-<em>gaming</em> companies. And they have been very busy in recent months. For example, Patron <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/patron-a-new-fund-from-former-riot-games-colleagues-locks-down-90-million/">raised a $90 million fund</a> to invest in crypto-based games; Mythical Games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/mythical-games-raises-75m-to-build-an-nft-game-engine/">raised $75 million this summer</a> to build crypto games; a trading card game called Parallel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/nft-sci-fi-card-game-parallel-raises-at-500m-valuation-from-paradigm/">raised at a $500 million valuation</a>; and Axie Infinity <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/axie-infinity">raised a round earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>This week, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/12/big-money-apes-into-blockchain-gaming-with-725m-raise-for-forte/">Forte raised $725 million for its crypto-gaming infrastructure</a>. This leads to me to wonder just how much capital the blockchain games can absorb in the near term. After all, games have historically proven to be poor venture capital investments, at least per traditional venture capital thinking. Why? Because games can prove rather hits-based, with certain titles performing well but fading in revenue terms after their launch.</p>
<p>Investors like strong, predictable, growing incomes. And investors like much less uneven revenues and uncertainty. The type of uncertainty that can come with new titles having the chance to flop.</p>
<p>And yet, slathered with crypto, gaming companies are hot? Are the economics and social risks that games have long demonstrated — the very things that made them less attractive venture wagers — improved when they are built with a blockchain backbone? I don’t see <em>why</em> that would be the case. But investors are putting capital into them as if they have. Let’s see how the various wagers pay out, or don’t, in time.</p>
<h2>Insurtech, SPACs and data</h2>
<p>We’re getting through earnings season at the moment, with all the majors behind us and smaller companies occupying much of our time and energy. From a number of calls this week, the following observations:</p>
<p><strong>Insurtech is hard:</strong> On the heels of news <a href="https://ir.metromile.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lemonade-acquire-metromile">that Metromile was selling itself to Lemonade</a>, you would be forgiven for wondering about the fate of public insurtech companies broadly. However, <a href="https://ir.joinroot.com/news-releases/news-release-details/root-inc-announces-2021-third-quarter-results">Root’s earnings this week</a> gave its share price a huge boost, after investors liked what they saw from the auto-focused insurance company.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that it’s all clear sailing ahead for Root, even as one of its rivals finds a new corporate home. Talking with Root CEO Alex Timm this week, The Exchange got a view into how complicated it can be to time growth in the insurance space.</p>
<p>The CEO explained that Root has dialed back its near-term growth goals given market uncertainty regarding how to price coverage, a problem that many auto insurance companies are dealing with at the moment; this is not a Root issue, I mean to say. It turns out that inflation pressures on the cost of cars and labor are making it difficult to determine the cost of insurance, leading to more caution from the various players in the market when it comes to attracting new policies.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that Root is in any long-term trouble, but it does indicate how macro conditions can make life tough even for tech and tech-enabled businesses. Root is a bet data and smart software can better price insurance over time. But the company, right after it went public, is running into a shift in the underlying economics of its business that is effectively unprecedented, per Timm. Perhaps that complication is partially why Metromile buckled and sold its operations so quickly after its public debut.</p>
<p><strong>SPACs can be ok:</strong> This week NextDoor began to trade as a public company (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nextdoors-spac-investor-deck-paints-a-picture-of-sizable-scale-and-sticky-users/">original notes here</a>). The Exchange caught up with its CEO, Sarah Friar, on its first day of trading to chat about her choice of listing vehicle.</p>
<p>According to the executive, NextDoor had to leave some of its product plans on the cutting room floor in late 2020, giving the company a general desire to raise more capital. And as NextDoor was able to get public-market ready and raise a chunk of money via its SPAC partner at a prearranged price, the deal made sense for her company.</p>
<p>That’s a somewhat standard perspective, and one that details why SPACs were popular earlier in 2021. But things have changed since, with many SPAC-led combinations seeing some of their backers pulling their capital out after they announced takeover targets and moved to consummate the deals.</p>
<p>NextDoor showed that the redemption issue is not endemic. After stating in its first release that its SPAC partner would bring $416 million in cash to its business, the final tally was $404 million. That’s a super-low ratio of lost capital. And NextDoor shares are trading nicely in the wake of its combination. A SPAC-led debut, it appears, can still work well in certain cases.</p>
<p><strong>Direct listings aren’t a pricing panacea: </strong>Amplitude <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/what-amplitudes-choice-to-direct-list-says-about-its-products-growth-and-value/">debuted via a direct listing recently</a> and reported its first set of earnings this week as a public company. The company has traded well since it listed, closing the week worth $73.86 per share, far above its $35 reference price.</p>
<p>Per Yahoo Finance, the company is worth just over $8 billion today. Given that the company chose a direct listing over a traditional IPO to avoid being mispriced, The Exchange was curious if the company was irked that it had raised at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/amplitude-series-f--92399aff">roughly a $4 billion valuation earlier this year</a>, ahead of its direct listing. After all, it direct listed to avoid pricing issues, raising from private investors beforehand, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">similar to what Roblox executed</a>.</p>
<p>Amplitude CEO Spenser Skates said that he felt good about the direct listing, arguing that a traditional IPO would have led to even greater price distortions. To which we say, <em>maybe</em>. But seeing private-market investors get a quick double on their money appears to be a similar cash-left-on-the-table moment as a mispriced IPO would generate, just with a different cohort of rich folks getting the lucre.</p>
<p>And, friends, with that, back to the weekend!</p>

<p>Lawmakers in India, where currently there isn&#8217;t an official framework to oversee cryptocurrency and their trading, have held conversations with several stakeholders in recent quarters to formulate a path forward for the industry.</p>
<p>The move comes as an increasingly growing number of Indians are beginning to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for the first time in their lives. Several Bollywood stars including legendary Amitabh Bachchan and Ranveer Singh, who has starred in several of the country&#8217;s biggest blockbusters, have promoted cryptocurrency trading in recent weeks.</p>
<p>On their part, CoinSwitch Kuber and CoinDCX have started podcasts and other collaborations with industry players to offer content that help youngsters make informed investment decisions.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in India have also expressed concerns around potential misuse of using crypto trading vehicle for laundering money and financing terrorism efforts.</p>
<p>To curb this, the government officials have indicated that they may require crypto exchanges to perform a full KYC of their customers. Most cryptocurrency exchanges have preemptively complied with this suggestion and some have prohibited users from moving their tokens and coins to private wallets or other exchanges.</p>
<p>But that might be the extent to which the Indian government plans to get involved with cryptocurrency at least in the immediate future.</p>
<p>One high-profile politician indicated to an industry executive earlier this month that the country will come up with laws that welcome innovation around blockchain technology and is open to foreign investment into local projects, a person directly familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The government&#8217;s conviction about such a potential move has grown stronger in the wake of the Chinese government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/china-says-all-cryptocurrency-related-transactions-are-illegal/">cracking down on cryptocurrency transactions</a>, the person said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private.</p>
<p>In the Saturday memo, it was relayed that the government is &#8220;cognizant of the fact that [blockchain] is an evolving technology hence the government will keep a close watch and take proactive steps.&#8221;</p>

		Daniel Cossío is the regional director at <a href="https://vilcap.com/about-us/regions/latin-america">Village Capital Latin America</a> and cares about building a more equitable future for the region.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Latin American farms and fields produce a lot of food, but 47 million people still <a href="https://iris.paho.org/bitstream/handle/10665.2/53263/faopahoregionaloverviewfood_eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">remain hungry</a>.</p>
<p>The region <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/CA4076EN/CA4076EN_Chapter2_Latin_American_Agriculture.pdf">accounts</a> for about a quarter of global exports in agricultural and fisheries products, including fruits and vegetables, salmon, maize, sugar and coffee. The agricultural sector is crucial for Latin American livelihoods, <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/CA4076EN/CA4076EN_Chapter2_Latin_American_Agriculture.pdf">contributing</a> to an average of 4.7% of GDP and employing at least 14% of the region’s population.</p>
<p>But paradoxically, the number of undernourished people in the region keeps growing year after year, <a href="https://iris.paho.org/bitstream/handle/10665.2/53263/faopahoregionaloverviewfood_eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">increasing</a> by around 13 million people over the past five years. The Pan American Health Organization estimates that by 2030, “hunger will affect 67 million people in the region, a figure that does not take into account repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230609" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>One major culprit: food waste. More than a third of the food produced each year around the globe <a href="http://www.fao.org/americas/noticias/ver/en/c/239392/">is lost or wasted</a>, and Latin America and the Caribbean are no exception. With a different and enhanced distribution chain, that amount of wasted food could be enough to nourish up to 2 billion people globally.</p>
<p>Here’s the rub: If we want to successfully address malnutrition in Latin America, agritech and food tech solutions need to come from within. Not just because Latin America <a href="http://www.fao.org/americas/priorities/seguridad-alimentaria/en/">has enormous natural wealth</a>, but because almost every Latin American has experienced food insecurity in one way or another, and someone who understands the problem is best suited to build a suitable solution.</p>
<p>Ady Beitler, chief executive officer at Nilus, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/follow-the-food/the-reason-we-are-running-out-of-farmers/">puts it well</a>: “There’s more food out there than what’s needed to eradicate hunger. That’s for sure. What doesn’t exist is a distribution system that can get that food to those who most need it.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, Latin America is also a crib of creative minds that are crafting agritech and food tech solutions to better distribute food, increase agricultural efficiency and prevent people from being hungry. Entrepreneurs are helping farmers access tools that can better support them, reduce food waste and develop plant-based products. These solutions tackle the different parts of the food production system, from fields to plates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One category of innovation that can reduce food waste: tools to help farmers improve field productivity. For example, <a href="https://sensix.ag">Sensix</a> from Minas Gerais, Brazil, uses drones and machine learning to map lands’ fertility. <a href="https://cienciapura.cl">Ciencia Pura</a>, a Chilean startup, implements software that illuminates plants throughout their different growth stages when natural light is unavailable.</p>
<p>A related category: innovation that helps reduce food loss through pest control. Typically, farmers control pests with a fungicide that creates health risks for both consumers and farmers. Plus, farmers normally detect pests too late and crops are lost.</p>
<p>Costa Rican startup <a href="https://www.clearleaf.cr">ClearLeaf</a> created a nontoxic, natural fungicide that enhances plant growth. And Brazilian startup <a href="https://www.sensaiotech.com">SensaIoTech</a> operates a platform that monitors crops and collects information to identify and detect pests on time.</p>
<p>The supply chain represents another important window to prevent food waste and, as a consequence, reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Food that’s thrown away in one neighborhood for being “<a href="https://newsandviews.vilcap.com/posts/world-without-hunger-philip-behn">imperfect</a>” is still healthy and consumable for another one where people are starving. That’s why Argentinian startups are revolutionizing logistics: <a href="https://nilus.online/">Nilus</a> recovers food that is perfectly safe to eat but would otherwise be thrown out and delivers it to low-income neighbors at discounted prices. <a href="https://www.savetic.com/en/home/">Savetic</a> develops software that traces products, analyzes data and predicts consumer trends to decrease food waste in supermarkets.</p>
<p>Another category to reduce food waste: agricultural waste reuse. Chilean startup <a href="https://fotortec.com">Fotortec</a> transforms agricultural waste into mushrooms that can be used as a flavor and protein enhancer. Peruvian startup <a href="https://bionatsolutions.com/#home">Bio Natural Solutions</a> reuses tropical fruit waste to develop a natural and nontoxic protection for fruits and vegetables that doubles their shelf life.</p>
<p>Lastly, entrepreneurs are finding plant-based products that provide protein and nutrition in an environmentally friendly way. <a href="https://plantsquad.com.mx/en/home">Plant Squad</a> from Mexico City develops alternative plant-based protein products that are nutrient dense and environmentally conscious. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/faba.oficial/">Faba</a>, from São Leopoldo, Brazil, sustainably extracts proteins from chickpeas.</p>
<p>The food system in Latin America is large and complex and won’t change in one day. But these startups (and many more) are leading the way in creating a collective response and building awareness around the financial support that these entrepreneurs need.</p>
<p>The agritech and food tech sectors are generating interest from international and regional investors and other ecosystem builders. If entrepreneurs received even more support from these important ecosystem players, the exorbitant amount of food waste could be reduced and entrepreneurs would build a fair and sustainable food system in Latin America.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines!</span></p>
<p>Friday afternoon the Equity team took to a Twitter Space to hit on a topic that we had to cut from our regular end-of-week show, namely crypto earnings and how Wall Street is digesting the results. And to bring in extra mental horsepower, <a href="http://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> lassoed new TechCruncher <a href="https://twitter.com/AnitaRamaswamy">Anita Ramaswamy</a> to help.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233501" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We touched on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/crypto-volatility-continues-to-flummox-wall-street/">Coinbase&#8217;s Q3 financial results</a> and what they tell us about trading incomes, and the company itself. Robinhood&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/robinhoods-nasty-quarter-shows-the-ups-downs-of-trading-incomes/">own Q3 results</a> were part of the chat as well, as they showed a similar pattern to what Coinbase disclosed.</p>
<p>More companies than just those two, newly-public entities are reporting crypto trading declines. Square did as well, after its bitcoin revenues slipped in Q3. Simply put, consumers traded less crypto in Q3 than they did in Q2, and a number of companies that were recently riding high on that particular volatility cycle had to deal with a down-cycle period.</p>
<p>We talked about what the results mean for the noisy world of crypto startups, many of which are looking to the highly-visible Coinbase as an indicator of what they can expect as they attempt to scale in a volatile market.</p>
<p>Equity is back Monday!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When it comes to fundraising or types of capital, optionality has been the term du jour in the current tech environment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Joshua Broggi believes that three new colleges need to be created every single day, for the next decade, in order to adequately meet demand from students. So, he is building <a href="https://woolf.university/">Woolf,</a> what he claims is the first software platform that can launch and manage an accredited digital college.</p>
<p>Woolf wants to take off “the sophisticated burden” of accreditation, or recognition that an institution fits certain criteria and standards, from younger institutions or programs &#8212; ranging from tech bootcamps to an entirely virtual business school. Similar to how the University of California (UC) system brings together a group of prestigious universities under one brand, Woolf wants to be the “UC” for lesser-known institutions that want to level up their curricula and offer credits at the same time. So far, Woolf is working with seven pilot customers across seven countries.</p>
<p>Broggi’s vision of accreditation as a service, and this early traction, helped the startup land a $7.5 million seed round led by Todd Jackson at First Round Capital, with participation from investors such as Connect Ventures’ Sitar Teli, IOVC’s Shuonan Chen, All Access Fund’s Shaan Puri and Tribe Capital’s Jonathan Hsu.</p>
<p>The debate around accreditation often focuses on two extremes: the people who don’t believe in the power of a four-year degree and the people who think accreditation is the only way to succeed. I think that is an oversimplification; there is more of an overlap that you’d imagine when it comes to how entrepreneurs are viewing the future of education.</p>
<p>Case in point: Woolf University isn’t competing with the cadre of startups offering non-accredited alternatives to education. Instead, Woolf wants to make them future customers.</p>
<p>When it comes to fundraising or types of capital, optionality has been the term du jour in the current tech environment. And the same goes when we’re talking about the types of education pathways that a student should have access to. Broggi’s key argument here is that many tech bootcamps, or newer colleges, will eventually need to provide an accredited option in order to continue attracting customers.</p>
<p>Ethos-wise, it seems like both camps agree that it’s important to offer students a variety of resources because traditional, one-size-fits-all learning isn’t effective. Strive School, led by Tobia De Angelis, was launched in response to the outdated STEM course material taught in European industries. Even though a majority of universities in Europe are low cost or free to attend, he argued that accessibility doesn’t equate to effectiveness. He raised millions of dollars <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/strive-school-wants-to-increase-the-number-of-job-ready-software-engineers-in-europe/">to prove why more options are needed</a>.</p>

Parr says, &#8220;When you hear &#8216;quiz,&#8217; you might be tempted to think of a BuzzFeed-style personality assessment, but in reality, they are the fundamental way we figure out what products we want to buy and what package to get.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><em>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/introducing-the-techcrunch-global-affairs-project/">TechCrunch Global Affairs Project</a> examines the increasingly intertwined relationship between the tech sector and global politics.</em></p>
<p>Criminals have a long history of conducting cyber espionage on China’s behalf. Protected from prosecution by their affiliation with China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS), criminals turned government hackers conduct many of China’s espionage operations. Alarming as it may sound, this is not a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/26/technology/china-hackers.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">new phenomenon</a>. An <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1295981/download">indictment</a> issued by the U.S. Department of Justice last year, for example, indicated that the simultaneous criminal-espionage activity of two Chinese hackers went back as far as 2009. In another case, FireEye, a cybersecurity company, <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/08/apt41-dual-espionage-and-cyber-crime-operation.html">alleges</a> that APT41, a separate cohort of MSS hackers, began as a criminal outfit in 2012 and transitioned to concurrently conducting state espionage from 2014 onward. But there’s reason to believe that since then, China has been laying the groundwork for change.</p>

The CCP’s first effort in 2015 was to standardize university cybersecurity degrees by taking inspiration from the United States’ National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education — a NIST framework for improving the U.S. talent pipeline. One year later, China announced the construction of a new <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/chinas-national-cybersecurity-center/">National Cybersecurity Talent and Innovation Base</a> in Wuhan. Including all of the <a href="https://ncc-map.cset.tech/">Base’s components</a>, it is capable of training and certifying 70,000 people a year in cybersecurity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230313" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Along similar lines, in 2017, the Central Cyberspace Administration of China announced an award for <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/chinas-cyberai-talent-pipeline/">World-Class Cybersecurity Schools</a>; a program that currently certifies eleven schools in the same way some U.S. government agencies certify universities as Centers of Academic Excellence in cyber defense or operations. But having a new pool of talent untainted by criminal activity is not reason enough to change China’s operational approach.</p>
<p>Efforts to professionalize state hacking teams are also directly linked to President Xi&#8217;s political goal of reducing corruption. <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/03/01/chinas-domestic-security-agencies-are-undergoing-a-massive-purge">Xi’s recent purge</a> of China’s state security services demonstrates the risk officials run by enriching themselves using government resources. Patronage relationships between contract hackers and their handlers are precisely the type of profiteering behavior that Xi has targeted in his <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/04/947943087/how-chinas-massive-corruption-crackdown-snares-entrepreneurs-across-the-country">sweeping anti-corruption campaign</a>.</p>
<p>In an increasingly cutthroat environment, officers running operations that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-allies-accuse-china-global-cyber-hacking-campaign-2021-07-19/">draw international ire</a> or foreign criminal indictments are vulnerable to being turned in by rivals. Officials targeted by internal investigators may find themselves locked up in “<a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/06/12/the-anti-graft-unit-of-chinas-communist-party-has-grown-in-power">black jails</a>.” China’s security services will shed their relationship with underground hackers as they weed out corrupt officials and directly hire hackers.</p>
<p>The implications of these measures suggest that the Chinese hackers that the world’s companies and intelligence services are accustomed to defending against will be far more professional by the end of the decade.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A more capable China will behave differently than the China we see today. Given its reliance on illicit hackers to hide its criminal and espionage activities, the Ministry of Public Security has tolerated some cyber criminals’ Chinese operations, despite the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannaren-ransomware-author-contacts-security-firm-to-share-decryption-key/">problems</a> they cause. Once criminal activity is no longer the norm, China’s security services will find that they can move these operations in-house, since government spying is an accepted behavior in international relations. As a result, China’s Ministry of Public Security may conduct more <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/winnti-trend-micro-china-gambling/">operations</a> against cyber criminals. Analysts should be on the lookout for a rise in these internally focused, anti-crime operations, which would be a good indicator of a change in operational tactics.</p>
<p>This shift in Chinese cyber capabilities will be felt abroad as the list of targeted countries and entities grow. Espionage priorities that long languished near the bottom of the list are likely to  receive renewed attention as the roster of state hackers swells. These campaigns will not be more “sophisticated” than past operations, since China’s hacking teams are already on par with the best. But they will become more frequent.</p>
<p>As China’s security-backed hacking steadily sheds its veneer of criminality, we can expect to see a slowdown over the next decade in cybercrime conducted by contract hackers and others connected to the state. But this trend away from thuggery will be paired with a rise in espionage and intellectual property theft. In hindsight, China’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/26/technology/china-hackers.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">reliance</a> on criminal hackers will seem like a vestige of the old MSS — corrupt and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/10/1020596/how-chinas-attack-on-microsoft-escalated-into-a-reckless-hacking-spree/">even amateurish</a>.</p>
<p>While this shift will be gradual, we can expect certain indicators, like rumors of crackdowns within the security services or reports of disappearing or indicted criminal groups. Over time, we can expect to see the gradual separation of technical indicators between known criminal and espionage hacking teams.</p>
<p>But since spying isn’t against the rules, U.S. policymakers will need to continue prioritizing cybersecurity across government agencies, the defense industrial base and critical infrastructure operators. The White House is already moving in this direction; in August 2021 the administration rallied NATO allies on cyber policy and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/08/25/remarks-by-president-biden-on-collectively-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">identified</a> 500,000 unfilled cybersecurity jobs. For its part, the NSA launched the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/21/nsa-is-surging-its-collaboration-with-private-sector/">Cybersecurity Collaboration Center</a> earlier this year to increase systemwide cybersecurity.  The United States already uses competitions like <a href="https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/">CyberPatriot</a> to push students into the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice">well-developed</a> cybersecurity <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/">talent pipeline</a>. Creating new programs aimed at encouraging job retraining through community colleges <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/">certified in cyber defense</a> would leverage existing resources but may attract new students who missed the K-12 pipeline the first time around.</p>
<p>Above all, policymakers should remain vigilant. A decline in China’s use of criminals doesn&#8217;t mean the threat has disappeared, only changed. The U.S. government should be prepared to seriously consider the full range of options to meet the challenge of China’s next generation of hackers.</p>

<div class="article__contributor-byline">
	<div class="contributor-byline__contributor">
		<div class="byline__author">
							<span class="byline__author-name">João Del Valle</span>
						<span class="byline__author-title" style="display: block;">Contributor</span>
		</div>

		<div class="contributor-byline__bio">
		João Del Valle is the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://business.ebanx.com/en/">EBANX</a>, a Brazilian fintech unicorn that serves as the gateway to Latin America through its payments platform for global merchants, tech giants and other large companies from all over the world.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">If you look under the hood of nearly any large merchant’s e-commerce operations, there are likely more than a dozen different card-acceptance platforms meshed together to serve different parts of the world with banking partners doing payment settlements and managing foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Latin American companies have the added challenge of processing the many transactions that are not card based, like bank transfers, emerging instant payments and the cash-based ones that offer in-person payments that need to be electronically confirmed.</p>
<p>A merchant might need anywhere from 50 to hundreds of partners, depending on complexity and the countries they are targeting. If any of the aggregate transactions across platforms go down for just a millisecond, that transaction will fail, potentially leading to huge losses.</p>
<h2>Why online merchants need a new breed of infrastructure fintechs</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The key to growing market share and loyalty for global merchants and service providers is knocking out the friction tied to payments and the online buying experience.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For global merchants expanding to the region — from <a href="https://www.alizila.com/alibabas-marketplace-aliexpress-ramps-up-in-brazil-as-e-commerce-booms/">Alibaba</a> to <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/articles/business/amazon-in-brazil-is-not-as-big-as-you-might-expect/">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e21efb53-4d70-4b89-8c69-ddd21628a1e8">Shopee</a> in e-commerce, to tech giants offering a variety of services such as <a href="https://www.garena.sg/">Garena</a>, <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/articles/technology/netflix-streaming-leader-latin-america-future/">Netflix</a> or <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2021/brazilian-central-bank-gives-green-light-whatsapp-payments/">WhatsApp</a> — Latin America’s payments landscape is particularly daunting. In South America alone, there are at least 14 different currencies.</p>
<p>Across Latin America and the Caribbean, there are more than <a href="https://statistics.cepal.org/portal/cepalstat/national-profile.html?theme=1&amp;country=atg&amp;lang=en">30 countries</a>, all with varying local customs, financial regulations and consumer protections. There’s also the issue of most global acquirers’ inability to recognize many Latin Americans’ credit scores, leading to a high rate of unapproved transactions.</p>
<p>While advancing quickly, these global merchants have not caught up with regional e-commerce giant MercadoLibre, which continues to <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/articles/business/mercado-libre-latin-america-main-ecommerce-player/">lead in Latin America</a>, pushing past a market cap of more than $90 billion earlier this year. In a Nasdaq analysis of MeLi’s most recent earnings report, writer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willhealy71/">Will Healy</a> describes some crucial advantages for LatAm’s current e-commerce leader, including its investments in both shipments and payments, and its “secret weapon” in <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/02/mercadolibre-has-a-secret-weapon-in-mercadopago">Mercado Pago</a> to facilitate electronic payments in its cash-dependent markets.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 12, 2021! It is Friday, my friends, the end of yet another week. The TechCrunch team hopes that you are healthy and ready for a rest. If you still have energy in the tank, Equity has an episode that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/tigers-den-of-due-diligence/">digs into how Tiger is putting capital to work</a>, while the Found team has an interview <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/how-one-founder-aims-to-help-ensure-you-can-keep-upgrading-your-smartphone-regularly/">with Megan O’Connor from Nth Cycle</a> that is worth checking out. Now, the news! — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/faster-deals-less-diligence-the-african-startup-market-mirrors-its-larger-rivals/">The African startup market’s growing pains:</a> </strong>With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">record capital flowing into African startups</a>, you might imagine that all things are great in the continent’s venture capital scene. Things are <em>good</em>, yes, but not perfect. TechCrunch learned from a few investors that while many deals are getting done, ills like lackluster due diligence that are impacting other markets are also at play in Africa. And African startups may need more late-stage capital, which took us by surprise, given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/venture-capital-is-going-to-need-a-record-breaking-run-of-ipos-to-clear-its-own-decks/">how active big checks have proven elsewhere this year</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/why-moviepass-co-founder-bought-back-the-brand/"><strong>MoviePass may live again:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Few startups truly earn the moniker Icarus. MoviePass is perhaps one, given how high it flew and how it burned through cash into the grave. But perhaps Lazarus is a better analogy, as the brand could be coming back to market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/oxygen-a-neobank-for-freelancers-and-small-businesses-in-talks-to-raise-funds-at-over-500-million-valuation/"><strong>Neobanks keep on raising:</strong></a><strong> </strong>While the world waits <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">for Nubank’s IPO to price and start trading</a>, investors are not pausing on making wagers into the challenger banking fintech segment. Oxygen, for example, a neobank that targets freelancers and SMBs, is in talks to raise at a half-billion valuation, TechCrunch reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/foody-cooks-up-marketplace-for-culinary-creators/"><strong>What are recipes worth?</strong></a><strong> </strong>A startup called Foody is wagering that they have real value &#8212; and that consumers will pay for them. The startup has raised $1.5 million for its food creator marketplace. That people will pay for recipes is at once true and dated. Yes, people pay for them, but largely in book format. Precisely how that model will translate to the digital realm is less clear.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/promoted-ai-marketplace/"><strong>Promoted.ai raises for better marketplace search:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Perhaps Foody will become a customer of what Promoted.ai is building, namely technology to help consumers find what they really want to buy on digital marketplaces. It just raised $2 million. Given how much capital has been invested in marketplace startups, it isn’t hard to come up with a potential customer list for what Promoted is building.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/weflow-pours-pre-seed-funding-into-tool-that-makes-updating-salesforce-faster/"><strong>Weflow wants to make Salesforce less irksome to use:</strong></a><strong> </strong>First, a note that Weflow is not Webflow. The latter is a business that helps folks build no-code websites that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/webflow-raises-140m-pushing-its-valuation-to-2-1-billion/">has raised oodles of cash</a>. Weflow is a tool to help salespeople keep their CRM up to date with less pain. And it has not raised nine figures of capital, instead adding a more modest $2.7 million to its own coffers this week.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/bellabeat-ivy-bracelet-health-tracker-review/"><strong>Bellabeat’s new health wearable shows promise:</strong></a><strong> </strong>From the hardware neck of the woods today, TechCrunch gave the Ivy wearable a try. Per our own Amanda Silberling, the wristband device wants to help users track “sleep patterns, heart rate, menstrual cycles, steps, hydration, activity, mindfulness and more.” But, she writes, its software left us wanting more.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/zembo-nabs-3-4-million-from-toyota-dob-equity-and-infraco-africa-to-grow-its-motorcycle-startup-in-uganda/"><strong>$3.4M for electric motorcycles in Africa:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Proof that not all startup activity in Africa is fintech-related, Zembo just raised capital from Toyota and others for its EV business. Zembo is notably based in France but focused on Africa, we should note, and sells its vehicles on a lease-to-own program.</li>

<li>Jyoti Bansal, who sold his previous startup AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion.</li>
<li>Monica Sarbu, who sold her startup Packetbeat to Elastic.</li>
<li>Nick Mehta, who sold his email archiving startup LiveOffice to Symantec.</li>
</ul>
<p>“It was four days of long board meetings and discussions and debates and fights and getting to the decision. So it wasn’t an easy decision,&#8221; said Bansal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though, at $3.7 billion, everyone thought it should probably be a no-brainer; it wasn’t.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nestled in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521321716/d157488ds1a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rivian&#8217;s S-1 IPO filings</a> was a note that the EV company&#8217;s &#8220;cornerstone investors&#8221; had &#8220;indicated an interest&#8221; in buying up to $5 billion worth of its stock at its IPO price. One of those parties was Amazon, and the American e-commerce giant appears to have pulled the trigger Friday afternoon on its buy.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001018724/000089924321044350/xslF345X03/doc4.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent Form 4 filing</a>, Amazon bought roughly $200 million worth of Rivian stock at its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/electric-automaker-rivian-largest-ipo-2021/">IPO price of $78 per share</a>. The buy worked out to 2,564,102 shares in total, worth a hair under the target dollar amount of a flat two hundred million at their purchase price.</p>
<p>Amazon now owns a total of 158,363,834 shares of Rivian, valued at some $20,579,380,228.3 at the company&#8217;s closing price of $129.95 per share set this afternoon. As Amazon paid just $78 per share for its most recent tranche of Rivian stock, the company has already seen upside of more than $133 million on the purchase.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233688" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In percentage terms, Amazon&#8217;s latest purchase of Rivian stock at its IPO price works out to just 1.6% of its total stake in the company, after its various pre-IPO holdings and warrants converted to Class A shares in the company now that it is publicly traded. When considering its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/amazon-reveals-20-stake-in-rivian-ahead-of-ev-makers-ipo/">previous ownership</a>, Amazon now owns about 22% of Rivian.</p>
<p>Rivian&#8217;s IPO has been a blockbuster event, raising an ocean of capital for the EV company and boosting its market cap into the stratosphere. Yahoo Finance <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RIVN/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicates</a>, for example, that Rivian is worth north of $127 billion today at the close of the week&#8217;s trading cycle.</p>
<p>Given that Rivian built just 12 cars in Q3, the company is worth around $10 billion per manufactured unit from its last reporting period. That ratio will fall in coming quarters, but underscores just how much of Rivian&#8217;s valuation is predicated on future results, and not past performance.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Let’s examine a series of winning fintech results from BNPL, consumer finance, proptech and corporate finance before turning to fintech's earnings misses from Q3 2021.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startup investors around the world are pouring capital into fintech startups. With good reason, it appears, if third-quarter earnings from public companies in the sector are any indication.</p>
<p>Earnings reports released this week show a host of fintech players with strong operating results, both delighting investors and boosting share prices. For private companies, seeing their public champions do well is more than simply encouraging; strong results from their comps could help upstarts continue to attract venture capital.</p>
<p>It’s shaping up to be fintech’s year, both in the public and private markets. After raising a record total of $52.9 billion in 2018, global fintech companies saw their private investment plateau in both 2019 ($46.5 billon) and 2020 ($48.4 billion), according to <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/">data collected by CB Insights</a>. But this year, global fintech startups raised $94.7 billion through Q3.</p>
<p>That wave of capital has borne a host of new unicorns, as investors wager that there’s ample growth ahead for fintech companies generally. Meanwhile, third-quarter results from companies like Affirm, SoFi and Marqeta support the view that the sector still has a way to go in filling white space, coloring over incumbents and aging systems.</p>
<p>Let’s examine a series of winning fintech results from BNPL, consumer finance, proptech and corporate finance players. After parsing those results and relating what they may mean for startups in those subsectors, we’ll discuss fintech earnings misses from Q3.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Hint:</strong> Trading incomes that were once the toast of the fintech market caused more than a few companies to stumble when they released their recent operating results.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Consumer lending is strong</h2>
<p>Public buy now, pay later (BNPL) company Affirm beat investor expectations in <a href="https://investors.affirm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/affirm-reports-fiscal-year-2022-first-quarter-results">the most recent quarter</a>, which is the first quarter of its fiscal 2022. And the recently listed fintech raised its guidance for its current fiscal year.</p>
<p>Affirm saw active consumers of its BNPL offering grow 124% to 8.7 million during the quarter, and the number of transactions per active consumer increased 8% to 2.3. But where it saw real growth was in the number of active merchants on its platform, which increased from 6,500 to 102,000 thanks to the adoption of Shop Pay Installments by merchants on Shopify.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back when most commerce took place on the local high street, shoppers who exchanged personally identifiable information with merchants received something in return.</p>
<p>Shops kept track of customers&#8217; hat, shoe and dress sizes, along with their birthdays, anniversaries and personal preferences. In return, buyers got a first look at new products and service that anticipated their wants — personalized shopping.</p>
<p>For most of the internet era, that work was performed with tools like browser cookies and tracking pixels, but consumer desire for greater privacy (and increased regulation) is forcing online marketers to rethink basic practices.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233463" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What if instead of surreptitiously tracking our behavior, they just asked us for relevant details?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just e-commerce: New restrictions on data sharing and collection will raise customer acquisition costs for everything from auto sales to real estate. If your startup is formulating a zero-party data strategy, please read.</p>

<p>Your homepage is your most valuable asset when it comes to explaining what you do and the value you provide.</p>
<p>At its root, it&#8217;s an advanced exercise in storytelling, but many startups completely overthink it, which is why studying how the competition presents itself will help you save time and money on testing and optimization.</p>
<p>As an example, Demand Curve’s Joey Noble tears down automation service Zapier’s homepage, delving into the copywriting and conversion tactics that have helped the platform gain millions of users worldwide.</p>

<p>In an expansive interview, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky and TechCrunch Managing Editor Jordan Crook looked back at how the travel company has adapted since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Their chat covered topics as far afield as Airbnb’s “work anywhere” policy, how it’s addressing liability issues for hosts and his biggest regret from the COVID-19 era:</p>
<blockquote><p>I overrode the host cancellation policy and refunded more than a billion dollars of guest bookings. I think it was the right thing to do. But I did it unilaterally, without consulting the hosts. They got really pissed off and it broke some trust with some of our host community.</p></blockquote>

<p>Raising debt is never easy for startups, and for fintechs with a business model that revolves around lending, raising a line of credit from banks or lending institutions can take several months.</p>
<p>Offering &#8220;debt as a service,&#8221; Sivo aims to rectify this problem through its platform, which requires few agreements and fees, and makes raising debt “as easy as plugging into an API,” reported Ryan Lawler.</p>
<p>&#8220;Early returns have been positive: In just about three months since launch, Sivo has received about $4 billion in demand and actually signed $1.5 billion in term sheets from originators who wish to leverage its debt-as-a-service offering,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, according to founder and CEO Kate Hiscox, the company is in the process of onboarding 600 originators who are hoping to tap into its programmatic debt lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>Investing in companies that have astronomical valuations based on expected growth can work out really well. But when the gulf between expectation and reality becomes too great, markets can crash.</p>
<p>According to Alex Wilhelm, today’s IPO market and valuations are based on real growth, but investors should still remain wary.</p>
<p>“The public is increasingly able to invest in higher-risk tech companies, and as multiples rise, the amount of air that tech valuations sit upon is expanding,” he writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The public is now at risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>This week, salad chain Sweetgreen set an IPO range of $23 to $25 per share, giving it a multiple of about 8.2x and a valuation between between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of lettuce, but the pricing shows how much tech-enabled DTC firms can flex, writes Alex Wilhelm, who compared Sweetgreen&#8217;s range to IPO pricing for Allbirds and Rent the Runway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Modern software multiples these are not, but nor are they poor,&#8221; says Alex. &#8220;In fact, they are better than I would have guessed, more evidence that I am a mixture of Scrooge and the Grinch.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a recent episode of TechCrunch Live, Managing Editor Jordan Crook spoke to Guild Education CEO Rachel Carlson, co-founder Brittany Stich, and Aileen Lee, founder and managing partner of Cowboy Ventures, about the education upskilling platform&#8217;s origins and growth arc.</p>
<p>Cowboy Ventures led a $2 million seed round in 2015 while the founders were just starting their entrepreneurial journey.</p>
<p>“[We felt like we had to] show up and be a founding team,” said Carlson.</p>
<p>“We tried to fake it a little bit. We had this great intellectual first meeting, and at the next one, I felt like I had to show up and show her that I made a business. I was a little less authentic.”</p>

<p>For several years, I&#8217;ve earned a living sitting at a desk in my living room. Each day, I get up, brew some coffee, and go to work.</p>
<p>“‘Remote’ is fundamentally disadvantaged,&#8221; said Phil Libin, founder and CEO of startup studio All Turtles and mmhmm at TechCrunch Disrupt. &#8220;We’re not remote, we’re distributed. We’re distributed intentionally in the same way that the internet is a distributed system.”</p>
<p>Managing Editor Eric Eldon interviewed Libin and Wendy Nice Barnes, chief people officer at Gitlab, to learn more about how to foster company culture, manage individuals and hire efficiently in a distributed workplace.</p>
<p>“It’s much easier now versus getting in my car, commuting to an office, having to check in and go through security — and then go sit in a room and be there for five or six hours,&#8221; said Barnes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you have the flexibility and you’re intrigued and you’re going to learn faster through the interview process remotely.”</p>

<p>Fintech reporter Ryan Lawler interviewed Expensify CEO David Barrett this week about the timing of the company&#8217;s IPO, and why they chose a traditional direct listing over a more trendy SPAC.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re aiming to be the most pro-employee IPO ever. So even though it’s a traditional IPO, with the exception of a collection of insiders, all of our employees can trade up to 15% of their shares starting today. Normally, you can only get that kind of &#8216;day one&#8217; liquidity if you did a direct listing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Barrett said getting liquidity for early shareholders was also a major consideration, as the company is already profitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really came down to — there’s no future where we don’t end up going public at some point. So then it’s no longer if we should go public, it’s really about when.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fact that Q3 earnings for Robinhood and Coinbase were both below expectation has Alex Wilhelm wondering whether Wall Street is underestimating just how volatile the crypto market is.</p>
<p>&#8220;The speed of the crypto economy as a whole may be simply too quick for public-market investors to fully grok,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the exchanges aren’t even the swingiest of crypto-themed investments.&#8221;</p>

<p>To better understand what goes through a founder’s mind when considering a sale, Ron Miller hosted a panel at TC Sessions: SaaS with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jyoti Bansal, who sold his previous startup AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion.</li>
<li>Monica Sarbu, who sold her startup Packetbeat to Elastic.</li>
<li>Nick Mehta, who sold his email archiving startup LiveOffice to Symantec.</li>
</ul>
<p>“It was four days of long board meetings and discussions and debates and fights and getting to the decision. So it wasn’t an easy decision,&#8221; said Bansal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though, at $3.7 billion, everyone thought it should probably be a no-brainer; it wasn’t.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Jared Spataro, corporate vice president for Microsoft 365, talks about Microsoft's move to a cloud-centric model.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We tend to take the cloud for granted today as a way of delivering and building software, but it wasn&#8217;t always the case. Less than a decade ago, in fact, companies like Microsoft sold <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/adobes-complex-journey-from-boxes-to-the-cloud/">most of their software in boxes</a> or in large on-prem installations inside customer data centers.</p>
<p>Around 2012, as the company began thinking about what the future of computing might look like, it became clear that software would eventually move to the cloud. Microsoft would have to go through a long journey of changing internal processes and convincing customers the cloud was a more efficient way to deliver software.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that in those days, whether we were talking Office or SharePoint, the company&#8217;s content management system, the software was developed over long multiyear cycles and delivered as one massive change. Not every customer upgraded because they had built systems to work with a previous version, and there was a large cost associated with upgrading.</p>
<p>That meant that existing customers often used older versions and didn&#8217;t take advantage of the latest innovations that Microsoft spent significant resources creating.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The fact that the company was ahead of its customers on this had to be scary, but Microsoft understood that the cloud was the future. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Today, Microsoft&#8217;s cloud software business is booming — the productivity and business category, where Office 365 and other cloud productivity software live, alone raked in $15 billion in business in the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2022-Q1/press-release-webcast">most recent earnings report</a> (this category also includes LinkedIn revenue). That&#8217;s up 22% from a year earlier. That number included boxed software, by the way, which is still sold in parts of the world. In case you&#8217;re wondering, boxed sales declined 13% for the same period, as companies and individuals increasingly chose cloud.</p>
<p>Last month, I interviewed Jared Spataro, corporate vice president for Microsoft 365, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/jared-spataro-will-talk-about-building-microsofts-saas-business-at-tc-sessions-saas/">at TechCrunch Sessions: SaaS</a>. He was at Microsoft during the company&#8217;s transition to the cloud, and we talked about what was involved in making such a huge shift and how the company convinced often reluctant customers that the cloud was the way to go.</p>
<h2>Leading through change</h2>
<p>Nobody likes a massive change, and it seemed like a big unknown for most customers looking at the cloud in 2012. Sure, there were successful SaaS companies at that point, Salesforce being a prime example, but it was a much smaller company than it is today.</p>
<p>There was still a prevailing feeling that the cloud represented a gamble. &#8220;When we first started thinking about making a transition from our previous model to the cloud, we of course, had those conversations with customers, and I&#8217;ll never forget customers saying, &#8220;No way, don&#8217;t go chase that. We&#8217;re not interested. Don&#8217;t spend your money there, spend your money in places where we want you to improve the product,&#8221; Spataro told me.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News broke yesterday that MoviePass co-founder Stacy Spikes purchased ownership of the beleaguered brand for an undisclosed sum. The transaction follows one of the more spectacular tech flameouts in recent memory. The service was plagued by ever-changing price tiers, blowback from the country’s biggest theater chain and major issues with its app.</p>
<p>Spikes tells TechCrunch that he was fired from the service he helped launch in 2018, after voicing concern over the price of its $10/month subscription service. It was one of a number of factors under the leadership of Helios and Matheson that ultimately led to the company’s protracted undoing.</p>
<p>This April, Spikes announced the launch of PreShow Interactive, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/preshow-interactive/">which we described as</a>, “a new way [for gamers to] earn in-game currency in exchange for watching ads.” In a conversation with TechCrunch, Spikes says that PreShow may live on in a different form, as part of a revamped MoviePass set to launch at some point next year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233508" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>All of this still sounds very much up in the air. First up on the company’s checklist is getting access to the defunct service’s code and other assets. Spikes also plans to test the waters and determine whether there is enough demand to warrant MoviePass’s return. With an industry struggling to bring back audiences after a seemingly endless global pandemic, is it possible that this is the right moment for a more thoughtful return of movie ticket subscriptions?</p>
<p><strong>TC: You had experience in the music industry that may have prepped you for the changes the movie industry has undergone over the past several years. It was a canary in the coal mine for a major part of the entertainment industry essentially imploding.</strong></p>
<p>SS: With subscription, you saw Napster, Pandora, Spotify, Rhapsody &#8212; all of this stuff on the horizon. You’re absolutely right, the music industry went first. Netflix was on the back end of a lot of those music subscription plays getting up and on their feet and making its digital transition out of DVDs and into digital. That was where digital really took hold first, and you saw it transforming the landscape.</p>
<p><strong>When you had the idea for MoviePass, was there a sense that someone needed to disrupt theaters the way these services disrupted music?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Being one of the few executives of color, I started Urban World Film Festival, to try and help filmmakers of color have a place. Ava DuVernay came out of that festival, Malcolm Lee, Tim Story, Lee Daniels. All this talent came up out of Urban World. Our initial thought was, their films were having a tough time getting into mainstream theaters and getting traction.</p>
<p>What I was going to do is create a circuit that they would play 10 markets, we had a subscriber group, we would four-wall the theaters, and it would make the circuit. We were trying to figure out what technology we would use. Who&#8217;s a member? How do you get to the theater? How do you just walk in? As we were building that someone said, “well, why don&#8217;t you just use it to help all independent movies?” And then it kept bubbling up from there.</p>
<p><strong>How different was your view of what MoviePass would be from the model that Helios and Matheson ultimately put in place?</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the day, when I was CEO, we price tested $15 up to $90. We were A-B testing these things all day long. What you are trying to do is find the vector point between what&#8217;s a profitable business price and what&#8217;s too expensive for people and you cut out the ability to grow, and what&#8217;s too cheap that you never, you&#8217;re never going to make money. We knew going below a certain point, financially, you couldn’t float the boat. There was no way. I think the big difference was we already knew that. When they came in with the idea that they know better, they fired me. They said, “you don&#8217;t agree with our view of the world.” Within four or five months of the deal, I was let go and kicked off the board.</p>
<p><strong>What are the primary reasons MoviePass failed?</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the day as a business, that price wasn&#8217;t sustainable. That&#8217;s a simple truth. It doesn’t get more complicated.</p>
<p><strong>There was the technical aspect of it, too. Shutdowns and other things were extremely frustrating for users.</strong></p>
<p>That wasn’t technical, because it was intentional. When I was CEO, the MoviePass app worked great. It functioned. Peopled loved the ease of service. I can go wherever I want, I can walk up to any theater. We had a larger footprint than Fandango and Movie Tickets combined. In any theater, probably except for drive-ins or cash-only, you could use MoviePass. So that ease of use and simplicity was perfect. We worked a lot of years to get that that right. Everything that transpired after that was intentional. Those weren&#8217;t technical issues. Them deciding to pull AMC Theaters, or your app not working fully were not technical issues.</p>
<p><em>[Editor’s note: As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/business/moviepass-settlement-ftc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted in this piece</a>, the FTC accused MoviePass of going to, “great lengths to deny consumers access to the service they paid for while also failing to secure their personal information.” MoviePass <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/10/ftc-finalizes-settlement-operators-moviepass-related-allegations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settled with the FTC last month</a>.]</em></p>
<p><strong>You mentioned AMC. Do you think you will try to court some of these larger theater chains?</strong></p>
<p>My goal is to help Hollywood return, help movie-going return. I think there is a place in the universe for &#8220;only sign up to one exhibitor,&#8221; and that&#8217;s the only one you go to. That’s your subscription plan, you only go there. I think there&#8217;s a place in the universe for people who want to go be able to go multiple places, and they may pay a little more for that. I think there&#8217;s room in the ecosystem for that, and I and our team have always only been driven to help drive movie going. We think that subscription can be a really big benefit for the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel there&#8217;s enough goodwill left in the name MoviePass? Is it smart to return under that banner?</strong></p>
<p>I guess the question is, is the consensus that the buying company was MoviePass, or the five years of the brand leading up to that was MoviePass? My experience, and I&#8217;m seeing, is people who signed up prior to 2017 know the difference. I think that there was a brand there. They knew what we were trying to do. We were the underdog. And we were trying to build something unique in our space.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it make sense specifically to return to the brand versus starting from scratch?</strong></p>
<p>When I look at Apple after Steve Jobs left, and I look at Dell computers after Michael Dell left. And you know, when founders get forced out of companies, there&#8217;s a lot of cases where those founders came back. And they fought for that thing that they work years to give birth to. I started working on MoviePass in 2005. And so it&#8217;s 16 years. And so I think there&#8217;s an affinity to when you build something that you just believe in. And so do we do a name change? I don&#8217;t know. I mean, we&#8217;ll find out. I think there&#8217;s going to be a listening tour. We&#8217;re going to hear people, get feedback, but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here to do. But I think there&#8217;s something there that we want to try for.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the records referred to third or fourth fiscal quarter 2022 as a relaunch time frame. Does that sound right?</strong></p>
<p>There’s a lot of things that have to come together. When I was asked, I said we’re going to explore. I think if the industry is not going to support it, I think if consumers don&#8217;t like the idea of it, I think if studios aren&#8217;t interested in it, as well, you know, I would probably go “okay, I paid a little bit for this, we talked to a lot of people, everybody thinks movie subscription is a dumb idea. We just all need to keep paying more prices, and people need to keep going to the theaters less, let&#8217;s just let this ship keep going where it&#8217;s going.” If you get that overwhelming sense, then we&#8217;ll just kind of keep moving. But if there is a sense that the stakeholders do want to lean into something that can help the industry overall, how do we get out of our ivory towers that are built, that are only designed for that circuit?</p>
<p><strong>The PreShow site lists the service as launching summer 2021. We’re in autumn right now. What&#8217;s the time frame there?</strong></p>
<p>The thought was, there&#8217;s a possibility of combining. I think PreShow needs a home, it needs a place to launch from. The thought was, is there a way to pull in some of what PreShow was trying to build. Maybe there&#8217;s a way to reduce the cost inside of MoviePass, to offset some of that. I don&#8217;t know is that a freemium model? I don&#8217;t know is that at a supplementary model? I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a select as you go, your own choice. I think those things would have to get tested and figured out.</p>
<p><strong>So PreShow won’t exist in the form it was initially envisioned.</strong></p>

We thought we could just launch it and the audience would be there, but you have to either build that audience or buy that audience. MoviePass might give it that audience that so many brands want to be in front of.</span></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s possible that some of that could subsidize the cost of movie tickets.</strong></p>
<p>It could be. Or it might be something that reduces a person&#8217;s monthly charge that they pay, versus completely subsidizing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I have in my hands the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/products/detail/game-and-watch-the-legend-of-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legend of Zelda Game &amp; Watch</a>, the second in Nintendo&#8217;s line of whimsical throwback handhelds clearly meant as stocking stuffers for those who already have (or can&#8217;t find) a Switch. It does a fine job, and the three old-school Zelda games included are great options for Nintendo-hard adventure that actually fits in a pocket.</p>
<p>Announced a couple months back, this $50 gadget is very similar physically to last year&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/nintendos-mario-game-watch-is-a-choice-gaming-stocking-stuffer-of-2020/">Mario Game &amp; Watch</a>, the first in the series based on Nintendo&#8217;s pre-Game Boy line of handhelds. The only difference is the addition of the start and select buttons, which are actually used in the Zelda games.</p>
<p>The games themselves are the inimitable original, The Legend of Zelda; its brutally hard side-scrolling sequel The Adventure of Link; and cherished puzzle box classic Link&#8217;s Awakening, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-remake-is-a-classic-well-worth-revisiting/">recently remade in style</a>. There&#8217;s also a recreation of a classic monochrome Game &amp; Watch from the &#8217;80s, though its entertainment value is, frankly, limited.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233122" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You can play each straight through, or hit the Game button to switch to another, saving your progress. There are no save states beyond that, though, so get ready to die a gazillion times in Zelda II.</p>
<p>The display is nothing fancy but matches the game resolution well, looking as clear as can be expected at that size. It&#8217;s definitely harder to play on this handheld than on a TV, but very doable. For the record, these close-up pictures show more pixilation than you notice when playing; there&#8217;s definitely no screen door effect as you see in the shot below. In a nice little bit of attention to detail, Link&#8217;s Awakening has an aspect ratio adjustment option; the original Game Boy screen was narrower than 4:3, so you can switch between them on the fly. Notably this is the original monochrome version, not colorized.</p>

<p>The &#8220;watch&#8221; portion consists of a clock and now also a timer app. The clock is quite fun, actually: At midnight and noon Link begins his quest in the original game, starting out by collecting his sword and progressing rather haphazardly through the game, repeatedly killing the endlessly spawning monsters on a screen for a minute at a time — and sometimes dying himself, only to likewise be revived — before moving on to the next one. It&#8217;s not recorded by a simple AI playing the game, so you won&#8217;t see the exact same thing happen over and over.</p>
<p>At 7:59, for instance, he is clearing a green dungeon room of Stalfos, and as the clock strikes 8 he always advances into the boss room, where he plays the flute to reduce Digdogger, slaughters the poor shrunken thing, and collects his fifth piece of the Triforce. At 11:30 he enters the final dungeon and at midnight effortlessly dispatches Ganon in a bit of an anticlimax — and the cycle repeats, albeit with a different color scheme. The dungeons and overworld are not exactly as in the original game but have been modified in various ways to allow for the clock. Still, you get a sense of progression as this Sisyphean Link progresses through the game, collecting the various tools and treasures over and over.</p>

<p>The timer is a limited but helpful little item which does exactly what you might expect, counting down from any full minute increment under an hour. Link battles waves of enemies in Zelda II style, and seems to have as much trouble as I do killing those stupid blue knights. It tracks his highest &#8220;score&#8221; for a given time, so you can set it to three-minute rounds and take bets on how he does.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233515" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-12-10.28.07.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233515" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2233515 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-12-10.28.07.jpg" alt="Nintendo's Zelda Game &amp; Watch showing a timer with Link fighting monsters." width="1024" height="742" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-12-10.28.07.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-12-10.28.07.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-12-10.28.07.jpg?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-12-10.28.07.jpg?resize=768,557 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-12-10.28.07.jpg?resize=680,493 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-12-10.28.07.jpg?resize=1536,1113 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-12-10.28.07.jpg?resize=2048,1484 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-12-10.28.07.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2233515" class="wp-caption-text">You can do it, Link! (Again, the moire effect here is exaggerated; to the eye the display looks very clean.) <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The hardware, as I said, is largely unchanged, but the addition of the start and select buttons means that A and B, already rather far down the device, are even lower. I think it has graduated from &#8220;not ideal&#8221; to &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; if you plan to play for longer than a few minutes and have average-size hands or larger. Nintendo, we can shift those up half an inch, can&#8217;t we? Fortunately the device is very light.</p>
<p>On the rear of the Zelda Game &amp; Watch is a little Triforce that, for no reason at all, lights up very dimly. It&#8217;s a sweet little totally unnecessary detail and indicative of someone over there really loving this thing.</p>
<p>Battery life will likely depend on how bright you make the screen, but it&#8217;s at least five or six hours, and likely more. I&#8217;m testing it right now and will update this post later.</p>
<p>Another fun detail, and perhaps I missed this on the Mario one, is that the box it comes in doubles as a little stand; you fold out cut-out legs and it holds the device at the proper angle to be seen — the viewing angle isn&#8217;t great, so leaving it flat or propped straight up isn&#8217;t ideal.</p>
<p>All in all the Zelda Game &amp; Watch is a fun little gadget that any lover of the NES and Game Boy classics will appreciate. The only question is whether you&#8217;ll be able to get hold of one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Oxygen, a startup that is bringing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/oxygen-seed/">digital banking services to freelancers and micro- and small-sized businesses</a>, is in talks to raise a new round at a valuation of over $500 million, two sources familiar with the matter told me.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-headquartered firm is in advanced stages of talks to raise about $70 million, the sources said. London-based Tribe Ventures is in talks to lead Oxygen&#8217;s Series B round, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the details are private.</p>
<p>Banks in the U.S. &#8212; and elsewhere &#8212; have traditionally refused to serve individuals without a traditional job and a consistent salary flow.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233475" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Hussein Ahmed, who previously worked at Amazon, faced this issue himself when he started to work as a freelance consultant for other startups. &#8220;That&#8217;s when I stumbled upon the market segment we are serving today,&#8221; he said in a podcast last year. Ahmed was working from a WeWork and realized that &#8220;everyone around me, from photographers to real estate brokers to accountants, were facing the same problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was then when Ahmed started <a href="https://oxygen.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxygen</a>. The startup offers consumers and small businesses accounts at zero monthly fee. These accounts, which are FDIC insured, can be operated without a minimum balance and come with a Visa debit card.</p>
<p>The startup, which counts Y Combinator and Runa Capital among its backers, has amassed over 600,000 customers.</p>
<p>Oxygen declined to comment on the fundraise talks, but through a spokesperson Ahmed said the startup has seen a &#8220;massive growth in 2021,&#8221; and increased its revenue by 10 times this year. &#8220;We are having continuous conversations about how to best fund our future plans and will comment when we can.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year millions of people are diagnosed with cancer. Meanwhile, hundreds of clinical trials testing potential treatments are ongoing. But there’s a gap between the people who need treatment and the people who actually end up in those studies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women and ethnic minorities are often underrepresented in cancer trials. For example, one 2018 meta-review of 310 clinical trials conducted between 2003 and 2016 found that non-Hispanic whites </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29099678/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">were more likely to be enrolled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in clinical trials than African American or Hispanic and Latino participants. Over the course of 14 years, 83% of trial participants were white, 6% were Black, 5.3% were Asian/Pacific Islander, 2.6% were Hispanic and less than 1% were American Indian/Alaskan Native. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excluding breast cancer, just 41% of trial participants were women. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233383" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been movement at the FDA to attempt to correct this. For instance, in 2020, the FDA </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enhancing-diversity-clinical-trial-populations-eligibility-criteria-enrollment-practices-and-trial"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released industry guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to enhance the diversity of clinical trial participation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One company currently operating in this space is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/trialjectory-uses-self-reported-clinical-data-to-match-cancer-patients-with-clinical-trials/">Trialjectory</a>, founded in 2017. The startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches cancer patients to clinical trials. In 2019, it only had about 2,000 members. In 2021, the company is on track to reach 50,000 cancer patients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirty-five percent of patients on Trialjectory are people from underrepresented backgrounds. Of that 35%, 60% are African American, 30% are Hispanic or Latino and the final 10% represent a mix of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native American, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and “other race/ethnicity,” according to figures provided by a company PR representative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sixty percent of these patients are women &#8212; though that figure may be skewed because of a focus on breast cancer trial matching. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch spoke to Trialjectory&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Tzvia Bader about the company’s growth strategy, creating patient community, why the pandemic has changed how people view their own healthcare and how tech and education go hand in hand in building diverse clinical trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The below interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. </span></p>
<p><b>TC: I’m curious to hear about the growth in the amount of patients on your platform. What do you think has fueled it over the past few years? </b></p>
<p><b>Bader: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think a lot of the growth is with this changed mindset and understanding of patient roles. Until now, the majority of patients outsourced their treatment to a physician. Whatever he says goes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key things that happened was that we, as patients, need to own more of the decision-making. We don’t outsource our flights anymore, we go to Kayak. We don’t outsource buying a house, we go to Zillow. Fighting for our lives&#8230;we can’t outsource that. We want to be on top of it and know all our options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second thing is related a little to COVID. When COVID started, treatment got pushed to the side. They were left at home with mobile devices and a computer, frightened not just from COVID but because of their cancer. That basically gave them an even bigger kick in the butt to own their journey and look for options. It expedited this trend of taking ownership and leadership [of care.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, if you think about COVID: Who is owning the journey? It’s us. We decide when to get tested. We decide when to get the vaccine. We don’t need to go to a physician to refer us. It’s already creating this mindset of: I need to be in charge, I need to be in control. </span></p>
<p><b>Let’s say a patient decides ‘I want to be more active in my cancer care.’ How exactly are they finding you?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We like to be wherever patients are. Patients are online. They spend 90% of their time online educating themselves, searching, trying to understand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We follow every aspect of their journey, and are creating content, like e-books to support them. We’re collaborating with advocacy groups. Even more importantly, there’s a big impact from patient-to-patient discussion and patient-to-physician discussion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve seen tremendous growth from this. Patients who found us, and used us, and told other patients. They’re part of patient communities, and they reach out online and offline for that type of support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we realized this network impact of the community we structured it even more. We have a program now called the patient champion. Patients that have used us become brand ambassadors and we’re leveraging them to share information with the communities they’re a part of. [</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Editor’s note: These ambassadors are unpaid, and the company says they have “a couple hundred” since the program was formalized roughly two months ago.] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s one of the key pillars of our growth strategy. Patients want to help other patients. </span></p>
<p><b>How do you select your patient champions?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are people in our community who have indicated they want to participate, and are physically capable of doing it. Then, they do whatever they feel comfortable doing. Some would just like to share their story. That goes all the way to building additional communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, not all breast cancer patients are the same. Those that are in their 20s before kids suffer from different types of challenges, compared to those in their 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s. There&#8217;s a lot that comes into play also in terms of what drives the treatment decisions, and what&#8217;s a concerning factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of what the champions do is highlight those, and then provide support and information around it.</span></p>
<p><b>How have you been able to access groups that are historically underrepresented in clinical trials? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason we’re able to reach them is exactly because we’re reaching out directly to the patient. And, we’re reaching out to the large proportion of patients &#8212; 85% of patients &#8212; who are being treated in the community setting &#8212; not the large research institutions. The majority of them live in the America that’s not large cities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re investing a lot in empowering them, in educating them and helping them understand their journey. We don’t leave them in a place where they’re still dependent on going to the oncologists, or they’re dependent on the oncologists’ time or knowledge to expose them to clinical trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s just not going to happen. Your oncologist doesn’t necessarily have time to invest in searching [for clinical trials]. And if patients have to search for themselves they get overwhelmed and confused. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We identify clinical trials, and explain why they are important. The information we give is patient-friendly. We show them key information that’s important to them: how many times treatment is given, how treatment is given. You need to understand if you can still go to work. Will I be able to maintain any kind of work-life balance? This is information they care about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have a team in place whose main job is support. A lot of time people from more diverse populations will want to talk to someone. They want to hear a voice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a team that is there for what I call “the last mile.” They’re there to listen and connect them with help if they need additional assistance. It might be: someone can’t go by themselves because they don’t have family nearby. So we might connect them to an advocacy group that can support them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We help remove barriers to help them act upon their options. </span></p>
<p><b>It’s one thing to match patients with clinical trials. But how do you actually &#8220;activate&#8221; them, or get them to enroll? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we really want to activate and empower people to take action, we need to help them understand, and help them navigate the journey. What we’ve found is that a lot of this helped with the activation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more I understand my options, the more likely I am to act upon it. Otherwise I might be afraid to bring it to my oncologist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a real use case. We had a patient whose oncologist wanted to put them on one of the PD-L1 inhibitors. But he saw on our platform that almost 40% of similar patients had reported progression with that treatment. So then he saw that one of the trials was a combination of that drug and another immunotherapy drug. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went to his oncologist and said, what do you think of that [trial]? It changes the dialogue: he comes to his physician, and he understands his options. And, the physician actually said: ‘I hadn’t heard about that trial. I think it’s worth pursuing.’ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s about giving the right options, giving them the data points and knowledge without scaring them, and without using language they don&#8217;t understand. And then from there, they’re acting upon it.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced today that it&#8217;s rolling out new shopping features: Shops in Groups, product recommendations and a test of Live Shopping for Creators.</p>
<p>Shops in Groups enables admins of Facebook groups to set up an online store on their associated Facebook Page. It&#8217;s up to the admins where this money goes &#8212; in the case of OctoNation, a page that tested the feature, the profits went to OctoNation&#8217;s nonprofit that educates people about octopuses (octopi?). This could get hairy in groups that don&#8217;t have a clear philanthropic aim, but it&#8217;s not as though Facebook groups have never been sites for drama before. Still, Yulie Kwon Kim, Meta&#8217;s vice president of Product Management, pointed out that many group admins are volunteers, and these shops could offer them a revenue stream for their work.</p>
<p>&#8220;The money goes to the group admin, and they can decide how they want to use it,&#8221; she told TechCrunch. &#8220;This is a great way for people to sustain and keep the group going.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233317" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/facebook-groups-to-gain-personalization-features-subgroups-chat-and-tools-for-making-money/">had previously announced its plans</a> for group monetization features &#8212; including shops, fundraisers and subscriptions &#8212; at its Facebook Communities Summit hosted earlier this month.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233367" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233367" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2233367" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Shops-in-Groups.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233367" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Facebook also said that users often ask for product recommendations in groups &#8212; think about a skincare or makeup group &#8212; so now, if a user mentions a product that is listed in a Facebook shop, they can tag it and embed it into their comment. Top product recommendations from groups will appear within users&#8217; news feeds.</p>
<p>Facebook has had Live Shopping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/06/facebook-live-shopping/">for years</a>, but as partnerships between brands and creators become more common, the app has begun testing a feature that would make these collaborations appear more seamless. Now, instead of an influencer directing fans to another page to watch them sell a product or vice versa, creators and brands can cross-stream on both of their pages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2233364" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233364" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2233364" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Top-product-mentions.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Top-product-mentions.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Top-product-mentions.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Top-product-mentions.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Top-product-mentions.png?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Top-product-mentions.png?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Top-product-mentions.png?resize=1536,1408 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Top-product-mentions.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233364" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>This year, Facebook &#8212; now under the company name Meta &#8212; has consistently worked on building out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/facebook-whatsapp-e-commerce-features/">shopping tools</a> for businesses and creators. So it only makes sense that as the holiday season draws nearer, the company is launching more ways to spend money on the Facebook app. These features will be available starting today on the web and on the Facebook mobile apps for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Right now, Meta&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/facebook-will-no-longer-allow-advertisers-to-target-political-beliefs-religion-sexual-orientation/">primary revenue stream</a> comes from advertising, but the company&#8217;s investment in shopping could offer another source of income. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113127348899371" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> this summer that as Meta rolls out more creator and commerce tools, it&#8217;s committed to not taking a cut from the earnings of businesses and creators until 2023. He added that when the company does introduce a revenue share, it will be less than Apple&#8217;s 30% cut. But by building a robust infrastructure for e-commerce now, the company is positioning itself for future profit.</p>
