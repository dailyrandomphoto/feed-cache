										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Morgan Stanley has joined the growing list of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/accellion/">Accellion</a> hack victims — more than six months after attackers first breached the vendor’s 20-year-old file-sharing product.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The investment banking firm — <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-fined-1-million-for-client-data-breach-1465415374">which is no stranger to data breaches</a> — confirmed in a letter this week that attackers stole personal information belonging to its customers by hacking into the Accellion FTA server of its third-party vendor, Guidehouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a letter sent to those affected, first reported by <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/morgan-stanley-reports-data-breach-after-vendor-accellion-hack/">Bleeping Computer</a>, Morgan Stanley admitted that threat actors stole an unknown number of documents containing customers&#8217; addresses and Social Security numbers.</p>
<p>The documents were encrypted, but the letter said that the hackers also obtained the decryption key, though Morgan Stanley said the files did not contain passwords that could be used to access customers&#8217; financial accounts.</p>
<p>“The protection of client data is of the utmost importance and is something we take very seriously,” a Morgan Stanley spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We are in close contact with Guidehouse and are taking steps to mitigate potential risks to clients.”</p>
<p>Just days before news of the Morgan Stanley data breach came to light, an <a href="https://www.arhealthwellness.com/about-us.html">Arkansas-based healthcare provider</a> confirmed it had also suffered a data breach as a result of the Accellion attack. Just weeks before that, so did UC Berkely. While data breaches tend to grow past initially reported figures, the fact that organizations are still coming out as Accellion victims more than six months later shows that the business software provider still hasn’t managed to get a handle on it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The cyberattack was first uncovered on December 23, and Accellion initially claimed the FTA vulnerability was patched within 72 hours before it was later forced to explain that new vulnerabilities <a href="https://www.accellion.com/company/press-releases/accellion-provides-update-to-recent-fta-security-incident/">were discovered</a>. Accellion’s next (and final) update came in March, when the company claimed that all known FTA vulnerabilities — which authorities say were exploited by the FIN11 and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/ukrainian-police-arrest-multiple-clop-ransomware-gang-suspects/">Clop ransomware gang</a> — have been remediated.</p>
<p>But incident responders said Accellion’s response to the incident wasn’t as smooth as the company let on, claiming the company was slow to raise the alarm in regards to the potential danger to FTA customers.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, for example, raised concerns about the timeliness of alerts it received from Accellion. In a <a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/news/2021/05/reserve-bank-taking-action-to-respond-to-data-breach-reports">statement</a>, the bank said it was reliant on Accellion to alert it to any vulnerabilities in the system — but never received any warnings in December or January.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this instance, their notifications to us did not leave their system and hence did not reach the Reserve Bank in advance of the breach. We received no advance warning,&#8221; said RBNZ governor Adrian Orr.</p>
<p>This, according to a discovery made by KPMG International, was due to the fact that the email tool used by Accellion failed to work: &#8220;Software updates to address the issue were released by the vendor in December 2020 soon after it discovered the vulnerability. The email tool used by the vendor, however, failed to send the email notifications and consequently the Bank was not notified until 6 January 2021,&#8221; the KPMG&#8217;s <a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/-/media/ReserveBank/Files/data-breach/kpmg-incident-assessment.pdf">assessment</a> said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We have not sighted evidence that the vendor informed the Bank that the System vulnerability was being actively exploited at other customers. This information, if provided in a timely manner is highly likely to have significantly influenced key decisions that were being made by the Bank at the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>In March, back when it was <a href="https://www.accellion.com/company/security-updates/mandiant-issues-final-report-regarding-accellion-fta-attack/">releasing updates</a> about the ongoing breach, Accellion was keen to emphasize that it was planning to retire the 20-year-old FTA product in April and that it had been working for three years to transition clients onto its new platform, Kiteworks. A press release from the company in May says 75% of Accellion customers have <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/18/2231538/0/en/Accellion-FTA-Customers-Migrate-to-Kiteworks-to-Protect-Their-Most-Sensitive-Data.html">already migrated</a> to Kiteworks, a figure that also highlights the fact that 25% are still clinging to its now-retired FTA product.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This, along with Accellion now taking a more hands-off approach to the incident, means that the list of victims could keep growing. It’s currently unclear how many the attack has claimed so far, though recent tallies put the list at around 300. This list includes Qualys, Bombardier, Shell, Singtel, the University of Colorado, the University of California, Transport for New South Wales, Office of the Washington State Auditor, grocery giant Kroger and law firm Jones Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a patch is issued for software that has been actively exploited, simply patching the software and moving on isn’t the best path,&#8221; Tim Mackey, principal security strategist at the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Since the goal of patch management is protecting systems from compromise, patch management strategies should include reviews for indications of previous compromise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Accellion declined to comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://powerz.tech">PowerZ</a> has raised another $8.3 million (€7 million at today’s exchange rate) including $1.2 million (€1 million) in debt — the rest is a traditional equity round. The company is both an edtech startup and a video game studio with an ambitious goal — it wants to build a game that is as engaging as Minecraft or Fortnite, but with a focus on education.</p>
<p>In February, PowerZ launched the first version of its game on computers. It doesn’t have a lot of content, but the company wanted to start iterating as quickly as possible. Aimed at kids who are 6 years old and over, PowerZ teleports the player into a fantasy world with cute dragons and magic spells.</p>
<p>“The idea is really to build a sort of Harry Potter,” co-founder and CEO Emmanuel Freund told me. “You have this world that is super nice and very interesting. Like with Hogwarts, you want to come back regularly. And the story will progress over a very long time.”</p>
<p>15,000 children tried out the first chapter. On average, they spent 4 hours in the game. I asked whether Freund was satisfied with those metrics. He told me he thought his company’s vision was “completely validated.”</p>
<p>Bpifrance Digital Venture, RAISE Ventures and Bayard are investing in today’s round. Existing investors Educapital, Hachette Livres, Pierre Kosciusko-Morizet and Michaël Benabou are also investing once again.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175174" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175174" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png" alt="" width="1024" height="614" class="size-full wp-image-2175174" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=1536,922 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175174" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PowerZ</p></div></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to add content, expand to other platforms and launch new languages. When it comes to content, the company wants to partner with other game studios. They’re going to create new islands and design games that make you learn new stuff. Zero Games, Opal Games and ArkRep are the first third-party studios to contribute to PowerZ.</p>
<p>When those new chapters are available, kids will be able to practice mental calculation, geometry, vocabulary, foreign languages, sign language, but also astronomy, photography, architecture, sculpture, cooking, wildlife, yoga, etc.</p>
<p>“Basically we want to position ourselves as a publisher,” Freund said. “The only thing we want to keep in-house is the main storyline.”</p>
<p>As for new platforms, PowerZ is launching its game on the iPad this week. The company realized that launching on computers was a mistake. Adults are already using computers or don’t want to leave your kid on the computer. That’s why PowerZ is starting with the iPad and the iPhone will follow suite. In 2022, the company expects to release its game on the Nintendo Switch and potentially other game consoles.</p>
<p>While the game is only available in French for now, the startup is also thinking about launching an English version soon.</p>
<p>“The game is completely free right now. We have an idea to monetize it. We&#8217;ll copy every other games with in-app purchases for visual items,” Freund said.</p>
<p>When you look further down the roadmap, PowerZ has some radically ambitious goals. Freund believes that educational games will become mainstream really quickly. Many companies don’t want to develop this kind of stuff because screens are bad for kids.</p>
<p>“If we just say that screens are bad, we’ll end up with an Amazon product to learn math. I feel a sense of urgency to develop an educational platform for screens that can scale,” Freund told me.</p>
<p>PowerZ wants to reach hundreds of thousands of children as quickly as possible. And just like Fortnite or Minecraft, the company believes its game can act as a platform for other stuff that can evolve over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As I mentioned at the close of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/robotics-roundup-18/">last week’s roundup</a>, the biggest issue in writing this roundup on Wednesday is that sometimes news breaks on Thursday morning. Again, I’m asking the robotics community to try not make any big headlines on Thursdays. That would really help a guy out.</p>
<p>Last week, news broke that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/zebra-technologies-is-acquiring-warehouse-robotics-company-fetch/">Zebra Technologies had purchased Fetch</a>. I’ve written about the latter several times over the past couple years, and spoken to founder Melonee Wise a number of times, as well. Ultimately, it’s not much of a surprise Fetch went the acquisition route. If I were a better man, however, I would have leaned heavily toward an acquisition by some mega-retailer like Walmart or Target.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172692" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172692" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2172692" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fetch-robotics-melonee-wise.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fetch-robotics-melonee-wise.jpeg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fetch-robotics-melonee-wise.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fetch-robotics-melonee-wise.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fetch-robotics-melonee-wise.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fetch-robotics-melonee-wise.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fetch-robotics-melonee-wise.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172692" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Everyone is looking for a competitive advantage against Amazon, including those big names. And, of course, they’ve got the deep pockets to purchase a head start. Ultimately, I think a deal like this is better for the industry, at large, given how Amazon’s acquisitions tend to go. The company loves to buy up startups and keep all of that cool technology to itself. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/fetch-robotics-ceo-on-the-companys-acquisition-and-the-future-of-warehouse-robots/">I spoke to Wise about the deal</a>, late last week. Some excerpts:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we were fundraising for our Series D, this opportunity came out of that. I think when you look at it, over the last couple of years, we’ve had a good relationship with them. With the pandemic, there’s been a huge draw for more and more automation technology. Before the pandemic, there were already labor shortages for warehouse and logistics, and the pandemic only exacerbated it. One of the other great things about us joining Zebra is they have a strong go-to-market engine, and they can amplify our sales capability. They’re already in all of the customers we want to be working with. It helps us reach a much broader, wider and deeper audience.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I think it’s complicated. When I started the company, I never really planned on anything. I just wanted to go build something. I mean that in the most sincere way. I wanted to go build something and not fail. And the question is, what does not failing look like? I think the facts are that in the last 20-something years, almost no robotics company has IPO’ed. Now we’re starting to see SPACS, but there hasn’t been a robotics company that’s IPO’ed through the traditional route.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In terms of vision of how we’re thinking about it, Zebra is very excited to kind of make Fetch the centerpiece of this whole new offering that they’re building out. It’s a high strategic priority for them.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the whole, this week marked a pretty substantial slow down in terms of funding announcements. We did get one big bummer news item, as Abundant Robotics is shutting down. <a href="https://www.goodfruit.com/abundant-robotics-closes-shop/">Good Fruit Grower</a> got the following statement from CEO Dan Steere,</p>
<blockquote><p>After a series of promising commercial trials with prototype apple harvesters, the company was unable to raise enough investment funding to continue development and launch a production system.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ve reached out for further comment, but the company’s understandably not champing at the bit to discuss where things went wrong. It’s easier, of course, to celebrate the successes than it is to dissect the failures, the latter happens much more often than we can to admit in this field. Often they arrive early in the process and don’t really warrant a lot of ink.</p>
<p>Abundant’s different. From the outside, the Bay Area company appeared to be on the right track toward becoming a dominant name in robotic fruit harvesting. The company had raised a total of $12 million, including Series A in 2017. Granted, that’s not an insignificant amount of time to go between raises and bringing robotics to production is extraordinarily difficult.</p>
<p>What’s more surprising is that the company couldn’t drum up enough interest to get it across the finish line during the pandemic, when, anecdotally, interest in robotics and automation seems to be heating up. Certainly that applies to farming, which has experienced series labor shortages over the past year. More insight into that soon, I hope.</p>

<p>Sarcos, meanwhile, keeps finding its way into the news cycle.

The company’s exoskeletons get all the love (thanks in no small part to some high profile partnerships), but company also produces non-body mounted robotics. Per the company,</p>
<p>The SenSuit controller enables the Guardian XT robot to mimic the operator’s movements in real-time. It is an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based motion tracker that communicates with the robot and leverages Sarcos’ proprietary force feedback technologies. The company also plans to integrate a VR- or AR-based HMD to provide remote visual and situational awareness to the operator. The Guardian XT robot is equipped with 3-degrees of freedom end effectors that enable dexterous control of trade tools and materials, including hand-held power tools, welding and cutting equipment, inspection and test equipment, parts and components, hazardous materials, and retail inventory goods, amongst others.</p>
<p>The system is capable of lifting and moving up to 200 pounds and will hit the market by the end of next year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, robotic surgery company <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/07/06/2258470/0/en/Integrity-Implants-and-Fusion-Robotics-Merge-to-Form-Accelus.html">Fusion Robotics announced</a> this week announced plans to merge with Adaptive Geometry, another tech company specializing in spinal surgery technology. The two companies will combine to create the perfectly nondescript Accelus (frankly, Fusion is a pretty good name for two combined companies, but maybe that&#8217;s just me).</p>
<p>“Accelus will create opportunities for wide-scale adoption of robotics in spine surgery—both in hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs)—by addressing previous constraints related to cost and efficiency,” Accelus Chris Walsh said in a release. “Both Fusion Robotics and Integrity Implants have built enabling technology platforms that create a force multiplier for spinal care. Our products and culture create accessibility to fit each patient’s anatomy, each surgeon’s preferred approach, and each healthcare facility’s space and budget limitations, embodying our core principle of access without compromise.”</p>
<p>That’s a lot of business talk this week, so here’s a fun video of Boston Dynamics doing fun Boston Dynamics stuff, presumably to welcome their new Hyundai overlords:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Circle is the sort of business that is correct for a SPAC-led debut. It could not go public in a traditional manner in its current state of maturity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/coinbases-direct-listing-alters-the-landscape-for-fintech-and-crypto-startups/">Coinbase&#8217;s direct listing earlier this year</a>, other crypto companies may be looking to go public sooner than later. That appears to be the case with Circle, a Boston-based technology company that provides API-delivered financial services and a stablecoin.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Circle will not direct list or pursue a traditional IPO. Instead, the company is <a href="https://www.circle.com/hubfs/investors/Press-Release-Circle-Concord-July2021.pdf">combining</a> with Concord Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or blank-check company. The transaction values the crypto shop at an enterprise value of $4.5 billion and an equity value of around $5.4 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The offering marks an interesting moment for the crypto market. Unlike Coinbase, which operates a trading platform and generates fees in a manner that is widely understood by public-market investors, Circle&#8217;s offerings are a bit more exotic.</p>
<p>Circle&#8217;s <a href="https://www.circle.com/hubfs/investors/Circle-Investor-Presentation-July2021.pdf">SPAC presentation</a> details a company whose core business deals with a stablecoin &#8212; a crypto asset pegged to an external currency, in this case, the U.S. dollar &#8212; and a set of APIs that provide crypto-powered financial services to other companies. It <a href="https://www.seedinvest.com/blog/seedinvest/seedinvest-officially-closes-its-sale-to-circle">also owns SeedInvest</a>, an equity crowdfunding platform, though Circle appears to generate the bulk of its anticipated revenues from its other businesses.</p>
<p>For more on the deal itself, TechCrunch&#8217;s Romain Dillet has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/cryptocurrency-company-circle-to-go-public-in-spac-deal/">a piece focused on the transaction</a>. Here, we&#8217;ll dig into the company&#8217;s investor presentation, talk about its business model, and riff on its historical and anticipated results and valuation multiples.</p>
<p>In short, we get to have a little fun. Let&#8217;s begin.</p>
<h2>How Circle&#8217;s business works</h2>
<p>As noted above, Circle has three main business operations. Here&#8217;s how it describes them in its deck:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175000" style="width: 732px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175000" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2175000 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-8.20.21-AM.png" alt="" width="722" height="234" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-8.20.21-AM.png 722w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-8.20.21-AM.png?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-8.20.21-AM.png?resize=300,97 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-8.20.21-AM.png?resize=680,220 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-8.20.21-AM.png?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175000" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Circle investor presentation</p></div></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider each one, starting with USDC.</p>
<p>Stablecoins have become popular in recent quarters. Because they are pegged to an external currency, they operate as an interesting form of cash inside the crypto world. If you want to have on-chain buying power, but don&#8217;t want to have all your value stored in more volatile, and tax-inducing, cryptos that you might have to sell to buy anything else, stablecoins can operate as a more stable sort of liquid currency. They can combine the stability of the U.S. dollar, say, and the crypto world&#8217;s interesting financial web.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies look for ways to respond to incidents in their complex micro services-driven software stacks, SREs or site reliability engineers are left to deal with the issues involved in making everything work and keeping the application up and running. <a href="https://rootly.io/">Rootly</a>, a new early stage startup wants to help by building an incident response solution inside of Slack.</p>
<p>Today the company emerged from stealth with a $3.2 million seed investment. XYZ Venture Capital led the round with participation from 8VC, Y Combinator and several individual tech executives.</p>
<p>Rootly co-founder and CEO Quentin Rousseau says that he cut his SRE teeth working at Instacart. When he joined in 2015, the company was processing hundreds of order a day, and when he left in 2018 it was processing thousands. It was his job to make sure the app was up and running for shoppers, consumers and stores even as it scaled.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said that while he was at Instacart, he learned to see patterns in the way people responded to an issue and he had begun working on a side project after he left looking to bring the incident response process under control inside of Slack. He connected with co-founder JJ Tang, who had started at Instacart after Rousseau left in 2018, and the two of them decided to start Rootly to help solve these unique problems that SREs face around incident response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically we want people to manage and resolve incidents directly in Slack. We don&#8217;t want to add another layer of complexity on top of that. We feel like there are already so many tools out there and when things are chaotic and things are on fire, you really want to focus quickly on the resolution part of it. So we&#8217;re really trying to be focused on the Slack experience,&#8221; Rousseau explained.</p>
<p>The Rootly solution helps SREs connect quickly to their various tools inside Slack, whether that&#8217;s Jira or Zendesk or DataDog or PagerDuty, and it compiles an incident report in the background based on the conversation that&#8217;s happening inside of Slack around resolving the incident. That will help when the team meets for an incident post-mortem after the issue is resolved.</p>

<p>The company is small at the moment with fewer than 10 employees, but it plans to hire some engineers and sales people over the next year as they put this capital to work.</p>
<p>Tang says that they have built diversity as a core component of the company culture, and it helps that they are working with investor Ross Fubini, managing partner at lead investor XYZ Venture Capital. &#8220;That&#8217;s also one of the reasons why we picked Ross as our lead investor. [His firm] has probably one of the deepest focuses around [diversity], not only as a fund, but also how they influence their portfolio companies,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Fubini says there are two main focuses in building diverse companies including building a system to look for diverse pools of talent, and then building an environment to help people from under-represented groups feel welcome once they are hired.<br />
&#8220;One of our early conversations we had with Rootly was how do we both bring a diverse group in and benefit from a diverse set of people, and what&#8217;s going to both attract them, and when they come in make them feel like this is a place that they belong,&#8221; Fubini explained.</p>
<p>The company is fully remote right now with Rousseau in San Francisco and Tang in Toronto, and the plan is to remain remote whenever offices can fully reopen. It&#8217;s worth noting that Rousseau and Tang are members of the current Y Combinator batch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are excruciatingly high stakes for software today. Trillions of dollars of market cap, billions of consumers, hundreds of billions of revenue, and limitless hours of usage are dependent on software working in real time, all the time, without downtime.</p>
<p>As the sophistication of software delivery has increased, every layer of the tech stack has been rewritten — an accelerated evolution has led to a bevy of multibillion-dollar, up-and-coming unicorns and multiple massive public market debuts.</p>
<p>However, today we’re talking about one of the most integral pillars holding up the internet. The Domain Name System, otherwise known as DNS, is the key addressing system that connects browsers, users, devices and servers together. Type in “www.techcrunch.com” in your browser, and DNS finds the address linked to that name and tells routers and switches across the world which server to connect to and how to send data back to you.</p>
<p>Unlike physical postal addresses, innovation around DNS addressing has flourished in recent years. Traffic management, performance scaling, and cost shaping have turned DNS from a basic directory into a vital layer for guaranteeing the reliability of all software in use on the internet today while protecting the bottom line.</p>
<p>Few companies have parlayed internet infrastructure experience into a world-class engineering company quite like <b>NS1</b>. The New York City-based startup has raised more than $100 million as it builds a strategic node at the core of the modern web delivery tech stack. Customers are flocking: 760 at latest count (up from 600 a year ago), with year-over-year bookings growth well into the triple digits.</p>
<p>How did the company take a slumbering and dreary yet reliable aspect of the internet and turn it into a strategic moat and an enterprise win? And what lessons can we learn about the future of the enterprise infrastructure layer from one of its leading lights? That’s what we’re here to find out.</p>
<p>The lead writer of this EC-1 is <b>Sean Michael Kerner</b>. Kerner has been covering the IT and enterprise infrastructure market for more than a decade as a tech journalist (or, <a href="https://twitter.com/TechJournalist">@TechJournalist</a> as he is known on Twitter). Perhaps most importantly, he’s also partially fluent in Klingon, which has no bearing on this EC-1, but is one of those cool facts we wanted to include anyway. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b>, and illustrations were drawn by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>NS1 had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Kerner has no financial ties to NS1 or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The NS1 EC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 10,300 words and a reading time of 41 minutes. Here’s what we’ll be (DNS) addressing:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Part 1: Origin story</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/">1 napkin and 22 lines of code, or how NS1 rewrote the rules of internet infrastructure</a>” (2,700 words/11 minutes) — Sets the context for NS1’s business and provides a brief explanation of why DNS (the technology at the core of the NS1 service) matters.</li>
<li><b>Part 2: Product development and roadmap</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-product/">WTF is NS1? It’s DNS, DDI, and maybe other TLAs</a>” (2,700 words/11 minutes) — Analyzes NS1&#8217;s products, vision and open-source efforts through NS1 Labs.</li>
<li><b>Part 3: Competitive landscape</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-competition/">The fight for the future of DNS is white hot</a>” (2,300 words/9 minutes) — Evaluates how NS1 competes in a space littered with well-funded Big Tech companies and well-established mature companies.</li>
<li><b>Part 4: Customer development</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-customers/">Outages, pandemics and the reengineering of traffic on the internet</a>” (2,600 words/10 minutes) — Explores how companies like Roblox and Pinterest have had to reshape their networking infrastructure in light of massive growth and increasing demands for resilience from users.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re always iterating on the EC-1 format. If you have questions, comments or ideas, please send an email to TechCrunch Managing Editor Danny Crichton at <a href="mailto:danny@techcrunch.com">danny@techcrunch.com</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s the most important primary layer in the modern tech stack for internet software, and its most intriguing evolution was written on a napkin in a New York City bar and translated to just shy of two dozen lines of Python code.</p>
<p>Such is the nature of tech innovation today, and such was the birth of NS1. Kris Beevers, along with Jonathan Sullivan and Alex Vayl, wanted to rebuild the core addressing system of the internet — the Domain Name System, or DNS — and transform it from a cost center into a critical tool for software reliability and cost savings. It was a smart idea back in 2012 and gained much steam a few years later when a fortuitous outage at a competitor left hundreds of websites stranded.</p>

<p>NS1 may make the networks of the internet more reliable. But the story of the company is also built on the back of a durable social network of engineers who met at a little-known NYC startup named Voxel. That startup would go on to become, unintentionally, an incubator for several massive enterprise companies and exits.</p>
<p>Chance encounters, bold engineering and lucky breaks: It’s the quintessential startup tale, and it’s changing the face of software delivery.</p>
<h2>“You learn a lot because you&#8217;re doing way more than you rightfully should.&#8221;</h2>
<p>NS1’s story begins back at the turn of the millennium, when Beevers was an undergrad at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in upstate New York and found himself employed at a small file-sharing startup called Aimster with some friends from RPI. Aimster was his first taste of life at an internet startup in the heady days of the dot-com boom and bust, and also where he met an enterprising young engineer by the name of Raj Dutt, who would become a key relationship over the next two decades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;We are not a DNS company, despite the name, and despite everything we&#8217;re talking about,&#8221; NS1 founder and CEO Kris Beevers says.</p>
<p>That might sound counter-intuitive, given that the company’s flagship product offering is literally called Managed DNS. The issue and the challenge NS1 actually solves today goes much deeper, and by positioning itself as being about more than DNS, the company helps to differentiate itself against what is, by any measure, a very commoditized technology.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

<p>NS1 looks at DNS differently from the competition: It doesn’t consider it as just a conduit to connect traffic; instead, DNS is treated as a routing system that can direct traffic very effectively.</p>
<p>Across its product portfolio, NS1 leverages data and injects software-defined intelligence, automation and real-time decisioning policy to steer and optimize traffic at the DNS layer, Beevers says. It does all this by a core technology known as the filter chain, and it is foundational to NS1’s current success.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/">In the first part of this EC-1</a>, I spoke about how Beevers wrote 22 lines of code to sketch out that filter chain technology, bringing NS1 to life. I will now look at how the company has expanded beyond DNS into what’s known as DDI, a key technology stack for managing internal networks within companies. We’ll also talk about NS1’s open-source efforts, and why experimentation remains a bedrock principle of the company’s engineering culture.</p>
<h2>Managing external traffic: DNS and active traffic management</h2>
<p>&#8220;Something that I will say very often to our team and to our customers in the market is, we&#8217;re not here to make DNS better; we&#8217;re not here to make DDI better, which is another realm that we play in now,&#8221; Beevers said. &#8220;We&#8217;re here to turn those technologies into leverage to solve much bigger problems that equate to connecting applications with an audience more effectively, at better scale, driving better performance and experiences with security and reliability.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since its inception, one of the toughest challenges NS1 has faced is the simple fact that DNS is a mature market category with venerable and well-established incumbents. When Kris Beevers and his two co-founders started the company, quite literally every company and internet user already had some form of DNS technology in place. It’s a decades-old technology after all.</p>
<p>Beevers and everyone associated with the company is keen to point out time and again that NS1 isn&#8217;t a DNS vendor, but rather a suite of products offering application and traffic delivery, performance and reliability. NS1 in its early days had to constantly preach that message and educate its potential customers on how its offering provided something different than the incumbents with years of performance history.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Because DNS mostly “just works,” some organizations don&#8217;t put a serious amount of thought behind it, assuming that all of the services and capabilities out there are roughly equivalent.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In the first two parts of the EC-1, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/">we looked at the origins of the company</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-product/">its core product offerings in DNS and DDI</a>. In this section, it&#8217;s time to look at the broader market and the competition facing NS1 and what that portends for the future of the company.</p>
<h2>Everyone owns a product they don’t fully understand</h2>
<p>Hosting providers typically offer basic DNS services that “just work” out of the box, creating a large challenge for any vendor in the managed DNS space. Eric Hanselman, principal research analyst with S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said that among some organizations, there is an expectation that DNS is just part of what happens on the internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the largest misconception that I find about DNS in general, is the lack of understanding of how critical it is to the performance and the customer experience of just about everything that organizations do today that is technology related,&#8221; Hanselman said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sales in enterprise infrastructure is all about meeting a customer’s requirements. But what happens if customers don’t even realize they need a startup’s product in the first place?</p>
<p>In the first three parts of this EC-1, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/">we looked at the origins of NS1</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-product/">how the company built its DNS and DDI services</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-competition/">how it competes in a hypercompetitive market</a>. This fourth and final part is where the &#8220;rubber meets the road&#8221; — the actual customers. Without customers, there is no money, there is no growth and there is no NS1.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			NS1 kicked off with the idea that DNS could be used for more than it was previously. The company&#8217;s technology has continued to evolve since its initial inception and now uses DNS as a leverage point to help organizations like Pinterest, Roblox and hundreds of others improve application delivery.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As we saw, the challenge for NS1 is that most customers are relatively content with their existing DNS service. It’s a space that has many offerings from legacy as well as public cloud providers, and for most customers, there’s never an urgent force pushing them to upend the fundamentals of their network.</p>
<p>NS1 has had a couple of lucky breaks. The first, as we will see with Pinterest and Roblox, was a major outage of one of the company’s largest competitors, DynDNS, back in October 2016. That failure brought NS1 immediate attention from network architects, turning a relatively staid layer of infrastructure into a critical area for re-architecting.</p>
<p>Beyond that outage, NS1 has been able to educate its customers on why a more flexible base for DNS is important for performance. We interviewed Roblox extensively to understand how the children’s gaming platform has engineered its systems in light of its feverish growth amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Finally, we will look at how NS1 continues to expand its product lineup, and what the future holds for the company. NS1 now serves more than <a href="https://ns1.com/customers">760 customers</a>, including many of the world’s most trafficked applications, such as LinkedIn, Dropbox, JetBlue, Fox and The Guardian. It has become a major infrastructure leader, and an “unusual outcome” likely awaits.</p>
<h2>One outage to topple them all</h2>
<p>There are a lot of different reasons why any enterprise or organization would choose to buy services from NS1.</p>
<p>Every business and internet user on the planet already has access to DNS in one form or another. NS1 doesn&#8217;t sell merely DNS services, as the company repeated time and again in every interview and briefing, but instead sells network resilience and performance. Sure, DNS &#8220;just works&#8221; in many cases, but &#8220;good enough&#8221; isn&#8217;t good enough when microseconds count and users demand and expect to always be connected at the best possible speed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.lula.is/">Lula</a>, a Miami-based insurance infrastructure startup, announced today it has raised $18 million in a Series A round of funding.</p>
<p>Founders Fund and Khosla Ventures co-led the round, which also included participation from SoftBank, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, Shrug Capital, Steve Pagliuca (Bain Capital co-chairman and Boston Celtics owner), Tiny Capital&#8217;s Andrew Wilkinson. Existing backers such as Nextview Ventures and Florida Funders also put money in the round, in addition to a number of insurance and logistics groups such as Flexport.</p>
<p>The startup’s self-proclaimed mission is to provide companies of all sizes &#8212; from startups to multinational corporations &#8212; with insurance infrastructure. Think of it as a “Stripe for insurance,” its founders say.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by 25-year-old twin brothers and Miami natives Michael and Matthew Vega-Sanz, Lula actually emerged from another business the pair had started while in college.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t afford to have a car on campus and wanted pizza one night,” Michael recalls. “So I thought it would be cool if there was an app that let me rent a car from another student, and then I thought &#8216;Why don’t we build it?’ We then built the ugliest app you’ve ever seen but it allowed us to rent cars from other people on the campus.” It was the first company to allow 18-year-olds to rent cars without restrictions, the brother say.</p>
<p>By September 2018, they formally launched the app beyond the campus of Babson College, which they were attending on scholarships. Within eight days of launching, the brothers say, the app became one of the top apps on Apple’s App Store. The pair dropped out of college, and within 12 months, they had cars available on more than 500 college campuses in the United States.</p>
<p>“As you can imagine we needed to make sure there was insurance coverage on each rental. We pitched it to 47 insurance companies and they all rejected us,” Michael said. “So we developed our own underwriting methodologies or underwriting tools into the operations and had the lowest incident rate in the industry.”</p>
<p>As the company grew, it began partnering with car rental providers (think smaller players, not Enterprise, et al.) to supplement its supply of vehicles. In doing so, the brothers soon realized that the most compelling aspect of their offering was the insurance infrastructure they’d built into it.</p>
<p>“Our rental companies begin to put a significant portion of their business through our platform, and one day one called us and asked if they could start using the software in the insurance infrastructure we’d built out in the rest of our business.”</p>
<p>That was in early 2020, right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.</p>
<p>“At that moment, we began to realize, ‘Hey maybe the big opportunity here is not a car-sharing app for college students, but maybe the big opportunity here is something with insurance,’” Michael said.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, the duo shut down their core business and by April 2020, they pivoted to building out Lula as it exists today.</p>
<p>“In the same way that Stripe has built a payment API that eliminates the need for companies to build their own payment infrastructure, we decided we could build an insurance API that eliminates the need for companies to build their own insurance infrastructure,” Matthew said. “Companies would no longer need to build out internal insurance systems or tools. No longer would they need to deal with insurance brokers to procure them coverage. No longer would they need to deal with insurance teams. We can integrate on to a platform and handle all things insurance for companies and their customers via our API.”</p>
<p>By August of 2020, the company launched an MVP (minimum viable product) and since then has been growing about 30% month over month after reaching profitability in its first four months.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174730" style="width: 387px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174730" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2174730 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lula.jpg?w=497" alt="" width="377" height="516" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lula.jpg 780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lula.jpg?resize=110,150 110w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lula.jpg?resize=219,300 219w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lula.jpg?resize=768,1052 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lula.jpg?resize=497,680 497w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lula.jpg?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174730" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lula</p></div></p>
<p>Today, Lula offers a “fully integrated suite” of technology-enabled tools such as customer vetting, fraud detection, driver history checks, and policy management and claims handling through its insurance partners. It has a waiting list of nearly 2,000 companies and raised its funding to fulfill that demand.</p>
<p>“The main purpose for raising capital was so we can build out the team necessary to fulfill demand and sustain growth moving forward,” Matthew said. “And apart from that, we also just want to further develop the technology &#8212; whether it be in the ways that we&#8217;re collecting data so we can get more granular and make smarter decisions or just optimizing our vetting system. We’re also just working toward developing a much more robust API.”</p>
<p>Existing clients include ReadyDrive, a car-sharing program for the U.S. military and a “ton of SMBs,” the brothers say. Investor Flexport will be conducting a pilot with the company.</p>
<p>“Every time a trucker picks up a load or delivery, instead of paying monthly policies, they will be able to pay for insurance for the two to three days they are on the road only,” Michael says. “Also, if someone is shipping a container via Flexport, they can add cargo coverage at the point of sale and get an additional layer of protection.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, Lula’s goal is to act as a carrier in some capacity.</p>
<p>Founders Fund&#8217;s Delian Asparouhov believes that the way millenials and Gen Zers utilize physical assets is &#8220;wildly different&#8221; than prior generations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We grew up in a shared economy world, where apps like Uber, GetAround, Airbnb have allowed us to episodically utilize assets rather than purchase them outright,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div>In his view, though, the insurance industry has not picked up on the massive shift.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Typical insurance agents both don&#8217;t know how to underwrite episodic usage of assets, and they don&#8217;t know how to integrate into these typical of digital rental platforms and allow for instantaneous underwriting,&#8221; Asparouhov told TechCrunch. &#8220;Lulu is combining both of these technologies into an incredibly unique approach that digitizes insurance and gives us flashbacks to how Stripe disrupted the digitization of payments.&#8221;</div>
<p>Despite their recent success, the brothers emphasize that the journey to get to this point was not always a glamorous one. Born to Puerto Rican and Cuban parents, they grew up on a small south Florida farm.</p>
<p>“We started our company out of our dorm room and initially emailed 532 investors only to get one response,” Michael said. “Founders just see the headlines but I just want to advise them to stay persistent and really keep at it. I’m not afraid to share that the company started off slow.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://z1.app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Z1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Sao Paulo-based digital bank aimed at Latin American GenZers, has raised $2.5 million in a round led by U.S.-based Homebrew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of other investors also participated in the financing including Clocktower Ventures, Mantis – the VC firm owned by The Chainsmokers, Goodwater, Gaingels, Soma Capital and Rebel Fund. Notably, Mantis has also backed </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/teen-banking-service-step-raises-100m-series-c-announces-steph-currys-investment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a teen-focused fintech based in the U.S., and Goodwater has also invested in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/kids-focused-fintech-greenlight-raises-260m-in-a16z-led-series-d-nearly-doubles-valuation-to-2-3b/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenlight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which too has a similar offering as Z1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Z1 participated in Y Combinator’s Winter ‘21 batch earlier this year, and at the time got $125,000 in funding from the accelerator. Maya Capital led its $700,000 seed round in March of 2020.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Z1 is a digital bank app built for teenagers and young adults. The company was founded on the notion that by using its app and linked prepaid card, Brazilian and Latin American teenagers can become more financially independent.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaopedrothompson/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">João Pedro Thompson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thiago-waddington-achatz-3280a297/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thiago Achatz</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">started the company in late 2019 and soon after,  </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccraveiro/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mateus Craveiro</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophie-secaf-b647b891/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophie Secaf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joined as co-founders. In its early days, Z1 is focused on Brazil but the startup has plans to expand into other countries in Latin America over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Z1 is what we’re building to be the go to bank of the next generation, and not just be a digital bank for teens,” Achatz told TechCrunch. “We want to grow with him and one day, be the biggest bank in Brazil and LatAm.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson agrees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re acquiring users really early and creating brand loyalty with the intention of being their bank for life,” he said. “We will still meet their needs as they grow into adulthood.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174907" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174907" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2174907 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg" alt="" width="661" height="717" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg 940w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg?resize=138,150 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg?resize=277,300 277w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg?resize=768,833 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg?resize=627,680 627w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174907" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Z1</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Z1’s offering is not completely unlike that of Greenlight here in the U.S. the founders agree that its products have been adapted more to the Brazil-specific cultural and market situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, points out Thompson, most teenagers in Brazil use cash because they don’t have access to other financial services, whether they be traditional or digital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We offer an account where they can deposit money, cash out money via an instant payment system in Brazil or spend through a prepaid credit card,” he said. “Most sites don’t accept debit cards so this is a big step compared to what teens already have.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the company’s use for the capital is to make its product more robust so they can do things like save money for big purchases such as an iPhone and earn interest on their accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another big difference between Brazil and the U.S., the company believes, is that many parents in general in Latin America haven’t had a true financial education that they can pass down to their kids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not top down like Greenlight,” Achatz said. “That approach doesn’t make sense in Latin America. Here, many are independent from an early age and already work whether it’s through a microbusiness, a side job or selling things on Instagram. They’re much more self-taught and the income they earn is often outside of their parents.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Z1 has grown 30% per week and 200% per month since launch, spending “very little” on marketing and relying mostly on word-of-mouth. For example, the company is following the lead of its U.S. counterparts and turning to TikTok to spread the word about its offering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Step has around 200,000 followers on TikTok, and we have a little under half of that,” the company says. “We’re well-positioned in terms of branding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For lead investor Homebrew, the opportunity to educate and provide financial services to Gen Z in Latin America is even more exciting than the opportunity in the US., notes partner Satya Patel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over one third of LatAm Gen Z’ers have a “side hustle,” generating their own income independent from their parents, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While millennials grew up during an economic boom, Gen Z grew up during recessions – 3 in Brazil over the last decade – and wants to become financially independent as soon as possible. They&#8217;re becoming economically educated and active much earlier than previous generations,” Patel added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also believes the desire to transact online, for gaming and entertainment in particular, creates a groundswell of GenZ demand in Brazil for credit card and digital payments products.</span></p>

<p>One month after<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/South-Korea-s-Coupang-launches-trial-operation-in-Japan"> entering Japan</a>, its first international market, <a href="https://www.coupang.com/">Coupang</a> has launched in Taiwan. The South Korean e-commerce giant began offering its service in Taipei City’s Zhongshan neighborhood, allowing people there to order items through its app for on-demand delivery between 8AM to 11PM, charging a delivery fee of 19 NTD (about 68 cents USD).</p>
<p>Coupang is testing its service and will assess different models for its delivery infrastructure in Taiwan. The selection of items is similar to what’s available in Japan&#8211;customers can buy food, beverages, daily necessities and pet supplies. In Taipei, Coupang’s most direct competition is currently Uber Eats and Foodpanda, which deliver from some retailers, including drugstores, as well as restaurants. A key difference is that Coupang is currently fulfilling orders directly, instead of sending couriers to stores or restaurants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As it expands into more product categories, it will also compete with e-commerce platforms like Momo and PChome, which both offer 24-hour deliveries. In South Korea, Coupang’s e-commerce platform offers millions of products. Its other services include Rocket Fresh for perishable groceries and Coupang Eats for meals.</p>
<p>Coupang <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/coupang-follows-roblox-to-a-strong-first-day-of-trading/">held a successful initial public offering </a>in March on the New York Stock Exchange. Founded in 2010, Coupang has become the e-commerce market leader in South Korea and also developed an international reputation for “out-Amazoning Amazon” with the speed of its deliveries and dollar retention rate (or how often customers return and spend money).</p>

<p>Coupang invested heavily in its own logistics infrastructure when it launched a decade ago, but now also partners with third-party providers in South Korea. It remains to be seen what kind of fulfillment model it will decide on in Japan and Taiwan. The company hasn’t announced what its next market is, but it has <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/korean-e-commerce-firm-coupang-said-to-move-ahead-in-expansion-into-spore">been hiring in Singapore</a> for lead operations, retail and logistics roles.</p>

In other words, Circle will have plenty of capital on its hands if the merger goes through.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Created in 2013, the company originally wanted to create <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/31/circle-raises-9m-series-a-from-accel-and-general-catalyst-to-make-bitcoins-mainstream/">a mainstream bitcoin payment platform</a>. But the company later pivoted to create a social payments app. Circle became a sort of Venmo clone with some blockchain technology under the hood. At some point, Circle even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/07/circle-removes-ability-to-buy-and-sell-bitcoin-as-it-doubles-down-on-mobile-payments/">removed</a> the ability to send and receive bitcoins.</p>
<p>“We never thought of ourselves as a bitcoin startup. The media certainly classified us that way because we were involved with the technology. From the day we founded the company three years ago we’ve focused on trying to build a new consumer finance company. And one that makes money work the way the Internet works,” Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire told TechCrunch’s Natasha Lomas <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/05/social-payments-startup-circle-expands-to-europe/">in 2016</a>.</p>
<p>While that consumer play didn’t take off, it&#8217;s interesting to see that Allaire was already thinking about being able to programmatically move money. In 2017 and 2018, the company pivoted once again to focus on cryptocurrencies. It launched an over-the-counter trading desk for big cryptocurrency investors.</p>
<p>It acquired Poloniex, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S. at the time. It also launched Circle Invest, a really simple mobile app that let you buy and sell a handful of crypto assets.</p>
<p>But Circle’s most promising product has been its stablecoin — USD Coin, or USDC for short. As the name suggests, 1 USDC is always worth 1 USD. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, you can be sure that the value of USDC isn’t going to fluctuate like crazy. Auditing firms regularly check that issuers always keep as many USD in bank accounts as USDC in circulation.</p>
<p>With USDC, moving money from one wallet to another becomes as easy as using standard API calls. The company has then added various infrastructure products around USDC, such as Circle Accounts. Circle has also built ramps to bridge the gap between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>There are currently $25 billion USDC in circulation and the company believes there will $190 billion USDC in circulation by the end of 2023. And Circle plans to leverage the popularity of USDC to build financial services that take advantage of USDC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has been a time for a lot of reflection on both a personal and business level. Tech companies in particular are assessing whether they will ever again return to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/tech-companies-are-looking-at-more-flexible-work-models-when-offices-reopen/">a full time, in-office approach</a>. Some are considering a hybrid approach and some may not go back to a building at all. Amidst all this, <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> has decided to reimagine the office with a new concept they are introducing this week called Dropbox Studios.</p>
<p>Dropbox CEO and co-founder Drew Houston sees the pandemic as a forcing event, one that pushes companies to rethink work through a distributed lens. He doesn&#8217;t think that many businesses will simply go back to the old way of working. As a result, he wanted his company to rethink the office design with one that did away with cube farms with workers spread across a landscape of cubicles. Instead, he wants to create a new approach that takes into account that people don&#8217;t necessarily need a permanent space in the building.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re soft launching or opening our Dropbox Studios [this] week in the U.S., including the one in San Francisco. And we took the opportunity as part of our focus to reimagine the office into a collaborative space that we call a studio,&#8221; Houston told me.</p>
<p>Houston says that the company really wanted to think about how to incorporate the best of working at home with the best of working at the office collaborating with colleagues. &#8220;We focused on having really great curated in-person experiences, some of which we coordinate at the company level and then some of which you can go into our studios, which have been refitted to support more collaboration,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175029" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175029" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2175029" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DBX-SF-Studio_little-r1.jpg?w=680" alt="Dropbox Studio coffee shop" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DBX-SF-Studio_little-r1.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DBX-SF-Studio_little-r1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DBX-SF-Studio_little-r1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DBX-SF-Studio_little-r1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DBX-SF-Studio_little-r1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DBX-SF-Studio_little-r1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DBX-SF-Studio_little-r1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175029" class="wp-caption-text">Dropbox Studio coffee shop <strong>Image Credit: Dropbox</strong></p></div></p>
<p>To that end, they have created a lot of soft spaces with a coffee shop to create a casual feel, conference rooms for teams to have what Houston called &#8220;on-site off-sites&#8221; and classrooms for organized group learning. The idea is to create purpose-built spaces for what would work best in an office environment and what people have been missing from in-person interactions since they were forced to work at home by the pandemic, while letting people accomplish more individual work at home.</p>

<p>The company is planning on dedicated studios in major cities like San Francisco, Seattle, Tokyo and Tel Aviv with smaller on demand spaces operated by partners like WeWork in other locations.</p>

<p>As Houston said when he appeared <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/dropbox-ceo-drew-houston-says-the-pandemic-forced-the-company-to-reevaluate-the-product-roadmap/">at TechCrunch Disrupt last year</a>, his company sees this as an opportunity to be on the forefront of distributed work and act as an example and a guide to help other companies as they undertake similar journeys.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you think more broadly about the effects of the shift to distributed work, it will be felt well beyond when we go back to the office. So we’ve gone through a one-way door. This is maybe one of the biggest changes to knowledge work since that term was invented in 1959,&#8221; Houston said last year.</p>
<p>He recognizes that they have to evaluate how this is going to work and iterate on the design as needed, just as the company iterates on its products and they will be evaluating the new spaces and the impact on collaborative work and making adjustments when needed. To help others, Dropbox is releasing an open source project plan called the <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/collections/virtual-first-toolkit">Virtual First Toolkit</a>.</p>
<p>The company is going all in with this approach and will be subletting much of its existing office space as it moves to this new way of working and its space requirements change dramatically. It&#8217;s a bold step, but one that Houston believes his company is uniquely positioned to undertake, and he wants Dropbox to be an example to others on how to reinvent the way we work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Legacy TV services like HSN and QVC may have put live shopping shows on the map for consumers, but livestream commerce got a completely new boost of life in the pandemic, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retailers</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/amazon-influencer-program-opens-to-livestreamers-for-broadcasting-to-amazon-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e-commerce leviathans</a> tapping a perfect storm of the craze for video entertainment, a trend (or even municipal rules in some cases) for people to stay away from physical stores, and a surge of e-commerce activity to bring more buying &#8220;shows&#8221; online.</p>
<p>Now, a startup and app called <a href="https://popshop.live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popshop Live</a>, which has approached this concept with a new twist &#8212; a standalone business that taps into the millennial taste for shopping from smaller and more edgy brands and individuals as much as bigger retailers &#8212; is today announcing some funding as it finds a lot of traction with sellers, shoppers and the media world at large.</p>
<p>The startup has closed a Series A of around $20 million (the startup is not disclosing the exact amount but a source very close to the deal confirmed this figure), at a valuation of about $100 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round is being led by Benchmark, with participation also from TQ Ventures (Andrew Marks, Schuster Tanger, and Scooter Braun&#8217;s firm), Mantis VC (The Chainsmokers&#8217; VC vehicle), Access Industries and SV Angel as well previous backers Floodgate, Abstract Ventures and Long Journey Ventures who were in Popshop&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/popshop-live-gets-3-million-to-bring-live-streaming-to-shopping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seed round in July 2020</a>. Individual investors in this latest Series A include Sophia Amoruso, Baron Davis, Jim Lanzone, Kevin Mayer, Vivi Nevo, Michael Ovitz, Hailey Bieber and Kendall Jenner. Yep&#8230; sounds like Popshop has popped, at least with the high-profile set.</p>
<p>But wait&#8230; there&#8217;s more!&#8230; as the late night shopping advertorials love to say. The funding is coming on the heels of the company pulling in some impressive numbers on the back of its livestreaming format. Sellers on Popshop Live are seeing gross merchandise value of $500,000 and more, with 80% of customers returning within 30 days to buy more.</p>
<p>Popshop is not disclosing how many sellers are now on its platform, but says that the figure went up by 500% in the last three months. They include names like 3D Retro, JapanLA, Earthing.VIP, Kettle &amp; Fire and Mall of America, as well as others you may not know but might love the names anyway: they include &#8220;Giant Robot&#8221; and &#8220;EmoWeasel&#8221;. (Now who <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> want to buy an old Def Leppard t-shirt from Giant Robot?)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175050" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175050" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2175050" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dan-Dan-Li.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dan-Dan-Li.jpeg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dan-Dan-Li.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dan-Dan-Li.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dan-Dan-Li.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dan-Dan-Li.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dan-Dan-Li.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175050" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://popshop.live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popshop Live <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Founded by Danielle Li, who goes by Dan Dan (pictured, right), Popshop lives in the same segment of e-commerce as <a href="https://depop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Depop</a>, the London-based peer-to-peer shopping platform that recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/etsy-is-acquiring-social-selling-site-depop-for-1-625b-in-a-mostly-cash-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got acquired by Etsy for $1.625 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Like Depop, the ethos of Popshop (funny that the two rhyme with each other) is based around a mix of interesting items, sold by equally interesting people, with some socialzing thrown in for good measure by way of a stream of chat that runs alongside the selling videos, and of course an algorithmic feed that lets you watch show, after show, after show, as you swipe into the night.</p>
<p>The effect is somewhere between diverting entertainment and practical platform for purchasing, and I&#8217;m going to be honest, you could imagine it living very well as a feature on an app like Snapchat or Instagram. (I&#8217;m guessing that these sites will also try to build something like this, if not try to buy Popshop outright.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting turn, given how one doesn&#8217;t think of channels like HSN and QVC as anything other than uncool, the domain of the middle-aged middle-class everyman, not&#8230; Kendall Jenner.</p>
<p>But the idea of more dynamic, streamed sales targeting a much younger demographic has precedent of course: there is YouTube and is massive culture of influencers using the platform to plug brands and products; and Twitch following swiftly behind with its livestreamed, often-janky but very fun productions crafted by the individuals starring in them. And of course, Amazon has long been trying to tap into that (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/23/amazon-home-shopping-evine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for years, we suspect</a>), most recently incorporating a way for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/amazon-influencer-program-opens-to-livestreamers-for-broadcasting-to-amazon-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influencers</a> to use its <a href="https://advertising.amazon.com/en-gb/solutions/products/amazon-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Live</a> platform, as its own streamed selling show format is called, to sell wares to people.</p>
<p>And there is China &#8212; which, with its hugely popular apps TikTok and Wechat (whose features get shamelessly copied by Western counterparts), has clearly become the newest pacemaker for where things are going in the world of apps, and consumer tastes.</p>
<p>The idea with Popshop is that it&#8217;s found an audience for this particular genre among younger users in the West, and that it is showing signs of  staying power that will transcend our current &#8220;new normal&#8221; as everyone loves to call it.</p>
<p>“Livestream commerce is not just a trend in China and through the pandemic, it is an emerging multi-billion-dollar phenomenon whose growth is accelerating every day,” said Benchmark&#8217;s Matt Cohler (who is a board member now of the startup). ““Dan Dan has created something fundamentally new, unbounded, and powerful. Her tenacity and commitment to her vision of creating a marketplace for culture is singular.”</p>
<p>And to be clear, it&#8217;s not just working with quirky retailers and individuals but the more traditional stores and environments that used to welcome younger shoppers but haven&#8217;t been able to.</p>
<p>“Popshop Live was a valuable alternative shopping platform as traditional in-person retail halted during the pandemic,” added Jill Renslow, EVP of business development and Marketing at Mall of America. “Even as the world continues to open up and we welcome shoppers back to Mall of America, we plan to continue live steam shopping to reach new customers in a unique way.”</p>
<p>Popshop said that the funding in part will be used to triple its team, which currently numbers 30. And it&#8217;s kicking that off with some interesting hires. Jason Droege, who founded and ran Uber Eats, is joining to head growth strategy; and Bangaly Kaba, who was previously at Instacart as VP of product and Instagram as head of growth, is coming on to build out Popshop&#8217;s product.</p>
<p>“There are few new products that seem magical the first time you use them,” said Droege in a statement. “Popshop is a totally new take on content and retail and I’m excited to scale it to new sellers and new categories.”</p>
<p>“Bangaly and Jason are forces to be reckoned with and we’re thrilled to welcome them to our team,” added Li. “Their combined expertise, along with that of our new backers, will accelerate the expansion of our platform across geographies, verticals and product features.” I&#8217;ll hopefully talk to Li later and update this with more from her.</p>

Kenya&#8217;s <a href="https://marketforce360.com/">MarketForce</a> wants to digitize a large </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the B2B retail end-to-end distribution platform is announcing the close of its $2 million pre-Series A round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investors who took part in this round include existing ones &#8212; P1 Ventures and Y Combinator, and new ones like Launch Africa, V8 Capital, Future Africa, GreenHouse Capital, Rebel Fund, Remapped Ventures, and some unnamed angel investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MarketForce has raised a total of $2.5 million, which includes its $350,000 seed round last year and $150,000 check from Y Combinator <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/marketforce">as part of the accelerator&#8217;s Summer 2020 batch</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesh Mbaabu and Mesongo Sibuti founded MarketForce in 2018. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders wanted to solve the fragmentation issue they noticed among small retail shops and their distribution networks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these shops are often used as points for offering financial services to the everyday Kenyan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, MarketForce&#8217;s play enables the optimized distribution of FMCG goods and financial services through this network of agents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was this business that got the startup into Y Combinator. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But upon graduation, MarketForce decided to tests its hands on another product &#8212; <a href="https://marketforce360.com/rejareja-on-demand-salesforce.html">RejaReja</a>, a B2B e-commerce marketplace for merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RejaReja </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in December 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform helps informal retail merchants buy and sell FMCGs and digital financial services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With RejaReja, MarketForce joins a growing list of startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/tradedepot-adds-10-million-to-add-financial-services-to-its-supply-chain-services-for-african-smbs/">TradeDepot</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/sokowatch-raises-14m-to-digitize-africas-informal-b2b-supply-chain/">Sokowatch</a> trying to revamp supply-chain markets for Africa’s informal retailers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RejaReja offers next-day delivery for hundreds of SKUs from a handful of FMCG brands. Though the trademark MarketForce retail distribution product is still very much thriving, RejaReja is where the founders think most of the company&#8217;s best opportunities lie</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve run both models </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simultaneously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we&#8217;ve seen much faster traction on the e-commerce side of the marketplace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re investing more and more resources into that, and the pre-Series A round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was raised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to focus on scaling that platform,&#8221; CEO said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, MarketForce acquired <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2021/06/15/kenyas-marketforce-acquires-digiduka-to-consolidate-distribution-of-consumer-goods/">another Kenyan retail platform Digiduka</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform allows informal retailers to resell digital services like airtime, electricity tokens, and bill payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digiduka&#8217;s acquisition saw that it was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> integrated into RejaReja, which now provides a wallet for retailers to act as agents and collect mobile money and bank payments via mobile app, WhatsApp bots or USSD shortcodes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MarketForce&#8217;s RejaReja runs an asset-light model where it doesn&#8217;t own capital assets like warehouses and delivery trucks. Most of the assets are provided by the company&#8217;s partners (distributors, manufacturers, and third-party logistics providers) who lease their assets to fulfil orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">K</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">iosks using RejaReja have access to various SKUs through an app and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can place orders on it. And based on their ordering habits, MarketForce can extend working capital loans to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this round of funding, MarketForce plans to launch RejaReja in Nigeria and scale up the product across more towns in East Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has a presence in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, where over 15,000 retail customers use RejaReja to process thousands of orders daily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, MarketForce&#8217;s trademark SaaS product has garnered over 10,000 monthly active users despite giving RejaReja a year headstart. These users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have performed 300,000 transactions worth more than $500 million since its launch in 2018 MarketForce clients include Pepsi, Safaricom, Fort Beverages, Lami, Platinum Credit, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our clients and partners understand MarketForce’s power to increase sales performance and productivity across markets and industries,” CTO Mesongo said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are building the operating system for retail distribution in Africa, and we have the right combination of technology and team to make our Pan-African vision a reality</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With computer science degrees, the founders said it was a struggle to scale MarketForce initially. And though they lacked experience and expertise in fintech or e-commerce before launching the company, they have compensated for that gap by making good hires</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Retail distribution is a very hardcore business so getting the right talent, the right people who understand the traditional elements in the business but are also willing to innovate and revolutionize the space has also been interesting for us,&#8221; the CEO said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another challenge the company faced in its early years was that it took a while for partners to get on board because they didn&#8217;t understand how MarketForce would operate without owning warehouses and logistics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But over time, as the company generated value to its partners, orders and revenue have started to increase rapidly, with the latter metric </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">recording a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">100% month-on-month growth, according to Mbaabu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;MarketForce has proven that they know how to leverage the entire retail supply chain as a gateway for digital payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their organic, as well as acquisition-driven growth and expansion strategy thus far, has proven that their understanding of unit economics and marginal customer acquisition costs is solid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a pan-African fintech company, they are very well positioned to tap into the $700 billion that gets transacted in this space every year,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” managing partner at Launch Africa, Zachariah George, said in a statement.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five months after announcing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/talkshoplive-seed-funding/">$3 million seed round</a> from <a href="https://spero.vc/">Spero Ventures</a>, shopping-focused live video host <a href="https://talkshop.live/">Talkshoplive</a> is back, this time with a $6 million seed extension led by <a href="https://raine.com/venture/">Raine Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>The new round of funding gives Los Angeles-based Talkshoplive $10.5 million raised to date and enables it to scale its product management and technical teams. In addition, the company will double-down on category verticals.</p>
<p>Talkshoplive CEO Bryan Moore said he founded the company with his sister Tina in 2018, after he led social media efforts at Twentieth Television (previously known as Twentieth Century Fox) and CBS Television.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Following the initial seed round, Moore said he found himself talking to even more investors wanting to get involved with the company. Then San Francisco-based Raine came along.</p>
<p>“We were not looking to fundraise, but when Raine reached out, what they had to offer was so strategic to our business,” Moore said in an interview. “Live commerce is today where social media was 15 years ago. Everyone is asking what their brand’s live commerce strategy is, but we had to figure out how to build it for the U.S.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/embed/#?secret=xYvv88wvyX" data-secret="xYvv88wvyX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Initially, the company was focused on books and music, working with famous names, such as Matthew McConaughey, Alicia Keys and Dolly Parton. Now, the company is looking at food, beauty, fashion, and sports.</p>
<p>“We’ve had just about everyone from the Food Network essentially start using Talkshoplive,” Moore said. “A large community around food has been built on the platform, especially after Giada De Laurentiis showed everyone the inside of her pantry. Now other personalities are being asked to show their pantries.”</p>
<p>Though the company launched its embeddable player in 2019, Moore says adoption of it became strongest over the last quarter, due in part due to new partnerships.</p>
<p>Talkshoplive debuted a new version of its embeddable player three weeks ago with publishers Hearst, with Oprah Daily, as well as Condé Nast’s Bon Appétit magazine and now launching across additional publications. In fact, sales so far this year have surpassed all of the company’s 2020 revenue, growing 85 percent month over month, he said.</p>
<p>The global pandemic put a spotlight on live commerce platforms, especially those catering to sports cards and other collectible enthusiasts. Seeing new funding recently were sports trading card platform <a href="https://www.onlyalt.com/">Alt</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sports-trading-card-platform-alt-launches-with-31-million-in-funding-and-plenty-of-market-hype/">raising $31 million</a> in May, while <a href="https://www.whatnot.com/">Whatnot</a>, specializing in Pokémon cards and Funko Pop figurines, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/whatnot-raises-20m-for-its-live-streaming-platform-built-for-selling-pokemon-cards-and-other-collectibles/">raised $20 million in Series A</a> funding in March.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Moore said he is looking forward to working with Raine Ventures, which was joined in the round with a group of entertainment and retail angel investors, including former Showtime chairman and CEO Matt Blank, Genius Sports chairman David Levy and Vivre founder Eva Jeanbart-Lorenzotti.</p>
<p>“We believe that Talkshoplive has a differentiated technology and strategy that will continue to drive adoption of live commerce,” Gordon Rubenstein, managing partner of Raine Ventures, said in a statement. “In the case of TSL, not only is there a clear value proposition that engages, supports and aligns incentives of all key players across the retail landscape, but also a fantastic team.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beyond Meat today announced the arrival of its new plant-based Chicken Tenders at upward of 400 U.S. based restaurants. The news follows continued growth for the California-based faux meat giant, which includes expansion to Walmart stores, Taco Bell restaurants and a big push into China over the past year.</p>
<p>The company says it’s a different product entirely from Beyond’s Chicken Strips despite bearing a similar name. That product predated the company’s wildly popular Beyond Burger patties, but were discontinued back in 2019 due to a lack of popularity compared to other offerings.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174361" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174361" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2174361" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-Chicken-Tenders_DippingGIF.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174361" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Beyond</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new recipe is largely made of fava beans and peas, contains 14 grams of protein a serving and is less than 40% the saturated fat of standard chicken tenders. The company says there’s no cholesterol, antibiotics or hormones, which not a lot of big-name chicken producers can say.</p>
<p>“As with all our products, Beyond Chicken Tenders offer delicious taste and an exceptional culinary experience, along with strong nutritional benefits,” CIO Dariush Ajami said in a press release tied to the news. “Innovation is at the heart of Beyond Meat, and Beyond Chicken Tenders are the latest example of our mission to create groundbreaking, tasty options that are better for people and for our planet.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174360" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174360" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2174360" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-Chicken-Tenders-Dipping.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-Chicken-Tenders-Dipping.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-Chicken-Tenders-Dipping.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-Chicken-Tenders-Dipping.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-Chicken-Tenders-Dipping.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-Chicken-Tenders-Dipping.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-Chicken-Tenders-Dipping.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-Chicken-Tenders-Dipping.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174360" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Beyond</p></div></p>

<p>There&#8217;s growing competition in the faux chicken market, as well. Last month, Nuggs-maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/nuggs-creator-simulate-raises-50m/">Simulate announced</a> a $50 million Series B to help it get to the other side.</p>
