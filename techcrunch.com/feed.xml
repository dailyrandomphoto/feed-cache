										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin, Texas, is becoming the new home for large companies (Tesla), investors and startups alike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is now also the new home for Tim Draper’s newest initiative to help support early-stage founders: Draper Startup House Accelerator Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backed by Draper, of course, the program will launch in April 2022. As founder of the famed Silicon Valley venture capital firm known as Draper Fisher Jurvetson, or DFJ, Draper in 2018 introduced the Startup House </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">concept. Today, there are more than 15 locations globally that are either hostels and/or co-working spaces aimed at traveling startup founders, digital nomads and other remote workers. Locations include Bali, Indonesia; Bangalore, India; and Valencia, Spain, among others. Besides Austin, the only other site in the U.S. is located in San Mateo, California, but that is a co-living space inside of Draper University.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236247" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This latest effort marks Draper Startup House’s only accelerator program, according to Daniel Wiegand, co-founder and president of DSH Accelerator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DSH will hold two cohorts in 2022 &#8212; both in Austin, consisting of 10 startup teams from around the world. The first cohort will take place in April and the second in August. As part of the program, DSH will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">invest up to $100,000 in pre-seed startups.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each cohort will last three months, take place two times per year and be located in Austin in 2022 and across the globe in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will not be your typical accelerator, but in addition to standard practices such as investment from the newly raised Draper Startup House Accelerator Fund, mentors, workshops and a demo day, DSH plans to incorporate a strong leadership building component as well as unique activities that will test the founders’ grit, creativity and push them outside of their comfort zone,” Wiegand said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be a mix of Draper University and a typical accelerator, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program will feature “unconventional twists to the standard accelerator model,” Wiegand told TechCrunch, and will be focused on early-stage deals across all industries. While the accelerator will accept applications from startups all over the world, the hope is that many of the startups will decide to continue their growth from Austin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups will be required to live together for the entirety of the program, dedicating the three months entirely to building their business. Interested entrepreneurs, founders or startups that want to learn more or apply to be in either cohort can fill out the application </span><a href="http://dshaccelerator.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We look for really great founders who are building big companies and have huge ideas,” Wiegand told TechCrunch. “It&#8217;s really all about the founder, which is why through the program, we will do a lot of leadership training to see if they are founders that are poised to take their company to where they want to take it.”</span></p>
<div class="gmail_default">DSH has also decided to add a co-living option for entrepreneurs who want to live in the house amongst the portfolio companies and participate in the programming, which is a paid program. They can get a single room for $2,500 a month or a shared bunk room for $900/month.</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, Draper’s intent was to launch its first U.S. location in Austin at SXSW as a hostel for entrepreneurs. The vision was to create a landing pad for entrepreneurs and startups traveling to Austin to get familiar with the local startup scene as well as the greater Draper network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then the COVID-19 pandemic led to SXSW being canceled and the city essentially shutting down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognizing that the pandemic would present extreme challenges, founders Katie Russel and Wiegand quickly pivoted to turn what was to be a hostel into a flexible coworking space for startups and entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past 18 months or so, Draper Startup House helped facilitate funding rounds for multiple Austin startups such as CoachTube, Mentor Method and Tabella.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw the talent in Austin, as well as inquiries from startups across the globe looking to enter the U.S. and talent-rich Austin ecosystem,” Wiegand said. “We wanted a way to really hone in and double down on the startups we saw great potential in. As Katie and I grappled with how to do this, it became clearer and clearer that a pop-up accelerator was the right path forward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The model is designed to eventually allow DSH to reach even more startups all over the world. While the accelerator will continue to have at least one cohort located in Austin, DSH Accelerator plans on moving the second cohort to a new destination each year. Future plans consist of programs emerging in multiple cities simultaneously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wiegand and Russel intentionally advocated to locate the accelerator somewhere other than in Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ve been working for four or five years in Silicon Valley. We&#8217;ve seen all the great opportunities and tools and resources that are here, but it&#8217;s just not accessible to everyone,” Wiegand explained. “It’s very expensive in Silicon Valley, especially for a startup that is bootstrapping. So what we pitched to him [Draper] was ‘hey, let us take this ecosystem and this brand that you&#8217;ve built over the last 20-30 years, and let us bundle up everything you have in San Mateo and spread it across the globe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Draper said in a statement: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are very excited about how the Draper Startup Houses around the world</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are becoming beacons for entrepreneurs everywhere. The DSH Accelerator, based in Austin,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">will take advantage of the amazing startup environment in Austin and bring more activity to the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Draper Ecosystem.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DSH will be conducting a month-long pilot in January.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Fora is one of the latest startups seeing venture capital attraction to push more of the travel industry into the digital age and tapping into the creator economy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Travel is back, at least according to experts who say <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/14/1054878036/thanksgiving-travel-airlines-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travel bookings for over the Thanksgiving holiday</a> are showing to be even higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Anyone who loves travel or is that friend who always plans the best vacations, <a href="https://www.foratravel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fora</a> has a tool for you. The company was co-founded by onefinestay’s Evan Frank, Virtuoso agency owner Henley Vazquez and entrepreneur Jake Peters, to redefine what we think of the travel agency and enable people who want to sell travel as a career, or in their spare time, a way to do it.</p>
<p>Frank and Vazquez had known each other for five years when the idea for Fora came up.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236066" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We always talked about doing something together, but this past March, we connected again,” Vazquez said. “I was in Costa Rica and talking about opportunities for women sitting on sidelines due to the pandemic and looking for interesting work. Content creators are circulating around the travel world, and we saw a big opportunity for technology to modernize the industry.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bplans.com/travel-agency-upscale-business-plan/market-analysis-summary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Travel agencies are a $100 billion market in the U.S.</a>, but it is still largely one that works with fax machines and phone calls. Fora is one of the latest startups seeing venture capital attraction to push more of the travel industry into the digital age and <a href="https://skift.com/2021/06/28/travels-creator-economy-is-poised-for-next-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tapping into the creator economy</a>. Another is Thatch, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/thatch-using-3m-round-to-put-travel-creators-on-the-map/">took in $3 million</a> in August to enable travel creators to monetize their recommendations.</p>
<p>However, Fora has a unique approach compared to some of its competitors: It is actually teaching people to sell travel through training sessions, content authoring tools and negotiated rates at the world’s top hotels.</p>
<p>“A lot of companies sell content or expertise, but we saw a bigger opportunity to empower more people to sell travel,” Frank said. “The booking of travel without a system or knowledge is janky and hard. We are focused on tooling to help our advisors be successful themselves.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since its soft launch in August, Fora has already booked $2 million in travel, and today, the company announced $5 million in a seed round. It was led by Forerunner Ventures with participation from Heartcore Capital, Uncommon Capital and individual investors, including Katrina Lake, Gokul Rajaram, Ran Makavy and Ben Rubin.</p>
<p>The company decided to go after venture capital to help build out its technology more quickly. Fora plans to use the new investment to onboard new advisors, product development and go-to-market. Its advisor waitlist has grown to more than 2,000 people, and the company will also spend the time onboarding and training them over the next few months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Brian O’Malley, general partner at Forerunner Ventures, said that his firm was looking at the creator space and found that what will make Fora successful is having the advisor with a circle of friends and a passion for travel.</p>
<p>“In our eyes, that fits the entrepreneur next store versus the person on Instagram getting free stuff,” he added. “The cost of customer acquisition is skyrocketing, and Fora is coming in as a ‘Trojan horse’ by getting networks that already existed. It’s also a next-generation platform that is getting people back into the workforce.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Starbucks has teamed up with Amazon to <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2021/starbucks-pickup-and-amazon-go-collaborate-to-launch-new-store-concept-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">open a cashierless store</a> in NYC. The new location — at 59th Street between Park &amp; Lexington Avenues — will combine the Starbucks app&#8217;s order ahead feature with Amazon&#8217;s Just Walk Out technology. In fact, the store sounds a like a cross between the cafe and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-25-amazon-big-go-grocery-store-seattle-cashless.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Amazon Go</a> store, which served as the launching pad for the e-commerce giant&#8217;s cashierless tech experience.</p>
<p>It has a lounge area customers can enter by using the &#8220;In-Store Code&#8221; in the Amazon Shopping app, by scanning their credit cards or by scanning their palm registered with Amazon One on the terminals onsite. Once they&#8217;re in, they&#8217;ll find a small Amazon Go market containing a curated selection of customer favorites from both companies. Anything they take from the shelf will be added to their virtual carts, and they will be charged after they leave like in any other location that uses Amazon&#8217;s Just Walk Out tech.</p>
<p>Over the past year-and-a-half, Amazon has expanded the availability of its cashierless technology. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-11-amazon-just-walk-out-cashier-less-newark.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">teamed up</a> with airport stores to implement the check-out free experience and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fresh-just-walk-out-technology-washington-114044465.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">opened</a> the first full-size Fresh grocery store with the technology in June. Amazon also added the technology to a few <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-just-walk-out-tech-comes-to-two-whole-foods-stores-101036042.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">Whole Foods</a> locations and, more recently, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sainsburys-amazon-just-walk-out-shopping-store-151027993.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">licensed</a> it for use to UK supermarket chain Sainsbury&#8217;s. This partnership with Starbucks is yet another step towards making Just Walk Out more ubiquitous than before.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236475" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Starbucks and Amazon are planning to open three joint stores in the coming year, including this one. The second location is planned for The New York Times Building located at 40th Street &amp; 8th Avenue. For now, New Yorkers can head to the first location at 59th Street to check out the concept.</p>

<p>Given that investors made a larger, more expensive bet on Sweetgreen than we might have anticipated, there&#8217;s work to do.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2220368" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Let&#8217;s calculate the company&#8217;s IPO valuation, using both simple and fully diluted share counts. Then we&#8217;ll dig into Sweetgreen&#8217;s final IPO revenue multiple to understand how investors are truly valuing the company. From there, we&#8217;ll see if the company&#8217;s valuation squares up with what we&#8217;ve seen from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/sweetgreens-ipo-pricing-guidance-illuminates-valuation-range-for-tech-enabled-companies/">other recent technology-enabled IPOs</a>.</p>
<p>Why are we paying attention to Sweetgreen? Because it started raising external capital in the mid-aughts and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/sweetgreen-series-i--77f42f82">kept at it through a Series I in 2019</a>. More simply, a host of private investors, including venture capitalists, bet on Sweetgreen. So, we care.</p>
<h2>Sweetgreen&#8217;s IPO valuation</h2>
<p>Before it added 500,000 shares to its IPO &#8212; 575,000 if we include 75,000 shares placed into its underwriters&#8217; option pool &#8212; Sweetgreen expected that it would have 106,311,529 shares outstanding after its IPO. That figure rises to 108,761,529 shares if we count the additional equity sold and the full total of shares reserved for underwriters.</p>
<p>At that new share count at $28 per share, Sweetgreen is worth $3.05 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re a YouTube star &#8212; honestly, it&#8217;s not impossible, given that now, <a href="https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/how-many-youtube-channels-have-over-1-million-subscribers-56881000f35a">some estimate</a> that over 20,000 YouTubers have at least 1 million subscribers. You&#8217;re going to monetize through YouTube ads, probably, but you might also sell merch, run a Patreon membership, or write a subscription-only newsletter. More and more startups like <a href="https://fourthwall.com/">Fourthwall</a> are emerging to help creators consolidate their various income streams within one all-in-one creator platform, aiming to take away some of the backend administrative stress of running your own business. The goal is to give creators more time to focus on creating.</p>
<p>Fourthwall announced today that it raised $17 million from investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners, Initialized Capital, and Alexis Ohanian’s <a href="https://sevensevensix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sevensevensix.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637187227892000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ITwtgeqW5bLC-wJv_hh0F">Seven Seven Six</a>. Like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/08/patronage-empire/">Memberful</a>, a subsidiary of Patreon, Fourthwall offers a white-label website with built-in tools for setting up merch stores, membership programs, tipping and more. When fans buy something, there&#8217;s an integrated Cameo-like feature that lets creators send personalized video and audio messages as a thank you. Fourthwall partners with manufacturers to offer over 200 different types of products that creators can develop to sell through their website, which creators can control down to the code itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We genuinely think Fourthwall is ready to really materially help creators succeed in this area, so they&#8217;re able to focus more thoroughly on the content and community side,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Will Baumann told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235751" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Still, creators are often skeptical of all-in-one solutions. Especially when the future of any given startup can look so uncertain, creators are encouraged to diversify their income streams. We saw this most recently with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-suspends-decision-to-ban-explicit-content/">almost-ban</a> of adult content on Only Fans &#8212; if the ban was enacted, creators would have had to start from zero, since they wouldn&#8217;t have had any way to contact their existing subscriber list (some platforms like Substack and Patreon give creators access at the get-go to their subscribers&#8217; emails). Even among safe-for-work creators, what happens if a microinfluencer gets locked out of their Instagram account? Even <a href="https://medium.com/@shessomickey/3-lessons-for-podcasters-from-someone-who-lived-through-youtubes-buyout-1beacbcfbcb">acquisitions</a> like Google&#8217;s purchase of YouTube or Spotify&#8217;s absorption of Anchor and Gimlet can drastically change a creator&#8217;s payouts from those platforms.</p>
<p>Fourthwall told TechCrunch that it has three months of emergency operating expenses set aside to ensure that if they were to fail, they could help transition creators to other platforms. The company said it would also make its platform open source if this were to happen. Fourthwall expects to be in business for a long time, but these contingency plans are necessary for creators who are gambling their livelihoods with emerging startups.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235904" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235904" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2235904" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Creator-Dashboard-Screenshot-1-copy.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="471" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Creator-Dashboard-Screenshot-1-copy.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Creator-Dashboard-Screenshot-1-copy.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Creator-Dashboard-Screenshot-1-copy.jpg?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Creator-Dashboard-Screenshot-1-copy.jpg?resize=768,532 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Creator-Dashboard-Screenshot-1-copy.jpg?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Creator-Dashboard-Screenshot-1-copy.jpg?resize=1536,1065 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Creator-Dashboard-Screenshot-1-copy.jpg?resize=2048,1420 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Creator-Dashboard-Screenshot-1-copy.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235904" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fourthwall</p></div></p>
<p>To onboard onto Fourthwall, creators have to <a href="https://fourthwall.com/request-an-invite/">request an invite</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Nobody gets rejected. This is just sort of our gating function to make sure we&#8217;re actually getting creators in the platform, as opposed to spam entries,&#8221; Baumann said. &#8220;Fourthwall is designed for anybody that has a community and wants to connect with that community and grow that community, and hopefully, make money off of the platform as things scale up.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no fee to join Fourthwall, but the platform takes 5% of creator earnings, plus a standard credit card processing fee of 2.9% plus $0.30 on all transactions. For creators producing merchandise through Fourthwall&#8217;s manufacturers, there are additional costs involved.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the funding announcement, Fourthwall is also revealing its new Chief Creative Officer, Phil DeFranco, a YouTuber with over six million subscribers who has been making videos for over fifteen years. DeFranco started out using Fourthwall about a year and a half ago and said that his merchandise revenue increased tenfold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phil&#8217;s number one focus is just making sure that the types of work that we&#8217;re building and shipping to other creators like him are meeting the bar and basically are able to solve their problems,&#8221; Baumann said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really to make sure that we&#8217;re always putting our creators first. That&#8217;s our focus: creator ownership, creator brand and greater control.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Platforms that bring more automation to the working environment, and platforms that are empowering more people to get involved in building tools to help themselves work, have equally seen a huge rise in usage in the last year and a half. Today, a company that ties both of those trends together &#8212; with a no-code platform designed to help build automated workflows for different tasks &#8212; is announcing a big round of funding to capture some of that growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.formstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formstack</a>, which provides a wide range of templates and integrations to let people create their own workflow automations, has raised $425 million, equity funding that it will be using to continue picking up more customers and to expand into more international territories.</p>
<p>The company today has some 238,000 users from 25,000 organizations, with some of the big names among its customers including Twitter, Netflix, the NHL and the Cleveland Clinic.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236426" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are helping non-tech users get things done, saving time and money,&#8221; said Chris Byers, Formstack&#8217;s CEO, in an interview. He said the company raised this round not because it needed the funds to operate &#8212; it is profitable &#8212; but because it sees helping non-tech users in this way as a very big opportunity, worth some $100 billion globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;About 25% of our customers are already international, so there is huge potential there.&#8221;</p>
<p>It will also use the funding to continue investing in its product, including adding in more integrations alongside the 250 it already has with a variety of big-name and lesser known email, payments, CRM, CMS and document storage services.</p>
<p>Silversmith Capital Partners and returning investor PSG are leading the round: PSG, along with Greater Sum Ventures, led a leveraged buyout of the company in 2018. This appears to be the company&#8217;s first big financing event since then, although the company is not disclosing many details about its management, nor its financial position, except to note that alongside being profitable, revenues have more than tripled since the LBO. We have asked, but valuation is also not being disclosed with this round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Formstack is playing in the very heart of what is trendy in enterprise IT today &#8212; RPA and other kinds of automation to speed up mundane processes and reduce costs are huge, and the growing sophistication of no-code tools has helped to democratize how IT can be built and used in businesses &#8212; but the age of the company itself underscores just how long the concepts of low-code, no-code tools, and automation have actually been around.</p>
<p>Founded in 2006 &#8212; not in the Valley but Fishers, Indiana (near Indianapolis) &#8212; the initial aim of Formstack, Byers said, was to build a tool to make it easier to create online forms to gather customer information and more automatically channel that into relevant applications in the back office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our original product was a drag-and-drop form builder, which could be used to put a form on site for lead capture,&#8221; said Byers. &#8220;Now we are not only focused on data collection, but document generation.&#8221; It has built out its reach very much with integrations, but it has also built a number of native features to complement that, such as e-signature.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a little more backstory: Byers himself is an integration of sorts. That is to say, he joined the company about five years after it was founded. When founder Ade Olonoh, who still sits on the board, moved on from Formstack, he built another startup: Formspring &#8212; similarly named but very different, initially focused on Q&amp;A and then social networking. Unlike Formstack, which has found a very well-timed groove in the market, Formspring ultimately found it a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/13/formspring-saved-new-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggle</a> to grow amid the rapid rise of Facebook and others. Today, it no longer exists.</p>
<p>Formstack&#8217;s pitch, indeed, has resonated with its customers and seen it move into a number of newer areas, such as healthcare, where automatic flows built using Formstack have been used to take in patient data and help speed up the intake and triage process in clinical settings &#8212; a critical piece of the care process at a time when workers are stretched, and generally everyone concerned wants to minimize physical contact as much as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Digital transformation has been accelerated, and we&#8217;re seeing usage of our platform to improve customer and worker experience, as well as the move to remote work,&#8221; Byers said. There will be more applications emerging that Formstack is now building for, he said, to help organizations comply with vaccine mandates, by creating forms for users to fill out more easily to verify their status.</p>
<p>“The number of businesses looking to streamline and digitize business processes today is accelerating, yet a key pain point for companies is not having the technical resources to implement and maintain a solution,” said Jim Quagliaroli, managing partner at Silversmith, in a statement. “Formstack’s no-code workflow automation solution was built to address this problem by enabling non-technical employees who understand a business use case, but don&#8217;t have the technical skills to implement a solution, to become ‘citizen-developers.’ We are thrilled to partner with Chris, his team, and our friends at PSG as the company continues to rapidly scale.”</p>
<p>“We believe Formstack is at the forefront of innovation in the workplace productivity space. Their talented team continues to deliver solutions to help organizations across industries operate more effectively and efficiently,” added Tom Reardon, managing director at PSG. “It’s been a pleasure to witness the significant growth they’ve achieved in the past several years, and we’re excited to continue to serve as a partner and work alongside Silversmith to support their expansion.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stytch-auth">Stytch</a>, an API-first passwordless authentication startup, has secured $90 million in Series B funding, pushing the company over the $1 billion valuation line.</p>
<p>The investment, led by Coatue Management LLC with participation from existing investors Benchmark Capital, Thrive Capital and Index Ventures, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/ex-plaid-employees-raise-30m-for-stytch-an-api-first-passwordless-authentication-platform/">comes just four months after Stytch raised $30M Series A</a> at a valuation somewhere around $200 million. Since then, the startup has seen an almost 1,000% increase in developers using its passwordless authentication platform, rising from 350 developers in July to about 4,000 in November.</p>
<p>This, the company&#8217;s CEO tells us, is because of its API-first approach. “If you think about other passwordless startups, they&#8217;re very widget focused,” Reed McGinley-Stempel, CEO of Stytch and former <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/plaid/">Plaid</a> employee tells TechCrunch. “We’ve had enough experience with non-API-first products that we knew there were a lot of limitations to what you can do.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235549" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;For example, one of the common use cases we’ve seen that we would never have anticipated is checkout flows &#8211; adding the ability to create a new account at checkout with an SMS password or email verification, rather than guest checkout,&#8221; said McGinley-Stempel.</p>
<p>The company has also launched a number of new products since its Series A raise in July, including support for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/answers-to-your-burning-questions-about-how-sign-in-with-apple-works/">Sign In with Apple,</a> Google and Microsoft, embeddable magic links, and one-time passcodes by email. This week it’s also adding support for WebAuthn, allowing Stytch to support hardware-based authentication keys like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/yubico/">Yubico</a>, as well as biometric-based Face ID and fingerprint logins.</p>
<p>Stytch said it plans to further expand its platform over the coming months, too. As part of its Series B raise, it acquired <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cotter-app">Cotter</a>, a no-code passwordless authentication platform backed by Y Combinator that allows users to add one-tap login to websites and apps. Stytch said it will make it easier for developers to adopt passwordless technologies.</p>
<p>The company will also use the funding to expand its 30-person team and to build out its infrastructure.</p>
<p>Stytch isn’t the only startup that’s on a mission to kill off the password. In June, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/transmit-security-raises-543m-series-a-to-kill-off-the-password/">Transmit Security raised $543 million, </a>in what was believed to be the largest Series A investment in cybersecurity history, for its natively passwordless identity and risk management solution. The following month Magic, a San Francisco-based startup that builds “plug and play” passwordless authentication technology, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/magic-27m-series-a-for-its-plug-and-play-passwordless-tech/">announced it had raised $27 million in Series A funding</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://doorvest.com/">Doorvest</a> this morning announced a $39 million funding event, including $14 million worth of equity financing and a $25 million credit facility. The latter makes sense given the startup&#8217;s business model, namely helping consumers buy and manage rental properties.</p>
<p><a href="https://m13.co/">M13</a> led the round (not to be confused with <a href="https://m12.vc/">M12</a>, Microsoft&#8217;s venture arm, or <a href="https://m25vc.com/">M25</a>, the Midwest-focused firm), with participation from <a href="https://www.mucker.com/">Mucker Capital</a> and others, including a number of angels.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">funding round blizzard</a> that we find ourselves in, it takes a little to stand out from the flow of inbound. But Doorvest caught our eye due to the fact that it sounded like it was building a too-consumer-friendly model for a for-profit business. So we got <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewluong_">Andrew Luong</a>, the company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, on the phone to discuss the funding event and how Doorvest&#8217;s business shakes out economically.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236404" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Doorvest&#8217;s model</h2>
<p>Doorvest wants to help individual consumers buy a rental property and manage it. Folks bring their own financial information to Doorvest, which helps them select a home to purchase &#8212; the startup has a number of listings already on its platform, including <a href="https://doorvest.com/homes/11023-gatlinburg-dr-houston-tx-77031">houses like this</a>. Once a house is selected and a small deposit paid, Doorvest buys the house in question and fixes it up.</p>
<p>The eventual owner then takes out a mortgage and buys the home from Doorvest, with the company handling its management for a cut of its rental income. The idea is that the consumer gets help selecting, buying and running a rental property without having to pick up a hammer. But what about Doorvest &#8212; why not just buy the houses it thinks make attractive rental candidates and run them itself?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236418" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236418" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2236418" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/JustinAndrew-Jan2021-9-of-20.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/JustinAndrew-Jan2021-9-of-20.jpg 3346w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/JustinAndrew-Jan2021-9-of-20.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/JustinAndrew-Jan2021-9-of-20.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/JustinAndrew-Jan2021-9-of-20.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/JustinAndrew-Jan2021-9-of-20.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/JustinAndrew-Jan2021-9-of-20.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/JustinAndrew-Jan2021-9-of-20.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/JustinAndrew-Jan2021-9-of-20.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236418" class="wp-caption-text">The Doorvest founding team. Andrew Luong, left, and Justin Kasad, right. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Doorvest</p></div></p>
<p>Per Luong, individuals can leverage government subsidies and tax advantages that companies often do not get. So, it makes more sense, in his view, to help individuals buy and manage rental units than to keep them intra-company after they are remodeled.</p>
<p>Doorvest makes money in a few ways during the process. It looks to snag a roughly 5% slice of a property&#8217;s final selling price, and the company indicated that the 10% cut of rental incomes it takes for managing properties has margin in it as well.</p>
<p>As a consumer, it all sounds rather excellent. I, an impractical human, would love to add more real estate to my personal portfolio. But I know effectively zilch about how to go about picking, updating and running properties. This limits my options to REITs, or, terrifyingly, trying to learn how to run a small property business myself.</p>
<p>Or, Doorvest. It&#8217;s a good pitch.</p>
<p>The startup has been operating for consumers since April 2020 and has purchased 170 homes to date. Doorvest&#8217;s growing capital base &#8212; it had raised around $3.5 million in equity funding before its latest $14 million infusion &#8212; and its expanding geographic footprint should help it get more homes through its process, collecting not only more data for the company but regular revenue streams.</p>
<p>If the math all shakes out, I dig what Doorvest is doing. Let&#8217;s see how it scales.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EasyHealth, a startup focused on navigating the Medicare experience, announced a $135 million Series A round on Thursday. EasyHealth has a simple purpose: to help enroll, and follow-up with (more on this later), people eligible for Medicare. But the bigger picture is that the company is aiming to fill a major “information gap” facing insurance companies along the way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EasyHealth was founded in 2020 (initially under the name Medicare Advisors 365, but has since rebranded to EasyHealth), and this most recent round represents the company&#8217;s total financing. The $135 million Series A consists of a $100 million credit facility, and $35 million in equity financing. The round was led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthemis Group and QED Investors and included Victory Park Capital, Nationwide Ventures, Healthy Ventures, Brewer Lane, and Operator Partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some sense, EasyHealth is reminiscent of insurance brokerages – third parties that help people pick between Medicare-eligible insurance plans. EasyHealth can connect users with Medicare Advantage plans (Medicare-approved plans offered by private insurers) or other Medicare supplements or prescription drug plans that partner with medicare. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236057" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking these plans can be a fraught process. In New York alone, there are 280 Medicare Advantage Plans and 19 stand-alone Medicare prescription drug plans to pick from according to the </span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/92921-state-state-fact-sheets-2022-medicare-advantage-and-part-d-landscape-final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a lot of insurance jargon to weed through. In response, about 96 percent of Medicare Advantage and Part D (the drug add-on) plans contract with agents to help sell plans. (Though some studies have suggested that these agents </span><a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2021/apr/how-agents-influence-medicare-beneficiaries-plan-choices"><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t represent all the available options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EasyHealth represents about 30-40 percent of Medicare Advantage plans, said CEO David Duel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the company has managed to enroll about 40,000 people in Medicare-based plans, per Duel. However, its aiming to be more than a broker. EasyHealth is particularly interested in follow-up up with enrollees. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is what Duel sees as a “core differentiation” between EasyHealth and an insurance broker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a lot of brokers and a lot of great companies that support enrollment and support the brokerage function. We&#8217;re going beyond just enrollment and having these clinical functions in house by employing a network of nurse practitioners, doctors and medical assistants to do in-home assessments, and meet the members in their home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a broker helps someone enroll in a healthcare plan, insurers will occasionally send a healthcare professional (usually not someone’s PCP) in-person to do a home visit. These visits are designed to detect chronic conditions or other conditions that might indicate underlying health problems that an insurance company can’t know about before enrollment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That “information gap” between a patient’s true health status and what an insurer actually knows  is the pain point Duel is trying to address. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a health insurance plan or a PCP doesn&#8217;t know what conditions a member has, they&#8217;ll only find out if once the issue becomes chronic, or the guy ends up in the hospital. So having that first party collect preventative data is super, super critical,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duel says that the company has conducted “a few thousand” home visits so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home visits can also be a money-maker for insurance companies that partner with Medicare. These home visits allow insurers to detect conditions they may otherwise miss. That allows them to adjust “risk scores” assigned to each patient. Higher scores allow companies to bill Medicare for the higher anticipated cost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, there’s some evidence that home visits can r</span><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.1305"><span style="font-weight: 400;">educe hospitalizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Center for Medicare Services also encourages Medicare Advantage companies to conduct health risk assessments, including home visits, because they offer an opportunity to develop a plan of care, deliver an intervention, or adjust a care plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But these home visit health assessments have also</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/08/12/431400145/whistleblower-says-medicare-advantage-plans-padded-charges-in-home-visits"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> been controversial.</span></a> <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/health/home-is-where-the-money-is-for-medicare-advantage-plans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2014 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Center for Public Integrity found that home visits had skyrocketed, and had likely led to more payments for insurance companies, while government regulators </span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/Downloads/Advance2015.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cast doubt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on their effectiveness for patients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services issued a </span><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-03-17-00474.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September 2021, showing that 20 Medicare Advantage companies (a small proportion overall), had driven a disproportionately large share of Medicare spending through diagnosis made, in large part, through health risk assessments. The benefits patients were receiving as a result of this increased spending was not clear, per the report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is possible that beneficiaries are receiving care, but plans are not submitting this data as required,” acknowledged Christi Grimm, Principal Deputy Inspector General of the. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in </span><a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/medicare-advantage-should-not-game-the-system-but-prioritize-patient-care/585613/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an op-ed summarizing the report.   </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Regardless, plans that use risk assessments to gather diagnoses, but then take no further action, are clearly missing an opportunity for meaningful care coordination.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the home visit can be a useful tool and an opportunity to improve care. But the concept has also faced criticism when it comes to spending and patient outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duel, for his part, argues these home-visits do drive better care in the long-term.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are facilitating the shift from a reactive care to a proactive care model,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The member gets a detailed education on their benefits and how to utilize them. The members get comprehensive clinical and social determinant screening which uncovers potential conditions and allows the providers to build the right care plan. If providers and payers are not aware of conditions due to poor engagement which is very common, they are unable to proactively manage care.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far EasyHealth has been able to get more people to complete home assessments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, with Bright Health, an insurance company partner, Duel says EasyHealth has led to an 80 percent visit completion rate, compared to industry averages “between five and 20 percent” he estimates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EasyHealth plans to use the $135 million raised to drive this “independent broker space.” The $100 million credit facility portion of this raise will be used to provide technology tools and capital to independent brokers to help them enroll members in Medicare. EasyHealth can then “leverage that membership” to provide the clinical followup portion of its business (the visits). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, the membership enrollment will take a back seat to the clinical visit side of things – that’s EasyHealth’s internal core competency. Though the company will keep a hand in enrollment too. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Software for hardware design is all the rage in the VC funding world these days. Following recent rounds from Flux and Bild, nTopology just announced a sizable series D of $65 million. The funding round led by Tiger Global (who else) brings the New York-based firm’s total funding to $135 million. Existing investors Root Ventures, Canaan Partners, Haystack and Insight Partners also participated in the round.</p>
<p>The company effectively offers CAD software, designed to be used by engineers in a wide range of fields, including industrial design, aerospace, automotive and medical. The company promises a more elegant solution than more traditional systems, specifically focused on the world of 3D printing/additive manufacturing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235177" style="width: 969px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235177" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2235177" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ALL_MR.gif" alt="" width="959" height="566" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235177" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> nTopology</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235119" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Earlier in my career, I found that most of the engineering software, like CAD, was a bottleneck in driving innovative design,” co-founder and CEO Bradley Rothenberg said in a release tied to the news. “Our company was built specifically to solve engineers’ problems, allowing them to fully utilize the power of additive manufacturing processes and fill the gaps left by these old legacy design tools.”</p>
<p>The company, which recently released v3.0 of its titular software offering, currently has around 300 clients, including names like Ford, Lockheed Martin and Honeywell. It also recently partnered with 3D printing giant Stratasys to create FDM Assembly Fixture Generator, a software platform designed for additive manufacturing workflows.</p>
<p>NTopology says the funding will go toward expanding its international reach, as well as developing additional features for its software.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company was co-founded by a group that includes doctors and a lawyer, all who know what it takes to build a healthcare brand because they did it with their own brand in 2016.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London-based <a href="https://www.gravitiq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gravitiq</a> is the latest e-commerce roll-up company, or aggregator, that has attracted a large amount of initial funding. It is buying and scaling Amazon marketplace brands in the digitally-native, consumer e-commerce healthcare sector.</p>
<p>The company announced today $55 million of seed investment in a mix of equity and debt (the company declined to disclose the breakdown), from a group of investors that includes CoVenture and Crossbeam Venture Partners.</p>
<p>What you’ll find a bit different about Gravitiq than its e-commerce aggregator peers is that the company was co-founded by a group that includes doctors and a lawyer, all who know what it takes to build a healthcare brand because they did it with their own brand in 2016.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236156" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Doctors Saurabh Srivastava and Adam Gunasekara, and Srivastava’s brother, Sachin, who began his career at Latham &amp; Watkins and has an M&amp;A background, made their first acquisition in October 2020.</p>
<p>“While stuck in a hotel for 14 days during the pandemic, we had the idea of building an online healthcare portfolio that would combine Adam’s and my skills building healthcare companies with Sachin’s M&amp;A background,” CEO Saurabh Srivastava told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Gunasekara noted that by acquiring brands in one niche, it would be easier to scale due to similarities with customers, while Sachin Srivastava added that having the group’s expertise resonated with sellers who felt comfortable handing their company over to medical specialists.</p>
<p>Gravitiq is looking for companies in all areas of healthcare, like supplements, wellness, baby and first aid. The company has now made half a dozen acquisitions that include orthotics and ADHD and anxiety tools.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new investment provides a path for the company to acquire additional companies, consider expanding its portfolio of e-commerce healthcare brands and add to its team of 20 employees in the U.S., Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The company plans to move quickly, but cautiously in the number of companies it buys, and is looking for annual recurring revenue of $1 million to $10 million per brand.</p>
<p>With the new funding, Gravitiq joins a long list of startups that have also attracted venture-backed funding to purchase Amazon marketplace companies. Just this week, San Francisco-based Heyday brought in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/heyday-raises-555m-to-buy-up-and-scale-more-d2c-brands-on-the-amazon-marketplace-universe/">$555 million in a Series C round</a>. The big name in aggregators, Thrasio, announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/thrasio-the-amazon-aggregator-raises-1b-in-fresh-funding-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-10-billion/">$1 billion in October</a>, while Perch grabbed a large investment of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$775 million</a> in May.</p>
<p>Sakib Jamal, investor at Crossbeam, says it&#8217;s still too early to say how the e-commerce aggregator market will shake out, but that there are a lot of brands that need help. As more and more new sellers join Amazon, there will be a large pool of companies that will seek help from aggregators like Gravitiq, he added.</p>
<p>What stood out to him with Gravitiq was the specialization in healthcare and being able to help companies with their regulatory pathways and making sure they don’t make outlandish claims on packaging, something Amazon won’t necessarily assist with, Jamal said.</p>
<p>“We like that they have both the medical and Amazon operating experience, and that combination is rare,” he added. “Other things that stood out was that they had already successfully run a brand and the materials and the processes they created on how they would do this — even before acquiring their first companies. There was also a trust factor, we trusted them and knew sellers would too.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors’ BrightDrop has scored a second customer for its EV410 electric delivery vans: fleet management company Merchants Fleet, which said Thursday that it had placed an order for 5,400 of the mid-sized electric vans.</p>
<p>The new order is in addition to Merchants’ previous commitment to purchase 12,600 of BrightDrop’s flagship EV600 van. The total order, which now stands at 18,000 vehicles, is BrightDrop’s largest client order to date.</p>
<p>BrightDrop is GM’s first-to-last-mile business arm that the automaker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gm-targets-delivery-companies-with-new-ev-business-unit-brightdrop/">launched at the beginning of 2021</a>. It was spun out of the automaker’s in-house organization Global Innovation, which also “incubated” OnStar Guardian, OnStar Insurance and GM Defense. So far, the unit has debuted three products: the EV600, the EV410 and a pod-like electric pallet it calls EP1.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236082" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GM&#8217;s newest startup aims squarely at the commercial EV market&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/gms-newest-startup-aims-squarely-at-the-commercial-ev-market/embed/#?secret=5Exl2g69vI" data-secret="5Exl2g69vI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>EV600 has an estimated range of 250 miles and 600 cubic feet of cargo space, while EV410, which GM unveiled in September, comes in at around 400 cubic feet of cargo space. The automaker has already lined up two customers for the vans: FedEx, which inked a deal for EV600 vans &#8212; and will reportedly start receiving the first vehicles in time for the holiday season &#8212; and telecom giant Verizon, which placed an order for an undisclosed number of EV410s.</p>
<p>Both vans will use GM&#8217;s Ultium battery architecture, and both will be manufactured at the automaker&#8217;s CAMI Assembly facility in Ingersoll, Ontario. GM said it would pour $1 billion CAD ($788 million) into converting the CAMI plant into Canada&#8217;s first large-scale facility dedicated to commercial electric vehicle manufacturing.</p>
<p>The launch of BrightDrop is a strong sign that GM sees delivery as one way to make a tidy return on its multibillion-dollar investment in electrification and connected vehicles. The automaker has estimated that the market for parcel and food logistics will top <a href="https://plants.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/jan/ces/0112-brightdrop.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$850 billion by 2025</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Merchants Fleet has over 150,000 units under its management in North America, with many EVs already in its roster. A spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch that many of the company’s customers have reservations for future vehicles, such as the BrightDrop EV600, EV410, Ford F-150 Lightning and the Chevrolet electric Silverado.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mom-and-pop corner store owners in Latin America manage relationships with over 100 different suppliers, on average, often traveling long distances to pick up inventory, so they aren’t able to regularly restock.</p>
<p>Most of these relationships are largely managed manually and on paper, but Chiper developed an e-commerce ecosystem for corner stores that is shifting that relationship into the digital realm.</p>
<p>The Colombia-based company is taking on some of that inventory burden by providing access to inventory at lower prices and often same-day delivery on thousands of products.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236111" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://growth.chiper.mx/">Chiper</a>, founded in 2018 by CEO Jose Bonilla, is already the primary supplier and operating system for over 40,000 corner stores.</p>
<p>“The way that retailers design their systems to visit corner stores means the stores have to buy more products to last a longer time between visits, but often don’t have the working capital or shelf space,” Bonilla told TechCrunch. “We built an end-to-end platform to buy from the CPGs ourselves and deliver it to the corner stores in less than 24 hours. All of the processes are connected with our technology that stakeholders access from an app.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bonilla says the company is just getting started, though, as there are more than 3.7 million corner stores across Latin America. Together, they brought in $330 billion in annual revenue in recent years, and Bonilla estimates that will soon reach $500 billion.</p>
<p>To get to a milestone of 100,000 stores, the company recently took in $53 million in Series B funding, led by Nosara Capital, with participation from Tiger Global, Endeavor Catalyst, InQlab, Alter Global and Interplay. To date, the company has raised more than $65 million, which included a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chiper-raises-12-million-series-a-to-accelerate-the-digital-transformation-of-corner-store-retail-in-latin-america-301153831.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$12 million Series A</a> in October 2020.</p>
<p>Both Nosara and Tiger are new investors for the company, which saw seven times revenue growth in the last 12 months. Those results are what triggered the company going into the market and looking for capital to keep the pace, Bonilla said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Orchata raises $4M, aims to build a ‘Gopuff for Latin America’&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/orchata-raises-4m-aims-to-build-a-gopuff-for-latin-america/embed/#?secret=8USR4SjxSF" data-secret="8USR4SjxSF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It was that year over year growth that attracted Nosara as well, the firm said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chiper platform dramatically improves the procurement process for corner stores by providing a greater assortment of goods from a broad network of suppliers, faster and more reliable fulfillment through an asset-light logistics network, and lower prices from aggregated demand and a more streamlined supply chain,” Ian Loizeaux, partner at Nosara Capital, said in a written statement. “The business is growing seven times year-over-year and has the highest gross margins we’ve seen in this space globally, which speaks to the strength of their value proposition and the company&#8217;s first mover advantage.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Chiper has scaled across both Mexico and Colombia over the past year, amassing 3,000 product SKUs and reaching 10,000 orders per day in the third quarter of this year. It is now poised to launch in Brazil early next year and add another 2,000 products by 2023.</p>
<p>The new capital will aid in that expansion into Brazil; adding 200 employees in areas like engineers, data scientists and machine learning experts; and launching embedded financial services. Bonilla plans to be at 650 employees by the end of the year.</p>
<p>“The challenge is building a habit and moving from decades of buying on paper to using a phone for core business processes,” he added. “We still have a lot of stores to go, and we have to be aggressive in bringing on new customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://kandji.io">Kandji</a>, the startup building an Apple device management business, has been doing pretty well for itself with rapdily growing revenue, a fat valuation and lots of investment capital rolling in. Today, the company announced a $100 million Series C on an $800 million valuation, up 10x in the last year when the company did its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/kandji-hauls-in-21m-series-a-as-apple-device-management-flourishes-during-pandemic/">$21 million Series A</a>. It quickly followed with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/kandji-nabs-60m-series-b-as-apple-device-management-platform-continues-to-thrive/">$60 million Series B</a> last April.</p>
<p>Tiger Global led today&#8217;s investment with participation from Definition, Frontline Ventures and existing investors First Round Capital, Greycroft, Felicis Ventures, The Spruce House Partnership, B Capital Group, SVB Capital and Okta Ventures. Kandji has raised over $188 million, according to the company, with $181 million coming since last October.</p>
<p>The company offers medium-to-large businesses a way to manage their Apple devices and founder and CEO Adam Pettit says that the pandemic and working from home really drove inbound customer interest. In fact, revenue has grown over 700 percent in the last year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236175" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Part of that is the result of growth in Europe, which has led to the startup opening a London office and that part of their market contributing substantially to the revenue mix. &#8220;We just launched operations in Europe. We [opened an office in] London, and we&#8217;re going to be rapidly hiring there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the catalyst for that was really interesting. We do very little to no marketing internationally, but we&#8217;ve seen that over the last year, roughly 25% of our top line revenues comes internationally.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is also seeing bigger customers more generally, who are becoming more comfortable that Kandji is in it for the long haul with this level of investment. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been adding larger and larger customers as we&#8217;ve been around longer, and our customers are getting comfortable that we&#8217;re here to stay,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In order to manage those [larger] customers pre- and post- sales, you need more sophisticated teams. We&#8217;ve been building that out over the last six months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pettit says that they have over 1000 companies using the platform, and grew from 40 employees at the start of the year to over 250 today, and he hopes to get to 400 by next year. Earlier this year, when I spoke to him <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/kandji-nabs-60m-series-b-as-apple-device-management-platform-continues-to-thrive/">around the Series B</a>, Pettit talked about how important it was to build a diverse and inclusive culture, and that it started with recruiting. He says that commitment has not wavered.</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually do a number of different things to expand the reach of our pipeline, making sure we&#8217;re moving outside of our normal networks to grab candidates that would not otherwise be available to us. The other thing that&#8217;s been great for [building diversity] for us, and I&#8217;d imagine for a lot of other companies, is being able to hire remotely means that we&#8217;re not targeting one specific market. And so that [really helps] for increasing the diversity of our hiring pipelines,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While the company has offices in San Diego and London, Pettit says his is a remote first company and he intends to keep it that way moving forward.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Carro enables brand partnerships to sell each other’s products without having to purchase inventory or manage logistics and returns.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brands are always looking for new ways to get in front of potential customers, but though influencer marketing has grown, it’s still not so easy for brands to find the right person.</p>
<p>That’s where <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/carro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carro</a> comes in. David Perry and Jason Goldberg co-founded the company in 2015 and built a cross-store selling and influencer commerce platform that is used by more than 7 million influencers and 30,000 brands, like Blendjet, Arizona Iced Tea and Chubbies Shorts.</p>
<p>Carro can be installed from the Shopify App store and enables brand partnerships to sell each other’s products without having to purchase inventory or manage logistics and returns. It also has a feature for brands to discover influencers who already love their products so they can build and maintain a relationship.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236201" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“When a customer purchases a bike, for example, they will most likely need a helmet, gloves and other accessories at the same time,” CEO Perry told TechCrunch. “We get them to see what things can go together with what you sell. For example, you sell makeup, but not brushes, so you could add them to your store without having to purchase them for your inventory.”</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R87rWdfRDkQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Goldberg noted that Carro got started when influencer marketing was a relatively new term and people had large followings, but not an easy way to get connected to brands. That has now changed: the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1092819/global-influencer-market-size/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global influencer marketing market</a> has more than doubled since 2019 and is poised to be valued at $13.8 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>That growth impacted Carro, too. It grew by over 500% in the last year, Perry said. To meet that demand, the company closed on $20 million of Series B funding. It was led by Alpha Edison, which was joined by PayPal Ventures, GC1 Ventures, Corazon Capital and a group of individuals who use Carro.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nate Redmond, managing partner at Alpha Edison, said in a written statement that the company “presents a compelling new way for brands to grow, by building direct relationships with customers without spending all of their profits on online advertising. We’ve been impressed with the pace at which the Carro team innovates and utilizes deep customer insights to deliver optimal results for customers.”</p>
<p>The new funding gives Carro $30 million in total funding to date. It will be used to grow Carro’s team of 50 employees, product development and network expansion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company has more than 1 million products in its network and sees 320 million visitors a month. In the past 12 months, over $10 billion was sold by brands through Carro.</p>
<p>“One thing that makes us happy is that when a smaller merchant, who was packing orders in their garage, joins Carro. They get really busy and can supercharge their business without having to save up tons of money for Facebook ads,” Goldberg said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cortex.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cortex</a>, a startup that helps engineering teams get improved visibility into the Rube Goldberg machine that is their microservices architecture and improve their overall development practices around it, today announced that it has raised a $15 million Series A funding round led by Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital, which led the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/cortex-snags-2-25m-seed-to-build-services-catalog-for-development-teams/">$2.5 million seed round</a>. A number of angel investors, including Gokul Rajaram, Snyk CEO Peter McKay and Front co-founder and CEO Mathilde Collin, also participated in this round.</p>
<p>Current customers include the likes of Grammarly, 8&#215;8 and Rappi. Cortex says it experienced 10x customer growth since its launch in May 2021 (though we&#8217;re probably talking about a relatively low baseline here).</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s mission is to build a system of record for engineering teams &#8212; or at least those that adopt modern development practices. It&#8217;s this services catalog that&#8217;s at the heart of what Cortex does and it was also the first product the team launched. Now it is starting to build out its features around this catalog.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235756" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We very quickly realized that once you have all these microservices being tracked in this catalog, you can do some interesting things there,&#8221; Cortex co-founder and CTO Ganesh Datta said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235762" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-9.49.50-AM.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235762" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2235762" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-9.49.50-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="505" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-9.49.50-AM.png 2874w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-9.49.50-AM.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-9.49.50-AM.png?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-9.49.50-AM.png?resize=768,379 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-9.49.50-AM.png?resize=680,336 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-9.49.50-AM.png?resize=1536,758 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-9.49.50-AM.png?resize=2048,1010 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-9.49.50-AM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2235762" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cortex</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Engineering leaders have very limited visibility into which teams are performing well or need additional resources across critical initiatives and reliability, security and just overall adoption of best practices,&#8221; said Cortex co-founder and CEO Anish Dhar. &#8220;On the other hand, you see teams like SRE, security and platform, who are still stuck using Excel spreadsheets, tracking hundreds, sometimes thousands of services across several teams. How do you actually align these teams and drive consistency?&#8221;</p>
<p>The goal here is to give engineering leaders insights into the quality of their services, but also to help the engineers themselves understand what services are available and what their status is.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That means a team can use Cortex to define its production readiness, for example, by setting up a checklist of criteria a service needs to meet before it&#8217;s ready to be pushed live (this could include a dashboard, alerting, on-call rotations, etc.). All of this is done using the company&#8217;s Cortex Query Language (CQL).</p>
<p>Cortex pulls in data from about 30 commonly used tools like GitHub, Bitbucket, Datadog, GitLab, Jira, SignalFX and your Kubernetes clusters.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s really impressive about Cortex is it works from both top-down as well as bottom-up,&#8221; Sequoia partner and Cortex board member Bogomil Balkansky explained. &#8220;It has a very strong value proposition for both engineering leaders and engineering executives in the sense of giving them a great framework for how to set expectations and standards across organizations &#8212; and how to say, &#8216;hey, every service in our organization needs to do X, Y and Z, needs to be upgraded to the latest version Node.js, needs to have these and these things &#8212; and then being able to track what percentage complies with all we call expectations. But it also helps individual engineers and individual teams keep track of their own work.&#8221;</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s announcement, the company is also launching its Service Creation tool, which gives developers a basic scaffold for new services based on their own templates. In a way, that&#8217;s a logical next step for the company. There&#8217;s no better way to help teams improve the consistency of their microservices practices than by automating them, after all.</p>
<p>Also new with today&#8217;s release are new teams features to help improve cross-team collaboration and developer onboarding.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Salesforce did for sales, Marketo did for marketing and ServiceNow did for IT, Cortex now does for engineering,&#8221; said John Curtius, partner at Tiger Global. &#8220;Cortex helps teams set best practices and guidelines for development, making it easy for engineering, SRE, security and DevOps to work together to create higher quality services. Cortex orchestrates a culture change where engineering organizations become proactive in their approach to software quality and are resilient to the inevitable and constant changes that come with building software.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The UK government has named five projects that have scored public funding under a &#8216;tech safety&#8217; challenged announced in September &#8212; when the Home Office said it wanted to encourage the tech industry and academia to develop novel AI/scanning technologies that could be implemented on end-to-end encrypted (e2ee) services to detect child sexual abuse material [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-funds-new-tech-in-the-fight-against-online-child-abuse">UK government</a> has named five projects that have scored public funding under a &#8216;tech safety&#8217; challenged announced in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/uk-offers-cash-for-csam-detection-tech-targeted-at-e2e-encryption/">September</a> &#8212; when the Home Office said it wanted to encourage the tech industry and academia to develop novel AI/scanning technologies that could be implemented on end-to-end encrypted (e2ee) services to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM).</p>
<p>A number of mainstream messaging services already use e2ee such as Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Apple&#8217;s iMessage.</p>
<p>The Home Office has claimed it&#8217;s looking for a middle ground that doesn&#8217;t require digital service providers to abandon the use of end-to-end encryption but will still allow for CSAM material to be detected and passed to law enforcement, also without the security being backdoored. At least that&#8217;s the claim.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236394" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Safety Tech Challenge Fund is being administered by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) &#8212; and following the announcement of the funding awards yesterday, digital minister, Chris Philp, said in a statement: &#8220;It’s entirely possible for social media platforms to use end-to-end encryption without hampering efforts to stamp out child abuse. But they’ve failed to take action to address this problem so we are stepping in to help develop the solutions needed. It is not acceptable to deploy E2EE without ensuring that enforcement and child protection measures are still in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>The five projects which have been awarded an initial £85,000 apiece by the UK government &#8212; with a further £130k potentially available to be divided up between the &#8220;strongest&#8221; projects (bringing the total funding pot up to £555k) &#8212; are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edinburgh-based digital forensics firm <a href="https://cyanforensics.com/">Cyan Forensics</a> and real-time risk intelligence focused <a href="https://www.crispthinking.com/">Crisp Thinking</a>, in partnership with the University of Edinburgh and the not-for-profit <a href="https://www.iwf.org.uk/">Internet Watch Foundation</a>, which will develop a plug-in to be integrated within encrypted social platforms to &#8220;detect CSAM by matching content against known illegal material&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/26/safetonet-demos-anti-sexting-child-safety-tool/">Parental control app maker</a> <a href="https://safetonet.com/">SafeToNet</a> and Anglia Ruskin University which will develop a suite of live video-moderation AI technologies that can run on any smart device &#8212; and are intended to &#8220;prevent the filming of nudity, violence, pornography and CSAM in real-time, as it is being produced&#8221;</li>
<li>Enterprise security firm <a href="https://www.galaxkey.com/">GalaxKey</a>, based in St Albans, which will work with Poole-based content moderation software maker <a href="https://www.image-analyzer.com/">Image Analyser</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/yoti/">digital identity</a> and age assurance firm <a href="https://www.yoti.com/">Yoti</a> to &#8220;develop software focusing on user privacy, detection and prevention of CSAM and predatory behavior, and age verification to detect child sexual abuse before it reaches an E2EE environment, preventing it from being uploaded and shared&#8221;</li>
<li>Content moderation startup <a href="https://www.dragonflai.co.uk/">DragonflAI</a>, based in Edinburgh, which will also work with <a href="https://www.yoti.com/">Yoti</a> to combine its on-device nudity AI detection tech with the latter&#8217;s age assurance technologies &#8212; in order to &#8220;spot new indecent images within E2EE environments&#8221;</li>
<li>Austria-based digital forensics firm <a href="https://www.t3k.ai/en/">T3K-Forensics</a> has also won UK government funding to implement its AI-based child sexual abuse detection technology on smartphones to detect newly created material &#8212; providing what the government bills as &#8220;a toolkit that social platforms can integrate with their E2EE services&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>The winning projects will be evaluated at the end of a five month delivery phase by an external evaluator &#8212; which the government said will look at success criteria including &#8220;commercial viability to determine deployability into the market, and long term impact&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, DCMS and the Home Office also touted the forthcoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">Online Safety Bill </a>&#8212; which they claimed will transform how illegal and harmful online content is dealt with by placing a new duty of care on social media and other tech companies towards their UK users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This will mean there will be less illegal content such as child sexual abuse and exploitation online and when it does appear it will be removed quicker. The duty of care will still apply to companies that choose to use end-to-end encryption,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>Prior guidance put out by DCMS <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/uk-tells-messaging-apps-not-to-use-e2e-encryption-for-kids-accounts/">this summer</a> urged social media and messaging firms to &#8220;prevent&#8221; the use of e2e encryption on child accounts. So the government appears to be evolving its approach (or its messaging) &#8212; and banking on embedded CSAM detection tools being baked into e2e encryption and able to carry out content detection.</p>
<p>Assuming, of course, any of the aforementioned projects delivers the claimed CSAM detection/prevention functionality at acceptable levels of accuracy (i.e. avoiding any ruinous false positives).</p>
<p>Another salient point is the question of whether the novel AI/scanning techs could result in vulnerabilities or even backdoors being baked into e2e encrypted systems &#8212; thereby undermining everyone&#8217;s security.</p>
<p>There is also the question of whether UK citizens will be happy with state-mandated scanning of their electronic devices &#8212; given all the privacy and liberty issues that entails.</p>
<p>While the UK public has generally been happy to get behind the notion of improving online child safety it might be rather less happy to discover that means blanket device scanning &#8212; especially if novel technologies end up sending alerts to law enforcement about people&#8217;s innocent holiday/bath-time snaps.</p>
<p>The political backlash around misfiring &#8216;safety&#8217; tech could be swift and substantial.</p>
<p>iPhone maker Apple put the rollout of its own on-device CSAM scanning tech &#8212; &#8216;NeuralHash&#8217; &#8212; on hold <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/apple-csam-detection-delayed/">this fall</a> after a privacy backlash.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Travel and tourism, two of the hardest-hit industries in the Covid-19 pandemic, are slowly starting to show some signs of recovery. Now, <a href="https://www.otainsight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OTA Insight</a> &#8212; a company that builds business intelligence tools for one of the key sectors in that space, hotels &#8212; is announcing a round of funding as it too picks up more business on the upswing.</p>
<p>The company has raised $80 million, a Series B led by Spectrum Equity, with previous backers Eight Roads, F-Prime Capital and Highgate Technology Ventures also participating. OTA Insight is not disclosing its valuation, but for some idea of its size and operation, it&#8217;s used today by some 55,000 properties; and it has been profitable for years already, including through the pandemic. Founded in 2015, prior to this, OTA Insight had only raised $20 million.</p>
<p>The plan will be to now use this injection of cash to drive more business in what is still a very untapped market, said CEO Sean Fitzpatrick.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236375" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;One of the unique things about the hotel and hospitality industry is that generally tech providers focus a lot of their energy on the larger chains, because that&#8217;s where they believe the opportunity is,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But if you look at the addressable market, there are over a million hotel properties, while there&#8217;s only about 70,000 chain properties&#8230; We have a really good spread between independent family run businesses all the way up to the global chains.&#8221;</p>
<p>As big data analytics continues to mature as a discipline, and different sectors become increasingly digitally savvy, we have seen a number of startups emerge with tools catering to specific verticals, company sizes and use cases. (Just earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/14/pigment-series-b-business-planning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pigment</a> &#8212; which provides better forecasting tools to finance teams that have been muddling through with Excel &#8212; raised $73 million.)</p>
<p>In the case of OTA Insight, its opportunity is to tap into a group of users &#8212; hoteliers &#8212; that not only are under new kinds of pressure in terms of the business climate, but have been shifting to, and are now willing to invest in more, digital tools to help them weather that new climate in a better way.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see this amazing opportunity, because even though the headlines [for travel] are not great in terms of just the the trajectory of the pandemic, I think over the three to five year horizon, people are really optimistic about travel rebounding, about people&#8217;s desire to get out there and have experiences again,&#8221; Fitzpatrick said. &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing really significant inbound interest in terms of investment in hospitality technology, but we&#8217;re seeing hotels also really evaluate their own tech stacks, looking for opportunities to maybe do things differently. Things have changed pretty profoundly in the industry, so that&#8217;s presenting a very significant opportunity.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The gap between the interactions that hotels have with their users, and what they understand about those users&#8217; intents is pretty huge. One one side, they check them in, provide them a place to sleep for the night, and potentially lots of other services. On the other, they generally don&#8217;t have a lot of visibility into what those users want, or have been searching for online, which sometimes results in a booking with their hotel, and sometimes does not. Direct experience of that was, in fact, some of what drove the founders to start the company: planning a trip to London from Belgium for the Olympics in 2012, Gino Engels and his friends couldn&#8217;t find any hotel rooms that weren&#8217;t painfully expensive. And yet after they arrived they could see that a lot of hotels had spaces and were drastically dropping prices. They saw that there had to be a better way of managing that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">OTA Insight today provides various business analytics and BI tools to hotel operators &#8212; variously called Market Insight, Rate Insight, Revenue Insight and Parity Insight &#8212; to help them figure out how to price and manage room availability, which can in turn be used for their own direct sales, and to manage sales through third-party channels. For now, the company doesn&#8217;t resell its tech through aggregators like Booking.com or Airbnb, although you might imagine that one day that could also become an opportunity to expand business, as those platforms also look for better ways to serve their hotel customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Part of the Series B will be used to continue investing in OTA Insight&#8217;s technology stack. </span></p>
<p>“We are very excited about the response from our customers to our latest products and innovations,” said Gino Engels, OTA Insight&#8217;s co-founder and CCO. “With this investment we will accelerate our expansion across all regions in 2022 but particularly in the Americas, where we have seen an incredible recovery.”</p>
<p>Steve LeSieur, an MD at Spectrum Equity who is joining the board with this round, said that bigger market potential is one big reason his firm invested now.</p>
<p>“OTA Insight is at the forefront of delivering real-time insights and broader commercial decision support to an industry that is quickly adopting dynamic intelligence to remain competitive and optimize performance,&#8221; he said in a statement to TechCrunch. &#8220;We’ve been impressed by OTA’s growth over the last several years, including during the pandemic, resulting in a very strategic customer footprint across the global hotel market. We think the business is very well positioned and just getting started.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/15/spotify-is-falling-behind-on-lyrics-and-voice/">years</a> of <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?advanced=false&amp;allow_punctuation=false&amp;q=lyrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ignoring</a> consumer demand for in-app lyrics, particularly in the U.S., Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-18/you-can-now-find-the-lyrics-to-your-favorite-songs-in-spotify-heres-how/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today it will make a new Lyrics feature available to all global users, both Free and Premium, across platforms. The feature is powered by lyrics provider <a href="https://www.musixmatch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Musixmatch</a>, and expands on a prior deal Spotify had with the company to offer lyrics to users in India, Latin America and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Last year, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/in-a-significant-expansion-spotify-to-launch-real-time-lyrics-in-26-markets/">introduced</a> real-time lyrics that sync to the music to users in 26 worldwide markets, after initially testing the feature in 2019. This was the first time 22 of the 26 markets had ever gained any form of lyrics support, the company said at the time. That deal later expanded to 28 markets. Spotify users in Japan have also had access to lyrics through a standalone deal with <a href="https://syncpower.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SyncPower</a>.</p>
<p>But users in other markets have only had access to &#8220;Behind the Lyrics,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/12/spotify-teams-with-genius-to-annotate-music-tracks/">a feature launched in 2016</a> in partnership with Genius which offered lyrics interspersed with trivia about the song, its meaning, the artist and other commentary. Meanwhile, through<a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?advanced=false&amp;allow_punctuation=false&amp;q=lyrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Spotify&#8217;s community feedback forum</a>, thousands of users over the years expressed to the company they would prefer a feature that provided real-time lyrics, instead of lyrics that are interrupted with facts and other background information.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236074" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Those users will now get their wish.</p>
<p>Spotify confirmed to TechCrunch it will be sunsetting &#8220;Behind the Lyrics&#8221; to make way for the new Lyrics feature.</p>
<p>Lyrics will be available across platforms from the &#8220;Now Playing&#8221; view or bar, depending on the platform.</p>
<p>On mobile, users can swipe up from the &#8220;Now Playing&#8221; screen to see the track&#8217;s lyrics scroll by in real time as the song is playing. On the desktop app, you can click the microphone icon from the &#8220;Now Playing&#8221; bar instead. And on the Spotify TV app, you&#8217;ll navigate to the top-right corner of the &#8220;Now Playing&#8221; view to enable Lyrics from the lyrics button.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company says the feature will be available on the big screen via its app for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Samsung, Roku, LG, Sky and Comcast.</p>
<p>The new feature also offers built-in sharing from an included button on the bottom of the screen on mobile, which allows users to select the lyrics they want to share and the destination.</p>
<p>There is no difference in the Lyrics experience for Free or Premium users, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>Real-time lyrics on music apps have had a complicated history. When lyrics aren&#8217;t provided by music publishers, companies turn to a third-party provider. But those providers don&#8217;t always play fair. Google, for example, was accused by Genius in 2019 for plagiarizing its lyrics collection, which Genius tracked by cleverly embedding secret codes into its lyrics <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2019/06/17/genius-lyrics-google-red-handed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to spell out &#8220;red-handed</a>.&#8221; Those lyrics later appeared in Google.com search results. But Google said <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2019/06/19/google-plagiarizing-lyrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the blame</a> was with its partner, LyricFind. It didn&#8217;t drop its partnership, as there are few alternatives for major lyrics deals &#8212; the companies tend to work with either Genius, LyricFind or Musixmatch (or a combination).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it made headlines when Apple in 2018 <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/11/genius-apple-music/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a partnership with Genius for lyrics across thousands of its top songs, and two years later <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-music-lyrics-smarten-up-with-genius-1539266407" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became the exclusive web player</a> for Genius. Among other services, Pandora says it <a href="https://help.pandora.com/s/article/Add-Album-Art-Biography-and-Lyrics-to-your-Station-1519949294867?language=en_US#lyrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">works</a> with LyricFind and Amazon works with both LyricFind and Musixmatch,<a href="https://artists.amazonmusic.com/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> its website states</a>.</p>
<p>With this expansion, Lyrics will now be available in all markets where Spotify is offered, eliminating one of the big competitive advantages these rivals have over Spotify.</p>
<p>The company says Lyrics will begin rolling out globally starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A week ago, we were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/home-star-trucker/">discussing</a> iRobot’s smart home ambitions as they pertain to the company’s work with Amazon. The company has been highlighted these plans bit by bit over the past couple of years, in the hopes of unlocking Roomba’s potential as a kind of smart home missing link.</p>
<p>Today the company takes a bit of a surprising next step, with the acquisition of Aeris Cleantec AG, a Swiss company best known for its HEPA air purifiers. Certainly the acquisition comports with the company’s core focus of cleaning the home, nearly 20 years after the introduction of its first robotic vacuum.</p>
<p>“Today’s acquisition of Aeris is an important step in iRobot’s strategy to expand our total addressable market and diversify our product portfolio in ways that will provide consumers with new ways to keep their homes cleaner and healthier,&#8221; CEO Colin Angle said in a release. “We are enthusiastic about the growth potential for Aeris’ products, especially as the pandemic has raised greater consumer awareness of the value of maintaining a cleaner, healthier home. We are also excited about the potential to leverage our Genius Home Intelligence platform and existing ecosystem of home robots to bring the iRobot experience to air purification.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235304" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We&#8217;re launching a robotics newsletter! Please sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">to get Actuator in your inbox</a> as soon as the first issue hits! For free!</em></p>
<hr />
<p>It’s worth noting, as we did last week, that most of iRobot’s successful non-Roomba lines have derived from acquisitions, including Braava and Root, which were purchased by the company in 2012 and 2019, respectively.</p>
<p>Air purification is undoubtedly a topic that’s been at top of mind over the past two years, courtesy of the pandemic. Though, even prior to this, the category was booming, with the advent of things like connected smart home filters. Aeris’ flagship products the Lite and 3-in-1 Pro both offer a connected smartphone app for monitoring device health, as well as controlling multiple connected machines.</p>
<p>That last bit likely provides a glimpse into iRobot’s bigger plans. Without its own smart speaker, the company is almost certainly looking for some manner of smart home device that can serve as a connected beacon. That’s something that could potentially &#8212; albeit expensively &#8212; be served by air purifiers. Perhaps down the road we might also see Aeris’ purification technology built into Roomba docking stations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The deal has already closed, according to iRobot, with the company paying $72 million in cash for Aeris. &#8220;In addition to this initial cash consideration,&#8221; the company notes, &#8220;the deal has a provision to pay a modest performance-based earn-out should Aeris achieve certain targets next year.&#8221;</p>
