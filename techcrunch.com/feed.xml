										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey and rapper Jay Z have created an endowment to fund bitcoin development initially in Africa and India, Dorsey said Friday.</p>
<p>The duo is <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1360114881978982403">putting 500 bitcoin</a>, which is currently worth $23.6 million, in the endowment called ₿trust. The fund will be set up as a blind irrevocable trust, Dorsey said, adding that the duo won’t be giving any direction to the team.</p>
<p>₿trust is looking to hire three board members. The mission of the fund is to “make bitcoin the internet&#8217;s currency,” a job application describes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Government in India has so far been reluctant to embrace bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Friday’s move comes as New Delhi is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies/">inching closer to introduce a law that would ban private cryptocurrencies</a> in the nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though India is the software development capital of the world, we haven&#8217;t contributed to bitcoin core development in any significant way,&#8221; explained Varun Deshpande, co-founder of <a href="https://onjuno.com/">OnJuno</a>, which is building a digital banking platform from India for Asian Americans, to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;India always had the skills to contribute but lacked the right incentives. Today&#8217;s initiative is even more significant since it provides the right incentives for developers from the world&#8217;s largest democracy to contribute and have a say in bitcoin&#8217;s protocol development and bring in a diversity of thoughts in shaping the future of money. The irony is as India prepares a bill to ban bitcoin in India, the world is turning to our massive technical talent in India to secure and safeguard the bitcoin network.&#8221;</p>
<p>Africa, most especially Nigeria, on the other hand, has experienced a surge in cryptocurrency transactions in recent years. Last year, Nigerians traded more than $500 million worth of cryptocurrency on major local crypto exchanges, and the country is <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1947769/nigeria-is-the-second-largest-bitcoin-market-after-the-us/">only second to the US</a> in terms of volume of bitcoin traded in the last five years.</p>
<p>Africans that trade cryptocurrencies rely on them because they offer protection against currency devaluation and for value exchange during cross-border transactions. In Nigeria, bitcoin trading became ubiquitous last year during the #EndSARS protests that rocked the country. When donations for the protests began to flow from all parts of the country and in the diaspora, the government shut down the bank accounts used for this effort. But bitcoin became a lifeline keeping the crowdfunding activities alive.</p>
<p>Since then, there have been growing concerns that the government had intentions to regulate cryptocurrency in the country. Last week, those doubts were actualized as the country&#8217;s apex bank gave a directive to banks and financial institutions from dealing in cryptocurrency or facilitating payments for cryptocurrency exchange platforms.</p>
<p>Dorsey has long supported the adoption of cryptocurrency. Square <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/square-cash-expands-bitcoin-buying-and-selling-to-all-users/">already supports bitcoin</a> and last year <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/2020-bitcoin-investment">acquired about $50 million worth of bitcoin</a> for its corporate treasury, and Twitter is studying the potential use of bitcoin to pay its employees and vendors.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1359501275650547714?s=20">CNBC earlier this week</a>, Twitter Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said, “We’ve done a lot of the upfront thinking to consider how we might pay employees should they ask to be paid in bitcoin, how we might pay a vendor if they ask to be [paid] in bitcoin and whether we need to have bitcoin on our balance sheet should that happen. It’s something we continue to study and look at, we want to be thoughtful about over time, but we haven’t made any changes yet.”</p>
<p>Many high-profile industry executives have called for nations to embrace bitcoin. Balaji Srinivasan, an angel investor and entrepreneur who previously served as the Chief Technology Officer of Coinbase, earlier this month made a case for <a href="https://balajis.com/why-india-should-buy-bitcoin/">why India should embrace bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>“India has the talent to pull this off. Such a move would make international headlines, attract global support from the world&#8217;s technologists and financiers, differentiate India from the increasingly zero-sum economic policies pushed by America and China, and put the country at the forefront of a trillion dollar industry,” he wrote, envisioning the potential unblocking bitcoin would create for India.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Kenya said this week that it will use bitcoin as a reserve currency amid the Kenyan Shilling volatility against the dollar. Last year, the country was only second to Nigeria in bitcoin trading in Africa. Dorsey&#8217;s plan is a follow up on his visit to the continent in 2019 when amid meeting with key political and tech stakeholders, made a startling reference to the continent&#8217;s budding cryptocurrency usage. “Africa will define the future (especially the bitcoin one!),” he said at the time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sweden&#8217;s data protection authority, the IMY, has fined the local police authority €250,000 ($300k+) for unlawful use of the controversial facial recognition software, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/clearview-ai/">Clearview AI</a>, in breach of the country&#8217;s Criminal Data Act.</p>
<p>As part of the enforcement the police must conduct further training and education of staff in order to avoid any future processing of personal data in breach of data protection rules and regulations.</p>
<p>The authority has also been ordered to inform people whose personal data was sent to Clearview &#8212; when confidentiality rules allow it to do so, per the IMY.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its investigation found that the police had used the facial recognition tool on a number of occasions and that several employees had used it without prior authorization.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">Earlier this month</a> Canadian privacy authorities found Clearview had breached local laws when it collected photos of people to plug into its facial recognition database without their knowledge or permission.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7VFRk9VAsl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">Clearview AI ruled &#8216;illegal&#8217; by Canadian privacy authorities</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clearview AI ruled &#8216;illegal&#8217; by Canadian privacy authorities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/embed/#?secret=7VFRk9VAsl" data-secret="7VFRk9VAsl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;IMY concludes that the Police has not fulfilled its obligations as a data controller on a number of accounts with regards to the use of Clearview AI. The Police has failed to implement sufficient organisational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing of personal data in this case has been carried out in compliance with the Criminal Data Act. When using Clearview AI the Police has unlawfully processed biometric data for facial recognition as well as having failed to conduct a data protection impact assessment which this case of processing would require,&#8221; the Swedish data protection authority writes in a <a href="https://www.imy.se/nyheter/police-unlawfully-used-facial-recognition-app/">press release</a>.</p>
<p>The IMY&#8217;s full decision can be found <a href="https://www.imy.se/globalassets/dokument/beslut/beslut-tillsyn-polismyndigheten-cvai.pdf">here</a> (in Swedish).</p>
<p>&#8220;There are clearly defined rules and regulations on how the Police Authority may process personal data, especially for law enforcement purposes. It is the responsibility of the Police to ensure that employees are aware of those rules,&#8221; added Elena Mazzotti Pallard, legal advisor at IMY, in a statement.</p>
<p>The fine (SEK2.5M in local currency) was decided on the basis of an overall assessment, per the IMY, though it falls quite a way short of the maximum possible under Swedish law for the violations in question &#8212; which the watchdog notes would be SEK10M. (The authority&#8217;s decision notes that not knowing the rules or having inadequate procedures in place are not a reason to reduce a penalty fee so it&#8217;s not entirely clear why the police avoided a bigger fine.)</p>
<p>The data authority said it was not possible to determine what had happened to the data of the people whose photos the police authority had sent to Clearview &#8212; such as whether the company still stored the information. So it has also ordered the police to take steps to ensure Clearview deletes the data.</p>
<p>The IMY said it investigated the police&#8217;s use of the controversial technology following reports in local media.</p>
<p>Just over a year ago, US-based Clearview AI was revealed by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html">New York Times</a> to have amassed a database of billions of photos of people&#8217;s faces &#8212; including by scraping public social media postings and harvesting people&#8217;s sensitive biometric data without individuals&#8217; knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>European Union data protection law puts a high bar on the processing of special category data, such as biometrics.</p>
<p>Ad hoc use by police of a commercial facial recognition database &#8212; with seemingly zero attention paid to local data protection law &#8212; evidently does not meet that bar.</p>
<p>Last month it emerged that the Hamburg data protection authority had <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2021-01/545_2020_Anhörung_CVAI_ENG_Redacted.PDF">instigating proceedings</a> against Clearview following a complaint by a German resident over consentless processing of his biometric data.</p>
<p>The Hamburg authority cited Article 9 (1) of the GDPR, which prohibits the processing of biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, unless the individual has given explicit consent (or for a number of other narrow exceptions which it said had not been met) &#8212; thereby finding Clearview&#8217;s processing unlawful.</p>
<p>However the German authority only made a narrow order for the deletion of the individual complainant&#8217;s mathematical hash values (which represent the biometric profile).</p>
<p>It did not order deletion of the photos themselves. It also did not issue a pan-EU order banning the collection of any European resident’s photos as it could have done and as European privacy campaign group, <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/clearview-ai-deemed-illegal-eu">noyb</a>, had been pushing for.</p>
<p>noyb is encouraging all EU residents to use <a href="https://clearview.ai/privacy/requests">forms on Clearview AI&#8217;s website</a> to ask the company for a copy of their data and ask it to delete any data it has on them, as well as to object to being included in its database. It also recommends that individuals who finds Clearview holds their data submit a complaint against the company with their local DPA.</p>
<p>European Union lawmakers are in the process of drawing up a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais/">risk-based framework to regulate applications of artificial intelligence</a> &#8212; with draft legislation expected to be put forward this year although the Commission intends it to work in concert with data protections already baked into the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">Earlier this month</a> the controversial facial recognition company was ruled illegal by Canadian privacy authorities &#8212; who warned they would “pursue other actions” if the company does not follow recommendations that include stopping the collection of Canadians&#8217; data and deleting all previously collected images.</p>
<p>Clearview said it had stopped providing its tech to Canadian customers last summer.</p>
<p>It is also facing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/clearview-facial-recognition-private-companies/">a class action lawsuit</a> in the U.S. citing Illinois’ biometric protection laws.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-clearview-ai-investigation-idUSKBN24A110">Last summer</a> the UK and Australian data protection watchdogs announced a joint investigation into Clearview&#8217;s personal data handling practices. That probe is ongoing.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> were all here to chat through the week’s biggest tech happenings. This week felt oddly comforting from a tech news perspective: Facebook is copying something, early-stage startup data is flawed enough to talk about and sweet DoorDash is buying robots for undisclosed sums.</p>
<p>So, here&#8217;s a rundown of the tech news we got into (as always, jokes aren&#8217;t previewed so you&#8217;ll have to listen to the actual show to get our critique and Award Winning Analysis*):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/ethena-which-sends-bite-sized-nudges-for-compliance-training-shifts-its-focus-amid-new-capital/">Ethena raising $2 million more</a> for corporate training that is not awful, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/zeta-joint-card-seed/">Zeta raising $1.5 million for couples&#8217; banking</a>. Natasha has been killing the early-stage beat lately.</li>
<li>How seed data could be getting harder and harder to parse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/are-safes-obscuring-todays-seed-volume/">from Alex&#8217;s desk</a>, and why VC data in general is dicey, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/psa-most-aggregate-vc-trend-data-is-garbage/">from Danny&#8217;s</a>. We discuss if directional data is useful, and why the limited numbers could have a cultural impact on signal.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/reddit-raises-250-million-in-series-e-funding/">Reddit raises $250 million</a>, but doesn&#8217;t tell us who the investors are and what the money is precisely going to. Still, the company has had quite a year so far, so the capital comes at an interesting time.</li>
<li>Justo, an online grocery based in Mexico, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/mexican-online-grocer-justo-raises-65m-in-general-atlantic-led-series-a/">raises $65 million</a> as the pandemic continues to shake up the way we live and shop.</li>
<li>DoorDash <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/doordash-acquires-salad-making-robotics-startup-chowbotics/">buys a salad robot</a>, which brings Natasha nostalgia and Danny anger.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/softbank-and-the-late-stage-venture-capital-j-curve/">inverted SoftBank J-Curve </a>thesis is a must-listen and read.</li>
<li>And from the world of dating, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/match-hyperconnect-acquisition/">big M&amp;A deal that caught our attention</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/bumble-prices-ipo-at-43-per-share/">the latest from the Bumble IPO</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In good news, long-time Equity producer Chris Gates is back starting next week, which means we&#8217;ll have our biggest crew ever helping get the show put together. And, in other good news, there&#8217;s going to be more Equity than ever for you to hear. Coming soon.</p>
<p><i>Equity drops every Monday at 7:00 a.m. PST and Thursday afternoon as fast as we can get it out, so subscribe to us on </i><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1215439780"><i>Apple Podcasts</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1215439780/equity"><i>Overcast</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=rZDFHv2sQUul_g94iCRgpQ"><i>Spotify</i></a><i> and all the casts.</i></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The world has spent most of 2020 adapting to ever-changing guidelines and restrictions (with no end in sight, even as the vaccines start to roll out). Board meetings are quickly increasing in their significance to foster consistent and vital interactions as an organization. It’s essential for companies to capitalize on the essential time together during these uncertain times.</p>
<p>While we might look like the Brady Bunch while sharing a Zoom window, are you actually communicating more like the family from &#8220;Succession?&#8221;</p>
<p>Are your meetings organized? Do people talk over one another? Do you usually run over time? Are you giving people time to digest information?</p>
<p>As we move into 2021 and Q1 meetings are being put onto calendars, take some time to modernize how you conduct your board meetings.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Board meetings are quickly increasing in their significance to foster consistent and vital interactions as an organization.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Having served on public company boards, growth-stage businesses and Series A startups, an observation I have made in boards that are later stage are more about financial analysis and governance. Whereas earlier-stage board discussions hinge more on product strategy, key partnerships, sharing best practices to help develop founders as executives and important hiring decisions.</p>
<p>Since the nature of the discussions is more, let&#8217;s call it … creative in earlier-stage businesses, where the focus is on where they’ve been particularly impacted by reduced bandwidth for collaboration while meeting remotely.</p>
<p>As said best by <a href="https://firstround.com/review/The-Secret-to-Making-Board-Meetings-Suck-Less/">Mike Maples and paraphrased by Jeff Bonforte</a> — there are only four things a board really needs to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has the market changed since we last met? If so, did it affect us negatively or positively?</li>
<li>Has the team changed? For better or worse?</li>
<li>Has our position in the market changed?</li>
<li>Can we do what we said we would?</li>
</ul>
<p>Collecting data around those points is the job. In the meeting, the team can add color.</p>
<p>Remember the board works for you, so be sure to put them to work. Sharing materials with participants about three days ahead of time tends to be the best. Any later and they may not get enough time to digest, send earlier and the information might be out of date by the time you meet. It’s most common to format as a deck, but lately I’m seeing more written format and even magazine-style.</p>
<p>The number one request I get from early-stage companies is “help find me more customers.”</p>
<p>Other common requests are “help me find or land this type of talent, help me with industry benchmarks for this type of business deal or compensation structure, connect me to people that have experience with X so I can learn ways we could structure our process.” It’s helpful to put these asks in the materials you send ahead because sometimes board members might not be able to react quickly and now “homework” comes up spontaneously in the discussions.</p>
<p>Another purpose of these meetings is to build working relationships so when strategic decisions need to be made, board members are used to working together. Sometimes it is a forum for executives to gain exposure to board members and for board members to have the opportunity to evaluate and provide input on executives. For that reason execs are often invited to participate in certain discussions.</p>
<p>Like the product person who presents a roadmap or a market analysis, the head of sales should give color on pipeline and competitive deals, the marketing person may lead a discussion on ABM or channel marketing tactics, the engineering lead might ask for feedback on their metrics versus other companies, etc. Generally, CEOs also bring forth an interesting topic to have a discussion, such as channel strategy, market mapping/sizing, hiring plan and related issues.</p>
<h2>Logistics</h2>
<p>As far as logistics, we reserve two hours in calendars but we try to hit 90 minutes. I suggest something like this for a 90-minute session:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

This time we&#8217;re digging into Techstars&#8217; latest three accelerator classes.</p>
<p>What follows are four favorites from the Techstars&#8217; <a href="https://demoday.techstars.com/boston-2020-t6">Boston</a>, <a href="https://demoday.techstars.com/chicago-2020-t6">Chicago</a> and &#8220;<a href="https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/announcing-the-2020-class-of-the-techstars-workforce-development-accelerator">workforce development</a>&#8221; programs.

<p>As always, these are just our favorites, but don&#8217;t just take our word for it. Dig into the pitches yourself, as there&#8217;s never a bad time to check out some super-early-stage startups.</p>
<h2>Four favs from Techstars Boston</h2>
<h3><a href="https://everydaylifeinsurance.com/"><strong>Everyday Life</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What:</strong> A platform that wants to make life insurance flexible and personalized.</li>
<li><strong>Why we like it:</strong> The insurtech wave, from auto insurance to home insurance, has underscored the need for more consumer-friendly plans. Life insurance still feels like an untapped part of the equation, and Everyday Life wants to use technology to make the process cheaper and simpler.<br />
The founding team says that there’s solid interest in life insurance amid the coronavirus pandemic, which amounts to a $20 billion market opportunity.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8220;Before Navalny’s return, Russian TikTok was all about dancing, pranks and post-Soviet trash aesthetics,&#8221; said food blogger Egor Khodasevich. &#8220;All of a sudden, political videos have started to appear across all categories — humor, beauty, sport.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is expanding its integrations with third-party services, with the launch of a test that allows creators in the food space to link directly to recipes found on the Whisk app. This is being made possible by way of a new &#8220;recipe&#8221; button overlaid on related TikTok food videos. The feature makes a TikTok cooking video more actionable as it encourages viewers to not just watch the content, but also take the next step to save the content for later use.</p>
<p>The new button could also potentially drive significant traffic to Whisk &#8212; especially if a particular recipe went viral &#8212; like the<a href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/02/is-this-viral-tiktok-pasta-actually-good.html"> &#8220;TikTok Pasta&#8221;</a> videos have in recent days.</p>
<p>The addition is being made available in partnership with Whisk and is currently in &#8220;alpha testing,&#8221; TikTok confirmed to TechCrunch. TikTok says it has also worked with Whisk to help identify food content creators who could serve as the first adopters of the new functionality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We found the feature in action on one of TikTok&#8217;s top food creators&#8217; profiles, <a href="https://thekoreanvegan.com/">The Korean Vegan</a>, aka Joanne L. Molinaro.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2112340" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2112340" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2112340" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_8035.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_8035.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_8035.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_8035.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_8035.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_8035.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_8035.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_8035.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_8035.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2112340" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>The button was also first spotted by social media consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra">Matt Navarra</a> on the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@feelgoodfoodie?lang=en">@feelgoodfoodie</a> TikTok account.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">New? TikTok’s got a recipe card feature via an integration with <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiskTeam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@whiskteam</a> <a href="https://t.co/5C5fOyR8YZ">pic.twitter.com/5C5fOyR8YZ</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1359636421389254657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The way the feature works, from the TikTok viewer&#8217;s side, is fairly simple.</p>
<p>A user who&#8217;s in the test group may come across a video on the app that includes the new button that reads: &#8220;See full recipe.&#8221; The button appears just above the creator name and video description on the bottom left of the screen &#8212; the same spot where the &#8220;Green Screen&#8221; button would otherwise appear. When tapped, you&#8217;re directed to a Whisk page where you can view recipe photos, see ingredients and choose to save the recipe to your own collection, if you&#8217;re a Whisk user.</p>
<p>This all takes place while still inside the TikTok app.</p>
<p>On the creator&#8217;s side, adding the recipe button to a video is done during the posting workflow via a new &#8220;add link&#8221; option.</p>
<p>The ability to add a &#8220;save recipe&#8221; feature to a TikTok video wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have to be limited to food content creators, however. Whisk allows anyone to create a recipe community on its platform, which means people can grow their followings simply by curating their favorite recipes around some sort of category or theme &#8212; like Instant Pot meals or favorite smoothie ideas or comfort baking, for example.</p>

<p>Whisk has also been working more recently to expand its recipe communities to serve as a home for curators and creators alike by allowing them to point to their websites, if they have one, or link out to their social media profiles, including Instagram, YouTube and, of course, TikTok.</p>
<p>The idea is that fans would view the content on social media and be inspired, then visit Whisk as the next step in terms of saving the recipe, creating a shopping list or actually trying the recipe at home. This sort of &#8220;actionable&#8221; content could present a challenge to Pinterest, which has been expanding into short-form video through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/pinterest-story-pins/">Story Pins</a>. The feature allows Pinterest creators to share video content in the tappable &#8220;story&#8221; format &#8212; including recipe and cooking videos.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rSzAWEJryP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/pinterest-story-pins/">Pinterest officially launches new Story Pins format in beta</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pinterest officially launches new Story Pins format in beta&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/pinterest-story-pins/embed/#?secret=rSzAWEJryP" data-secret="rSzAWEJryP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Pinterest hoped to use Story Pins as a way to differentiate its short-form videos from rivals, noting during its <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pinterest-pins-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcript-2021-02-05">earnings</a> last week that Story Pins are &#8220;not as focused on entertainment,&#8221; but rather &#8220;what the Pinner could do to enrich their own lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s selection of Whisk as a new partner makes sense as the recipe app has gained a rapid following since its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/whisks-a-i-powered-recipe-app-lets-you-send-the-ingredients-to-your-door/">late 2019 launch</a>. Today, Whisk sees over 1.5 million interactions per month on its platform. It also just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-plays-best-of-2020-awards-highlight-the-stressful-year-its-been/">won</a> a &#8220;<a href="https://whisk.com/blog/whisk-wins-everyday-essentials-in-google-play-best-of-2020-awards/#:~:text=Whisk%20wins%20%E2%80%9CEveryday%20Essentials%E2%80%9D%20in%20Google%20Play%20Best%20of%202020%20Awards&amp;text=We're%20delighted%20to%20announce,Play%20Best%20of%202020%20Awards.">Best of 2020&#8243; Google Play award</a>.</p>
<p>Whisk&#8217;s TikTok button, however, is not the first integration of its kind.</p>
<p>Last month, learning platform Quizlet <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-quizlet">announced a similar TikTok feature</a> aimed at creators in the education space. In its case, the buttons overlaid on top of videos would link directly to Quizlet&#8217;s study sets, like its digital flashcards. At the time, it wasn&#8217;t clear that the new Quizlet feature was a part of a larger effort to connect TikTok videos more directly with related apps and services &#8212; an addition that could lead to an expansion in TikTok content and, perhaps, influencer sponsorships, further down the road.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s potential for TikTok to form other partnerships like this as well, given the app&#8217;s ability to drive trends across a number of content categories, effectively becoming the video alternative to Pinterest&#8217;s image bookmarking site.</p>
<p>At year-end, for example, <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/the-year-on-tiktok-top-100">TikTok published lists</a> of 2020&#8217;s &#8220;top trends&#8221; in cooking, music, beauty and style. On the style front, TikTok already ran <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">a livestreamed video shopping pilot</a> with Walmart that used influencers to drive purchases, demonstrating the potential in connecting video inspiration to consumer action in an even more timely fashion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Facebook Oversight Board has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-oversight-board-controversy/">only been operational for a short time</a>, but the nascent project is already looking ahead.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/02/11/conversation-with-oversight-board-facebook-s-trump-ban-and-future-of-online-speech-event-7540">conversation hosted by the Carnegie Endowment Thursday</a>, Oversight Board co-chair and former Prime Minister of Denmark Helle Thorning-Schmidt painted a more expansive vision for the group that could go beyond making policy decisions for Facebook.</p>
<p>The board co-chair said that if the project proves to be a success, &#8220;other platforms and other tech companies are more than welcome to join and be part of the oversight that we will be able to provide.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Thorning-Schmidt emphasized that a broader vision for this kind of moderation body would happen well in the future, but the board&#8217;s current mission was to move away from policy decisions getting made in a &#8220;closed box&#8221; at the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until now, content moderation was basically done by the last person at Facebook or Twitter as we have seen — either Mark Zuckerberg or the other platform directors,&#8221; Thorning-Schmidt said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first time in history, we actually have content moderation being done outside one of the big social media platforms. That in itself&#8230; I don&#8217;t hesitate to call it historic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those comments may capture broader aspirations for Facebook&#8217;s Oversight Board, which refers to itself only as the &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221; without an explicit reference to Facebook on its website.</p>
<p>Throughout the panel, those involved with the Oversight Board defended the project. The group has <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-ad-hoc-group-of-activists-and-academics-convening-a-real-facebook-oversight-board">come under criticism from skeptics</a> wary that its origins with Facebook make real autonomy from the company impossible.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people want to immediately dismiss the Oversight Board and look for something new,&#8221; Oversight Board Head of Communications Dex Hunter-Torricke said.</p>
<p>Hunter-Torricke, who spent four years working on the Facebook executive communications team and served as a speechwriter for both Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, also hinted at a more expansive vision for the board.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a model that we&#8217;re testing here to see if this is the kind of institution that can have an impact in one sphere of Facebook and the content moderation challenges they face,&#8221; Hunter-Torricke said. He added that the board intends to &#8220;evolve and grow&#8221; using what it learns from handling Facebook moderation cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; As we build up our expertise and our body of experience in dealing with Facebook I expect there will be more capabilities that come onto the board,&#8221; Hunter-Torricke said. &#8220;We are on a journey. It&#8217;s not something [where] we necessarily know the final destination yet but we are looking to test this model and refine it further.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to the Oversight Board to ask if the group sees its future as an external governing body for social networks beyond Facebook.</p>

<p>Facebook&#8217; Oversight Board is currently facing the hugely consequential case of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/facebook-oversight-board-trump-facebook-suspension/">whether to reinstate former President Donald Trump</a>, who was removed from Facebook after inciting the violent mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol in early January.</p>
<p>Five of the group&#8217;s 20 members will evaluate the Trump case, though the board will not disclose which members evaluate which cases. Once the five reach their decision, the broader board must pass the decision in a majority vote. The board&#8217;s verdict is expected within the next two months.</p>
<p>The Facebook Oversight Board&#8217;s most prominent Trump critic, legal scholar Pamela Karlan, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/06/facebook-oversight-board-member-decamps-for-biden-doj-466526">left her role at the board to join the Biden administration last week</a> and won&#8217;t be involved in the decision. Karlan testified at Trump&#8217;s first impeachment hearing, arguing that Trump&#8217;s actions constituted impeachable offenses.</p>
<p>The board is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/facebook-trump-oversight-board-public-comment/">accepting comments on the Trump case</a> through Friday in an effort to consider &#8220;diverse perspectives&#8221; in its decision process.</p>
<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000177-8e40-df6c-abf7-ae726a9b0000">former Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos signed onto a public letter</a> urging the Oversight Board to keep in place Facebook&#8217;s decision to remove Trump. &#8220;Without social media spreading Trump’s statements, it seems extremely unlikely these events would have occurred,&#8221; the comment&#8217;s authors wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;There no doubt will be close calls under a policy that allows the deplatforming of political leaders in extreme circumstances. This was not one of them.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="c-link" href="https://www.knifecap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.knifecap.com/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Knife Capital</a>, a South African venture capital firm, is raising a $50 million fund for startups looking to raise Series B financing. With Knife Fund III called the African Series B Expansion Fund, the firm seeks to directly invest in the aggressive expansion of South African breakout companies. It also plans to co-invest in companies across the rest of Africa.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first fund, known as Knife Capital Fund I or HBD Venture Capital, was a closed private equity fund managed by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/eben-van-heerden">Eben van Heerden</a> and <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/keetvz">Keet van Zyl</a>. The firm offered seed capital to startups. It also generated significant exits from its portfolio &#8212; Visa <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/09/visa-acquires-mobile-financial-services-company-fundamo-for-110m-in-cash/">acquisition of fintech startup Fundamo</a>, and <a href="https://ventureburn.com/2018/05/uber-eats-acquires-ordertalk/">orderTalk&#8217;s acquisition</a> by UberEats come to mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, the VC firm launched its current 12J offering with Knife Capital Fund II. The fund (<a href="https://www.knf.vc/">KNF Ventures</a>), which invests primarily in Series A stage, has eight startups in its portfolio. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year the firm told TechCrunch of its intention to extend the Fund II and open to new investors. The plan was to give startups <a href="https://knifecap.com/networks/">access to networks</a>, money and expansion opportunities. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to help South African and African companies internationalize,” said co-managing partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreaboehmert/?originalSubdomain=za">Andrea Bohmert</a> at the time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A testament to its cause, one of its portfolio companies,</span><a href="http://www.dataprophet.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">DataProphet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, raised $6 million Series A to expand into the U.S. and Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohmert tells TechCrunch that the third fund aims to address the critical Series B funding gap that has characterised the venture capital asset class in South Africa, resulting in businesses not reaching full potential or exiting too early.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lately, we see an increase in companies able to raise $2 million to $5 million funding rounds. And while the companies are operating within their home country, in our case South Africa, such amounts take you far due to the local cost structure,&#8221; Bohmert says. &#8220;However, once these companies start gaining international traction and need to build an infrastructure outside of their home country, they need to raise significant amounts to afford so. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently hardly any South African VC funds, perhaps other than Naspers Foundry, that can write checks of $5 million or more and are willing to deploy them to finance the externalization of South African companies into larger markets.”</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Rx2XxNLenG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/these-specialized-africa-vc-funds-are-welcoming-co-investors/">These specialized Africa VC funds are welcoming co-investors</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;These specialized Africa VC funds are welcoming co-investors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/these-specialized-africa-vc-funds-are-welcoming-co-investors/embed/#?secret=Rx2XxNLenG" data-secret="Rx2XxNLenG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Bohmert argues that Africa has become an incubator for international VCs who can write these checks but cannot provide the local support most of these companies still need. Likewise, there are instances where international investors actively search for local co-investors in South Africa to invest in a round, and not finding one might blow the chances of them going further with the investment. This is the gap Knife Capital intends to fill by launching this fund, Bohmert says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to be the local lead investor of choice for South African technology companies looking to internationalise, co-investing with international investors who can lead the Series B discussion and further.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, Knife Capital secured $10 million from <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/company/mineworkers-investment-company">Mineworkers Investment Company</a> (MIC), a South Africa-based investment firm. The commitment positions MIC as an anchor investor to the fund alongside other local and international investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/nchaupe-khaole-a5b5533">Nchaupe Khaole</a>, the CIO at MIC, explained that the move to change the way local institutional investors approach venture capital investment has been in MIC&#8217;s pipeline for a while. And by partnering with Knife Capital, this idea can begin to materialize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our commitment brings to the table the investment, along with many of our strengths as an experienced player. One of which is our ability to influence the companies within our portfolio to partner with us and effect real, tangible change to the South African economy. We are delighted to be a key catalyst in the success of this funding round,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per other details, Knife Capital aims for a first close by May and a final close by the end of the year. Most of its participation will be co-investing, and the idea is to do that in 10 to 12 companies.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/for-all-mankind-time-capsule/id1541425599">&#8220;For All Mankind: Time Capsule&#8221;</a> is a new augmented reality app created by Apple to promote the upcoming second season of &#8220;For All Mankind,&#8221; which premieres on February 19 on Apple TV+.</p>
<p>Even for those of you who aren&#8217;t fans of the the show — which tells the story of an alternate history in which the Soviet Union beat the United States to the moon leading to an extended space race in the &#8217;70s and beyond — the app is still noteworthy as another sign of Apple&#8217;s interest in AR, even beyond <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/23/augmented-reality-and-the-next-century-of-the-web/">the reports that it&#8217;s working on AR glasses</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time Capsule&#8221; takes place during the decade-long gap between seasons one and two, tracing the relationship between Danny Stevens and his parents, the astronauts Gordo and Tracy Stevens. Users who download the free iOS app will be able to interact with a variety of objects — such as a mixtape and an Apple II computer — that illustrate the family relationship.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Time Capsule&#8221; walks users through a linear experience with between 45 and 60 minutes of content, but it sounds like it&#8217;s also designed to support further exploration and additional visits. You&#8217;ll be able to check &#8220;D-mail&#8221; and play a text adventure game on the computer, and if you&#8217;ve got an Apple device with a LiDAR scanner (such as an iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max or iPad Pro) you can use a virtual slide projector to project Danny&#8217;s family photos onto your own walls.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2112318" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2112318" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2112318" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/For-All-Mankind_-Time-Capsule.jpg?w=680" alt="For All Mankind Time Capsule" width="680" height="417" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/For-All-Mankind_-Time-Capsule.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/For-All-Mankind_-Time-Capsule.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/For-All-Mankind_-Time-Capsule.jpg?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/For-All-Mankind_-Time-Capsule.jpg?resize=768,471 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/For-All-Mankind_-Time-Capsule.jpg?resize=680,417 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/For-All-Mankind_-Time-Capsule.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2112318" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;For All Mankind&#8221; producer Ben McGinnis said the app was created in parallel with the show&#8217;s second season, with the creative team working with Apple to figure out &#8220;which objects were best for getting the story across,&#8221; and offering feedback as the actual AR objects were developed.</p>
<p>Creator and executive producer Ron Moore added that he&#8217;s excited about the possibility of giving fans new ways to explore the show&#8217;s world and characters, especially since writers on the show often create far more material than what ends up on screen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of the promise of this technology is that a fan of any show, by definition, usually wants to know more about it, more about the characters,&#8221; Moore said.</p>
<p>In this case, &#8220;For All Mankind&#8221;&#8216;s team had written things like love letters and newscasts that are only seen briefly on screen. They could then be used in the app, along with additional material by Stephanie Shannon, a writer on the show. The key, Moore said, is to &#8220;play fair by the audience that just wants to show up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can certainly watch &#8216;For All Mankind&#8217; on-air without the AR stuff,&#8221; he added. &#8220;But if you do the AR stuff first, it enriches your experience.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public.com, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a social-focused free stock trading service,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is nearing the close of a Series D just two months after raising </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/social-stock-trading-services-public-raises-65m-series-c/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $65 million Series C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based fintech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to give people the ability to invest in companies using any amount of money, with a focus on community activity over active trading. It competes with Robinhood, M1 Finance and other American fintech companies that offer consumers a way to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/17/saving-not-spending-is-the-new-hotness-in-fintech/">invest in equities with low or zero fees</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public.com apparently got a flurry of investor interest over the past couple of weeks after Robinhood found itself in hot water and essentially</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised $3.4 billion in a matter of days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help get itself out of a mess. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That new capital came at a challenging time for the unicorn, which </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could pursue an IPO this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">some investors reportedly want a piece of rival Public.com’s pie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One source told TechCrunch that many of those offering term sheets believe there could be “a mass exodus from Robinhood” and want a way to capture that value.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public recently </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/trading-app-public-drops-payment-for-order-flow-in-favor-of-tips/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shook up its business model</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, moving from generating revenue from order flow payments, a key way that Robinhood monetizes, to collecting tips from users in exchange for executing their orders. Payment for order flow, or PFOF, has become a touchstone in the debate surrounding low-cost trading platforms, and how users may pay for their transactions if not in direct fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors betting on Public, then, would be placing a wager on not merely future user growth, but the startup’s ability to monetize effectively in the future.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sources for this story were granted anonymity due to the sensitivity of the discussions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public grew quickly in 2020, expanding its user base by a multiple of 10 since the start of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder Leif Abraham told TC’s Alex Wilhelm in December that the company’s growth has been consistent instead of lumpy, expanding at around 30% each month. The co-founder also stressed that most of Public’s users find its service organically, implying that the startup’s marketing costs have not been extreme, nor its growth artificially boosted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t know yet  how much Public is raising in its Series D, or who all is investing. Public has not responded to multiple requests for comment. VC firm Accel &#8212; which <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/matador-app/company_financials">led its Series A, B and C rounds</a> &#8212; also declined to comment. But we’ll definitely report details as we get them.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Demetrius Curry has spent the last couple years chasing a dream.</p>
<p>His startup, <a href="https://yourcollegecash.com/">College Cash</a>, allows brands to petition users to create photo and video marketing content highlighting their product or service, with the wrinkle being that content creators are paid by the brands in the form of credits that go directly toward paying down their student loan debt. This model awards the brands involved a level of social good will and tax benefits.</p>
<p>The Dallas-area founder was inspired to tackle the student loan debt crisis after talking with his daughter about the prospect of eventually paying down her own loan debt. Curry has spent the past two years building out the nascent platform, tracking down brand partners, navigating accelerator programs, enticing users and pounding the pavement to find investors willing to bet on his vision.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>College Cash has raised $105,000 to date, and is hoping to eventually wrap the funding into a $1 million seed round.</p>
<p>Filling out the round has been its own challenge for Curry, who has struggled at times to find opportunity, even among historic levels of capital flowing into the startup ecosystem, a distinction that has been less noticeable for black founders that still make up just a small percentage of VC allocation. In the aftermath of last summer&#8217;s protests against police brutality, a number of venture capital firms issued statements decrying institutional racism and pledging to back more underserved founders, spinning up new programs for diverse founders.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2112255" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2112255" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2112255 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-3.25.17-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="455" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-3.25.17-PM.jpg 2154w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-3.25.17-PM.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-3.25.17-PM.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-3.25.17-PM.jpg?resize=768,514 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-3.25.17-PM.jpg?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-3.25.17-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1028 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-3.25.17-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1371 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-3.25.17-PM.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2112255" class="wp-caption-text">Demetrius Curry, CEO of College Cash</p></div></p>
<p>While Curry says he appreciates the scope of the problem and the good intentions of those making the statements, he believes that venture capital networks still have a lot to learn about what being an &#8220;underserved&#8221; founder means, and that plenty of the existing efforts feel like &#8220;lip service.&#8221; He says that even as Silicon Valley continues to idolize dropouts from prestigious universities, stakeholders have less interest in recognizing the accomplishments of founders who fought their way through poverty or found opportunity in geographies where opportunities are harder to come by.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t look for something different if you&#8217;re looking in the same places,&#8221; Curry tells TechCrunch. &#8220;When you look at the topic of &#8216;underserved founders,&#8217; it&#8217;s not only a skin color thing, it&#8217;s also about where they came from and what they&#8217;ve been through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curry says that it can be frustrating to compete for early-stage opportunities when investors aren&#8217;t willing to meaningfully adjust their parameters. Of particular frustration to Curry has been navigating the world of &#8220;warm introductions&#8221; to even get a foot in the door for programs meant for diverse founders, or applying for early-stage programs geared toward the &#8220;underserved&#8221; only to be told that they weren&#8217;t far enough along to qualify.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think about how much we had to go through to even get in the room with you,&#8221; Curry says. &#8220;I&#8217;ve sold plasma to pay a web hosting fee, nothing is going to stop me.&#8221;</p>
<p>College Cash&#8217;s mission of expanding opportunities for people struggling to manage their student loan debt is personal to Curry, who saw his life turn around after going back to school.</p>
<p>Decades ago, fresh out of the military, Curry said he had a random conversation with a stranger while eating at a Hardee&#8217;s &#8212; the discussion about what more he wanted from life ended up pushing him to to go back and get his GED and later a business degree. What followed was a career in finance that eventually led toward his recent entrepreneurial pursuits with College Cash.</p>
<p>The platform is firmly an early-stage venture at the moment, but Curry has big ambitions he&#8217;s building toward. His next effort is building out a College Cash tipping integration with gig economy platforms, with the aim that users of those platforms could ultimately opt to tip a worker and route that money directly toward paying down that person&#8217;s student loan debt.</p>
<p>Curry says the team at College Cash has been working with a &#8220;national gig economy platform&#8221; to run a pilot of the integration and has run focus groups showing that users are more likely to tip when they know that money goes toward erasing loan debt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Video collaboration startup <a href="https://www.frame.io">Frame.io</a> unveiled a new technology today that it calls <a href="https://www.frame.io/c2c">Frame.io Camera to Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Michael Cioni, the startup&#8217;s global senior vice president of innovation, explained that while consumers expect to instantly upload video footage to the cloud, professional film and TV productions still rely on hard drives.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good reason for that: Those productions use much higher-quality footage, which means that the files are enormous. But Frame.io gets around that by uploading &#8220;proxy&#8221; footage that&#8217;s not nearly so bandwidth intensive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It can, in fact, be uploaded on an LTE connection, as the Frame.io team demonstrated for me by shooting brief footage that was accessible a few seconds later from a computer on the other side of the country.</p>
<p>Cioni said this means the editing process no longer has to wait on the movement of hard drives: &#8220;We take this linear process and make it parallel.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2112259" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2112259" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2112259 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Frame.io-C2C_8_iPhone-App.jpg?w=680" alt="Frame.io Camera to Cloud iPhone app" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Frame.io-C2C_8_iPhone-App.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Frame.io-C2C_8_iPhone-App.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Frame.io-C2C_8_iPhone-App.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Frame.io-C2C_8_iPhone-App.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Frame.io-C2C_8_iPhone-App.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Frame.io-C2C_8_iPhone-App.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2112259" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Frame.io</p></div></p>
<p>Footage uploaded through Camera to Cloud can then be edited in Frame.io, but the technology is also integrated with popular editing software like Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere. And because the proxy footage has the same timecodes and metadata as the original, any edits can be synchronized once you receive the drives.</p>
<p>In addition, Camera to Cloud allows production members on and off the set to view footage from their computer, iPhone or iPad, as soon as it&#8217;s shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;The moment that you hit stop [on the camera], wouldn’t it just be great to pull the footage up on your phone, because you want to see what you shot?&#8221; said Frame.io CEO Emery Wells. &#8220;You can’t do that right now on a professional set. There&#8217;s person whose job it is to do that, there are playback monitors all over the set and everybody watches playback at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while the company started to develop this technology before the pandemic, Wells said, &#8220;It turns out there&#8217;s even more of a need for this now, when fewer people can be on sets.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, the technology was already used during the production of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/20/original-content-podcast-the-pandemic-thriller-songbird-could-have-been-a-lot-worse/">the pandemic movie &#8220;Songbird.&#8221;</a> The movie was filmed last summer, and by using Camera to Cloud, producers who were not allowed on the set (due to new safety protocols) could still keep up with the footage.</p>
<p>Camera to Cloud works on existing devices like the Teradek CUBE 655, Sound Devices 888 and Scorpio recorders, which can be attached to compatible cameras from Arri, RED and Sony. It&#8217;s available at no additional charge to paying Frame.io subscribers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s our prediction that by the end of the decade, everybody shooting audio, video and whatever, they&#8217;re going to shoot into the cloud,&#8221; Cioni said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In general, ESG stands for &#8220;environment-social-governance&#8221; and comprises a set of principles that touches on issues from diversity and board structures to labor relations, supply chain, data ethics, environmental impact and legal requirements.</p>
<p>Unlike impact investing, which is squarely focused on the (external) effects of a business, ESG concerns mostly internal practices and processes that could support both a fund and its portfolio companies to make them more sustainable.</p>
<p>While other asset classes from <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/esg-investing-global-private-equity-report-2020/">buyout funds</a> to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/betsyatkins/2020/05/08/how-to-operationalize-esg/">public equities</a> have seen a big push toward ESG ratings and initiatives<em>, </em>venture capital has been lagging behind. What has changed recently?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the last several months, quite a few mostly European funds have stepped forward with initiatives to tackle ESG. Balderton, for instance, announced its <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/NCV0C9rANUkPOkvTEk9Fx/">Sustainable Future Goals</a> with a bang <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/KvjbC82zNU6xk6lunJJfH/">at the startup event Slush</a> in early December 2020. Their efforts are focused both internally on the fund and externally on investment decisions and portfolio support. I asked Colin Hanna, one of the leaders of the development internally and a principal at the firm, how this initiative came about:</p>
<blockquote><p>While our efforts on this front preceded COVID, this year we saw that a real impact was possible on climate-change-related goals […] we have become accustomed to doing virtual board meetings, cutting down on travel; the challenge will be to continue those efforts going forward and rolling them out to our portfolio companies even as the world returns to normal. Having a framework helps us do that.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This rationale also recently brought a group of about 25 VCs to form a community around ESG for VC for the first time. The initiative is led by GMG Ventures and Houghton Street Venture, a new firm affiliated with the London School of Economics that met for the first time in December with representatives from </span><a href="https://localglobe.vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LocalGlobe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Latitude</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://kindredcapital.vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kindred Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Balderton, the </span><a href="https://www.westlygroup.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Westly Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://blisce.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blisce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The group&#8217;s stated g</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">oal is to share expertise from the bottom up and fill the gap where existing frameworks don’t quite work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is direly needed right now, says Sophia Bendz, partner at Berlin-based firm </span><a href="https://www.cherry.vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cherry Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning with topics around DEI and climate issues, we are really keen on upping our ESG game. ESG involves such important issues and we have to dedicate the time to learn more to ultimately do more on these fronts now. Yet, I also believe that true impact doesn&#8217;t result from knowledge silos. It&#8217;s great that we are learning from and supporting each other to have more societal impacts in our day-to-day roles. I am really passionate about this.</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>What are the main drivers for this push? </strong></h2>
<p>I asked Susan Winterberg, an ESG consultant who recently finished a two-year fellowship at Harvard producing a <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/responsible-investing-tech-and-venture-capital">groundbreaking report</a> on the subject of ESG for VCs specifically about the &#8220;why now&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are broadly two sets of reasons why investors and company leaders adopt ESG. The first set relates to increased awareness of how their activities impact external events happening in the world such as climate change and social justice. The second relates to increased awareness of how adopting ESG can advance specific business goals they have such as increasing sales, attracting top talent, and reducing operating risks.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, 2020 was a watershed year to drive change based on both of these sets of rationales. Social justice issues — from Black Lives Matter and racial equity, COVID-19 and healthcare to freedom of expression and democracy — were prevalent across the spectrum. Startup leaders and investors were influenced by these societal movements as much as by new research helping them understand how ESG can help advance business objectives in venture capital. The two reports published by <a href="https://www.fmo.nl/responsible-venture-capital">CDC/FMO</a> and the <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/responsible-investing-tech-and-venture-capital">Belfer Center</a> are only two examples of this evidence.</p>
<p>What do VCs say, how has change happened for them? Hana told me that at Balderton a combination of factors mentioned by Winterberg above, worked together to start the process:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was both a push and a pull within Balderton. Our investors and the leaders at the top of our firm were proponents of this change but the efforts were also driven by the younger generation within the firm; they felt it was important. Overall, we were silent about climate change and sustainability for a long time, which was not really an option anymore.</p></blockquote>
<p>For Martin Weber, founding partner at HV Capital that&#8217;s working with the St. Gallen-based ESG initiative <a href="https://rose.startglobal.org/">ROSE</a>, the conversation really started with <a href="https://lfca.earth/">Leaders for Climate Action</a>. Weber admits: “We didn’t think about ESG enough […] beyond our own horizon really […] sometimes you really need a kick in the butt, that’s what Leaders for Climate Action did for us; a small change started our awareness and commitment to ESG.”</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			ESG concerns mostly internal practices and processes that could support both a fund and its portfolio companies to make them more sustainable.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For HV Capital but also some funds in the U.S. such as the <a href="https://www.westlygroup.com/">Westly Group</a> a specific ESG vector started the journey — that could be the E as in environment but also DEI as part of the S and G of ESG.</p>
<p>I also spoke to several LPs recently among others moderating a panel at the U.K.-based <a href="https://allocate.gp/">Allocate conference</a>; the atmosphere seems to be shifting more drastically toward &#8220;doing business better&#8221; among the asset owners, too. Particularly family offices managing their own money are outspoken already, but big asset owners are becoming aware (and active) as well.</p>
<p>Michael Cappucci, managing director of Compliance and Sustainable Investing at the Harvard Management Company — Harvard’s endowment — thinks that “we are long past the time to ‘wait and see’ if ESG integration is a worthwhile undertaking for investors&#8221; (see the <a href="https://www.fmo.nl/responsible-venture-capital">UNPRI</a> report for more context).</p>
<p>The movement here seems to be coming even stronger from Europe again, however. As a result, the same group around Houghton Street Ventures and GMG Ventures pushing ESG for VCs is also in the process to get more LPs on board with a special workshop in February, as I learned. The tempo on the LP front is increasing as we speak.</p>
<h2><strong>What is still missing?</strong></h2>
<p>While lots of progress has been made on the level of individual funds, individual LPs and in baby steps toward a more general industry-wide push, there are still some core elements that are not in place. I believe the five key gaps concern a clear differentiation of ESG from impact, finding the right language, establishing a common framework, agreeing on metrics and real LP commitment.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Know what ESG is: </strong>Many investors (and LPs) I speak with still don’t really know the difference between impact and ESG. In very simple terms, ESG principles are about the (internal) processes (of a fund, portfolio company, etc.) while impact investing is about outcomes (sometimes operationalized through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)). While impact will likely remain a niche asset class for the foreseeable future, ESG principles should inform the practices of <em>all </em>investors in one way or the other.</li>
<li><strong>Find the right language</strong>: On a related note, finding the right <em>language </em>to talk about what ESG (versus impact) is, might help us to differentiate better. As Sarah Drinkwater of Omidyar Network made very clear in <a href="https://sarahdrinkwater.medium.com/the-responsible-tech-movement-is-held-back-because-we-dont-know-what-to-call-it-9a674e867054">her post from September</a> last year, we simply don’t have a good word to describe (and own) what ESG expresses in the world of venture capital and technology — principled, progressive, equitable? Possibly, &#8220;setting a standard&#8221; can help with this issue, too.</li>
<li><strong>Somebody, set a standard: </strong>ESG (and impact) frameworks developed and deployed slowly in the venture industry are still all over the place; they are influenced by all kinds of other frameworks (from other asset classes and related activities, such as impact) and mostly made up by individual funds themselves. There is certainly a risk of green washing if it stays that way; (self-proclaimed and reported) marketing is one thing but if we really want to change the industry, an authoritative body will have to step forward. What the biggest European anchor investor — the European Investment Fund — has done on that front so far with a very high-level questionnaire is not enough. How about, for instance, the UNPRI descends from the plane of high level down to individual industry principles?</li>
<li><strong>What isn’t measured:</strong> One part of what could really lead to an industry standard is a set of widely accepted and benchmarkable metrics; what are the most important measurements across early-stage and late-stage VC portfolio companies? The group of funds in London has for good reason announced that this particularly question will be one of the focus points they are working on next. But how will this again be adopted and spread industrywide? Another set of players might get involved in that again: LPs. If they make their GPs report on ESG on an annual basis, this will surely shift the industry as a whole and make the next generation of startups more equitable, responsible and stakeholder-focused.</li>
<li><strong>LPs really need to bite:</strong> So far, we are still missing real LP commitments when it comes to ESG. On the one hand, many GPs I spoke with that have recently been fundraising reported that LPs in general still don’t ask about ESG. In fact, some LPs particularly in the U.S. believe ESG might be a distraction from generating returns. In any case, ESG still has not become a must-have but is merely regarded a nice-to-do. The ESG questionnaires that do exist — like the EIF framework — are so far really high level and unspecific. When big anchor LPs like the EIF and BBB in Europe or big foundations and university endowments ask about it in their due diligence meetings, GPs will have to comply — all of them. Their influence as agenda setters might in the medium term be the biggest driving factor toward making ESG for VC the normal way of doing business. Given that there is state-money, all of our money, involved here, it seems an absolute no-brainer to take that step.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Analysis of a trove of data extracted from the Chicago Police Department has revealed major differences between how Black and white officers, as well as male and female ones, actually enforce the law. This rare apples-to-apples comparison supports the idea that improving diversity in law enforcement may also improve the quality of policing.</p>
<p>Historically hard data from police departments has been extremely hard to come by, for a variety of reasons. As the authors put it in the paper:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rigorous evaluation of the effects of police diversity has been stymied by a lack of sufficiently fine-grained data on officer deployment and behavior that makes it difficult or impossible to ensure that officers being compared are facing common circumstances while on duty.</p>
<p>… At present, a patchwork of nonstandard record-keeping and disclosure practices across roughly 18,000 U.S. police agencies has severely impeded broader policy evaluation.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abd8694">This study by B.A. Ba et al.</a>, however, is based on highly detailed CPD records resulting from requests made to the department over a period of three years. It&#8217;s a collaboration between researchers from UC Irvine, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, and Columbia, and was published today in Science (access is free).</p>
<p>The records include millions of shifts and patrols from 2012 through 2015, which the team carefully sorted and pruned until it had a set that would allow the kind of analysis they hoped to do: comparing police work that is similar in all respects except the demographics of the officers doing it.</p>
<p>If on a Monday in March, in the same district at the same time of day, no serious differences could be found between Black officers and white officers, then race could be tentatively ruled out as a major contributor to how police do their work. On the other hand, if there were serious differences found, then that might indicate — as a topic for further study — the possibility of systemic bias of some kind.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Does tech have the guts to deploy its resources against police brutality?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/does-tech-have-the-guts-to-deploy-its-resources-against-police-brutality/embed/#?secret=jshfJRU01X" data-secret="jshfJRU01X" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As you might expect, the analysis found that there are indeed serious differences that, having isolated all the other variables, only correlate with the race of the officer. This may seem obvious to some and controversial to others, but the point of this work is not to assume or confirm assumptions, but to show plainly with data that there are disparities associated with race that need investigation and explanation.</p>
<p>Some of the specific findings can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minority officers (Black and Hispanic, self-identified) &#8220;receive vastly different patrol assignments,&#8221; something that had to be controlled for in order to provide effective comparisons for the other findings.</li>
<li>Black officers use force 35% less than white officers on average, with most of the difference coming from force used against Black civilians.</li>
<li>Black officers perform far fewer &#8220;discretionary stops&#8221; for &#8220;suspicious behavior.&#8221;</li>
<li>Hispanic officers showed similar, but smaller reductions.</li>
<li>Female officers use force considerably less often than male ones, again especially when it comes to Black civilians.</li>
<li>Much of the disparity in stops, arrests and use of force results from differences in pursuing low-level offenses, especially in Black-majority neighborhoods.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data show (as a sort of inverse image of the above list) that white male officers stop, arrest and use force more often, especially on people of color, and frequently as a result of minor crimes or &#8220;discretionary stops&#8221; with vague justifications.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111904" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ba-et-al-diagram.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111904" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2111904" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ba-et-al-diagram.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="664" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ba-et-al-diagram.jpg 2169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ba-et-al-diagram.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ba-et-al-diagram.jpg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ba-et-al-diagram.jpg?resize=768,498 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ba-et-al-diagram.jpg?resize=680,441 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ba-et-al-diagram.jpg?resize=1536,996 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ba-et-al-diagram.jpg?resize=2048,1328 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ba-et-al-diagram.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2111904" class="wp-caption-text">This diagram shows a sampling of the collected data, indicating stops, arrests and uses of force by officers on a map of the Wentworth District of Chicago. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Science</p></div></p>
<p>The researchers are careful to point out that as conclusive as the patterns may appear to be, it&#8217;s important to understand that there is no causal mechanism studied or suggested. In fact they expressly point out that the data could be interpreted in two directions:</p>
<blockquote><p>One explanation for these disparities centers on racial bias, i.e., white officers are more likely than Black officers to harass Black civilians. Technically, it is also possible that Black officers respond more leniently when observing crimes in progress.</p></blockquote>
<p>More study is required, but they point out that one explanation — leniency by Black officers on minor offenses — has very little effect on public safety (violent crimes are addressed largely the same regardless of race and gender). The other — systemic racism — is significantly more harmful. Though they are &#8220;observationally equivalent&#8221; in the context of this data specifically, they are not equivalent in consequence. (Nor in likelihood — nor are they entirely incompatible with each other.)</p>

<p><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abf4518">In a valuable commentary on the paper and its implications</a>, Yale&#8217;s Phillip Atiba Goff notes that its findings are rich in implications that we ignore at our peril:</p>
<blockquote><p>The magnitude of the differences provides strong evidence that — at least in some cities — the number of officers who identify with vulnerable groups can matter quite a bit in predicting police behavior. Although this does not settle the matter, the work stands alone in its ability to make apples-to-apples comparisons across officers — regardless of how many may be bad apples.</p>
<p>Given that Ba et al. find negligible demographic differences in officers’ responses to community violence, such a large difference in discretionary stops compels a reader to ask: Are any of those excess stops by white officers necessary? Should a department even be making them, given the demonstrated risk for abuse so evident in vulnerable communities?</p>
<p>Are any of those excess use of force incidents by white officers necessary? And if the excess force is not necessary for public safety, why does the department target Black communities for so much physical coercion? These questions are difficult to answer outside a broader engagement with the purpose of policing — and its limitations.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, while it may require further study to get at the core of these issues, police departments may look at them and find that their resources are not necessarily being used to best effect. Indeed they may have to face the possibility — if only to refute it — that much of what officers do has little, no, or even negative value to the community. As Goff concludes:</p>
<blockquote><p>With violence trending downward the past three decades, mostly troubling small geographic areas, and possibly occupying a small portion of police activity, what should the role of police be? Failing to take seriously the possibility that the answer should be &#8220;much less&#8221; may end up frustrating both researchers and a public that has been asking the question for far longer than most scientists.</p></blockquote>
<p>This revealing study was only possible because the authors and legal authorities in Chicago compelled the police there to release this data. As noted above it can be difficult, if it is even possible, to collect large-scale data from any department, let alone from many departments for analysis at a national scale. The authors freely admit that their findings, in their specificity to Chicago, may not apply equally in other cities.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s meant to be a call to action; if when finally given access to real data, researchers find problems of this magnitude, every department in the country should be weighing the benefits and risks of continued obfuscation with those of openness and collaboration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Sam Lurye looks at a loading dock he sees both a bottleneck in the world’s supply chain and an opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opportunity — driven by a tension between the digital and physical infrastructure at warehouse distribution centers and factories today and the push toward autonomy — prompted Lurye to found Kargo, a smart loading dock platform startup that recently raised $6 million in seed money from Founders Fund, Accomplice, Sozo Ventures and other unnamed investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first months of the company, which was founded in late 2019, Lurye spent months traveling throughout the United States, visiting warehouse distribution centers and factories and speaking with hundreds of truck drivers, plant workers and supply chain managers to understand where the change in the autonomous logistics was impacting them.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their primary complaint: loading docks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No matter whether you&#8217;re building cars or elevators or distributing things, everyone has loading docks,” Lurye said in a recent interview. “It’s kind of this universal API of the industrial world; a loading dock allows any industrial facility to connect with the outside world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loading docks are ubiquitous, and so are their problems. Bottlenecks are common with the average truck waiting two and half hours to be loaded or unloaded at the dock. For every 15 minutes that the truck waits beyond that average dwell time, the chance of a crash later on in the route increased by 6.2%, according to a <a href="https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/FMCSA%20Driver%20Detention%20Final%20Report.pdf">study by the U.S. Department of Transportation</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lurye concluded that warehouses and factories weren’t ready for the coming wave of investment in autonomy, which tends to focus on autonomous trucks and warehouse robotics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kargo’s platform is not just a digital enterprise. The company mounts physical sensor towers to a loading dock. The computer vision sensor is able to automatically identify and verify all incoming and outgoing freight in real time. The accompanying software platform takes in all of that data, which can then be used by customers to take a macro or micro view of its supply chain. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2112206" style="width: 1524px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/kargo_platform.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2112206" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2112206 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/kargo_platform.png" alt="kargo loading dock platform" width="1514" height="1070" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/kargo_platform.png 1514w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/kargo_platform.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/kargo_platform.png?resize=300,212 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/kargo_platform.png?resize=768,543 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/kargo_platform.png?resize=680,481 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/kargo_platform.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1514px) 100vw, 1514px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2112206" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kargo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company makes money by selling the sensor and then offering a software subscription that gives customers access to the data.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lurye said the platform has allowed its customers to reduce loading time by more than 40%. As more loading docks are connected to the platform, the predictive feature that Kargo built improves and will allow customers to make informed forecasts of whether a shipment will be late or missed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lurye’s aim in 2021 is to use the new funds to double its 7-person workforce over the next several months and launch its first commercial launch of 50 loading docks with plans to triple that number before the end of the year. In 2022, Lurye wants to add more than 1,000 loading docks to the platform.  </span></p>
<p>Demand for Kargo&#8217;s platform and sensors could rise as e-commerce giants like Amazon as well as hundreds of other distributors add more automation inside their warehouses and factories.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A webcam app installed by thousands of users left an exposed database packed with user data on the internet without a password.</p>
<p>The Elasticsearch database belonged to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xm.adorcam">Adorcam</a>, an app for viewing and controlling several webcam models including Zeeporte and Umino cameras. Security researcher Justin Paine discovered the data exposure and contacted Adorcam, which secured the database.</p>
<p>Paine said <a href="https://rainbowtabl.es/2021/02/11/adorcam-leaks-124-million-rows-data/">in a blog post shared</a> with TechCrunch that the database contained about 124 million rows of data for the several thousand users, and included live details about the webcam — such as its location, whether the microphone was active and name of the WiFi network that the camera is connected to — and information about the webcam owner, such as email addresses.</p>

<p>Paine also found evidence of the camera uploading captured stills from the webcam to the app&#8217;s cloud, though he could not verify since the links had expired.</p>
<p>He also found hardcoded credentials in the database for the app&#8217;s MQTT server, a lightweight <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/google-launches-cloud-service-to-manage-internet-of-things-data/">messaging protocol</a> often used in internet-connected devices. Paine did not test the credentials (as doing so would be unlawful in the U.S.), but also alerted the app maker to the vulnerability, who then changed the password.</p>
<p>Paine verified that the database was updating live by signing up with a new account and searching for his information in the database. Although the data was limited in sensitivity, Paine warned that a malicious hacker could craft convincing phishing emails, or use the information for extortion.</p>
<p>Adorcam did not return our emails with questions — including if the company planned to inform users of the incident.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Typically when we talk about tech and security, the mind naturally jumps to cybersecurity. But equally important, especially for global companies with large, multinational organizations, is physical security — a key function at most medium-to-large enterprises, and yet one that to date, hasn&#8217;t really done much to take advantage of recent advances in technology. Enter <a href="https://baseoperations.com">Base Operations</a>, a startup founded by risk management professional Cory Siskind in 2018. Base Operations just closed their $2.2 million seed funding round and will use the money to capitalize on its recent launch of a street-level threat mapping platform for use in supporting enterprise security operations.</p>
<p>The funding, led by Good Growth Capital and including investors like Magma Partners, First In Capital, Gaingels and First Round Capital founder Howard Morgan, will be used primarily for hiring, as Base Operations looks to continue its team growth after doubling its employe base this past month. It&#8217;ll also be put to use extending and improving the company&#8217;s product and growing the startup&#8217;s global footprint. I talked to Siskind about her company&#8217;s plans on the heels of this round, as well as the wider opportunity and how her company is serving the market in a novel way.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we do at Base Operations is help companies keep their people in operation secure with &#8216;Micro Intelligence,&#8217; which is street-level threat assessments that facilitate a variety of routine security tasks in the travel security, real estate and supply chain security buckets,&#8221; Siskind explained. &#8220;Anything that the chief security officer would be in charge of, but not cyber — so anything that intersects with the physical world.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Siskind has firsthand experience about the complexity and challenges that enter into enterprise security since she began her career working for global strategic risk consultancy firm Control Risks in Mexico City. Because of her time in the industry, she&#8217;s keenly aware of just how far physical and political security operations lag behind their cybersecurity counterparts. It&#8217;s an often overlooked aspect of corporate risk management, particularly since in the past it&#8217;s been something that most employees at North American companies only ever encounter periodically when their roles involve frequent travel. The events of the past couple of years have changed that, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was the last bastion of a company that hadn&#8217;t been optimized by a SaaS platform, basically, so there was some resistance and some allegiance to legacy players,&#8221; Siskind told me. &#8220;However, the events of 2020 sort of turned everything on its head, and companies realized that the security department, and what happens in the physical world, is not just about compliance — it&#8217;s actually a strategic advantage to invest in those sort of services, because it helps you maintain business continuity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, and global political unrest all had significant impact on businesses worldwide in 2020, and Siskind says that this has proven a watershed moment in how enterprises consider physical security in their overall risk profile and strategic planning cycles.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Companies] have just realized that if you don&#8217;t invest [in] how to keep your operations running smoothly in the face of rising catastrophic events, you&#8217;re never going to achieve the profits that you need, because it&#8217;s too choppy, and you have all sorts of problems,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Base Operations addresses this problem by taking available data from a range of sources and pulling it together to inform threat profiles. Their technology is all about making sense of the myriad stream of information we encounter daily — taking the wash of news that we sometimes associate with &#8220;doom-scrolling&#8221; on social media, for instance, and combining it with other sources using machine learning to extrapolate actionable insights.</p>
<p>Those sources of information include &#8220;government statistics, social media, local news, data from partnerships, like NGOs and universities,&#8221; Siskind said. That data set powers their Micro Intelligence platform, and while the startup&#8217;s focus today is on helping enterprises keep people safe, while maintaining their operations, you can easily see how the same information could power everything from planning future geographical expansion, to tailoring product development to address specific markets.</p>
<p>Siskind saw there was a need for this kind of approach to an aspect of business that&#8217;s essential, but that has been relatively slow to adopt new technologies. From her vantage point two years ago, however, she couldn&#8217;t have anticipated just how urgent the need for better, more scalable enterprise security solutions would arise, and Base Operations now seems perfectly positioned to help with that need.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just three years after its founding, biotech startup <a href="https://www.immunai.com">Immunai</a> has raised $60 million in Series A funding, bringing its total raised to over $80 million. Despite its youth, Immunai has already established the largest database in the world for single cell immunity characteristics, and it has already used its machine learning-powered immunity analysts platform to enhance the performance of existing immunotherapies. Aided by this new funding, it&#8217;s now ready to expand into the development of entirely new therapies based on the strength and breadth of its data and ML.</p>
<p>Immunai&#8217;s approach to developing new insights around the human immune system uses a &#8220;multiomic&#8221; approach — essentially layering analysis of different types of biological data, including a cell&#8217;s genome, microbiome, epigenome (a genome&#8217;s chemical instruction set) and more. The startup&#8217;s unique edge is in combining the largest and richest data set of its type available, formed in partnership with world-leading immunological research organizations, with its own machine learning technology to deliver analytics at unprecedented scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it doesn&#8217;t sound corny, but we don&#8217;t have the luxury to move more slowly,&#8221; explained Immunai co-founder and CEO Noam Solomon in an interview. &#8220;Because I think that we are in kind of a perfect storm, where a lot of advances in machine learning and compute computations have led us to the point where we can actually leverage those methods to mine important insights. You have a limit or ceiling to how fast you can go by the number of people that you have — so I think with the vision that we have, and thanks to our very large network between MIT and Cambridge to Stanford in the Bay Area, and Tel Aviv, we just moved very quickly to harness people to say, let&#8217;s solve this problem together.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mission Bio raises $70 million to help scale its tech for improving the development of targeted cancer therapies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/mission-bio-raises-70-million-to-help-scale-its-tech-for-improving-the-development-of-targeted-cancer-therapies/embed/#?secret=qB5naBuWN7" data-secret="qB5naBuWN7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Solomon and his co-founder and CTO Luis Voloch both have extensive computer science and machine learning backgrounds, and they initially connected and identified a need for the application of this kind of technology in immunology. Scientific co-founder and SVP of Strategic Research Danny Wells then helped them refine their approach to focus on improving efficacy of immunotherapies designed to treat cancerous tumors.</p>
<p>Immunai has already demonstrated that its platform can help identify optimal targets for existing therapies, including in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1074-2">partnership with the Baylor College of Medicine where it assisted with a cell therapy product</a> for use in treating neuroblastoma (a type of cancer that develops from immune cells, often in the adrenal glands). The company is now also moving into new territory with therapies, using its machine learning platform and industry-leading cell database to new therapy discovery — not only identifying and validating targets for existing therapies, but helping to create entirely new ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re moving from just observing cells, but actually to going and perturbing them, and seeing what the outcome is,&#8221; explained Voloch. This, from the computational side, later allows us to move from correlative assessments to actually causal assessments, which makes our models a lot more powerful. Both on the computational side and on the lab side, this are really bleeding edge technologies that I think we will be the first to really put together at any kind of real scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The next step is to say, &#8216;Okay, now that we understand the human immune profile, can we develop new drugs?&#8217;,&#8221; said Solomon. &#8220;You can think about it like we&#8217;ve been building a Google Maps for the immune system for a few years — so we are mapping different roads and paths in the immune system. But at some point, we figured out that there are certain roads or bridges that haven&#8217;t been built yet. And we will be able to support building new roads and new bridges, and hopefully leading from current states of disease or cities of disease, to building cities of health.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apps saw record downloads and consumer spending in 2020, globally reaching somewhere around <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-and-downloads-2020">$111 billion</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/app-stores-to-see-130-billion-downloads-in-2020-and-record-consumer-spend-of-112-billion/">$112 billion</a>, according to various estimates. But a growing part of that spend was subscription payments, a new <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/subscription-apps-revenue-2020">report</a> from Sensor Tower indicates. Last year, global subscription app revenue from the top 100 subscription apps (excluding games), climbed 34% year-over-year to $13 billion, up from $9.7 billion in 2019.</p>
<p>The App Store, not surprisingly, accounted for a sizable chunk of this subscription revenue, given it has historically outpaced the Play Store on consumer spending. In 2020, the top 100 subscription apps worldwide generated $10.3 billion on the App Store, up 32% over 2019, compared with $2.7 billion on Google Play, which grew 42% from $1.9 billion in 2019.</p>

<p>There are some signs that subscription revenue growth may be hitting a peak. Some of the slowdown and otherwise flat growth can be attributed to larger apps, like Netflix and Tinder, which have found ways to workaround the app stores&#8217; in-app purchases requirements.</p>
<p>Globally, subscription app revenue from the top 100 apps was around 11.7% of the total ~$111 billion consumers spent on in-app purchases in 2020 &#8212; which is roughly the same share it saw in 2019.</p>
<p>And in the fourth quarter of 2020, 86 of the top 100 earning apps worldwide offered subscriptions, which was down from the 89 that did so in the fourth quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>In addition, subscription app revenue growth in the U.S. is now trailing the global trends.</p>
<p>Although subscription app revenue was still up 26% on a year-over-year basis to reach nearly $5.9 billion in 2020, that was slower growth than the 34% seen worldwide.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2112066" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2112066" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2112066" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/subscription-app-us-2020-spending.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="434" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/subscription-app-us-2020-spending.png 1538w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/subscription-app-us-2020-spending.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/subscription-app-us-2020-spending.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/subscription-app-us-2020-spending.png?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/subscription-app-us-2020-spending.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/subscription-app-us-2020-spending.png?resize=1536,981 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/subscription-app-us-2020-spending.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2112066" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, subscription app spending in the U.S. last year represented a smaller percentage of the total consumer spend than in 2019, the report found. In 2020, subscription payments from the top 100 subscription apps were 17.6% of the $33 billion U.S. consumers spent on in-app purchases, down from the 21% share they accounted for in 2019.</p>
<p>And out of the 100 top grossing apps in the U.S. in the fourth quarter 2020, 91 were subscription-based, down from 93 in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>The top subscription apps in the U.S. looked different between the App Store and Google Play. On the former, YouTube was the top grosser in this category, while Google Pay users spent on Google One (Google&#8217;s cloud storage product). Tinder, meanwhile, was No. 2 on the App Store, while Disney+ took the second spot on Google Play.</p>

<p>Overall, the top 10 across both stores were YouTube, Disney+, Tinder, Pandora, Google One, Twitch, Bumble, HBO Max, Hulu and ESPN. These top earners indicate that consumers are willing to pay for their entertainment &#8212; like streaming services &#8212; on subscription, but it&#8217;s more difficult for other categories to break into the top charts. Dating apps. however, remain an exception.</p>
