										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cryptocurrency company <a href="https://www.circle.com">Circle</a> has <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/bringing-institutional-defi-to-the-world">announced</a> that it plans to launch a new API for companies using <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/circle-account">Circle accounts</a> to manage crypto assets — and in particular USDC stablecoins. The new API will let companies access decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols starting with <a href="https://compound.finance">Compound</a> lending pools.</p>
<p>Circle is better known as one of the founding members of the <a href="https://www.centre.io">Centre consortium</a> with Coinbase. Along with other <a href="https://www.centre.io/usdc">crypto partners</a>, they have issued USD Coin (USDC), a popular stablecoin.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with a fixed price. One USDC is always worth one USD. Auditing firms regularly check that issuers always keep as many USD in bank accounts as USDC in circulation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea behind USDC is that you can manipulate money more easily. According to USDC backers, moving money from one person to another should be as easy as sending bitcoin from one wallet to another. Circle has its own solution with Circle accounts. Account holders can programmatically send, receive and hold USDC using standard API calls.</p>
<p>In particular, Circle has built ramps to bridge the gap between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. With <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/payments">Payments</a>, you can accept card payments, bank transfers and USDC transactions. Everything arrives in your Circle account as USDC. Similarly with <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/payouts">Payouts</a>, you can send bank transfers from your Circle account.</p>
<p>Now, Circle also wants to help you access more features with your USDC currently in your Circle account. With the upcoming DeFi API, you’ll be able to access DeFi protocols without having to manually send USDC tokens to another wallet. Circle will start with the Compound protocol.</p>
<p>Compound manages crypto-based lending markets. Some users provide crypto assets and contribute to liquidity pools. Others borrow crypto assets — they first need to provide another type of crypto as collateral.</p>
<p>Users who lend money on Compound are rewarded with interest rates. For instance, when you supply USDC using the Compound protocol, you get 1.74% in annual percentage yield (APY). As USDC is a popular collateral for the Compound protocol, it makes sense that Circle is embracing the protocol with its business accounts. It&#8217;s an interesting addition to Circle&#8217;s treasury infrastructure.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">3/ We&#39;ve created a new API service that allows companies to automate fiat flows, USDC account flows and direct integration with and custody of yield and governance tokens.  Our first protocol launch is Compound Protocol.  More to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s competition watchdog, the CMA, has opened another investigation into Big Tech &#8212; this one targeted at Amazon and Google over how well they handle (or, well, don&#8217;t) fake reviews.</p>
<p>The Competition and Markets Authority has taken an interest in online reviews for several years, as far back as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-reviews-and-endorsements">2015</a>.</p>
<p>It also went after eBay and Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/21/ebay-and-facebook-told-to-tackle-trade-in-fake-reviews/">back in 2019</a> to try to squeeze the trade in fake reviews it found thriving on their marketplaces. After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/facebook-and-ebay-pledge-to-do-more-to-tackle-trade-in-fake-reviews-after-pressure-from-uk-regulator/">continuing to pressure</a> those platforms the watchdog was given pledges they&#8217;d do more. Albeit, in the case of Facebook, it took <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/facebook-takes-down-16000-groups-trading-fake-reviews-after-another-poke-by-uks-cma/">until April 2021</a> for it to take <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">down 16,000 groups that had been trading fake reviews &#8212; and the CMA expressed disappointment that it had taken Facebook over a year to take meaningful action.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4sEcmqDdme"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/facebook-and-ebay-pledge-to-do-more-to-tackle-trade-in-fake-reviews-after-pressure-from-uk-regulator/">Facebook and eBay pledge to do more to tackle trade in fake reviews after pressure from UK regulator</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook and eBay pledge to do more to tackle trade in fake reviews after pressure from UK regulator&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/facebook-and-ebay-pledge-to-do-more-to-tackle-trade-in-fake-reviews-after-pressure-from-uk-regulator/embed/#?secret=4sEcmqDdme" data-secret="4sEcmqDdme" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now the CMA has Amazon and Google in its sites, both of which control platforms hosting user reviews &#8212; saying it will be gathering evidence to determine whether they may have broken UK law by taking insufficient action to protect shoppers from fake reviews.</p>
<p>Businesses that mislead consumers or don&#8217;t take action to prevent consumers being misled may be in breach of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consumer-protection-from-unfair-trading-regulations-traders">UK laws intended to protect consumers from unfair trading</a>.</p>
<p>The CMA says its investigation into Amazon and Google follows an initial probe, which it started in May 2020, which was focused on assessing several platforms’ internal systems and processes for identifying and dealing with fake reviews.</p>
<p>That work raised specific concerns about whether the two tech giants have been doing enough to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detect fake and misleading reviews or suspicious patterns of behaviour. For example, where the same users have reviewed the same range of products or businesses at similar times to each other and there is no connection between those products or businesses – or where the review suggests that the reviewer has received a payment or other incentive to write a positive review.</li>
<li>Investigate and, where necessary, remove promptly fake and misleading reviews from their platforms.</li>
<li>Impose adequate sanctions on reviewers or businesses to deter them and others from posting fake or misleading reviews on their platforms – including those who have published these types of reviews many times.</li>
</ul>
<p>The regulator also said it&#8217;s concerned that Amazon’s systems have been &#8220;failing adequately to prevent and deter some sellers from manipulating product listings&#8221; &#8212; such as, for example, by co-opting positive reviews from other products.</p>
<p>And, well, who hasn&#8217;t been browsing product reviews on Amazon, only to be drawn up short by a reviewer earnestly referring to product attributes that clearly bear no relation to the sale item in question?</p>
<p>While the user reviews that pop up on, for example, Google Maps after a search for a local business can also display &#8216;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/ez85ve/why_google_reviews_is_a_complete_rubbish/">unusual patterns</a>&#8216; of 5-starring (or 1-starring) behaviour&#8230;</p>
<p>Commenting on its investigation into concerns that Amazon and Google are not doing enough to combat the problem of fake reviews the CMA&#8217;s CEO Andrea Coscelli had this to say, in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our worry is that millions of online shoppers could be misled by reading fake reviews and then spending their money based on those recommendations. Equally, it’s simply not fair if some businesses can fake 5-star reviews to give their products or services the most prominence, while law-abiding businesses lose out.</p>
<p class="last-child">&#8220;We are investigating concerns that Amazon and Google have not been doing enough to prevent or remove fake reviews to protect customers and honest businesses. It’s important that these tech platforms take responsibility and we stand ready to take action if we find that they are not doing enough.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazon and Google were contacted for comment.</p>
<p>A Google Spokesperson sent us this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/support.google.com/contributionpolicy/answer/7422880?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7422769__;!!FMox2LFwyA!-2uTNuqCyaVbOOzL7k599xUZ3vhBX2Ny5GrFs9xLyWfTCOqa-pQrmsE3ZCQBIXhDit4$" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/support.google.com/contributionpolicy/answer/7422880?hl%3Den%26ref_topic%3D7422769__;!!FMox2LFwyA!-2uTNuqCyaVbOOzL7k599xUZ3vhBX2Ny5GrFs9xLyWfTCOqa-pQrmsE3ZCQBIXhDit4$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624697241893000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZwEXp7DkVn_4x8w6K0W-VYT44Ig">strict policies</a> clearly state reviews must be based on real experiences, and when we find policy violations, we take action &#8212; from removing abusive content to disabling user accounts. We look forward to continuing our work with the CMA to share more on how our industry-leading technology and review teams work to help users find relevant and useful information on Google.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“To help earn the trust of customers, we devote significant resources to preventing fake or incentivized reviews from appearing in our store. We work hard to ensure that reviews accurately reflect the experience that customers have had with a product.<span class="m_3059772826490668927apple-converted-space">  </span>We will continue to assist the CMA with its enquiries and we note its confirmation that no findings have been made against our business. We are relentless in protecting our store and will take action to stop fake reviews regardless of the size or location of those who attempt this abuse.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/how-amazon-works/creating-a-trustworthy-reviews-experience?ots=1&amp;tag=arstech20-20&amp;linkCode=w50">blog post</a> earlier this month, Amazon &#8212; likely aware of the CMA&#8217;s attention on the issue &#8212; discussed the problem of bogus online reviews, claiming it &#8220;relentlessly innovates to allow only genuine product reviews in our store&#8221;; and offering up some illustrative stats (such as that, in 2020 alone, it stopped more than 200M &#8220;suspected fake reviews&#8221; before they were seen by any customers, mostly via the use of &#8220;proactive detection&#8221;).</p>
<p>However the blog post was also heavily on the defensive &#8212; with the ecommerce giant seeking to <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">spread the blame for the fake reviews problem &#8212; saying, for example, that there&#8217;s an &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">increasing trend of bad actors attempting to solicit fake reviews outside Amazon, particularly via social media services&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It sought to frame fake reviews as an industry-wide problem, needing a coordinated, industry-wide solution &#8212; while reserving its heaviest fire for (unnamed) &#8220;social media companies&#8221; (<em>cough</em> Facebook <em>cough</em>) &#8212; and suggesting, for example, that they are the weak link in the chain: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span>We need social media companies whose services are being used to facilitate fake reviews to proactively invest in fraud and fake review controls, partner with us to stop these bad actors, and help consumers shop with confidence. It will take constant innovation and partnership across industries and law enforcement to fully protect consumers and our honest selling partners.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s blog post also called for coordinated assistance from consumer protection regulators &#8220;around the world&#8221; to support its existing efforts to litigate against &#8220;bad actors&#8221;, aka &#8220;those who have purchased reviews and the service providers who provided them&#8221;.</p>
<p>The company also told us it has won &#8220;dozens&#8221; of injunctions against providers of fake reviews across Europe &#8212; adding that it won’t shy away from taking legal action.<span class="m_3059772826490668927apple-converted-space"> (It noted, for example, a lawsuit it filed on June 9 with the London Commercial Court a</span>gainst the owners of the websites, AMZ Tigers and TesterJob &#8212; seeking a prohibitory injunction and damages.)</p>
<p>In light of the CMA&#8217;s investigation being opened now, Amazon&#8217;s blog post calling for regulatory assistance to support litigation against purveyors of fake reviews looks like a pre-emptive plea to the CMA to swivel its gaze back onto Facebook&#8217;s marketplace &#8212; and check back in on how the trade in fake reviews is looking over there.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Qk2251BsRc"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/facebook-takes-down-16000-groups-trading-fake-reviews-after-another-poke-by-uks-cma/">Facebook takes down 16,000 groups trading fake reviews after another poke by UK&#8217;s CMA</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook takes down 16,000 groups trading fake reviews after another poke by UK&#8217;s CMA&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/facebook-takes-down-16000-groups-trading-fake-reviews-after-another-poke-by-uks-cma/embed/#?secret=Qk2251BsRc" data-secret="Qk2251BsRc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>We reached out to the CMA to ask whether its investigation into Amazon and Google will dig into the role that review trading groups hosted elsewhere, such as on social media platforms, may play in exacerbating the issue.</p>
<p>The regulator declined to comment on this point &#8212; but we understand the action into Amazon and Google is a separate investigation.</p>
<p>In terms of what could happen if, following the investigation, the CMA considers that the firms have broken UK consumer protection law it has a range of enforcement powers &#8212; which could include securing formal commitments from them to change the way they deal with fake reviews or escalating to court action if needed.</p>
<p>However, for now, it has not reached a view on whether Amazon and Google have broken the law.</p>
<p>The CMA has been increasingly active in regulating Big Tech as it dials up attention on digital markets to prepare for planned UK reforms to competition law that look set to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">usher in an ex ante regime</a> for dealing with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">competition-denting platform power</a>.</p>
<p>The watchdog has a number of other open investigations into Big Tech &#8212; including into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">Google&#8217;s planned deprecation of tracking cookies</a>. It also recently initiated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/uks-cma-opens-market-study-into-apple-googles-mobile-duopoly/">a market study</a> into Apple and Google&#8217;s dominance of the mobile ecosystem.</p>
<p>Given the watchdog&#8217;s focus on major platforms &#8212; as well as its long standing interest in fake reviews &#8212; it&#8217;s interesting to speculate whether iOS maker Apple may not face some UK scrutiny on this issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/">Concerns have also been raised</a> over fake ratings and reviews on its App Store.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, for example, iOS app developer, Kosta Eleftheriou, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">filed suit against Apple</a> &#8212; alleging it enticed developers to build apps by claiming the App Store is a safe and trustworthy place but that it doesn’t protect legitimate developers against scammers profiting from their hard work.</p>
<p>The CMA already has an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">open investigation into Apple&#8217;s App Store</a>. So it will be paying close attention to aspects of the store, saying back in March that it would be investigating whether Apple imposes unfair or anti-competitive terms on developers &#8212; which then ultimately result in users having less choice or paying higher prices for apps and add-ons.</p>
<p>For now, though, the watchdog&#8217;s attention toward the fake reviews issue has been publicly focused elsewhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian online learning platform Unacademy is in advanced talks to acquire Rheo TV, a less than two-year-old startup founded by two former Unacademy employees, according to three sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The current deal values <a href="https://rheo.com">Rheo TV</a>, a startup that has built a platform to help professional game streamers live stream their gameplays and monetize those feeds, at over $10 million, one of the sources said. The deal proposes Rheo TV&#8217;s team of fewer than a dozen people to join Unacademy.</p>
<p>The younger startup counts Lightspeed India Partners, Sequoia Capital India’s Surge, as well as the founding team of Unacademy &#8212; Gaurav Munjal, Hemesh Singh, and Roman Saini &#8212; among its existing investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Munjal and Sequoia Capital India declined to comment. A founder of Rheo TV didn’t immediately respond.</p>
<p>As tens of millions of college students come online and play games, the startup is betting that many of them, provided platforms are able to help them make a living, will consider streaming their gameplays as a viable career option.</p>
<p>Streamers on Rheo TV, which offers several features similar to those of Twitch, are currently rewarded based on their gameplays, followerbase, and past performance in different tournaments.</p>
<p>If the deal materializes, it would be the latest acquisition by Unacademy, the Bangalore-based startup that has amassed over 5 million monthly active users in over 10,000 cities in India.</p>
<p>In the past two years, the Facebook, Tiger Global, and SoftBank-backed startup has acquired WiFi Study, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/unacademy-prepladder-india/">PrepLadder</a>, Coursavy, and led a strategic investment in Mastree.</p>
<p>The startup, which also operates creator platform Graphy, this week unveiled a fund worth over $13 million to help applicants kickstart their online school.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s online education market is estimated to grow to $19.7 billion by 2030, up from $1 billion last year, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a recent report.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stock in many American companies, like Amazon, Alphabet or Tesla, can host hundreds or thousands of dollars per share. Fractional trading, or buying part of a single share through a brokerage, makes them more accessible—at least to people within the United States. Investors in other countries, however, often have to pay high fees through interactive brokers. <a href="https://www.heygotrade.com/">Gotrade</a> makes fractional trading of U.S. stocks available to people in 150 countries, and charges a minimum of just one dollar.</p>
<p>The startup announced it has raised $7 million in seed funding led by LocalGlobe, with participation from Social Leverage, Y Combinator, Picus Capital and Raptor Group. The round also included angel investors like Matt Robinson, co-founder of GoCardless; Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas, former chief product officer of Skyscanner; Frank Strauss, former head of Deutsche Bank’s global digital business; and Joel Yarbrough, Asia-Pacific head at Rapyd.</p>
<p>GoTrade was founded in 2019 by David Grant, Norman Wanto and Rohit Mulani. Its app launched three months ago and is currently invite-only. Gotrade claims sign-ups have grown 20% week-on-week, and it now has more than 100,000 users spread across the world. About 65% of Gotrade’s users have traded stocks before, while the rest are first-time investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mulani, the company’s chief executive officer, told TechCrunch that the idea for Gotrade was planted when he became interested in American stocks, but discovered many barriers to trading.</p>
<p>“When I was 18, I actually looked to get access in Singapore, and banks were charging $30 per trade. Effectively, the market taught me that I could not get into the market. Fast forward ten years, I decided to look into it again, and the banks were still charging $25 a trade,” he said. “On top of that, their user interfaces were something I didn’t want to look at. So we decided to build a brokerage platform where anyone can get access.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Fractional trading actually came a bit later,” he added. “That was the real MVP for us because fractional really makes investing accessible to anyone globally since all you need is one dollar.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/robinhood-fractional-share/">Robinhood</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/sofi-nears-deal-to-go-public-in-merger-with-chamath-palihapitiyas-newest-spac/">SoFi</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/29/stash-investing/">Stash</a> all feature fractional trading, but Mulani said those apps are primarily used by U.S. residents. On the other hand, Gotrade is not available to U.S. residents because of financial regulations, so its main competitors are interactive brokers, Saxo Bank and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/trading-platform-etoro-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-10b-deal/">eToro</a>.</p>
<p>Gotrade does not charge commission, custody, inactivity or dividend fees. Instead, it monetizes by collecting a small fee on the currency exchange from deposits, and interest generated from uninvested cash in brokerage accounts. The app is free to use, but plans to add a premium paid subscription program and virtual debit card that users can link to their accounts.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Trading platform eToro to go public via SPAC merger in $10B deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/trading-platform-etoro-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-10b-deal/embed/#?secret=Rt1a4aAoJW" data-secret="Rt1a4aAoJW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Many of Gotrade’s users are people who have invested in their local stock markets, but weren’t able to trade U.S. stocks before. They vary widely in age, but 25- to 34-year-olds are the app’s biggest segment, and the average account size is about $500.</p>
<p>Gotrade acts as an introducing broker to Alpaca Securities LLC, a U.S. stock brokerage that is regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and serves as an intermediary. Alpaca Securities splits its stock inventory into fractions, and Gotrade users can decide how many fractions they want to buy. The app also allows them to set a budget, and automatically calculates the amount of fractional shares they can afford through notional value trading.</p>
<p>User accounts are protected up to $500,000 by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and money goes through counterparties regulated in Singapore, like Rapyd, and the United States, including Alpaca and First Republic Bank. To protect users, Gotrade works only with fully-funded cash accounts without any margin facility. Mulani explained that a margin account effectively means people are borrowing money to invest, while a fully-funded account means that a user can only invest the money they have already deposited in their account. FINRA and Securities Exchange Commission regulations also mean accounts under $25,000 can only day trade, or buy and sell a security on the same day, up to three times every five trading days.</p>
<p>Like many investment apps aimed at first-time or relatively new traders, Gotrade includes educational content, like pop-ups with definitions for investment terms, and news articles about publicly-traded companies. Its new funding will be used for hiring and product development, with a strong focus on adding more in-app content.</p>
<p>In a statement, LocalGlobe partner Remus Brett said, “Over the past 100 years, U.S. stocks have delivered average annual returns of 10%. With compounding, an investment of $1,000 back then would be worth $13 million today. These returns have fueled wealth creation in the U.S. and other developed markets but most of the world has missed out. We believe Gotrade has the potential to help the world’s 99% gain access the same benefits that the 1% have. We are incredibly excited to be joining Rohit, David and Norman on this journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Podcast downloads have <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/03/podcast-listenership-download-data-on-the-rise.html">boomed</a> over the last year, and Kayak co-founder and tech entrepreneur Paul English became an avid, daily listener. But anyone who loves podcasts knows that podcast discovery can be challenging. Even the top streaming apps like Apple Podcasts and Spotify lack robust discovery tools &#8212; so last week, when Spotify acquired the podcast discovery app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/spotify-acquires-podz-a-podcast-discovery-app/">Podz</a>, it validated the industry&#8217;s growing need for an easier way to uncover new shows.</p>
<p>Today, English launched <a href="https://www.moonbeam.fm/">Moonbeam</a>, a podcast discovery app that blends machine learning and human curation to present personalized recommendations. This might sound like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/podz-launch/">what Podz is doing</a>, creating a newsfeed-style stream of content that users might like. But Moonbeam ups the ante by creating a creator-friendly platform, allowing podcast hosts to select clips of their show to feature on the app, too. The app also lets fans send a tip to the creator if they like their show enough (Moonbeam won&#8217;t take a cut, but there&#8217;s still that pesky <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/apple-digs-in-heels-over-its-app-store-commission-structure-with-release-of-new-study/">in-app purchase fee</a> for podcasters to consider).</p>

<p>&#8220;Podz is one approach for discovery, but I think that there needs to be a lot of people working on this problem,&#8221; English told TechCrunch. &#8220;One thing that I think differentiates Moonbeam from Podz is that we have human editors.&#8221;</p>
<p>English was inspired by TikTok, which has become so ubiquitous in part because of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/tiktok-explains-how-the-recommendation-system-behind-its-for-you-feed-works/">its sophisticated discovery algorithm</a>. As an engineer, he would often redesign apps for fun, like Instagram or Twitter. But as he became interested in podcasting, he wanted to create an app that works like TikTok, but helps people find new podcasts. On the Beam section of the app, which is the equivalent of the For You page on TikTok, users are presented with clips of about a few minutes long. Based on how you interact with them, the algorithm learns what kind of podcasts you might want to see.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170110" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170110" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170110" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/08-Create.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/08-Create.jpg 2700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/08-Create.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/08-Create.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/08-Create.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/08-Create.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/08-Create.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/08-Create.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/08-Create.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/08-Create.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/08-Create.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/08-Create.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/08-Create.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170110" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://moonbeam.fm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moonbeam <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Machine learning can find better content for you than your friends can. We might find someone in Germany who has the same funny sense of humor you do, which might be a bit different than even your closet friends,&#8221; said English. &#8220;Machine learning is all about user clustering, where we find users that interacted with Moonbeam in ways similar to you. If we find users who like similar things that you like, we can share shows that they listen to on Moonbeam.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s tricky about apps like Moonbeam is that it will only get better as more people use the app. In its early stages &#8212; to be fair, the app launched today &#8212; many of the podcast recommendations come from relatively established shows. But with so many podcasts in existence (not every show is produced by NPR!), the challenge isn&#8217;t discovering &#8220;This American Life.&#8221; It&#8217;s finding emerging creators that might not get a shot in the podcasting industry without the backing of a major production studio. That&#8217;s what makes TikTok so valuable for creators &#8212; it&#8217;s very possible to become a viral sensation over night. What if there was an app that did that for podcasters?</p>
<p>Moonbeam plans to roll out software updates every two weeks, which will introduce a series of tools that allow listeners to interact with the teams behind their favorite podcasts. The first of these features &#8212; which is already in-app &#8212; is tipping. Soon, fans and podcasters alike will be able to make their own clips to share on the app. For now, podcast hosts who navigate to <a href="http://moonbeam.fm">Moonbeam&#8217;s website</a> can claim their show and create clips of it. It&#8217;s a bit clunkier to navigate than an app like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/sparemin-headliner/">Headliner</a>, but it&#8217;s functional.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s going to be a whole bunch of other tools we&#8217;re adding between the listener and the host,&#8221; said English. &#8220;Building that relationship is really important, and we want to do it directly in the player. We don&#8217;t want you to have to go to Facebook or some other site.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moonbeam can also function as a podcatcher, since you can listen to full episodes in the app and search for specific shows, even if they don&#8217;t appear on your Beam – but while podcatchers are abundant, good discovery apps aren&#8217;t. Hopefully, Moonbeam can help change that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.archer.com/">Archer Aviation</a> is ramping up its defense against claims by rival <a href="https://wisk.aero/">Wisk Aero</a> that it misappropriated trade secrets. Archer, which unveiled its Maker eVTOL earlier this month, alleged in a court filing late Wednesday that Wisk learned of Archer’s aircraft design weeks before it filed its patent design application – effectively reversing claims that it stole Wisk’s design.</p>
<p>Wisk claimed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/wisk-aero-sues-archer-aviation-for-alleged-patent-infringement-trade-secret-theft/">in its April lawsuit</a> that its design is nearly identical to Archer’s, and that the similarities are the result of a former Wisk employee (who was later hired by Archer) stealing proprietary work files. In this new filing, Archer alleged that it shared its plans for a 12-rotor tilting design with Geoff Long, a senior engineer at Wisk, whom Archer was considering recruiting. Archer alleges that Long shared Archer’s plans with Wisk executives weeks before Wisk filed its patent application.</p>
<p>Still following? Archer also says that it hired a third party to conduct a forensic analysis, which found no evidence of any of the allegedly stolen documents on Archer’s systems or the devices belonging to the former Wisk-now-Archer employee.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The filing was made in response to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/wisk-aero-files-injunction-in-trade-secret-lawsuit-against-archer-aviation/">an injunction Wisk filed in May</a>, requesting that the court immediately prohibit its rival from using any of the 52 trade secrets it alleges were stolen. It’s a request that could have potentially catastrophic effects on Archer, as the company itself admits in the filing. Archer argues that approving the injunction would take it “offline indefinitely” and pose a “grave danger” to Archer and its network of partners and suppliers.</p>
<p>“Wisk’s legal and media blitz is threatening to derail Archer’s anticipated merger and its business partnerships and compelling Archer to redirect significant resources to defend this lawsuit,” Archer says in the filing. The company further requested that if an injunction should be granted, it should also require a $1.1 billion bond – which Wisk would have to pay should the court ultimately side with Archer.</p>
<p>Wisk, in response to the filing, sent the following statement to TechCrunch: “Archer&#8217;s latest filing is full of inaccuracies and attempts to distract from the serious and broad scope of misappropriation claims it faces. The filing changes nothing. We look forward to continuing our case in court to demonstrate Archer’s improper use of Wisk’s intellectual property.”</p>
<p>The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California under case no. 5:21-cv-2450.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 24, 2021. There’s an ocean of tech news to get through today, but up top if you care about the advertising market, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/is-google-about-to-delay-its-depreciation-of-tracking-cookies/">head here first</a>. Google is pushing back cookiegeddon, and the decision could impact companies from the smallest startup to, well, Google. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/instagram-post-from-desktop/">Instagram’s slow embrace of computers continues:</a></strong> After a long history of being a mobile-first, or mobile-only product, Instagram is now testing the “ability to create a Feed post on Instagram with [a] desktop browser,” the company told TechCrunch. As a PC user, huzzah.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/5-takeaways-from-buzzfeeds-spac-deck/">BuzzFeed is going public:</a></strong> Digital media company BuzzFeed is going public via a SPAC at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Want to know why it’s worth that much? We’ve got you covered. (Don’t forget that BuzzFeed raised hundreds of millions of dollars while private.)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/companies-navigate-ethical-minefield-to-build-proof-of-vaccination-apps/">How some companies are working on vaccine passports despite the controversy:</a> </strong>TechCrunch’s <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron Miller</a> dove into the world of vaccine passports, the tech companies that are backing them and how they’re handling a dicey political environment. It’s a great read.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/a16zs-new-2-2b-fund-wont-just-bet-on-the-crypto-future-it-will-defend-it/">Doubling down on crypto:</a> </strong>The a16z investing house is redoubling its bet in the crypto economy with a new $2.2 billion fund. And the venture capital firm is going to do more than just write checks: It intends to take part in crypto projects and even help clear regulatory brush for the sector. It’s a big commitment.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/visa-to-acquire-open-banking-platform-tink-for-more-than-2-billion/">Visa tries again:</a> </strong>After Visa’s deal to acquire fintech API provider Plaid died, you might have thought that the American payments giant would have thrown in the towel on big deals. Nope. Visa is dropping $2.15 billion to buy Tink, a company that TechCrunch described as “a leading fintech startup in Europe focused on open banking application programming interfaces,” or APIs.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/psychedelic-vr-meditation-startup-tripp-raises-11-million-series-a/"><strong>Don’t trip about Tripp’s (virtual) trips:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Tripp, a startup that wants to provide mental-health services via VR that mimic psychedelic experiences sans drugs, has just raised $11 million. If that sounds far out, understand that some startups are flat-out working with psychedelic drugs for different therapeutic approaches to mental health. So, this is the less aggressive version of the idea. Because VR is pretty neat, we dig it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/tonkean-raises-50m-series-b/"><strong>The intersection of no-code, automation and humans:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s where Tonkean plays. The company’s software helps ops teams at startups build automated business logic across applications, allowing data to flow between them. And it allows for humans to be in the loop, separating its offerings from what UiPath and other RPA companies offer. Oh, and Tonkean just closed a $50 million round.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/jw-player-raises-100m-to-build-subscriptions-and-other-monetization-tools-around-its-video-software/"><strong>The online video boom powers JW Player to $100M in new capital:</strong></a><strong> </strong>While not quite yet a unicorn, JW Player’s nine-figure round caught TechCrunch’s attention. The company sells a video platform for publishers and others, and it had a good 2020. COVID led to a boom in video watching, so the company’s recent growth is not a huge surprise. And now it has a tower of new capital to fuel even more expansion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reform your startup’s meeting culture</h2>
<p>Meetings should have a clear purpose, but at many startups, they&#8217;ve become a way to perform in front of a crowd instead of share information.</p>
<p>Workplace politics can make the matter even more complicated: How secure do you feel declining a meeting invitation from a co-worker, or worse yet, from a manager?</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time a recurring meeting is added to a calendar, a kitten dies,&#8221; says Chuck Phillips, co-founder of MeetWell. &#8220;Very few employees decline meetings, even when it’s obvious that the meeting is going to be a doozy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Changing your meeting culture is difficult, but given that 26% of workers plan to look for a new job when the pandemic ends, startups need to do all they can to retain talent. Here are four actionable steps that will help you boost productivity and say goodbye to poorly run, lazily planned meetings.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today was a big day for Microsoft, so we’ll start there, yeah? Here are TechCrunch’s notes from the day’s Windows 11 event:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/android-apps-are-coming-to-windows-11-through-the-amazon-appstore/"><strong>Android apps are coming to Windows:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Via the Amazon store, but still. Microsoft’s effort over time to make its operating system more open reached a new zenith today with the news that Windows 11 will support a host of Android apps. We want to play with it before we grade it, but the idea is super neat.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/microsoft-teams-will-be-built-directly-into-windows-11/"><strong>We hope you like Teams:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Microsoft is all-in on Teams, so much so that it’s getting the Windows treatment. TechCrunch reports that “Windows 11 will have Microsoft Teams built in, in a bid to compete more directly with communication platforms like Apple’s FaceTime.” Honestly, Teams is way better than Skype was, so that sounds fine. It does prickle our antitrust early warning system, however.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/microsoft-announces-windows-11-generally-available-by-the-holidays/"><strong>It’ll be a Windows Christmas:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Per Microsoft, Windows 11 should land later this year. In time for Christmas, it turns out. So if you are a gamer or a corporate drone or merely someone who prefers the Microsoft approach to computing, get hyped. The new build is coming your way, and quickly. If you can’t wait, there are leaks out there. But don’t install those on a computer with data you actually need.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next up, a little from Google:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/google-and-jio-platforms-announce-worlds-cheapest-smartphone-jiophone-next/"><strong>Google and Jio team up for a budget smartphone:</strong></a> The JioPhone Next, a low-cost Android smartphone, could help the next few hundred million folks in India get online with faster service if the telco and American tech giant have their way. Jio wants more mobile subscribers, and Google wants more internet users, period. Call it a match made in heaven, provided that the hardware is good.</li>
</ul>
<p>And to close out, one for the Zoomers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/snap-makes-a-deal-with-universal-music-group-adding-its-catalog-to-sounds/"><strong>Ephemeral tunes?</strong></a> In today’s TikTok world, having access to popular music is a must for social networks. So it’s not a surprise to see Snap close a multiyear deal with Universal Music Group. Snapper, rejoice!</li>
</ul>

<p>TechCrunch is building a shortlist of the top growth marketers in tech. If you’re a founder, we’d love to hear who you’ve worked with. <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">Fill out the survey here.</a></p>
<p>Here’s one of the many excellent recommendations we’ve received:</p>
<p><strong>Name of marketer: </strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylanmax/">Dylan Max</a></p>
<p><strong>Name of recommender: </strong>Kris Rudeegraap, <a href="http://sendoso.com">Sendoso</a></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> “Dylan Max&#8217;s creativity is what sets him apart from 99% of those that practice growth marketing. One of his first campaigns went viral on LinkedIn. We ran a special campaign where we sent real cans of Spam to the best marketers and salespeople (our target demographic), with the idea that traditional spamming has become impersonal and we&#8217;re out to change that. Those that were nominated could &#8220;spam&#8221; other marketers or salespeople in their network, leading to a viral sensation that took over LinkedIn. We got a ton of business from it and our sales team still lists it as one of the most creative ways to leverage direct mail and gifting. Today it is still LinkedIn&#8217;s most viral grassroots campaign in the B2B space. Dylan is part of a rare breed of growth marketers, excelling in many different marketing channels including SEO, paid search, conversion rate optimization (CRO) and A/B testing. Dylan also spun up our first ever ABM campaign where we leveraged hypertargeted social media ads to earn seven-figure revenue on less than $20,000 of ad spend. I love his hackiness and he needs to be on this list.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Regularly testing waterways and reservoirs is a never-ending responsibility for utility companies and municipal safety authorities, and generally — as you might expect — involves either a boat or at least a pair of waders. <a href="https://www.nixiedip.com">Nixie</a> does the job with a drone instead, making the process faster, cheaper and a lot less wet.</p>
<p>The most common methods of testing water quality haven&#8217;t changed in a long time, partly because they&#8217;re effective and straightforward, and partly because really, what else are you going to do? No software or web platform out there is going to reach into the middle of the river and pull out a liter of water.</p>
<p>But with the advent of drones powerful and reliable enough to deploy in professional and industrial circumstances, the situation has changed. Nixie is a solution by the drone specialists at Reign Maker, involving either a custom-built sample collection arm or an in-situ sensor arm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The sample collector is basically a long vertical arm with a locking cage for a sample container. You put the empty container in there, fly the drone out to the location, then submerge the arm. When it flies back, the filled container can be taken out while the drone hovers and a fresh one put in its place to bring to the next spot. (This switch can be done safely in winds up to 18 MPH and sampling in currents up to 5 knots, the company said.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170077" style="width: 717px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nixie-dip.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170077" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170077" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nixie-dip.jpg" alt="A drone dips a sample container in a river." width="707" height="344" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nixie-dip.jpg 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nixie-dip.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nixie-dip.jpg?resize=300,146 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nixie-dip.jpg?resize=680,331 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nixie-dip.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170077" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reign Maker</p></div></p>
<p>This allows for quick sampling at multiple locations — the drone&#8217;s battery will last about 20 minutes, enough for two to four samples depending on the weather and distance. Swap the battery out and drive to the next location and do it all again.</p>
<p>For comparison, Reign Maker pointed to New York&#8217;s water authority, which collects 30 samples per day from boats and other methods, at an approximate cost (including labor, boat fuel, etc) of $100 per sample. Workers using Nixie were able to collect an <em>average</em> of 120 samples per day, for around $10 each. Sure, New York is probably among the higher cost locales for this (like everything else) but the deltas are pretty huge. (The dipper attachment itself costs $850, but doesn&#8217;t come with a drone.)</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that the drone is not operating autonomously; it has a pilot who will be flying with line of sight (which simplifies regulations and requirements). But even so, that means a team of two, with a handful of spare batteries, can cover the same space  that would normally take a boat crew and more than a little fuel. Currently the system works with the M600 and M300 RTK drones from DJI.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170083" style="width: 339px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nixie-dash.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170083" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2170083" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nixie-dash.png" alt="Mockup of the Nixie water testing app showing readings for various locations." width="329" height="612" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nixie-dash.png 329w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nixie-dash.png?resize=81,150 81w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nixie-dash.png?resize=161,300 161w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nixie-dash.png?resize=27,50 27w" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170083" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reign Maker</p></div></p>
<p>The drone method has the added benefits of having precise GPS locations for each sample and of not disturbing the water when it dips in. No matter how carefully you step or pilot a boat, you&#8217;re going to be pushing the water all over the place, potentially affecting the contents of the sample, but that&#8217;s not the case if you&#8217;re hovering overhead.</p>
<p>In development is <a href="https://www.nixiedip.com/nixie-advanced">a smarter version of the sampler</a> that includes a set of sensors that can do on-site testing for all the most common factors: temperature, pH, troubling organisms, various chemicals. Skipping the step of bringing the water back to a lab for testing streamlines the process immensely, as you might expect.</p>
<p>Right now Reign Maker is working with New York&#8217;s Department of Environmental Protection and in talks with other agencies. While the system would take some initial investment, training, and getting used to, it&#8217;s probably hard not to be tempted by the possibility of faster <em>and</em> cheaper testing.</p>
<p>Ultimately the company hopes to offer (in keeping with the zeitgeist) a more traditional SaaS offering involving water quality maps updating in real time with new testing. That too is still in the drawing-board phase, but once a few customers sign up it starts looking a lot more attractive.</p>

<p>The GOAT Group parent company shared today that it has raised $195 million in a Series F raise valuing the fashion giant at some $3.7 billion. The raise was led by a handful of hedge funds and P/E firms including Park West Asset Management, <span class="xn-person">Franklin Templeton</span>, Adage Capital Management, Ulysses Management and funds &amp; accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates.</p>
<p>GOAT has surgically defined a corner of fashion commerce outside of Amazon&#8217;s purview while growing the appeal of street wear and sneakers to a broader audience of consumers. GOAT Group has now raised just shy of $500 million in total.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This round more than doubles the $1.8 billion valuation GOAT Group reached in its Series E fundraise last year. Like other online marketplaces, GOAT saw major growth last year, expanding its audience of buyers and sellers while seeing 100% year-over-year growth in its sneaker business and 500% year-over-year growth for its newer apparel business.</p>
<p>GOAT details some 30 million &#8220;members&#8221; and 600,000 sellers across its platform. In a press release, the company detailed its peer-to-peer marketplace has reached some $2 billion in gross merchandise volume.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In many industries, <a href="https://databricks.com/">Databricks</a> has become synonymous with modern data warehousing and data lakes. Since it&#8217;s exactly these technologies that are at the core of what modern businesses are doing around operationalizing their data, data engineering and building machine-learning models &#8212; and since Databricks is at the forefront of startups that offer these services on a SaaS-like platform, who better to join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=databricks&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=databrickseditpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS on October 27</a> than Databricks co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi.</p>
<p>Ghodsi co-founded Databricks together with a handful of partners in 2013 with the idea of commercializing the open-source Apache Spark analytics engine for big data processing. As is the case with so many open-source companies, Ghodsi, who has a Ph.D. from KTH/Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden and whose <a href="http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/resultList.jsf?dswid=7809552&amp;af=%5B%5D&amp;aq=%5B%5B%7B%22personId%22%3A%22u1oux2k2%22%7D%5D%5D&amp;aqe=%5B%5D&amp;aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&amp;language=en&amp;query=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a> focused on distributed computing, was one of the original developers of the Spark engine. At Databricks, he first served as the company&#8217;s VP of Engineering and Product Management before being named CEO in 2016.</p>
<p>Under his leadership, Databricks has reached a $28 billion valuation and has now raised a total of $1.9 billion. The company&#8217;s bets on open source, data and AI are clearly paying off and unlike some of its competitors, Databricks has done a good job staying ahead of the trends (and had a bit of luck given that some of those trends, including the rise of machine learning, really benefitted the company, too).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite consistent rumors of Microsoft and others trying to acquire the company in recent years, Ghodsi and his board have clearly decided that they want to remain independent. Instead, Databricks has shrewdly partnered with all of the big cloud players, starting with Microsoft, which actually gave the service the kind of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/15/microsoft-makes-databricks-a-first-party-service-on-azure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prime placement</a> in its Azure cloud computing service and user interface that was previously unheard of. Most recently, the company brought its platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/databricks-brings-its-lakehouse-to-google-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Google Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Ghodsi will join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=databricks&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=databrickseditpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS</a> to talk about building his company, raising funding at crazy valuations and what the future of data management in the AI space looks like.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In my role at CloudBlue, Fortune 500 companies often approach me for help with solving technology challenges while shifting to a subscription business model, only to realize that they have not taken crucial organizational steps necessary to ensure a successful transition.</p>
<p>Subscriptions scale better, enhance customer experience and hold the promise of recurring and more predictable revenue streams — a pretty enticing prospect for any business. This business model is predominant in software as a service (SaaS), but it is hard to find an industry that doesn&#8217;t have a successful subscription story. A growing number of companies in sectors ranging from automotive, airlines, gaming and health to wellness, education, professional development and home maintenance have been introducing subscription services in recent years.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Legacy companies accustomed to pay-as-you-go models may assume shifting to a subscription model is just a sales issue. They are wrong.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>However, businesses should be aware that the subscription model is much more than simply putting a monthly or annual price tag on their offering. Executives cannot just layer a subscription model on top of an existing business. They need to change the entire operation process, onboard all stakeholders, recalibrate their strategy and create a subscription culture.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/08/03/strategies-and-practices-for-transformation-to-a-subscription-business-model/?sh=7def2e484460">70%</a> of business leaders believe subscriptions will be key to their future, only <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/technology-sector/ownership-or-consumption-how-will-it-strengthen-your-business">55% of companies believe they’re ready for the transition</a>. Before talking technology, which is an enabler, companies should first address the following core issues to holistically plan and switch to a recurring revenue model.</p>
<h2>Get internal stakeholders involved</h2>
<p>Legacy companies accustomed to pay-as-you-go models may assume shifting to a subscription model is just a sales issue. They are wrong. Such a migration will affect nearly all departments across an organization, from product development and manufacturing to finance, sales, marketing and customer service. Leaders must therefore get all stakeholders motivated for the change and empower them to actively prepare for the transformation. The better you prepare, the smoother the transition.</p>
<p>But as we know, people naturally do not like change, even if it is for their own good. So it can be a formidable task to secure the cooperation of all internal stakeholders, which, depending on the size of your company, could number in the thousands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After years of solely focusing on its mobile product, Instagram is at long last thinking about letting users post from their computers. A number of Twitter uses <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1408068647025664025">noticed</a> that the test feature had gone live Thursday, and Instagram confirmed the test to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that many people access Instagram from their computer,&#8221; an Instagram spokesperson said. &#8220;To improve that experience, we’re now testing the ability to create a Feed post on Instagram with their desktop browser.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Instagram?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Instagram</a> is rolling out the ability to create posts from the desktop website <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f973.png" alt="🥳" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&mdash; Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1408069664085659660?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Why now? Apparently over the course of the pandemic, the company saw a rise in people cruising Instagram from their computers rather than their phones.</p>
<p>To see if the test is live for you, head to Instagram in your browser and look for a new &#8220;plus&#8221; icon in the icon tray on the top right. The test isn&#8217;t available to everyone and it only allows users to create posts for the main feed.</p>
<p>The new test feature is the company&#8217;s most recent sign of life for its desktop product: Instagram added the ability to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/instagram-stories-are-coming-to-the-web/">view Stories on the web in 2017</a> and<a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/engineering/launching-instagram-messaging-on-desktop"> added direct messaging to desktop</a> late last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; We haven&#8217;t found any evidence that the Instagram desktop web experience cannibalizes engagement from the native apps,&#8221; a data scientist with Instagram observed with the launch of web messaging.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, it’s quite the opposite — users who use both interfaces spend more time on each interface, compared to users who use each interface exclusively.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As an increasing number of startups sell investors on mobile apps that help consumers prioritize well-being and mindfulness, other startups are looking for a more immersive take that allows users to fully disconnect from the world around them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tripp.com/">Tripp</a> has been building immersive relaxation exercises that seek to blend some of the experiences users may find in guided meditation apps with more free-form experiences that allow users to unplug from their day and explore their thoughts inside a virtual reality headset while watching fractal shapes, glowing trees and planets whir past them.</p>
<p>As the name implies, there have been some efforts by the startup to create visuals and audio experiences that mimic the feelings people may have during a psychedelic trip &#8212; though doing so sans hallucinogens.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Many people that will never feel comfortable taking a psychedelic, this is a low-friction alternative that can deliver some of that experience in a more benign way,&#8221; CEO Nanea Reeves tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The idea is to take mindfulness structures and video game mechanics together to see if we can actually hack the way that you feel.&#8221;</p>

<p>VR startups have largely struggled to earn investor fervor in recent years, as major tech platforms have sunsetted their virtual reality efforts one-by-one leaving Facebook and Sony as the sole benefactors of a space that they are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebooks-entry-into-vr-advertising-isnt-going-too-well/">still struggling to monetize </a>at times. While plenty of VR startups are continuing to see engagement, many investors that backed companies in the space five years ago have turned their attention to gaming and computer vision startups with more broad applications.</p>
<p>Reeves says that the pandemic has helped consumers dial into the importance of mindfulness and mental health awareness, something that has also pushed investors to get bolder in what projects in the space that they&#8217;re backing.</p>
<p>Tripp has apps on both the Oculus and PlayStation VR stores and subscription experiences that can be accessed for a $4.99 per month subscription.</p>
<p>The company provides a variety of guided experiences, but users can also use the company&#8217;s &#8220;Tripp composer&#8221; to build their own visual flows.</p>
<p>Beyond customization, one of Tripp&#8217;s major sells is giving consumers deeper, quicker meditative experiences, claiming that users can alleviate stress with sessions as short as eight minutes inside their headset.</p>
<p>The startup is also exploring the platform&#8217;s use in enterprise in-office wellness solutions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Tripp is currently in the midst of clinical trials to study the software platform&#8217;s effectiveness as a therapeutic device.</p>
<p>The company says that users have gone through over 2 million sessions inside the app so far.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikki-dominguez/">Nikki Dominguez</a> is the co-founder and president of <a href="https://handsomeapp.com/">Handsome</a>, an app that provides beauty professionals with equal career opportunities. She also built two beauty academies and one school and turned a team of 70 into a team of more than 150 stylists.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">When the pandemic struck last year, the fundraising world turned upside down. Due to shifting priorities, investors had to commit to taking care of their portfolio companies, the majority of which were led by white men.</p>
<p>Any funding opportunities we had in the pipeline evaporated. This was especially true for investors considering attempts to reach new and underrepresented founders.</p>
<p>But the fundraising market came back pretty quickly in 2020 &#8212; for some. And though we are thrilled to have closed a $1.5 million pre-seed round in the middle of a pandemic, the challenges we faced in the past continued. The spotlight only turned back on minority founders after the Black Lives Matter movement took off last summer, and we began to pursue fundraising again in late 2020. We could tell by how investors interacted with our pitch deck or asked us questions that they already had preconceived ideas about us and our business.</p>
<p>We were in our second year of running <a href="https://handsomeapp.com/">Handsome</a> and had traction similar to, if not better than, other male-centric startups that were getting funded, yet we still ran into friction when fundraising. The hard part was that we didn’t have any concrete evidence as to why, or the extent to which, fundraising was harder for minority and female teams outside of our apparent challenges and personal experiences. Men are allowed to have a vision or an idea on the back of a cocktail napkin, while women need to have fully established businesses and revenue streams.</p>
<h2>The evidence is in the analytics</h2>
<p>DocSend, a tool that we and thousands of other startups use to send out pitch decks to investors, analyzed how investors interact with pitch decks. A recent DocSend <a href="https://try.docsend.com/funding-divide-report">study</a> confirmed our hunch, finding that investors do indeed scrutinize the decks of businesses founded by women and minorities differently.</p>
<p>For instance, their data showed investors spent 20% longer on the business model section of decks from all-female teams at the pre-seed stage than all-male teams. While more time spent on a particular section of a deck may seem to indicate more interest, it can actually be a sign of greater scrutiny and skepticism.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			We could tell by how investors interacted with our pitch deck or asked us questions that they already had preconceived ideas about us and our business.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>When you look at the makeup of the average VC you are pitching to, it is likely a middle-aged white man. When pitching Handsome — something that’s reimagining the education and community of the beauty industry — you can imagine that most VCs don’t understand the value and opportunity at hand. Although beauty is a $190 billion global industry ($60 billion alone in the U.S.), investors who don’t follow this industry might have a hard time understanding how big it is, how the industry works, and how our business fits into this thriving market. Even further, investors might completely discredit our business because of the “beauty” label.</p>
<p>All these factors can lead to more time spent analyzing the business model &#8212; and its viability &#8212; articulated in our pitch deck. In reality, VCs are busy, and if they’re spending more time on the fundamentals of your business, they don’t understand it. It’s more likely they are looking for ways that your business won’t work. And, frankly, we are not business school graduates or Stanford alumni, so investors who want to de-risk their portfolios will spend more time looking at our deck to gauge if we know how to build a business.</p>
<h2>More than goodwill is needed for lasting change</h2>
<p>Despite all this, we believe that most of the time, investors don’t even know they are acting on these biases. They don’t realize they may have already written you off, which is part of the problem. Awareness of a subconscious bias is the first step toward making positive change. Investors may think they’re widening the funnel simply by taking a meeting or providing mentorship over coffee when, subconsciously, they’ve already counted you out.</p>
<p>Even though the barriers are being lowered, minority founders just starting out still have a hard time getting their foot in the door. Most underrepresented founders don’t have an established network, making it difficult to get even an initial introduction. That’s why these founders aren’t getting meetings. So even with more investor goodwill, founders are still unable to access the capital they need to grow their businesses.</p>
<p>It takes time and effort to enact meaningful changes. Truly committed people are going to work on these issues over the coming years and decades. It’s only on a longer time scale that we’re going to be able to tell whether investors promising change have delivered. Changing the demographics of the founders you fund requires year in, year out consistency, again and again and again.</p>
<p>Only then will we see a time when the future of great ideas is not hindered by the demographics of the people building businesses out of those ideas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A code repository used by the New York state government&#8217;s IT department was left exposed on the internet, allowing anyone to access the projects inside, some of which contained secret keys and passwords associated with state government systems.</p>
<p>The exposed GitLab server was discovered on Saturday by Dubai-based SpiderSilk, a cybersecurity company credited with discovering data spills at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/samsung-source-code-leak/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/clearview-source-code-lapse/">Clearview AI</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/moviepass-thousands-data-exposed-leak/">MoviePass</a>.</p>
<p>Organizations use GitLab to collaboratively develop and store their source code — as well as the secret keys, tokens and passwords needed for the projects to work — on servers that they control. But the exposed server was accessible from the internet and configured so that anyone from outside the organization could create a user account and log in unimpeded, SpiderSilk&#8217;s chief security officer Mossab Hussein told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>When TechCrunch visited the GitLab server, the login page showed it was accepting new user accounts. It&#8217;s not known exactly how long the GitLab server was accessible in this way, but <a href="https://www.shodan.io/host/161.11.141.160">historic records</a> from Shodan, a search engine for exposed devices and databases, shows the GitLab was first detected on the internet on March 18.</p>
<p>SpiderSilk shared several screenshots showing that the GitLab server contained secret keys and passwords associated with servers and databases belonging to New York State&#8217;s Office of Information Technology Services. Fearing the exposed server could be maliciously accessed or tampered with, the startup asked for help in disclosing the security lapse to the state.</p>
<p>TechCrunch alerted the New York governor&#8217;s office to the exposure a short time after the server was found. Several emails to the governor&#8217;s office with details of the exposed GitLab server were opened but were not responded to. The server went offline on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Scot Reif, a spokesperson for New York State&#8217;s Office of Information Technology Services, said the server was &#8220;a test box set up by a vendor, there is no data whatsoever, and it has already been decommissioned by ITS.&#8221; (Reif declared his response “on background&#8221; and attributable to a state official, which would require both parties agree to the terms in advance, but we are printing the reply as we were not given the opportunity to reject the terms.)</p>
<p>When asked, Reif would not say who the vendor was or if the passwords on the server were changed. Several projects on the server were marked &#8220;prod,&#8221; or common shorthand for &#8220;production,&#8221; a term for servers that are actively used. Reif also would not say if the incident was reported to the state&#8217;s Attorney General&#8217;s office. When reached, a spokesperson for the Attorney General did not comment by press time.</p>
<p>TechCrunch understands the vendor is Indotronix-Avani, a New York-based company with offices in India, and owned by venture capital firm Nigama Ventures. Several screenshots show some of the GitLab projects were modified by a project manager at Indotronix-Avani. The vendor&#8217;s website touts New York State on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210624162555/https://www.iic.com/staffing/government/">its website</a>, along with other government customers, including the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>
<p>Indotronix-Avani spokesperson Mark Edmonds did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snap today announced <a href="https://www.universalmusic.com/universal-music-group-and-snap-inc-announce-expansive-global-agreement-that-spans-recorded-music-and-augmented-reality-experiences/">a multi-year deal</a> with Universal Music Group, one of the largest music companies in the world. From Queen to Justin Bieber, users can clip songs from the expansive UMG catalog to use in their Snaps and on Spotlight, the app&#8217;s TikTok competitor.</p>
<p>This announcement comes after Snapchat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/snapchat-launches-its-tiktok-rival-sounds-on-snapchat/">added its Sounds feature</a> in October, which lets users enhance their Snaps with music that Snap has licensed. Snap says that since then, over 521 million videos have been created using Sounds, which have been viewed over 31 billion times.</p>
<p>Of course, Snapchat&#8217;s investment in music is a direct response to the growth of music on TikTok. Last year, Fleetwood Mac&#8217;s 1977 album &#8220;Rumours&#8221; re-entered the Billboard charts after &#8220;Dreams,&#8221; a song on the record, went viral on TikTok. Dance trends also often go viral on TikTok, which can correlate with a boost in sales for the artist whose song is featured. So, the more music that&#8217;s licensed by apps like TikTok and Snapchat, the more opportunity there is for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/11/922554253/tiktok-sensation-meet-the-idaho-potato-worker-who-sent-fleetwood-mac-sales-soari">another Nathan Apodaca moment</a>, which means free publicity for the platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Already, gen Z artists like Olivia Rodrigo have leveraged these social platforms to promote their new music. On Snap, over 10 million videos were created using her song &#8220;Driver&#8217;s License,&#8221; Snap reports. Rodrigo was also the first artist to use AR Lenses on Snapchat to promote her record-breaking debut &#8220;Sour,&#8221; but to be fair, she also shared AR effects on Instagram.</p>
<p>Olivia Rodrigo sings about &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cii6ruuycQA">deja vu</a>&#8221; on her new album, and you might also be getting deja vu from Snap&#8217;s announcement. TikTok also <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/digital-and-mobile/9523263/universal-music-tiktok-partner-artist-collabs-data">struck a deal with UMG</a> in February. And before that, in November, TikTok announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/tiktok-strikes-new-licensing-agreement-with-sony-music/">a new licensing agreement</a> with Sony. Meanwhile, Snap&#8217;s portfolio of music partners include Warner Music Group, Sony Music Publishing, and more.</p>
<p>These deals aren&#8217;t exclusive &#8212; you can make a video with &#8220;deja vu&#8221; on Snapchat, TikTok, and Instagram alike. When it comes to deals like these, it&#8217;s a constant battle of reactionary one-upmanship. If TikTok makes a deal with UMG, Snapchat needs to strike a deal with UMG as well to remain competitive, which is what we&#8217;re seeing today. As our friend Olivia would say, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM2U8cb8lhI">it&#8217;s brutal out here</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[BuzzFeed had a hard time with growth in 2020, but its deck showcases big optimism about the future of its leading business (advertising) and growth business (commerce). ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital media outfit BuzzFeed <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60cbbb36879f9269a9b2c1e5/t/60d48f9628aa4c7d9c789d29/1624543127007/BuzzFeed+Inc+Press+Release.pdf">announced</a> today that it will go public via a SPAC, or blank check company. BuzzFeed also disclosed that it will purchase Complex, another media company, for $300 million in cash and shares in BuzzFeed itself; the SPAC deal will help finance its purchase of Complex.</p>
<p>The transaction will see BuzzFeed merge with 890 Fifth Avenue Partners Inc., a public company, with the combined entity sporting an enterprise valuation of around $1.5 billion after its completion.</p>
<p>BuzzFeed&#8217;s SPAC partner is bringing $288 million in cash to the table, and BuzzFeed intends to raise another $150 million in a convertible debt offering.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>

	</p>
<p>In raw numbers, BuzzFeed is a large company with hundreds of millions of dollars in yearly revenue and a roughly break-even business in recent years. The company&#8217;s investor presentation anticipates a return to growth after a mostly flat 2020, and rising profitability over time.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get into the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60cbbb36879f9269a9b2c1e5/t/60d46000058c421e525ff0d2/1624530951725/BuzzFeed+Investor+Presentation.pdf">company&#8217;s investor presentation</a>. We want to know about its historical growth, anticipated growth, revenue mix and profitability, as well as how the company thinks about its news division. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve broken each of our points into its own minisection, so if you want to skate ahead to any particular point, feel free!</p>
<h2>Historical revenue growth</h2>
<p>Why is BuzzFeed buying Complex? In part, because it adds audience scale to its platform, a key to the company&#8217;s expected future advertising revenue growth (more on that in a moment). But also because Complex adds a lot of revenue to its overall top-line picture.</p>
<p>For example, in BuzzFeed&#8217;s historical revenue figures we see the following numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>2019: $425 million.</li>
<li>2020: $421 million.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the company&#8217;s historical results are <em>inclusive</em> of Complex. Here&#8217;s the breakdown of the company&#8217;s historical revenues (gray) and Complex&#8217;s own (black). The combined figures are what BuzzFeed notes in its trailing metrics:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169786" style="width: 487px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169786" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2169786 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-10.35.08-AM.png" alt="" width="477" height="202" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-10.35.08-AM.png 477w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-10.35.08-AM.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-10.35.08-AM.png?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-10.35.08-AM.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2169786" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BuzzFeed SPAC deck</p></div></p>
<p>From this breakdown, we can see that BuzzFeed anticipates 19% growth from Complex in 2021, and just under 23% growth from the group it&#8217;s acquiring in 2022.</p>
<p>Per a later slide, BuzzFeed grew 4% in 2019, inclusive of historical Complex numbers. That figure fell to -1% in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Our read of the company&#8217;s historical revenue growth is that it weathered a turbulent 2020 in reasonable health; digital advertising took a huge hit in the first half of the year, likely impacting BuzzFeed&#8217;s operating results. To see it manage an essentially flat revenue result last year feels pretty OK.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://smartasset.com/">SmartAsset</a>, a marketplace that connects consumers to financial advisors, announced today that it has raised $110 million in a Series D round of funding.</p>
<p>The financing values New York-based SmartAsset at over $1 billion, and brings its total raised since its 2012 inception to just over $161 million, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/smartasset/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>TTV Capital led SmartAsset’s Series D, which also included participation from Javelin Venture Partners, Contour Venture Partners, Citi Ventures, New York Life Ventures, North Bridge Venture Partners and CMFG Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company last raised in June of 2018 &#8211; a $28 million Series C led by Focus Financial Partners. Since then, it says it has grown revenue “by 10 times” and is now on the cusp of reaching $100 million in ARR (annual recurring revenue). It recently made its one millionth consumer/advisor match on its <a href="https://smartasset.com/financial-advisor/about">SmartAdvisor</a> platform. Also in 2020, SmartAsset says it referred $10 billion in new, closed assets under management (AUM) to financial advisors and firms across the U.S.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dbQUT9xav2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/19/smartasset-series-c/">Personal finance startup SmartAsset raises $28M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Personal finance startup SmartAsset raises $28M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/19/smartasset-series-c/embed/#?secret=dbQUT9xav2" data-secret="dbQUT9xav2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Besides pairing consumers with advisors with its Automated Financial Modeling software, SmartAsset claims to reach over 100 million people each month through its personal finance content, tools and “personalized” calculators.</p>
<p>Prior to starting the company, Carvin worked in finance. In <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/qa-with-michael-carvin-cofounder-of-smartasset/">an interview with Y Combinator </a>(one of its backers), he shared how his frustration in finding information about buying a home and getting a mortgage “that was useful, accurate and unbiased” led him to join forces with Philip Camilleri to found SmartAsset.</p>
<p>“Calculators had obvious errors and the content seemed like it was all written by people that wanted me to take out the largest mortgage possible,” he added. So the pair launched SmartAsset in an effort to provide people with the tools and content to help them make better decisions around topics such as retirement, taxes, savings, homeownership and insurance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169963" style="width: 612px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169963" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2169963" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="602" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Carvin-SmartAsset.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2169963" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SmartAsset CEO and co-founder Michael Carvin / SmartAsset</p></div></p>
<p>The company plans to use the new capital to invest in new product offerings, technology infrastructure and data partnerships. It also plans to boost its current headcount of 202 by more than 75% this year.</p>
<p>TTV Capital Partner Mark Johnson said the company “is quickly expanding its lead in one of the largest markets in the U.S. by providing an incredibly valuable resource for both consumers and financial advisors alike.”</p>
<p>The funding and its flashy valuation comes with a certain weight, even in the growing world of unicorn companies.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://t.yesware.com/tt/1f0c796e3117f8188cc9e43a574eb1b1a5b3dd17/52eb41258feffb54f8289e5e4b73f7b9/2a58c7e2f7d9a1ef370be345daee2da9/www.abnewswire.com/pressreleases/black-unicorn-factory-cracks-the-unicorn-startup-code_544450.html">claims that</a>, with today’s news, co-founder Michael Carvin now becomes the third Black founder and CEO of a company valued at over $1 billion. Others include Compass CEO and founder Robert Reffkin, whom we recently profiled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/how-robert-reffkin-went-from-being-a-c-average-student-to-the-founder-of-compass/">here</a>, and Calendly CEO and founder Tope Awotona, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/">who we have also profiled</a>.</p>
<p>While exciting, the unfortunate rarity of Black-led unicorns is a symptom of historical underfunding in Black or African-American startup founders. Crunchbase estimates that in 2020, 1% of total venture capital funding, or $1 billion, went to this cohort of founders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope seeing more successful Black founders inspires more people of color to start companies so that one day this is not news,&#8221; Carvin told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>A number of Black-led venture capital firms have closed investments in the past year, which could change this number, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/collab-capital-closes-50-million-debut-fund-for-black-founders/">Collab Capital’s $50 million investment vehicle</a>, Harlem Capital, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/harlem-capital-fund-ii/">closed a $134 million seed fund </a>earlier this year; Cleo Capital, which set a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/cleo-capital-is-targeting-20-million-for-fund-ii/'"> $20 million target for Fund II</a>; and MaC VC, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/closing-on-103-million-mac-venture-capital-is-changing-the-face-of-venture-capital/">landed $103 million for its inaugural fund.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/hbcuvc-venture-capital-lab-fund-1-million/">HBCUvc and Google for Startups also announced this month</a> two separate efforts to provide non-dilutive capital to early-stage, underrepresented founders.</p>
<p>With a Series D under its belt, SmartAsset is working on taking out the bias from personal finance &#8211; while it itself is a case study in how overlooked founders, which routinely suffer from this exact phenomenon, continue to lead strong businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the U.S, after you get vaccinated against COVID-19 you are given a small paper card <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect.html">issued by the CDC</a> that is essentially the only evidence that you&#8217;ve received your shots. It might seem like a flimsy level of proof, one that you could easily lose, but replacing that paper copy with a digital one has become a political lightning rod in America.</p>
<p>In spite of that, many companies are attempting to attack the problem to produce a viable form of digital proof, sometimes called vaccine passports. For all intents and purposes, what many call a vaccine passport is simply proof you&#8217;ve been vaccinated that you can carry on your smartphone, rather than on a card in your wallet.</p>
<p>Some have argued against the digital approach <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/24/andrew-cuomo-covid-ibm-blockchain/">for privacy reasons</a>. Others have claimed it is <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/theres-a-lot-that-can-go-wrong-with-vaccine-passports/">a civil liberties issue</a>, and some have pointed <a href="https://www.the-parallax.com/digital-health-pass-inequity/">to equity issues</a> related to not having equal access to appropriate technology or the internet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That lack of consensus along with the open ethical questions, has led some states, including <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2021/04/30/florida-lawmakers-pass-vaccine-passport-ban/">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/25/politics/kemp-georgia-vaccine-passports-covid/index.html">Georgia</a>, to ban the use of electronic passport records, at least as far as requiring them to conduct state business or to create a centralized vaccination record-keeping system. In Iowa, <a href="https://www.weareiowa.com/article/news/local/local-politics/iowa-vaccine-passports-banned-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-bill-into-law/524-898ae00e-605b-4a93-88ee-49d3ec1ddb59">the governor signed a law last month</a> that prohibits businesses and the state from requiring any proof to access services, whether the card is physical or digital.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/which-states-have-banned-vaccine-passports">the patchwork of state laws and executive orders</a> that has resulted in even more complexity for companies trying to develop products to solve this problem. But not every state is banning digital vaccination records. Earlier this month,<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-18/what-you-need-to-know-about-californias-new-digital-vaccine-verification"> California opened a registration</a> system to request a digital record of your vaccination and New York <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-excelsior-pass-covid-19-vaccine-passport-152722058.html">announced a system earlier this year</a> to download proof of vaccination to your smartphone. More on these approaches later.</p>
<p>We spoke to several experts to get their take on moving your vaccine card to the digital world to find out how this could work in spite of the obvious friction.</p>
<h2>Practical issues</h2>
<p>According to Dr. Shira I. Doron from Tufts Medical Center in Boston, whose specialties include infectious diseases and hospital epidemiology, it&#8217;s not as simple a matter as may sound.</p>
<p>For starters she says, states have not kept records in a consistent way. People have been getting vaccinated in all kinds of places from school gyms to pharmacies to stadiums, and it&#8217;s not clear if those records have made their way to people&#8217;s primary care physicians, assuming they even have one.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Vaccine passports could work] if [a system] had been rolled out that way [with central record keeping in mind] from December 15th [when we started vaccinating], but it was not. So, if somebody takes it on to go backwards and issue that kind of proof to people, maybe a system like that could work &#8212; and of course there are a lot of people that have taken issue with the ethics of that,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>For her, it comes down to infection rates. As they drop with more people getting vaccinated, it could alleviate the need for any kind of proof at all because we would be safer simply because the infection rate fell below 10%. &#8220;I think that more ideally we get down to such a low infection rate and such high rate of vaccination that there is no longer a concern about people walking into a building,&#8221; she said.</p>

<h2>Putting it in on the blockchain</h2>
<p>If the infection rate remains higher than desirable, or certain entities like universities want to require it, how do we offer proof of vaccination beyond the paper card? Some people are pointing to the blockchain, but the approach isn&#8217;t without controversy. New York State is using IBM&#8217;s blockchain technology for its proof of vaccination called <a href="https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/excelsior-pass">Excelsior Pass</a>, but<a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/24/andrew-cuomo-covid-ibm-blockchain/"> privacy advocates worry</a> that doing so could expose people&#8217;s personal medical information.</p>
<p>The idea with the IBM approach is that you to go to your physician&#8217;s healthcare portal or some other place that has your vaccine records, and which has partnered with IBM. The portal will present you with a QR code which you can take a picture of with your phone and store in your phone&#8217;s digital wallet. The person then presents the QR code at a venue, which uses a companion scanning application to view it to see proof of vaccination (or a recent negative test). Finally the venue would verify the identity of that person with a secondary form of ID like a driver&#8217;s license.</p>
<p>The question then is why use the blockchain at all in this instance. IBM Global VP of Payer and Emerging Business Networks Eric Piscini, says that there are three main reasons. &#8220;The first is that the immutability of the blockchain is extremely important, and that&#8217;s [a big reason] why we use it. The second piece, which is also very important is the decentralization of that platform so that [all of the vaccine data] is not just in one place. It&#8217;s decentralized and managed by different parties. [&#8230;] The third piece [&#8230;] is the audit trail, and not just for me as a consumer, but as an [entity] that is trying to verify me,&#8221; he explained.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech and health companies including Microsoft and Salesforce team up on digital COVID-19 vaccination records&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/tech-and-health-companies-including-microsoft-and-salesforce-team-up-on-digital-covid-19-vaccination-records/embed/#?secret=SbvD6Pflp3" data-secret="SbvD6Pflp3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But are those reasons enough to justify its use? Steve Wilson, an analyst at Constellation Research, who specializes in end user privacy thinks the blockchain is an inappropriate technology to use for digital proof of vaccination. &#8220;Basically, I don&#8217;t see how blockchain adds anything to the digitizing of COVID vaccinations or tests. The purpose of blockchain is to crowd-source agreement on the ordering of some events, and logging that order in a shared record. What problem in vaccination management does that address,&#8221; he asked.</p>
<h2>An open-source approach to the problem</h2>
<p>When California released a digital vaccination record app last week, it went a different route, using an open-source framework called the <a href="https://smarthealth.cards/">Smart Health Cards Framework</a>. The framework was developed by an organization called <a href="https://thecommonsproject.org/">The Commons Project</a> (TCP) along with a broad coalition of health and technology organizations including Oracle, Microsoft, Salesforce, Epic and others.</p>
<p>JP Pollak, co-founder of The Commons Project, Senior Researcher-in-Residence at Cornell Tech, and Assistant Professor at Weill Cornell Medicine, says that since the government has made clear it won&#8217;t be compiling vaccine records in a central database, and because the vaccine administration system itself is so fragmented, it&#8217;s even more challenging to create digital records. His organization is working to create a solution to that problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re working on at <a href="https://thecommonsproject.org/">The Commons Project</a> is a steering group called the <a href="https://vci.org/">Vaccination Credential Initiative or VCI</a>. And the purpose of that group is basically to design and advocate for a specification, someday hopefully a standard, that makes it so that all of those disparate issuers of vaccines can issue the same vaccine record in a signed and portable format,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That comes in the form of a Smart Health Card app that VCI has developed. &#8220;The additional layer that we have built is what turns [your vaccine] information into what we&#8217;re calling the <a href="https://smarthealth.cards/">Smart Health Card</a>. And basically it&#8217;s all of the information that goes on your CDC card &#8212; so your name, your date of birth, the type of vaccine that you received, the dates of your doses, lot numbers and where you received it. All of those kinds of things get packaged up into this credential, and that credential is then signed by the issuer,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Healthvana&#8217;s digital COVID-19 vaccination records are about communication, not passports for the immune&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/healthvanas-digital-covid-19-vaccination-records-are-about-communication-not-passports-for-the-immune/embed/#?secret=5bxbDp8OIY" data-secret="5bxbDp8OIY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In addition to California, the state of Louisiana also went live with the The Commons Project solution this week, and Walmart recently announced that anyone that received their vaccine through them is now able to download a digital version of their vaccine record directly to the <a href="https://www.commonhealth.org/">CommonHealth</a> app (available on Android) or <a href="https://commonpass.org/">CommonPass</a> app (available on iOS or Android). The company also hinted that other companies that have administered the vaccine would be following Walmart&#8217;s lead in the coming weeks and providing access to digital records through the same apps.</p>
<p>The approach doesn&#8217;t necessarily solve all of the criticisms around equitable access to technology, privacy or the ethics of being asked to show proof vaccination, but it does provide a means to deliver the information digitally for those that want it in an open way.</p>
<p>Regardless of the method your state chooses, if it indeed chooses any approach at all,  it will come with its own set of pros and cons. The paper CDC card, as Wilson points out, is similar in many ways to the &#8220;<a href="https://bookstore.gpo.gov/products/international-certificate-vaccination-or-prophylaxis-approved-world-health-organization-0">Yellow Card</a>&#8221; vaccination record that people traveling overseas have been carrying for decades, and that has worked fine.</p>
<p>But it seems that in 2021 when approximately half the world&#8217;s population owns a smartphone, while two-thirds have some sort of mobile phone, smart or otherwise, it makes sense to make this record available in a digital form. For the many startups and large companies trying to solve that problem, they will have to do more than come up with a clever solution. They will also need to figure out how to convince individuals, businesses and governments that it makes sense to even offer this approach, and that may be the biggest hurdle of all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we become more and more aware of the kind of impact we are having on this planet we call our home, just about everything is having its CO2 impact measured. Who knew, until recently, that streaming Netflix might have <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/what-is-the-carbon-footprint-of-your-netflix-habit-5189605">a measurable impact on the environment</a>, for instance. But given vast swathes of the internet are populated by websites, as well as streaming services, then they, too, must have some sort of impact.</p>
<p>It transpires that a new service has identified how to gauge that, and now it’s raised venture capital to scale.</p>
<p>Ryte raised €8.5 million ($10 million) in a previously undisclosed round led by Bayern Kapital out of Munich and Octopus Investments out of London earlier this year for its Website User Experience Platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It has now launched the &#8216;Ryte Website Carbon KPI’, which claims to be able to help make 5% of all websites carbon neutral by 2023.</p>
<p>Ryte says it worked with data scientists and environmental experts to develop the ability to accurately measure the carbon impact of clients&#8217; websites. According to carbon transition think tank, the Shift Project, the carbon footprint of our gadgets, the internet, and the systems supporting them account for about 3.7% of global greenhouse emissions. And this trend is rising rapidly as the world digitizes itself, especially post-pandemic.</p>
<p>Ryte has now engaged its data scientist, Katharina Meraner, who has a PhD in climate science and global warming, and input from Climate Partner, to launch this new service.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are currently 189 million active websites,&#8221; Ryte CEO Andy Bruckschloegl said. &#8220;Our goal is to make 5% of all active websites, or 9.5 million websites, climate neutral by the end of 2023 with the help of our platform, strong partners, social media activities, and much more. Time is ticking and making websites carbon neutral is really easy compared to other industries and processes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ryte says it is also collaborating with a reforestation project in San Jose, Nicaragua, to allow its customers to offset their remaining emissions through the purchase of climate certificates.</p>
<p>Using a proprietary algorithm, Ryte says it measures the code of the entire website, average page size, as well as monthly traffic by channel then produces a calculation of the amount of CO2 it uses up.</p>
<p>Admittedly there are similar services, but these are ad-hoc and not connected to a platform. A simple Google search will bring us sites like <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">Websitecarbon</a>, <a href="https://www.ecosistant.eu/en/website-carbon-footprint/">Ecosistant</a>, and academic papers. But as far as I can tell, a startup like this hasn&#8217;t put this kind of service into their platform yet.</p>
<p>“Teaming up with Ryte will help raise awareness on how information technology contributes to climate change – while at the same time providing tools to make a difference. Ryte’s industry-leading carbon calculator enables thousands of website owners to understand their carbon footprint, to offset unavoidable carbon emissions and thus lay a basis for a comprehensive climate action strategy,” commented Tristan A. Foerster, Co-CEO ClimatePartner.</p>
