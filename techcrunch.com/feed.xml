					<description><![CDATA[Confluent's approach of growing from open source to commercial product has worked out well — the company defied conventional wisdom and still ended up thriving.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s common these days to launch an enterprise startup based on an open source project, often where one the founders was deeply involved in creating it. The beauty of this approach is that if the project begins to gain traction, you have the top of the sales funnel ready and waiting with potential customers when you move to commercialize your business.</p>
<p>In the past, this often meant providing help desk-style services for companies who appreciated what the open source software could do but wanted to have the so-called &#8220;throat to choke&#8221; if something went wrong. Another way that these companies have made money has been creating an on-prem version with certain enterprise features, particularly around scale or security, the kind of thing that large operations need as table stakes before using a particular product. Today, customers typically can install on-prem or in their cloud of choice.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;A key aspect of these kinds of technology-developer data products is they have to have a combination of bottom-up adoption and top-down SaaS, and you actually have to get both of those things working well to succeed.&#8221;							<cite>Jay Kreps</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In recent years, the model has shifted to building a SaaS product, where the startup builds a solution that handles all the back-end management and creates something that most companies can adopt without all of the fuss associated with installing yourself or trying to figure out how to use the raw open source.</p>
<p>One company that has flirted with these monetization approaches is <a href="http://confluent.com">Confluent</a>, the streaming data company built on top of the open source <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka project</a>. The founding team had helped build Kafka inside LinkedIn to move massive amounts of user data in real time. They open sourced the tool in 2011, and CEO and co-founder Jay Kreps helped launch the company in 2014.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Confluent raised $450 million as a private company with a final private valuation in April <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/confluent-lands-another-big-round-with-250m-series-e-on-4-2b-valuation/">of $4.5 billion</a> before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/confluents-ipo-brings-a-high-growth-high-burn-saas-model-to-the-public-markets/">going public in June</a>. Today, it has a market cap of over $22 billion, not bad for less than six months as a public company.</p>
<p>Last month at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/confluent-ceo-jay-kreps-is-coming-to-tc-sessions-saas-for-a-fireside-chat/">TC Sessions: SaaS</a>, I spoke to Kreps about how he built his open source business and the steps he took along the way to monetize his ideas. There&#8217;s certainly a lot of takeaways for open source-based startups launching today.</p>
<h2>Going upmarket</h2>
<p>Kreps said that when they launched the company in 2014, there were a bunch of enterprise-size companies already using the open source product, and they needed to figure out how to take the interest they had been seeing in Kafka and convert that into something that the fledgling startup could begin to make money on.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been different paths for different companies in this space, and I think it&#8217;s actually very dependent on the type of product [as to] what makes sense. For us, one of the things we understood early on was that we would have to be wherever our customers had data,&#8221; Kreps said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 19, 2021. It’s a welcome Friday today, heading into a holiday week here in the United States. TechCrunch is a global team, but we’ll be a touch slower starting next Thursday. Still, there’s more than a little to get into today! – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<p><em>P.S. Tickets to our upcoming space-themed event are </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/score-a-20-pass-to-tc-sessions-space-2021-during-our-week-long-black-friday-sale/"><em>on sale for the next few days!</em></a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237427" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/flytrex-raises-40m-to-build-its-drone-based-delivery-service-across-suburbs-in-the-u-s/"><strong>Bring on drone deliveries:</strong></a><strong> </strong>An Israeli drone company (Flytrex) is teaming up with U.S. chains (Walmart, Chili’s) to test deliveries in one state (North Carolina). Amazon has worked on drone deliveries, as have other companies. Flytrex just raised $40 million for its efforts. Given how little interest we have in <em>driving</em> to get things, here’s hoping the experiment works this time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/as-sequoia-changes-its-model-other-permanent-capital-vcs-weigh-in/">The changing structure of venture capital:</a></strong> News that U.S. venture giant Sequoia was shaking up its operating model was big news when it landed. But after looking at a few examples from other markets, there’s precedent for a more permanent capital model. Our next question is which venture capital firm is next.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/as-crypto-unicorns-multiply-the-us-stands-out-as-ground-zero-for-blockchain-winners/"><strong>Crypto unicorns multiply:</strong></a><strong> </strong>It’s no surprise that with more and more venture funds built to invest in them, crypto-focused startups are having a busy year. But you might be surprised regarding just how many new crypto unicorns were born this year and where they are based. A new data set also details where the crypto unicorns are focused, and, yes, NFTs do come up.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/nym-raises-13m-from-a16zs-crypto-fund/">Speaking of crypto startups, Nym raises $13M:</a></strong> Based in Switzerland — quickly becoming a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/the-anoma-protocol-raises-26m-for-its-work-to-undefine-money/">domiciling hub for crypto projects</a> — Nym has raised fresh capital from the a16z crypto fund to, in TechCrunch’s words, “commercialize an old idea for privacy-centric infrastructure (mixnets) by combining it with buzzy crypto incentives.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/mmhmm-eats-macro/"><strong>Mmhmm buys Macro:</strong></a> Video-focused startup mmhmm has made a purchase, snagging video-chat filter service Macro. Given that both work in making video-based communications a bit more snazzy, they fit together well on paper.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/sudowrite-fundraising/"><strong>Sudowrite will help you write a zillion words:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Our own Haje Jan Kamps has a fascinating look at a writing tool that leverages GPT-3 to attack writer’s block. It’s not the first writing-focused service built atop GPT-3 that we’ve covered, and we doubt that it will be the last. But this does appear to be the most, ahem, wordy. Sudowrite recently raised $3 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/foodtech-amara-infant/"><strong>Amara’s high-density baby food attracts $12M Series A:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Feeding your little kiddo isn’t easy. Between picky eating and a plethora of foods on offer that are less than winsome for their growing bodies, it can be hard to get the right foodstuffs into your pantry. Amara is taking on the issue with a Series A that values its healthy kid food business at $100 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/kettle-books-25m-for-its-reinsurance-platform-against-fire-and-other-catastrophes/"><strong>Startups are taking on reinsurance, too:</strong></a><strong> </strong>By now we’re familiar with a number of insurtech models. Root, Metromile, Hippo and others are taking on familiar insurance products. Zebra and its rivals are building insurance marketplaces. But reinsurance? That’s rarer. Kettle just raised $25 million to take on the business of insuring the insurers. Let’s see how its economics play out.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/primer-sazze-partners-closes-127m-second-fund-aimed-at-south-korean-entrepreneurs/"><strong>VC focused on Korean startups raises $127M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Thanks to the sharp eyes of our own Kate Park, TechCrunch has news up today discussing Primer Sazze Partners, a San Jose-based venture capital firm that wants to “invest in startups founded by Korean entrepreneurs in Asia and North America.” It’s not the biggest fund we’ve heard of, but we don’t know of that many venture firms taking on its exact remit, so it stood out from the mix.</li>
<li>If you need a little something to take your mind off the weekend, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/co-founder-titles-arent-a-formality-theyre-a-morality/">Equity has a fun episode out</a> taking on the week’s news, from OpenSea to edtech. If that’s not enough, the other flagship TechCrunch podcast Found <a href="https://pod.link/found/episode/69e59707f7641ecae0537f0513d9eeff">has a great episode out this week</a> with recent TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield winner Nabiha Saklayen that I cannot recommend enough.</li>

<h2>Making the case for IVP: Initial viable product</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2236746" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/making-the-case-for-ivp-initial-viable-product/"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236746" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2236746 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-86298178.jpg" alt="Hand placing cherry on top of cup cake" width="1024" height="816" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-86298178.jpg 1939w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-86298178.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-86298178.jpg?resize=300,239 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-86298178.jpg?resize=768,612 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-86298178.jpg?resize=680,542 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-86298178.jpg?resize=1536,1225 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-86298178.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2236746" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gettyimages.in/search/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=Flashpop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flashpop <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>As a concept, minimum viable product (MVP) has given founders maximum flexibility.</p>
<p>The goal is to keep shipping until you reach product-market fit, but there’s a catch: “Minimal is a sliding scale that will always slide onto you,” according to Aron Solomon, head of strategy at Esquire Digital.</p>
<p>Instead of putting MVP on a pedestal, he proposes adding an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/making-the-case-for-ivp-initial-viable-product/">initial viable product (IVP) to the roadmap.</a></p>
<p>“If your IVP is your presentation of an unbaked pepperoni pizza, your MVP is when you present a can of sauce, a package of cheese, a Slim Jim, and a pencil sketch of an oven.”</p>

One suggestion? That ad-tracking be phased out. That would be, ahem, a change in how the internet works.</li>

American e-commerce giant Amazon is also making moves into healthcare work, perhaps giving us a trend to watch for in other markets.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Let's look at why BNPL is becoming a more attractive payment option for big e-commerce companies like Amazon and Walmart, as well as merchant marketplaces like Square and Shopify.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this week, Amazon announced that it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/amazon-says-it-will-stop-accepting-uk-issued-visa-credit-cards-on-january-19th/">stop accepting Visa credit cards</a> issued in the U.K. due to high interchange fees on transactions. The company gave a deadline of January 19 and is offering consumers who primarily use Visa cards £20 off a purchase as an incentive to update their preferred payment method.</p>
<p>The move followed similar efforts by Amazon to curtail the use of Visa-issued credit cards in Singapore and Australia, markets where the e-commerce giant introduced a <a href="https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/amazon-takes-visa-battle-to-australia/606055/">0.5% surcharge</a> on <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/amazon-to-introduce-05-surcharge-for-visa-credit-card-transactions-in-singapore">transactions made with those cards</a>. In both cases, Amazon also offered customers gift cards to encourage them to switch payment methods.</p>
<p>While Amazon is asserting its market dominance in an effort to lower transaction fees &#8212; which a company spokesperson said “[continue] to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers” &#8212; it is hardly alone in its desire to ween customers off high-cost payment methods.</p>
<p>For merchants, the introduction of “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) payment options, the rise of digital wallets and a broader push toward ACH or account-to-account (A2A) transactions are all part of a strategy to reduce consumers’ overreliance on credit cards.</p>
<p>For today, let’s focus on BNPL and why it is becoming a more attractive payment option for big e-commerce companies like Amazon and Walmart, as well as merchant marketplaces like Square and Shopify.</p>
<h2>Not just bigger shopping carts</h2>
<p>For years, the key selling point of BNPL services like Affirm, Afterpay and Klarna was that they allowed merchants to increase the average order value while also reducing cart abandonment.</p>
<p>Affirm’s merchant transaction fees vary depending on the structure of the installment offering, which takes into account things like the cart size, length of term and whether those loans are offered to the consumer as 0% APR or interest-bearing installments.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This is a fantastic time to found a startup, but unless you plan to bootstrap it, you will still need to go through the laborious exercise of crafting a pitch deck.</p>
<p>With so much riding on the outcome, this can be an extremely stressful process — a convincing deck requires you to come up with data-driven answers for existential questions:</p>
<p><em>Can you lay out your plan for tripling revenue YoY? What’s your ideal product use case?</em></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237284" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>It’s tempting to make overly sunny projections or copy what’s worked for others, but your pitch isn’t meant to impress — it’s supposed to show how well you understand the business you’re building and the space in which you’re operating.</p>
<p>According to Jose Cayasso, CEO and co-founder of pitch deck design agency Slidebean, there are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/5-critical-pitch-deck-slides-most-founders-get-wrong/">five slides where pretty much all founders miss the mark</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go-to-market</li>
<li>Use case/audience</li>
<li>TAM</li>
<li>Possible outcomes</li>
<li>Team</li>
</ul>
<p>Using examples from Airbnb, Uber and others, he shares several strategies for avoiding the most common pitfalls, along with the pitch deck framework Slidebean uses with most of its clients.</p>
<p>“Remember, a pitch deck needs to achieve two things: tell your company story and convince the investor that they can make money with this,” says Cayasso.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading; I hope you have an excellent weekend.</p>

<h2>Making the case for IVP: Initial viable product</h2>

<p>As a concept, minimum viable product (MVP) has given founders maximum flexibility.</p>
<p>The goal is to keep shipping until you reach product-market fit, but there’s a catch: “Minimal is a sliding scale that will always slide onto you,” according to Aron Solomon, head of strategy at Esquire Digital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead of putting MVP on a pedestal, he proposes adding an initial viable product (IVP) to the roadmap.</p>
<p>“If your IVP is your presentation of an unbaked pepperoni pizza, your MVP is when you present a can of sauce, a package of cheese, a Slim Jim, and a pencil sketch of an oven.”</p>

<p>The concept of MLOps gained traction as a few specific best practices for working with machine learning (ML) models, but it is maturing into a standalone approach for managing the ML lifecycle.</p>
<p>This evolution has played a key role in helping companies adopt and employ ML and AI, according to Ashish Kakran, principal at Thomvest Ventures.</p>
<p>In a TechCrunch+ post, Kakran lays out several challenges companies can address using MLOps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-team collaboration to deploy ML</li>
<li>Integration with ML tools</li>
<li>Model lifecycle management</li>
<li>Bringing ML models to production</li>
<li>Regulation and compliance</li>
<li>Accelerating AI adoption</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the fact that Americans are famous for failing to eat their vegetables, salad chain Sweetgreen is seeing a lot of success on the public markets.</p>
<p>The company priced its IPO above its planned range at $28 per share and was trading at nearly double that price soon after it debuted.</p>
<p>That pricing and the resulting ~9x multiple reflects the fact that the market now considers tech-enabled businesses like Sweetgreen, Allbirds and Rent the Runway to be around the same value as software businesses in 2015, writes Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>“How can we call it anything but a win?”</p>

<h2>4 strategies for setting marketplace take rates</h2>

<p>E-commerce platform founders may be tempted to set transaction fees just a little higher than they initially planned, but greed isn’t always good.</p>
<p>Boosting take rates by a point or two could raise early revenue when it’s needed most, but there’s an opportunity cost, since “a higher take rate typically leads to lower transaction volume,” according to angel investor and product manager Tanay Jaipuria.</p>
<p>Take rates should directly reflect the stage of your business, he advises, since platforms with higher rates see lower transaction volumes.</p>
<p>To learn how different companies use this lever, Jaipuria studied take rates for more than 25 marketplaces, including Apple, Shutterstock and OpenSea.</p>
<p>“It’s important for founders to remember that maximizing the take rate of the platform is not the goal,” he says.</p>

<p>San Francisco is an outlier, but a walk through its residential neighborhoods shows how successful Instacart became during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Nearly every restaurant has a hand-lettered “Instacart pickup here” sign, and its drivers now deliver everything from Safeway groceries to Walgreens prescriptions. On more than one occasion, I’ve seen neighbors accepting boba tea deliveries.</p>
<p>But after The Information reported that the delivery platform’s growth plateaued in 2021, Alex Wilhelm gathered data from competitors Amazon, Walmart, DoorDash and Uber to see if they are “snacking on Instacart’s core business.”</p>

<p>North America’s legal cannabis industry is about a decade old, but many stakeholders are developing a framework “to make sure that for once, an industry starts off on the right path,” reports Jesse Klein.</p>
<p>Twenty companies have formed a coalition to promote sustainability practices aimed at reducing energy and water usage, along with emissions. To “green it up,” they’re studying new tech like LEDs, as well as traditional agricultural practices.</p>
<p>“They’re making pretty good margins and they’ve kind of got a PR problem,” said Stephen Doig, senior research and strategy adviser at Dartmouth’s Arthur L. Irving Institute for Energy and Society.</p>
<p>“Getting it right, right now [will] make a big difference.”</p>

<p>In the software space, even the tiniest difference in metrics can affect a company’s fortunes once it goes public.</p>
<p>Braze and UserTesting both provide ways to centralize and optimally use customer data, and their growth metrics are quite evenly matched. Yet, when they went public earlier this week, Braze priced above its price range and UserTesting priced below.</p>
<p>“It appears that those metrics — software TAM is so large these days that we’re not going to compare vanity metrics for the sake of being kind to S-1 scribblers — are enough to give it the revenue multiple differential that we see, and thus explain the difference in the two companies’ IPO pricing runs,” writes Alex Wilhelm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mmhmm.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mmhmm</a> has perhaps the noisiest take on the future of video-conferencing: virtual meetings will be fun, flexible and, as shown by its most recent acquisition, emotive. The video-conferencing software startup, founded by Evernote creator Phil Libin, announced today that it has bought <a href="https://www.macro.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macro</a>, a company that has created filters, reactions and tools to take the pressure off of virtual meetings (and bring the relationship-building energy back).</p>
<p>The talks between Macro and Mmhmm started in late September, with the deal closing just weeks later. The terms of the transaction were undisclosed, but given Mmhmm’s recent $100 million raise, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/the-mmhmm-story-and-how-it-plans-to-spend-its-100m/">it’s clear that the early-stage company had some capital to spare.</a></p>
<p>Macro was founded in 2019 by Ankith Harathi and John Keck, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/macro-just-raised-4-3m-to-make-your-never-ending-zoom-calls-more-useful/">soon raised $4.3 million in venture capital</a> from investors such as FirstMark Capital, General Catalyst and Underscore VC. Unlike Mmhmm, which focuses on customizing user’s video feeds, Macro changes the actual interface that users are working from.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237389" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For example, a key characteristic of Macro is the Airtime feature, which helps participants understand who is speaking the most within a certain meeting. Video sizes adjust based on each person&#8217;s engagement, which can help teams better distill influence and figure out who may need extra nudges to speak up.</p>
<p>Other features include custom windows to &#8220;unbox&#8221; yourself on the screen and filters. To promote ease of use, Macro is able to be used with MacOS and any Zoom client, even if everyone else is on Zoom.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kvi27jmMKEg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>After Macro’s first fundraise, Harathi explained that he and his co-founder had to decide if they should keep building, raise another round or join forces with another company. Competition from other Zoom clients was heating up, a demand that was great for validation, but difficult for development. They realized that Mmhmm had a lot of the functionality they felt was imperative to being successful in the video-conferencing space.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“How do you make meetings more human? How do you make them adapt to the people we are, as opposed to putting identity-driven and expressive organisms into constrained boxes,” Harathi said, of his early talks with Libin’s team. “They were debating going down this camera route, or the client route, and they chose one, we chose the other.”</p>
<p>“We really think that the company that is going to win this video 2.0 world is the product that goes seamlessly between asynchronous and synchronous,” Libin said. “Letting you shift between recorded and live, and doing that smoothly is the near term of what video is going to be.” Harathi added that the winning app needs to solve for all the ways people will communicate in the distributed world, from on the fly phone calls to deep-thinking sessions to high-stakes presentations.</p>

<p>The big vision for Mmhmm, as Libin’s been clear about from the start, is to redefine video as a medium for expression and building relationships. It’s a type of trust that is hard to build, literally. He hopes that by offering more surface area in Zoom rooms, using Mmhmm and Macro, there is more room to understand who you are speaking with.</p>
<p>“What room did they choose? What effects are they doing? It gives everyone more opportunity to be creative and customize how they’re appearing,” he said. “And it becomes a little closer to you and I hanging out in person and getting to know each other. The foundation is far more expressive.”</p>
<p>Macro is Mmhmm’s second acquisition to date. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/23/mmhmm-phil-libins-new-startup-acquires-memix-to-add-enhanced-filters-to-its-video-presentation-toolkit/">Mmhmm announced its buy of Memix</a>, a San Francisco-based startup that offers a series of filters that can be applied to both pre-recorded and live videos to tweak stuff like lighting, details in the background, or what appears across the entire screen. Libin says that Memix’s technology now makes up the core of Mmhmm’s offering.</p>
<p>Macro will be sunset by the end of November. All seven members of Macro’s team have decided to join Mmhmm to keep on building.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">VinFast, the Vietnamese automaker under Vingroup, was one of the LA Auto Show&#8217;s numerous newcomers this year aiming to make an impression with consumers.</p>
<p>The company showed off two all-electric crossovers at the show. And like so many new entrants to automotive &#8212; or in VinFast&#8217;s case, new to the United States &#8212; the vehicles are not yet in production.</p>
<p>VinFast shared few details on the specs of the vehicles, which are due to show up in the U.S. in late 2022. Visitors to the show could sign up via Typeform to be among the first to &#8220;experience&#8221; the vehicles and indicate purchasing interest.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237269" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Right now we want people to register. So we want to &#8230; collect and build up the database so that we know where customers are, you know, who is interested. And then, we will keep them updated on the progress that the products and the service here that we are going to offer,&#8221; VinFast US CEO Van Anh Nguyen said in an interview with TechCrunch on Thursday.</p>
<p>Customers who are interested can put down a $500 deposit to reserve their vehicle of choice in one of eight colors in the first quarter of 2022. According to Nguyen, when the vehicles become available a few months later, interested customers can test drive and determine if they want to convert that deposit into a purchase. While specs and details are thin, VinFast appears to be moving quickly with plans to enter the U.S. market.</p>
<h2>A factory, HQ and 60 stores</h2>
<p>VinFast&#8217;s plans for the United States extend well beyond selling some electric crossovers. The company announced ambitious plans to invest more than $200 million to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vinfast-officially-announces-us-headquarters-in-los-angeles-301426252.html">open a U.S. headquarters</a> based in Los Angeles. The company also plans to open more than 60 sales locations, multiple service centers and some mobile service sites by 2022. A factory is also on the list, although that is not slated to open until the second half of 2024.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fast run-up for VinFast that will require significant capital and staff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nguyen has been in the states just 14 months, she said, working to put together the team that will bring VinFast models to the U.S. market. She would not disclose where that manufacturing facility might be located, however.</p>
<p>VinFast <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/vietnams-vinfast-plans-us-listing-couple-years-ceo-2021-11-17/">also told Reuters</a> recently that the company plans to list on the U.S. stock market in the next few years.</p>
<p>While other Asian auto manufacturers like Korean-owned Hyundai and Kia and Japanese-owned Toyota, Subaru and Mazda have all cracked the U.S. market, VinFast is the first Vietnamese company to make the attempt. Chinese companies like BYD have tried and failed to break into the U.S. market.</p>
<h2>What is VinFast?</h2>
<p>VinFast is a part of the Vingroup, a private Vietnamese conglomerate started in 1993 that dabbles in everything from real estate and hospitality to industrials, technology and even education.</p>
<p>VinFast, the automotive arm, announced its first internal combustion engine vehicles at the 2018 Paris Motor Show, a pair of luxury sedans that used BMW engines. They quickly followed up with the launch of a number of e-scooters, Lux SUVs and cars specifically for the Vietnamese market. Within a year, the company says its vehicles became the <a href="https://vinfastauto.us/story">fastest-selling in Vietnam</a>.</p>
<p>Just this year, the company launched an all-electric bus and more scooters in Vietnam, as well as the two SUVs it pulled the cover off of at the LA Auto Show on Wednesday, the VinFast VFe35 and VFe36, which the company says will be global vehicles. In many ways, VinFast seems similar to a Hyundai Group in that the automotive business makes up a very small portion of the other main businesses.</p>
<p>Vingroup also owns VinAI, which, according to a small display off to the side of the two new SUVs VinFast unveiled at the show, is a separate legal entity that is working on what appears to be an in-car AI that can track your movements in the driver&#8217;s seat to determine whether you&#8217;re paying attention, looking at your phone or drowsy. The system also uses sensors and cameras to determine obstacles like pedestrians and scooters outside the vehicle and help avoid crashes.</p>
<h2>Two electric SUVs for the global market</h2>
<p>The VinFast VFe35 and VFe36, both electric vehicles, will be built in VinFast&#8217;s massive, 90% automated manufacturing facility in Vietnam. The two vehicles were designed in partnership with automotive brand Pininfarina. That name likely sounds familiar &#8212; Pininfarina is known for designing classic Ferraris as well as the Pininfarina Battista, an electric sports car that costs $2 million.</p>
<p>VinFast said that the SUVs will be able to travel around 300 miles on a charge, though it did not reveal any charging or capacity details on Wednesday. Nguyen added that there will be two versions of each vehicle, the Eco and Plus models. She said that the VFe35 will have a range of around 285 miles in the Eco model and 310 miles in the Plus model. The larger VFe36 Eco model will get around 310 miles and the Plus will get around 420 miles of range, she said.</p>
<p>The two SUVs on the stage at the LA Auto Show are both prototypes, and the spec sheet shows that the VFe35 and VFe36 prototypes appear to have 402 hp and 472 lb-ft of torque, a variety of airbags, a virtual assistant, &#8220;remote control by VinFast App,&#8221; an e-commerce service, video game, in-car office and something called location-based and behavioral advertising.</p>
<p>Nguyen said that VinFast is working closely with a number of partners. While she wouldn&#8217;t disclose the battery supplier, she said the cells are from a &#8220;very, very famous company.&#8221;</p>
<p>The battery packs will be made at VinFast&#8217;s facility in Vietnam. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been working closely with our battery partners like ProLogium and few others as well,&#8221; she added. &#8220;We have selected very good and experienced partners on battery technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>ProLogium is a solid-state battery manufacturer based in Taiwan.</p>
<p>VinFast says that the two vehicles will have a suite of standard advanced driver assistance systems, a full-color head-up display, and a 15.5-inch touchscreen that can be changed to display your favorite photo in &#8220;zen mode&#8221; with a swipe of your finger.</p>
<p>We weren&#8217;t allowed to open the doors of either vehicle on the floor at the LA Auto Show. The smaller VFe35 had what appeared to be a real interior, but no digital cluster in front of the steering wheel, while the VFe36 had no interior.</p>
<p>VinFast plans to sell only electric vehicles in the U.S., and its rapid four-year path to vehicle production is almost unheard of in the automotive industry. The company said that deliveries of vehicles will start at the end of 2022. We&#8217;ll have to wait until next year to see just how it all shakes out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Pentagon <a href="https://sam.gov/opp/dbc25be4a53746a19ecf7ed14863ffdd/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a limited request for bids</a> for a new cloud initiative today that replaces <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nobody-wins-as-dod-finally-pulls-the-plug-on-controversial-10b-jedi-contract/">the cancelled $10 billion</a>, decade-long JEDI contract initiative. You may recall (or not) that it previously ran a winner-take-all bid it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/15/why-the-pentagons-10-billion-jedi-deal-has-cloud-companies-going-nuts/">dubbed JEDI</a> (short for Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure). The new initiative goes by the much less catchy name, Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability, or JWCC for short.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the RFP, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Oracle have been invited to bid. That multi-vendor approach is markedly different from the JEDI RFP, where just a single vendor was going to walk away with the prize. In fact, the Pentagon makes clear that while it favors Amazon and Microsoft, any of the qualified (invited) vendors could get a piece of this deal.</p>
<p>As the RFP states, &#8220;The Government anticipates awarding two IDIQ contracts &#8212; one to Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) and one to Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) &#8212; but intends to award to all Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) that demonstrate the capability to meet DoD’s requirements.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237292" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It appears it limited the number of vendors involved because after researching its requirements, the Pentagon found that there were a limited number of companies out there capable of meeting them. &#8220;Market research indicates that a limited number of sources are capable of meeting the Department’s requirements. Currently, the Department is aware of only five U.S.-based hyperscale CSPs (cloud service providers). Furthermore, only two of those hyperscale CSPs &#8212; AWS and Microsoft &#8212; appear to be capable of meeting all of the DoD’s requirements at this time, including providing cloud services at all levels of national security classification.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government is still working out the pricing for this one, but with multiple vendors involved, it&#8217;s entirely possible that it will exceed the $10 billion price tag of the now-defunct JEDI contract. &#8220;The Department is still evaluating the contract ceiling for this procurement, but anticipates that a multi-billion dollar ceiling will be required. The contract ordering ceiling will be included in any directed solicitations issued to vendors.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that each company that wins an award under the terms of the RFP will get a three-year contract for its piece, with two one-year option periods.</p>
<p>JEDI was mired in controversy from the start as top cloud vendors jockeyed for position, and lesser ones also tried to get into the act. There was much drama, complaints <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-04/oracle-s-catz-is-said-to-raise-amazon-contract-fight-with-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the president</a>, complaints <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/president-throws-latest-wrench-in-10b-jedi-cloud-contract-selection-process/">from the president</a>, complaints <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/in-latest-jedi-contract-drama-aws-files-motion-to-stop-work-on-project/">about presidential interference</a>, formal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/dod-inspector-general-report-finds-everything-was-basically-hunky-dory-with-jedi-cloud-contract-bid/">inquiries galore</a> and several <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/oracle-loses-10b-jedi-cloud-contract-appeal-yet-again/">lawsuits</a>. In the end, in spite of everyone believing that Amazon would win the bid, it didn&#8217;t. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/25/in-a-victory-over-amazon-microsoft-wins-10b-pentagon-jedi-cloud-contract/">Microsoft did</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But that wasn&#8217;t the end, and the two companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/microsoft-and-aws-exchange-poisoned-pen-blog-posts-in-latest-pentagon-jedi-contract-spat/">went to the mat</a> over the decision, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/judge-halts-microsoft-work-on-jedi-contract-after-aws-request/">ending up in court, </a>of course. Eventually the Pentagon tired of the whole thing and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nobody-wins-as-dod-finally-pulls-the-plug-on-controversial-10b-jedi-contract/">decided to scrap the project</a> altogether.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t mean, however, that the military&#8217;s requirement to modernize its computing systems went away just because the contract did. That&#8217;s why today, the Pentagon announced the new initiative to push technology modernization involving cloud infrastructure back to the forefront.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/amazon-microsoft-google-grab-the-big-numbers-but-rest-of-cloud-market-still-grows-by-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Synergy Research</a>, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/cloud-infrastructure-market-hits-180b-run-rate-in-q3-as-even-chip-shortages-cant-slow-it-down/">of Q3 earnings reports</a>, the top three vendors &#8212; Amazon, Microsoft and Google account for 70% of the market share. Amazon leads the cloud infrastructure market with 33% market share, Microsoft follows with around 20% and Google is in third with 10%. Oracle is in the low single digits, according to Synergy.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Did you know your company’s data privacy practices can be a competitive differentiator? Usually, we think of competitive differentiators around the level of service you provide, the quality of your products or even the price point for your solutions.</p>
<p>However, no matter the industry, if you participate in the ecosystem of personal data, how you handle that data could make or break your business — literally — which means it can also help set you apart from competitors.</p>
<p>Consumers today <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">mistrust</a> how companies use their data and will only share personal information for transactions they view as important, such as those in the healthcare or financial services industries.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236555" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But winning the trust of consumers often goes hand-in-hand with winning their business: <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">87% of surveyed U.S. consumers</a> said they would not do business with a company if they had concerns with its privacy practices. Amid this lack of trust, companies like Google and Apple are taking proactive steps to position themselves favorably with consumers: Third-party cookies going by the wayside and the release of iOS 15 are two stark examples of this.</p>
<p>For other players in the data landscape, it’s critical to reevaluate your practices as well. Whether your company is just starting out or has an established market presence, there are specific actions you can take to position your company for success, and it all starts with developing and publishing a data ethics framework.</p>
<h2>Assess how customers want their data treated</h2>
<p>A data ethics framework is a set of guiding principles for how your company collects, stores, uses and deletes data. This framework will differ for each individual company based on the industry it sits in and the customers it interacts with, but at the most basic level, it must consist of what you believe and how you act.</p>
<p>The first step in creating this framework is understanding what the expectation is from your customers and data subjects around how they want their data treated. We call this the Platinum Rule: treating people’s data the way <em>they</em> want it to be treated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What consents have they provided? Are there any gaps in how you communicate how their data is used? Do you have processes in place for not only ethically collecting data but deleting it as well?</p>
<p>Evaluate your privacy policies and the experience consumers have with them (i.e., if they’re easy to comprehend) to understand at a granular level how consumers want their data treated.</p>
<h2>Hire a chief data ethics officer</h2>
<p>Hiring a chief data ethics officer (CDEO) to steward the creation of a data ethics framework is also a key step. Unlike a chief data officer, who must manage data and draw business value from it, the CDEO is primarily responsible for ensuring data is used ethically by all employees and partners.</p>
<p>By dedicating a member of the executive team to this specific task, your company is showing that you’re not just talking about data ethics because it’s the right thing to do &#8212; you’re making an investment to ensure data ethics are upheld.</p>
<p>Part of the CDEO’s mandate will be to create the data ethics framework, but it shouldn’t just be up to them — your entire executive team, including the CEO, CISO, CMO, head of product and engineering, and chief data scientists must be involved. Each of these stakeholders plays a role in the data ecosystem and must be part of the development of data ethics principles so there’s buy-in from all parts of the organization. Privacy practices are a core concern that each of these players is typically involved with; now, they must be involved with data ethics as well.</p>
<h2>Evaluate your organization’s data practices</h2>
<p>When the team is assembled that will contribute to crafting your organization’s data ethics framework, it’s now time to get a granular understanding of your data inventory process: what you collect, how you collect it and where you store it.</p>
<p>This technical understanding of what you do with data is something your company should already understand from a legal perspective. Ensure that all stakeholders are clear and aligned with this process.</p>
<p>However, if processes must be changed, now is the time to do so. For example, if you review your privacy policies and realize they’re too lengthy, difficult to understand or something users just click through without absorbing the information, it may be necessary to redesign how you present privacy consent forms.</p>
<p>Rather than sharing a big block of text filled with legal jargon, consider a layered approach that uses colloquial language and visuals, organizing the information in a more digestible way. By presenting this information to users in a way they can understand, your company is on its way to operating more ethically.</p>
<h2>Operationalize your data ethics framework</h2>
<p>Now it’s time for your executive team to align on how your company acts and, at a philosophical level, what you want it to become or do — this is the basis of your framework.</p>
<p>You should outline specific actions your company takes to uphold ethical data practices today by publishing data ethics principles. But remember: The data landscape is constantly evolving, which means your data ethics framework should as well. Creating a set of guiding principles that can be revised and refined over time is key.</p>
<p>These principles must be disseminated to all internal and external stakeholders for your framework to take effect. Make prospective job applicants aware of your data ethics principles through the job description or other means so that before they even start working for your company, they understand how critical ethical practices are.</p>
<p>Once candidates are hired, ensure data ethics discussions are part of onboarding. Provide ongoing training on a company and department level and make data ethics a foundational matter of employee conduct. It’s not enough to just make the principles available to read — every employee from the CEO to interns should be accountable for ethical data practices.</p>
<p>Your partners, suppliers, data processors and customers should be aware of these practices as well. By making ethical data management part of any business discussion, you can set expectations and ensure your company aligns itself with other players in the industry who operate ethically. And when data ethics principles are readily available for any customer or partner to access, you’ll be operating in a transparent way, which demonstrates nothing nefarious is happening behind the scenes.</p>
<h2>Don’t wait to get started</h2>
<p>It’s never too late to create and implement a data ethics framework, but the best step a company can take is implementing this framework from the outset of the business.</p>
<p>For early-stage startups, this is good news — it can be very difficult to insert this framework into business functions that are already in motion. For more established brands, it may be trickier to implement, but the sooner you do, the better off your company will be.</p>
<p>Once a data ethics framework is in place, remember to continuously evaluate the accuracy and quality of your data. If you leverage outdated, incomplete or inaccurate data, you could risk losing customer trust, undermining all the work your company has done to operate more ethically.</p>
<p>With continuous improvement and accountability, businesses can win trust and be set up for long-term success.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Funding for startups is on fire. But sometimes to get that funding, particularly after the seed round, startups need to have their financial house in order.</p>
<p>In the early stages, leaders are usually laser-focused on three key areas: developing their product or service, getting sales and generating cash flow. They can’t afford to invest in the wrong areas, including the wrong people and positions. Most don’t see hiring a CFO as a burning need yet, since an experienced CFO can command a big salary.</p>
<p>Fractional CFOs are the answer for a growing number of small companies. By bringing on a part-time CFO, a startup can get the benefits of having a veteran finance leader they likely couldn’t afford or even attract at such an early stage.</p>
<p>Typically, a business will bring on a fractional CFO for a limited time frame, often to help it mature its finance operations and secure its next round of funding. After that point, the company might hire an in-house CFO and accounting team.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Fractional CFOs are a short-term bridge, and they generally aren’t angling for a full-time job.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Now that so many companies have adjusted to working remotely, some are keeping fractional CFOs on longer. For example, one of our customers, Countsy, provides outsourced CFOs and entire accounting and HR departments for startups and growing companies in the technology and life-science industries. Its business is booming right now.</p>
<p>Whether a fractional CFO is hired for the short term or for an extended stay, companies are seeing that bringing in this expertise early on can truly change their trajectory.</p>
<p>Working with businesses in a variety of industries, I see those that bring in a fractional CFO benefit in three key ways:</p>
<h2>1. Expertise and connections</h2>
<p>It often makes sense for ambitious companies to look for outside expertise to get their finances in order while they focus on building products and ramping up sales. Most fractional CFOs have served as a company CFO in the past, and many have a background in private equity or venture capital and have steered startups to successful exits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), an expert steering body which advises EU lawmakers on how to interpret rules wrapping citizen&#8217;s personal data, has warned the bloc&#8217;s legislators that a package of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">incoming digital regulations</a> risks damaging people&#8217;s fundamental rights &#8212; without &#8220;decisive action&#8221; to amend the suite of proposals.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The reference is to draft rules covering digital platform governance and accountability (the Digital Services Act; DSA);</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> proposals for ex ante rules for internet gatekeepers (the Digital Markets Act; DMA), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/">the Data Governance Act</a> (DGA), which aims to encourage data reuse as an engine for innovation and AI; and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">Regulation on a European approach for Artificial Intelligence</a> (AIR), which sets out a risk-based framework for regulating applications of AI. </span></p>
<p>The EDPB&#8217;s analysis further suggests that the package of pan-EU digital rules updates will be hampered by fragmented oversight and legal inconsistencies &#8212; potentially conflicting with existing EU data protection law unless clarified to avoid harmfully inconsistent interpretations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237189" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Most notably, in a <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-11/edpb_statement_on_the_digital_services_package_and_data_strategy_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> published today following a plenary meeting yesterday, the EDPB makes a direct call for EU legislators to implement stricter regulations on targeted advertising in favor of alternatives that do not require the tracking and profiling of internet users &#8212; going on to call for lawmakers to consider &#8220;a phase-out leading to a prohibition of targeted advertising on the basis of pervasive tracking&#8221;.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EDPB statement urges that the profiling of children for ad targeting should &#8220;overall be prohibited&#8221;.</p>
<p>As it happens, the European Parliament&#8217;s internal market and consumer protection (IMCO) committee was today <a href="https://multimedia.europarl.europa.eu/en/committee-on-internal-market-and-consumer-protection_20211119-1000-COMMITTEE-IMCO_vd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holding a hearing</a> to discuss targeted advertising, as MEPs consider amendments to a wider digital regulation package known as the Digital Services Act (DSA).</p>
<p>There has been a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/">push by a number of MEPs</a> for an outright ban on tracking-based ads to be added to the DSA package &#8212; given rising concern about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/international-coalition-joins-the-call-to-ban-surveillance-advertising/">myriad harms flowing from surveillance-based ads</a>, from ad fraud to individual manipulation and democratic erosion (to name a few).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rRwXoTOyoJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/">Inside a European push to outlaw creepy ads</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Inside a European push to outlaw creepy ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/embed/#?secret=rRwXoTOyoJ" data-secret="rRwXoTOyoJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However MEPs speaking during the IMCO committee hearing today suggested there would not be overall support in the Parliament to ban tracking ads &#8212; despite compelling testimony from a range of speakers articulating the harms of surveillance-based advertising and calling out the adtech industry for misleading lobbying on the issue by seeking to conflate targeting and tracking.</p>
<p>While retail lobbyist Ilya Bruggeman did speak up for tracking and profiling &#8212; parroting the big adtech platforms&#8217; claim that SMEs rely on privacy invasive ads &#8212; other speakers at the committee session aligned with <a href="https://twitter.com/ka_iwanska/status/1461708650897190927" target="_blank" rel="noopener">civil society</a> in challenging the line.</p>
<p>Johnny Ryan, a former adtech industry insider (now a fellow at the <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICCL</a>) &#8212; who has filed numerous GDPR complaints against real-time bidding (RTB)&#8217;s rampant misuse of personal data, dubbing it the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/irelands-data-watchdog-slammed-for-letting-adtech-carry-on-biggest-breach-of-all-time/">biggest security breach in history</a> &#8212; kicked off his presentation with a pointed debunking of industry spin, telling MEPs that the issue isn&#8217;t, as the title of the session had it, &#8220;targeted ads&#8221;; rather the problem boils down to &#8220;tracking-based ads&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have targeting, without having tracking,&#8221; he told MEPs, warning: &#8220;The industry that makes money from tracking wants you to think otherwise. So let&#8217;s correct that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The direction of travel of the European Parliament on behavioral ads (i.e. tracking-based targeting) in relation to another key digital package, the gatekeeper-targeting DMA, also looks like it will eschew a ban for general users in favor of beefing up consent requirements. Which sounds like great news for purveyors of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/01/wtf-is-dark-pattern-design/"> dark pattern design</a>.</p>
<p>That said, MEPs do appear to be considering a prohibition on tracking and profiling of minors for ad targeting &#8212; which raises questions of how that could be implemented without robust age verification also being implemented across all Internet services&#8230; Which, er, is not at all the case currently &#8212; nor in most people&#8217;s favored versions of the Internet. (The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">U.K. government might like it though</a>.)</p>
<p>So, if that ends up making it into the final version of the DMA, one way for services to comply/shrink their risk (i.e. of being accused of ad-targeting minors) could be for them to switch off tracking ads for all users by default &#8212; unless they really have robustly age-verified a specific user is an adult. (So maybe adtech platforms like Facebook would start requiring users to upload a national ID to use their &#8220;free&#8221; services in this version of the future&#8230; )</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In light of MEPs&#8217; tentativeness, the EDPB&#8217;s intervention looks significant &#8212; although the body does not have lawmaking powers itself.</p>
<p>But by urging EU co-legislators to take &#8220;decisive action&#8221; it&#8217;s firing a clear shot across the Council, Parliament and Commission&#8217;s bows to screw their courage to the sticking place and avoid the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy/">bear-pit of lobbying self-interest</a>; and remember that alternative forms of (contextually targeted) online advertising are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/data-from-dutch-public-broadcaster-shows-the-value-of-ditching-creepy-ads/">available</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/on-a-growth-tear-duckduckgo-reveals-it-picked-up-100m-in-secondary-investment-last-year/">And profitable</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our concerns consist of three categories: (1) lack of protection of individuals’ fundamental rights and freedoms; (2) fragmented supervision; and (3) risks of inconsistencies,&#8221; the Board writes in the statement, going on to warn that it &#8220;considers that, without further amendments, the proposals will negatively impact the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and lead to significant legal uncertainty that would undermine both the existing and future legal framework&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;As such, the proposals may fail to create the conditions for innovation and economic growth envisaged by the proposals themselves,&#8221; it also warns.</p>
<p>The EDPB&#8217;s concerns for citizens&#8217; fundamental rights also encompass the Commission&#8217;s proposal to regulate high-risk applications of artificial intelligence, with the body saying the draft AI Regulation does not go far enough to prevent the development of AI systems that are intended to categorize individuals &#8212; such as by using their biometrics (e.g. facial recognition) and according to ethnicity, gender and/or political or sexual orientation, or other prohibited grounds of discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPB considers that such systems should be prohibited in the EU and calls on the co-legislators to include such a ban in the AIR,&#8221; it writes. &#8220;Furthermore, the EDPB considers that the use of AI to infer emotions of a natural person is highly undesirable and should be prohibited, except for certain well-specified use-cases, namely for health or research purposes, subject to appropriate safeguards, conditions and limits.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Board has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public-to-safeguard-rights-urge-eu-bodies/">reiterated its earlier call</a> for a ban on the use of AI for remote biometric surveillance in public places &#8212; following a joint statement with the European Data Protection Supervisor back in June.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/european-parliament-backs-ban-on-remote-biometric-surveillance/">MEPs have also previously voted for a ban</a> on remote biometric surveillance.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal offered a very tepid, caveated restriction which has been widely criticized as insufficient.</p>
<p>&#8220;[G]iven the significant adverse effect for individuals’ fundamental rights and freedoms, the EDPB reiterates that the AIR should include a ban on any use of AI for an automated recognition of human features in publicly accessible spaces &#8212; such as of faces but also of gait, fingerprints, DNA, voice, keystrokes and other biometric or behavioural signals &#8212; in any context,&#8221; the Board writes in the statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proposed AIR currently allows for the use of real-time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement in certain cases. The EDPB welcomes the recently adopted EP Resolution where the significant risks are highlighted.&#8221;</p>

<p>On oversight, the EDBP sounds concerned about data protection bodies being bypassed by the bloc&#8217;s ambitious flotilla of digital regulations updates &#8212; urging &#8220;complementarity in oversight&#8221; to enhance legal certainty, as well as emphasizing the need for DPAs to be provided with &#8220;sufficient resources to perform these additional tasks&#8221;. (A perennial problem in an age of ever bigger data.)</p>
<p>Legal certainty would also be improved by including explicit references to existing data protection legislation (such as the GDPR and ePrivacy Directive), it argues, to avoid the risk of incoming data packages weakening core concepts of the GDPR such as consent to data processing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It also creates the risk that certain provisions could be read as deviating from the GDPR or the ePrivacy Directive. Consequently, certain provisions could easily be interpreted in a manner that is inconsistent with the existing legal framework and subsequently lead to legal uncertainty,&#8221; the Board warns.</p>
<p>So far from the EU&#8217;s much vaunted digital regulation reboot strengthening protections for citizens &#8212; to boost their trust in data-driven services &#8212; there is, failing some very key amendments, a risk of death by a thousand cuts (and/or regulatory complexity) to foundational fundamental rights, with potentially ruinous consequences for the bloc&#8217;s much proclaimed &#8220;European values&#8221;.</p>

<p>Although Halo View doesn&#8217;t have a built-in microphone, there is integration with Alexa. If you connect to the voice assistant through the Halo app settings, you can ask an Alexa-enabled device to tell you about your health summary, sleep quality and other information.</p>
<p>Amazon says privacy was a key consideration in how it designed Halo. &#8220;There are multiple layers of protections in place to keep data safe and in your control,&#8221; the company claims. It also pledged not to sell health data that&#8217;s linked directly to you. You&#8217;ll have the option to download your health data or delete it from the Halo app at any time too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In January, <a href="https://www.sabre.com/insights/releases/sabre-forges-10-year-partnership-with-google-to-build-the-future-of-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabre</a>, the travel technology company that probably managed at least some aspects of your last flight and hotel bookings, announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/google-cloud-lands-lufthansa-group-and-sabre-as-new-customers/">10-year partnership with Google Cloud</a> that would see it spend about $2 billion on Google&#8217;s cloud platform over that time. Sabre, like so many companies of its size, has long operated its own data centers, so any shift to the cloud would be a major undertaking. But while the story for a lot of big enterprises is all about being multi-cloud, Sabre is squarely betting on a single partner.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joedifonzo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe DiFonzo</a>, Sabre&#8217;s CIO, told me that this is the result of quite a bit of learning. When he joined Sabre in 2017, the company&#8217;s leadership had already decided on moving more workloads to the cloud. For Sabre, with its eight mainframes and more than 35,000 servers, that was never going to be a trivial undertaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was this whole element of how we operate our software, how we deploy our products, how we deliver service to customers, that was very much still sort of stuck in the traditional models, [including how you] run your own data center and the massive supply chain management issues around that, how we deploy software and package it, this notion of physical machine environments, that sort of thing,&#8221; he explained.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236668" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6LcRTPw25M"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/google-cloud-lands-lufthansa-group-and-sabre-as-new-customers/">Google Cloud lands Lufthansa Group and Sabre as new customers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google Cloud lands Lufthansa Group and Sabre as new customers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/google-cloud-lands-lufthansa-group-and-sabre-as-new-customers/embed/#?secret=6LcRTPw25M" data-secret="6LcRTPw25M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With buy-in from the leadership, he set to move the company to not only the cloud but also a modern development model. And like so many other companies, Sabre started making deals with a number of cloud providers, mostly because the team wasn&#8217;t sure yet who to bet on &#8212; or whether to opt for a multi-cloud approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were able to start making that journey, but we had not done a lot in the cloud before. So, originally, we went on path where we made deals with all the major cloud providers. We were thinking: well, let&#8217;s go down the multi-cloud path until we see if there&#8217;s something better, because, quite frankly, we didn&#8217;t know what we didn&#8217;t know and we didn&#8217;t want to make the mistake of committing to anybody too early.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while the leadership was behind the move, DiFonzo felt like he had to get an early win, in part because the company&#8217;s customers also had to be on board. For that, the team picked one of Sabre&#8217;s most important and most CPU-intensive services: its shopping application, which previously ran in its own Tulsa, Oklahoma data center. That&#8217;s where a lot of revenue for Sabre&#8217;s customers is generated, so by being able to show improved performance and stability for this service, the team was able to build up credibility for the rest of its roadmap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But by mid-2018, the team realized that using multiple clouds became a limiting factor. While all of the different providers offered a plethora of interesting services, being multi-cloud meant the team had to limit itself to the lowest common denominator across the different providers.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you didn&#8217;t take the least common denominator approach, then you&#8217;d have this massive problem of having to train your entire staff on three different sets of architectures, three different groups of databases, three different types of messaging mechanisms, and on and on and on,&#8221; DiFonzo said. &#8220;So we really came back to, &#8216;hey, given where the cloud vendors are today &#8212; and this is two years from the initial point &#8212; do we really have a lack of confidence that any one of them really could fulfill our needs?'&#8221;</p>
<p>After an extensive search, the team decided to go with Google Cloud, based on its technology offerings and road map, but also because of Google&#8217;s acquisition of ITA, which gave it unique insights into how the travel space operates. Sabre was also interested in Google&#8217;s AI technologies, as well as Apigee&#8217;s ability to help Sabre manage its APIs &#8212; and, as DiFonzo noted, both companies also had similar engineering mindsets.</p>
<p>Even with hindsight, more than two years later and with new multi-cloud tools available like Google&#8217;s own Anthos or Microsoft&#8217;s Azure Arc, DiFonzo believes he would make the same decision. Indeed, Sabre actually uses parts of Anthos to manage its applications inside of Google&#8217;s environment. But maybe most importantly, DiFonzo argues, going with a single vendor allows its engineering teams to focus.</p>
<p>So far, Sabre has trained more than 3,600 employees on Google Cloud (and those employees have consumed over 67,000 hours of learning content on Coursera alone).</p>
<p>At this point, about 15% of Sabre&#8217;s mid-range workloads have been migrated to Google&#8217;s cloud, including 100% of its Hotel Customer Reservation System and Travel Solutions airfare shopping service.</p>
<p>That may be slower than some expected. A report in The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-a-2-billion-google-cloud-contract-has-generated-only-10-million-in-revenue-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this year</a> noted that Sabre had only spent about $10 million on Google Cloud so far. But DiFonzo argues that nobody should be surprised by this, and that the last year was all about laying the foundations, with the move now accelerating. Indeed, he expects that 75% of Sabre&#8217;s total compute capacity will be powered by Google Cloud by the end of next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It took the time of training and building all the infrastructure &#8212; because our goal isn&#8217;t to just move machines immediately, it&#8217;s to be more efficient at the end of the day. All of the automation work and all of the planning work that went into this is now helping us move forward faster,&#8221; he said. That also means that the team is decomposing old applications into microservices, for example &#8212; which itself means that engineering and operations teams have to learn new skills. So it&#8217;s not just about containerizing existing applications, but also moving some applications to a serverless architecture using Google Cloud Functions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to take a little bit more work on our part to validate all that &#8212; performance and operation and scale, etc. But certainly, that just goes to the next level of how we continue to virtualize away a lot of the routine day-to-day management activities we have to deal with today,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>As for bringing more AI-powered services to its customers, DiFonzo noted that he doesn&#8217;t want to have to build all of the infrastructure to do so. Together, Saber and Google are developing a new AI-driven platform to bring more of this technology to Sabre&#8217;s product portfolio. Sabre is also in the process of moving 11 petabytes from its core data sets to Google Cloud (with all data migrating by 2023), and it&#8217;s about to launch a new market intelligence product that uses BigQuery and Looker to predict travel demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to stand on the shoulders of giants,&#8221; DiFonzo explained. &#8220;They have tens of thousands of engineers figuring out all this cool stuff. And I just want to put it to use as quickly and safely as we can here at Sabre.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hulu is getting a sizable upgrade starting next month that will give its Live TV subscribers access to both the Disney+ and ESPN+ streaming services as part of their plan. Beginning on December 21, 2021, Hulu + Live TV subscriptions across both its ad-free and ad-supported tiers will bundle in access to Disney&#8217;s other streaming services for a small &#8212; but not optional &#8212; upcharge.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/how-much-does-hulu-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans</a> will increase by $5 per month, the company says.</p>
<p>That means the Hulu + Live TV Ad-Supported plan will now be $69.99 per month instead of $64.99 per month, while the Hulu +  Live TV No Ads plan will now be $75.99 per month, instead of $70.99 per month.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236903" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While generally, streaming subscribers don&#8217;t appreciate the constant fee hikes they&#8217;ve been seeing, a $5 increase to add on two more major streaming services may be viewed a bit differently. By itself, a Disney+ subscription would have otherwise cost either $7.99 per month or $79.99 per year. Meanwhile, ESPN+ is priced at either $6.99 per month, or $69.99 per year. If you subscribed to at least one of those separately from your Hulu + Live TV plan, you&#8217;ll be saving money.</p>
<p>Before this change, all three services had been separately marketing <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/disney-hulu-espn-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the &#8220;Disney bundle,</a>&#8221; which combined Disney+ and ESPN+ with Hulu&#8217;s regular ad-supported or ad-free plan for $13.99 per month or $19.99 per month, respectively. However, this combo had left out Hulu + Live TV subscribers from accessing a similar bundle discount.</p>
<p>Of course, the current Disney bundle is something consumers can opt into if they want to combine multiple services onto one bill. Hulu + Live TV is being upgraded automatically.</p>
<p>Despite the combination, users will still need different apps. While ESPN+ content <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/hulu-disney-espn-bundle#watch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was already made available</a> in the Hulu app, users will still need to visit a separate app to access Disney+. Hulu will email users an activation link for adding Disney+, it says, and will include this link in users&#8217; account settings for easy access.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also notes that existing subscribers will not need to cancel Disney+ or ESPN+, if they were already subscribed. As long as the email addresses on file for both accounts are the same &#8212; and they&#8217;re paying through Hulu (not a carrier) &#8212; the subscriptions will be connected automatically. For applicable subscribers, Hulu will issue a credit for the retail value of each existing subscription on their first regular billing cycle on or after December 21.</p>
<p>Disney has been working to further capitalize on its Hulu investment since its 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/disney-closes-it-71-3b-fox-acquisition/">acquisition</a> of Fox and subsequent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/15/hulu-buys-back-atts-minority-stake-in-streaming-service-now-valued-at-15-billion/">buyback</a> of AT&amp;T&#8217;s 9.3% stake <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/hulu-disney-comcast/">gave it full operational control</a> of Hulu. In the time since, it&#8217;s changed the organizational structure, raised prices and combined some content libraries.</p>
<p>Last year, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/hulu-restructures-under-disney-ceo-randy-freer-departs/">restructured</a> Hulu to streamline executives&#8217; reporting structure to be directed to Disney&#8217;s Direct to Consumer and International chairman, which was then Kevin Mayer. (Mayer shortly thereafter left to run TikTok in the U.S., then <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer-resigns-control-acquisition-bytedance-zhang-yiming-2020-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quit</a> amid the Trump-induced &#8220;TikTok ban&#8221; drama. <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/leaders/rebecca-campbell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebecca Campbell</a> <a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/rebecca-campbell-disney-kevin-mayer-direct-to-consumer-international-1234611583/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">succeeded</a> him at Disney.)</p>
<p>Disney this year <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/disney-phase-out-hotstar-us-espn-hulu-bundle-1235050111/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made the decision</a> to fold in Hotstar&#8217;s South Asian sports and entertainment programing into ESPN+ and Hulu, and shutter the standalone Hotstar U.S. service in 2022. The company also pushed price increases across its service, hiking Hulu + Live <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/hulu-will-increase-the-price-of-its-live-tv-service-again-on-december-18th/">by $10 more per month last December,</a> and <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/09/hulu-raises-prices-disney-ad-supported-premium-streaming-1234827203/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later</a> bumping up the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22661241/hulu-plans-ads-dollar-price-increase-monthly-subscription-disney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hulu + Live service</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348169/disney-price-increase-united-states-bundle-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney+</a>, ESPN+ and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348169/disney-price-increase-united-states-bundle-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney bundle</a> by $1 more per month in 2021.</p>
<p>Today, Disney+ is larger and growing faster than the Hulu business. As of Disney&#8217;s fiscal Q4 2021 <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2021/11/q4-fy21-earnings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings</a>, Disney+ had 118.1 million subscribers, up 60% year-over-year, while Hulu combined business had 43.8 million subscribers, up 20% year-over-year. Hulu&#8217;s Live TV business is the smallest tier of Hulu, with just 4 million subscribers. That&#8217;s down from 4.1 million year-over-year &#8212; an indication that today&#8217;s consumers may see a declining value in live TV content. (It&#8217;s still larger than Sling TV, however, which <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/dish-network-dish-q3-earnings-145702640.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has 2.56 million</a> subscribers.)</p>
<p>This new bundle could give Hulu + Live TV&#8217;s numbers a boost, if it incentivizes upgrades or new sign-ups, as Disney hopes. Or it may end up being one price hike too many, leading to further cancellations as users drop down to the more affordable Disney bundle, which doesn&#8217;t have live TV.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The market for crypto-focused investing is growing rapidly. News that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/crypto-vc-firm-paradigm-debuts-monster-2-5-billion-fund/">Paradigm put together a $2.5 billion fund</a> the other day is a reminder of the scale of funds now available to startups looking to build on the blockchain. Andreessen Horowitz <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/">has a mega-fund in the market as well</a>, while Coinbase Ventures is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase-ventures/recent_investments">setting a blistering pace</a> for a corporate venture firm.</p>
<p>The result of the run-up in capital availability has led to, as in many other venture markets, larger and more rapid-fire rounds &#8212; and more unicorns.</p>
<p>While the now-dated unicorn valuation threshold of $1 billion is losing some of its salience in a market where there are hundreds of unicorns globally, inside a single niche the metric can still prove useful. The crypto market is one such place.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/">The Block</a>, a crypto-focused publication <a href="https://www.theblockresearch.com/">and research operation</a>, has <a href="https://www.theblockresearch.com/mapping-out-the-blockchain-unicorns-124025">a new data collection</a> out this morning that highlights just how rapidly the unicorn cohort is expanding in the crypto space. The data set also details where unicorns are being formed, in both focus terms &#8212; exchanges, NFT platforms, etc. &#8212; and geographically.</p>
<p>Key takeaways today are that the United States, despite certain domestic complaints that it is hostile to the crypto economy, is by far the dominant single market for crypto unicorn creation, and that the business-model mix of crypto unicorns is broader than I anticipated. Let&#8217;s dig in!</p>
<h2>Money</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s the perfect moment to discuss crypto unicorns, and not because Paradigm just secured billions to invest. Furthermore, rumor is out that OpenSea, an NFT platform, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/co-founder-titles-arent-a-formality-theyre-a-morality/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">considering raising capital at a $10 billion valuation</a>. The company was last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/nft-market-opensea-hits-1-5-billion-valuation/">valued at $1.5 billion earlier this year</a>. <em>That&#8217;s</em> the sort of valuation appreciation that some crypto startups are enjoying today.</p>
<p>The result? There are now 64 total crypto unicorns. And, per The Block Research, that figure has grown by 39 so far in 2021. Simply: More than half of the global crypto unicorns reached the $1 billion threshold this <em>year</em> alone.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why. Crypto trading has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/coinbase-crushes-q2-expectations-notes-q3-trading-volume-is-trending-lower/">proven to be nearly comedically lucrative</a>, leading to a number of exchanges <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2021/11/18/gemini-raises-400-million-to-protect-the-metaverse-from-meta-facebook/?sh=57e516b25f57">raising what we might describe as <em>hella bank</em></a>. But more than that, crypto assets themselves have proven to be profitable trades to host. NFT marketplaces are minting cash, adding more unicorns to the tally.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[To better understand Sequoia's new model, The Exchange reached out to a number of publicly listed venture capital groups from the United Kingdom.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/sequoia-dramatically-revamps-its-fund-structure-as-it-looks-to-rethink-venture-capital-model/">decision by Sequoia</a> to become a registered investment adviser (RIA) and move to a “singular, permanent structure,” in its own words, landed with a splash in the U.S. venture capital market. But perhaps it shouldn’t have made quite as many waves as it did.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Sequoia was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/andreessen-horowitz-isnt-alone-in-leaving-behind-vc-as-we-know-it-and-more-company-is-coming/">not the first</a> United States-based venture capitalist to opt for RIA status, and it was also not the first venture capitalist that The Exchange tracks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/how-public-markets-can-help-address-venture-capitals-limitations/">that moved to a more permanent-capital model</a>. The combination of becoming an RIA and moving to a capital pool that isn’t beset with artificial return windows may be notable in the United States, but we’ve seen examples of this elsewhere.</p>
<p>To better understand what Sequoia is up to, The Exchange reached out to a number of publicly listed venture capital groups from the United Kingdom: We chatted with Augmentum Fintech COO <a href="https://twitter.com/rmatthews_">Richard Matthews</a>, Molten Ventures partner <a href="https://twitter.com/vinothj">Vinoth Jayakumar</a> and Forward Partners Managing Partner <a href="https://twitter.com/brisbourne">Nic Brisbourne</a>. We’ve spoken to them before, when we previously explored the advantages and costs of VCs moving to listed status.</p>

The Sequoia shift, the investors told us, is similar to their own setup in its ability to provide more returns-timing flexibility — possibly allowing for greater return maximization — but different in whom it benefits.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about it.</p>
<h2>The Sequoia shift</h2>
<p>Sequoia partner Roelof Botha spoke about his firm’s model shift <a href="https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/66371765/botha-sequoias-crucible-moment?tab=transcript">on a podcast the other day</a>, giving us a somewhat long-form explanation of what it&#8217;s up to. During the show, he noted that Sequoia tells “founders that the IPO is a milestone” &#8212; not the finish line &#8212; for a company. So, he rhetorically asked, why “should the IPO be a destination for the investor”?</p>
<p>The comment gets at the crux of what Sequoia would like to do with its new model: hold investments longer, requiring the VC to be able to hold stocks over a long time horizon. RIAs are not beholden to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/sbcfac/2020-02-04-presentation-vc-fund-definition.pdf">venture capital rules</a> requiring them to hold 80% of their assets in private companies, loosely, and no more than 20% in other assets. This means that if a venture capitalist scores a big win with a startup that goes public, there will likely be pressure to liquidate some of the VC&#8217;s position as a result.</p>
<p>This can lead to earlier-than-desirable exits in terms of returns, i.e., VCs have to return stock or cash to their LPs before the investment in question has had its full chance to generate profit &#8212; and, therefore, returns for both venture fund backers (LPs) and venture fund managers (GPs).</p>
<p>And if there is one thing that is true about venture investors, it’s that they want to get paid.</p>
<p>In the same podcast, Botha said that Sequoia “realized” that the best venture bets “continue to compound, and the majority of the value accrues after the IPO.” The balance has changed, we’d note, as private companies stay private longer. But, yes, it’s true that in some cases, big returns largely land post-IPO. Shopify is an obvious example of how money can be made holding through a public offering, to pick one.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/2021-financial-operating-benchmarks-report">recent report from OpenView</a> makes this point well, noting that since Salesforce’s 2004 IPO, it has grown its valuation 210x. Shopify, the venture group noted, is up 143x from its IPO price. ServiceNow is up 60x. There are simply massive returns to be made — and therefore huge checks for GPs — in holding certain investments post-debut.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The skyline of the city is a mass of brightly lit office buildings, industrial factories and skyscrapers, the endless hash of lights and shadows making the night seem as if it is teeming with life. Within that urban jungle, we find <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitgupta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amit Gupta</a>, our dastardly hero. He smelled of fresh laundry, hair gel and a faint aroma of peppermint. His suit was a silken blend of powerful cologne and a soft, warm scent of leather and musk. His woolly hat was of a bright hue of burnt ochre. His necktie was of a darker hue of pink. The startup founder’s skin is soft and warm like a newborn baby. He has a strong handshake and a gentle demeanor. His conviction runs deep. The company? <a href="https://www.sudowrite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sudowrite</a>. The co-founder? James Yu, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/25/facebook-parse/">also founded Parse and later sold it to Facebook</a>. The investors? An impressive list of angels. The dollar amount? $3 million.</p>
<p>In the midst of the urban cacophony and an immense symphony of sounds, the sounds of traffic, the sounds of kids playing, the sounds of televisions, of radio, of fire alarms, of police sirens, of mumbling drunks, he received a piece of blood-curdling news. Amit was diagnosed with leukemia, and his life was utterly upended. It was time to take stock, and really examine what was important for him. He took a breath &#8212; was he on borrowed time, or was this merely a wake-up call?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235339" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Startup.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235339" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2235339" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Startup.png" alt="" width="1024" height="358" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Startup.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Startup.png?resize=150,53 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Startup.png?resize=300,105 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Startup.png?resize=768,269 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Startup.png?resize=680,238 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Startup.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2235339" class="wp-caption-text">Asking Sudowrite to describe what a startup is had me laughing so hard I was gasping for air. Truly, a magical experience. Screenshots: Sudowrite</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235319" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Gone was the dream of running his existing startup, Photojojo, which was known for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/16/photojojo-gets-into-camera-gear-rentals-but-not-just-for-fancy-lenses/">drone rentals</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/01/turn-your-expensive-dlsr-into-a-cheap-pinhole-camera/">strange photography accessories</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/03/20/wrap-around-photo-frames-fit-on-corners/">creative photo-mounting ideas.</a> He sold it, and ended up spending some time trying to figure out what to do next. The money he got from the sale of his company was no thicker than a thin black leaf, curled like the wings of the devil, thin as paper, thin as smoke, thin as silk; it felt like spider webs.</p>
<p><strong>If the first couple of paragraphs of this article seem weird</strong>, that&#8217;s because I used the Sudowrite tool to write a bunch of descriptions. It&#8217;s hilarious &#8212; but also an incredibly powerful tool. Do they make sense? Not always, but that&#8217;s not the point &#8212; the tool isn&#8217;t meant to replace writers completely, but to help summarize or expand, or to spark the creative juices that sometimes are lacking in the writing process. With that in mind &#8212; as you can read from the completely bonkers beginnings of this article &#8212; it works fantastically well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sold Photojojo in 2014 after being sick and kind of going through some soul searching. I left Silicon Valley completely and did some travel. I did all these things on my bucket list. At some point, it was five years out from the transplant, which meant that like I probably wasn&#8217;t going to die of leukemia,&#8221; Amit Gupta, founder and CEO of Sudowrite told me. &#8220;And then I was like &#8212; well, what do I do with my life? I was coaching for a while. And then I ended up writing science fiction for the past several years and getting really into that. It was really fun, and something very new for me, starting all the way at the bottom and clawing my way up.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his journey as a science fiction writer, Gupta ran into an issue many writers experience: Writer&#8217;s block. It shouldn&#8217;t be this hard to write, should it?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I think Sudowrite solves multiple problems, and I think the specifics are different for every writer. One of the problems I discovered with writing was that it is very solitary. Coming from the startup world where everything is very collaborative. It felt very lonely to be sitting at the keyboard, hitting my head against the desk whenever I got stuck in having no outlet except for my once-a-week reading group which may or may not be able to help. I think our first impulse was, can we create something that acts like a creative partner sitting next to you, so that when you&#8217;re stuck you can turn to them and say, &#8216;I can&#8217;t figure this out? This isn&#8217;t working, like give me ideas.&#8217; That was the original impulse,&#8221; Gupta explains.</p>

They have been known to grow to a size just a little larger than a typical house cat. A hodgepodge of human skeletons lay huddled together in the dirt, their eye sockets staring blankly at the sky, nestled in a pile that looks more like a rubbish heap than a grave. The founders gather their wits, shaking the muck from their clogs and steeling themselves for battle. They can hear the dragon breathing down on them.

<p>&#8220;We wanted to <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">give you someone who&#8217;s almost as good as a human reading partner, to bounce ideas off of. Beyond that, I think as we talked to users, especially people in the entertainment industry such as screenwriters, we discovered there was a specific need. They have a lot of rote tasks that they don&#8217;t like doing: they might have a screenplay they&#8217;ve written and they might need to generate a one-page treatment, a three-page treatment, etc. It&#8217;s all very specific industry stuff, but it&#8217;s pretty easy for an AI to do. It&#8217;s not very creative work, and a tool like Sudowrite saves them hours and hours of the worst kind of work that they have to do. I think there&#8217;s a lot of opportunities like that, but the core product is really about inspiration provocation, helping you stay in flow.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Gupta was trying to fight off the loneliness of writers with a Sci-Fi writing group, where he met his co-founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesyu/">ex-Parse founder James Yu</a>. Together they built an early version of the app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/okay-the-gpt-3-hype-seems-pretty-reasonable/">built on GPT-3</a>, started getting some paid customers, and decided to raise some funds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started thinking we&#8217;d raise about $1 million just to get this off the ground. We ended up raising $3 million, almost entirely from individual investors. That was by design: We wanted to have people who were willing to allow us to experiment at our own pace and try some like weird stuff, without the pressure of doing the startup / VC treadmill,&#8221; explains Gupta.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s list of angel investors is incredibly impressive, and includes Medium and Twitter founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ev-williams/">Ev Williams</a>, Gumroad founder <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/sahil-lavingia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sahil Lavingia</a>, Parse founder <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/kevin-lacker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin Lacker</a>, WordPress founder <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/matt-mullenweg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Mullenweg</a> and Rotten Tomatoes founder <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/patrick-lee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patrick Lee</a>. The cap table also includes an impressive who-is-who from the entertainment world, including Big Fish and Aladdin screenwriter <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0041864/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John August</a>, Bourne Ultimatum and Oceans Twelve writer/director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1079776" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Nolfi</a>, and many more.</p>
<p>The company currently has between 300 and 400 users, paying around $20 per month for the platform. The fundraising round enabled the founding team to extend the team a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;The primary thing this fundraise unlocks for us is to be able to hire. We hired our first machine learning person, our first developer and a lead designer. Those are the first three roles we just closed, and we&#8217;ll probably keep the team at that size for a while as we hit our stride,&#8221; explains Gupta. &#8220;Our users all came from word of mouth, and cover a wide range. We have people who are writing novels or screenplays. Some of our users are creating Substack newsletters. We have users who write for their occupation. But we have some unusual use cases too: A rabbi who uses Sudowrite to make parables, and someone who uses the tool to write meditations. We also have users who create roleplaying games. We have a very broad appeal,&#8221;</p>
<p>Sudowrite was in closed beta until today &#8211; now, you can sign up for the beta yourself to give it a whirl.</p>
<p>Below, I&#8217;m embedding a video demo Gupta recorded. It&#8217;s a few months old, but it gives a bit more of an idea what the tool is and how it works.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. financial regulators have approved a new rule that requires <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/banking/">banking</a> organizations to report any “significant” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> incident within 36 hours of discovery.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Under the rule, banks must inform their primary federal regulator about incidents that have — or are reasonably likely to materially affect — the viability of their operations, their ability to deliver products and services, or the stability of the U.S. financial sector. That could include large-scale distributed denial of service (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ddos/">DDoS</a>) attacks that disrupt customer access to banking services, or computer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/hacking/">hacking</a> incidents that disable banking operations for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>Additionally, banks — which the rule defines as “banking organizations” including national banks, federal associations, and federal branches of foreign banks — must notify customers “as soon as possible” if the incident has or might materially affect their customers for four hours or more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237154" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Computer-security incidents can result from destructive malware or malicious software (cyberattacks), as well as non-malicious failure of hardware and software, personnel errors, and other causes,&#8221; the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/board-matters/2021/2021-11-17-notational-fr.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer-Security Incident Notification Final Rule</a> explains. &#8220;Cyberattacks targeting the financial services industry have increased in frequency and severity in recent years. These cyberattacks can adversely affect banking organizations&#8217; networks, data, and systems, and ultimately their ability to resume normal operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The final rule, approved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), will take effect on April 1, 2022, with full compliance expected by May 1, 2022.</p>
<p>The FDIC told TechCrunch in a statement that the rules &#8220;would apply to only those entities that are insured or regulated by the three banking agencies (FDIC, Federal Reserve or Office of the Comptroller of the Currency), or organizations that provide services to a regulated bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>Financial regulators first proposed the notification requirement in December, but after receiving some negative feedback from industry groups, it was forced to change some elements of the final rule.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The original version, for example, said that banks would have to report incidents if they “believed in good faith” they had suffered a significant cyber incident, but the industry warned that this could lead to over-reporting of a wide range of incidents, and the rule was changed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“After considering the comments carefully, the agencies are replacing the ‘good faith belief’ standard with a banking organization’s determination,” <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20211118a1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the final rule summary states</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> “The agencies agree with commenters who criticized the proposed ‘believes in good faith’ standard as too subjective and imprecise.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The Bank Policy Institute, one of the industry groups that had commented on the regulation, <a href="https://bpi.com/bpi-supports-cyber-incident-notification-rule-finalized-by-banking-regulators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a statement</a> that it supported the final rule.</p>
<p>“BPI recognizes the value of timely notification and supports the final rule, which establishes a clear timeline and flexible process for notifying regulators and affected parties when a significant incident occurs,” said Heather Hogsett, BPI&#8217;s senior vice president of Technology and Risk Strategy. “The rule also importantly maintains a clear distinction between notification and reporting. Cyber incident notification encourages early collaboration between regulators and banks so that regulators are made aware of circumstances that may have broader implications across the financial system while banks work to respond to, and investigate the incident.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Mini, the diminutive and unexpectedly fun to drive car born out of the <a href="https://www.mini.com/en_MS/home/automotive/heritage/1959-the-mini-was-born.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late 1950s fuel crisis in the U.K.</a>, is undergoing another revolution. This time, it&#8217;s being driven by climate change and parent company BMW&#8217;s plan to go all-electric by 2030.</p>
<p>Mini isn&#8217;t new to battery electrics &#8212; the <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2010/08/19/lessons-learned-after-150000-kilometers-with-the-mini-e-pilot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mini E pilot program</a> started way back in 2008. The current Mini SE electric vehicle has been in high demand since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/all-electric-mini-cooper-se-priced-starting-at-29900-in-the-u-s/https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/all-electric-mini-cooper-se-priced-starting-at-29900-in-the-u-s/">going on sale in 2020</a>. But they&#8217;re not the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both the Mini E and the Cooper SE. They&#8217;re essentially retrofits of existing internal combustion engine vehicles. So we have yet to really get into the space,&#8221; Mike Peyton, vice president of MINI of the Americas, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237062" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like nearly all automakers, Mini is working on a dedicated electric platform for its future vehicles. However, the central focus isn&#8217;t range as much as how it drives. It has to drive like a Mini.</p>
<p>&#8220;​​It&#8217;s got to be fun. It&#8217;s got to be that Mini handling and we think that fits really, really well overall for electrification,&#8221; Peyton said. That behind-the-wheel go-kart feeling Mini is famous for needs to be there even when the vehicle is powered by electrons instead of dead dinosaurs.</p>
<p>As for how these future electric Minis will look, Peyton says, &#8220;it&#8217;s definitely going to be more of that modern interpretation of what people have maybe seen and expected from us. In our very early years, it was all about that minimalism and that simplicity. I think you&#8217;ll see that as a theme in a lot of our future cars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Future cars will include an electric convertible Mini that drives forward the tech, while maintaining its legacy and brand identity. The company is working today on what that future-yet-brand-centric EV looks like and how it can evolve moving forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Mini might get smaller and bigger</h2>
<p>More exciting is the potential for something completely unexpected, especially in a world quickly being populated by electric SUVs and crossovers. In the future, Peyton said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll also see some small-format vehicles, which are very very Mini.&#8221; When asked if these vehicles would be smaller than what the automaker currently has for sale, Peyton replied &#8220;potentially, yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>For fans of the pre-BMW-acquisition Minis, which are incredibly tiny, the move to electrification might usher in a new micro-vehicle market in the United States.</p>
<p>Peyton said the brand may also design and sell an EV Mini larger than what&#8217;s on the road today. It&#8217;s unclear exactly what &#8220;bigger&#8221; Mini means. Based on the reaction to the automaker&#8217;s <a href="https://www.mini.com/en_MS/home/nextgen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concept Urbanaut</a>, this vehicle may skew more VW microbus than Mini.</p>
<p>Mini is in an interesting position. The character of its vehicles &#8212; small, fun and mostly urban &#8212; fits incredibly well in an EV package.</p>
<p>The Mini SE (a vehicle with an EV powertrain shoved into a gas-powered car) is a bit of an appetizer of the company&#8217;s future. Even though its range of 110 miles is laughably small in a world where more than 200 miles is the norm, the first year of production was sold out. Mini says that 80% of those buying the vehicle are new to the brand.</p>
<p>The success of the brand as it navigates the climate crisis really relies on one thing. How its EVs drive and look. On that front Peyton tells us &#8220;it will always be unmistakably a Mini.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pony.ai, the self-driving startup that operates in both the U.S. and China, has lost at least two executives from its trucking team following the combination of the company’s passenger car and self-driving truck R&amp;D teams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development, initially detailed by two sources familiar with the internal restructure that happened quietly in September, was later confirmed by Pony. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Toyota-backed startup said the restructuring was made because combining the teams would lead to more efficient outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the move has called into question Pony’s plans for commercially developing autonomous trucking technology, specifically in the United States. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232394" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank (Zhenhao) Pan, one of the executives who recently resigned, was the chief technology officer for Pony&#8217;s trucking business. The team he led included senior engineers of the autonomous truck driving team in the U.S. Twenty members of that team have since left the company, either leading up to or immediately after the restructuring, a person familiar with the departures told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan and another colleague, Youhan Sun, who used to lead planning and control for Pony’s trucking business in the U.S., left to start another self-driving truck company together, Qingtian Smart Trucking Technology. According to Tianyancha, a Chinese database that compiles business records, Zhenhao owns 82% of Qingtian and Youhan owns 18%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sun Haowen, former head of planning and control for Pony’s autonomous driving in China, also left following the merger, </span><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/w4kWHIOAmijHEHWxsyrXBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to China’s LatePost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He has gone on to work at Qiangua Technology, a company that specializes in Level 4 autonomous trucking technology.</span></p>
<h3>Pony.ai&#8217;s thwarted IPO</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until August this year, Pony was gearing up to go public in New York with a $12 billion valuation through a SPAC merger. The company put those plans on hold as it struggled to gain assurances from Beijing that it wouldn’t become the next target of a crackdown against Chinese technology companies going public in the U.S., </span><a href="http://reuters.com/technology/exclusive-chinas-tech-crackdown-thwarts-ponyais-us-listing-plans-sources-2021-08-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Pony says it’s an American company with headquarters in Silicon Valley. However, much of its operations, including all of its self-driving truck testing, take place in China, a country that exerts considerable regulatory power over autonomous vehicle companies.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pony does have some operations in the U.S., notably in California, <span style="font-weight: 400;">where it tests passenger cars equipped with autonomous vehicle technology. The company has been testing its AVs on public roads in California since 2017. It was even providing a drivered passenger service in Irvine, California until service was suspended due to the pandemic. The service should return in 2022, the company says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pony’s SPAC deal would have given the startup an additional $1.2 billion to play with, but since the listing was reportedly blocked, Pony has had to think a little differently about its finances and the allocation of resources, according to LatePost. Pony declined to comment on its IPO, but a lack of resources could be the reason the two R&amp;D teams were combined. </span></p>
<h3>A short history of PonyTron</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company established a separate trucking division in 2020, which it branded <a href="https://www.telematicswire.net/pony-announces-brand-name-of-autonomous-truck-business-ponytron/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PonyTron</a> at the end of March. It was actively hiring for the division, Pony confirmed. The team had grown to about 100 people by September, according to LatePost. While PonyTron was growing fast, it still lagged in terms of total workforce compared to others in the self-driving trucks industry. </span><a href="https://ir.tusimple.com/static-files/2df1337a-af02-4ac3-9adc-ea1b5dcdf53f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TuSimple’s R&amp;D team is about 1,000 people</span></a>, for instance.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pony, while demonstrating potential, was still lagging in terms of resources. Now recruitment has slowed nearly to a halt and road tests for trucks based in the U.S. have been suspended, TechCrunch&#8217;s source confirmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pony denied that it had intentionally slowed its hiring in trucking, saying it has enough staff and will continue to fill roles as needed. The company also said it has the same approximate headcount working on trucking and auto as before, with plans to continue to hire in trucking to support future growth. </span></p>
<h3>Divide and conquer?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current trucking staff on the newly combined R&amp;D team are mainly junior engineers, since most of the senior ones left, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The source said at least some of the senior engineers believed strongly that smart trucking and passenger trucks should be separate, not combined. Many experts in the industry agree it makes more sense to train different models for different use cases. Passenger cars usually go to market as robotaxis, which are often trained to drive in urban environments. Trucks, which carry freight between cities, are often trained to drive on highways.</span></p>
<p>Some companies, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/self-driving-startup-aurora-taps-pixar-veterans-to-make-a-more-realistic-virtual-world-for-testing/">Aurora</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/waymo-self-driving-vehicles-are-headed-to-nyc-for-a-mapping-operation/">Waymo</a>, have been known to follow a similar approach to Pony and combine forces, saying experiences learned by one driver can benefit others. Others tend to focus on one or the other because they say it&#8217;s a faster and more direct route to market, which will allow for a better business and possibly room in the future to move into other markets. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/self-driving-truck-startup-kodiak-robotics-raises-125m/">Kodiak Robotics</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/tusimple-aims-to-test-self-driving-trucks-on-public-roads-without-human-safety-operator-by-eoy/">TuSimple</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/einride-launches-autonomous-pods-and-electric-freight-operations-in-u-s/">Einride</a> all work to solve the problem of highway driving, whereas companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/motional-and-lyft-to-launch-driverless-commercial-robotaxi-service-in-las-vegas-in-2023/">Motional</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/cruise-lays-out-its-plan-for-how-it-will-make-robotaxis-a-reality/">Cruise</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/walmart-to-launch-autonomous-delivery-service-with-ford-and-argo-ai/">Argo AI</a> focus specifically on passenger cars and smaller delivery vehicles that are trained for urban autonomy.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It all comes down to management because the technology behind them is similar,” a former Pony employee told TechCrunch. “From a purely technological point of view, passenger cars and trucks could be worked on together. But when a company reaches such a scale, I think there are considerable obstacles if the two are combined.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you mix the technology, who is responsible for the product at the end of the day?&#8221; said the person who asked not to be named.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pony said both its robotaxi and trucking operations have always included urban and highway use cases and that the company remains equally focused on global robotaxi and trucking, adding that the reorganization has not changed its go-to market in China, at least. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To increase our engineering efficiency &#8212; and recognizing the many overlaps between virtual truck driver and virtual auto driver, in both coding and testing, especially in China &#8212; we optimized our R&amp;D processes,” a Pony spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We have the same approximate headcount working on trucking and auto as before, but the engineering process is now more fluid and integrated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spokesperson went on to say Pony is continuing to invest in its trucking business, “and we have made significant progress on that front, which we hope to announce shortly.”</span></p>
<p>Pony is also still focused on scaling robotaxis into a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/chinese-startup-pony-ai-plans-to-launch-a-driverless-robotaxi-service-in-california-in-2022/">commercial service</a> beyond Irvine and into other parts of California. <span style="font-weight: 400;">In May this year, Pony</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/chinese-startup-pony-ai-can-now-test-driverless-vehicles-in-three-california-cities/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">obtained a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to test fully driverless AVs on public roads, and the company says it’s been testing both driverless and drivered AVs on public roads in the state. Meanwhile in China, Pony just got the</span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211015005137/en/Pony.ai-to-Start-Driverless-Tests-on-Public-Roads-in-Beijing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">OK to perform driverless testing on public roads in Beijing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, something it&#8217;s been doing in Guangzhou, as well, as of this year. </span></p>
