										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I wasn’t super impressed when I reviewed the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/echo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="echo">Echo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Buds around this time last year, but <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> first shot at Alexa-powered fully wireless earbuds was passable. And while they’ve already been on the market for a while now, the company’s continuing to deliver some key updates, including today’s addition of new fitness features.</p>
<p>Say “Alexa, start my workout” with the buds in, and they’ll begin logging steps, calories, distance, pace and duration of runs. Like many new software additions, this one will take a few days to roll out for everyone. This one also requires users to enable the new tracking feature using the Alexa app.</p>
<p>Once enabled, you can state/ask follow-ups, like:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Alexa, start my run&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Alexa, pause my walk&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Alexa, end my workout&#8221;</li>
<li>“Alexa, how far have I run?”</li>
<li>“Alexa, what’s my pace?”</li>
<li>“Alexa, how was my workout?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Asking, “Alexa, how was my workout?” After the fact will pull up your historical running stats.</p>
<p>As I noted previously, the Echo Buds didn’t really do much to set themselves apart from myriad other earbuds, though there certainly was a lot to be said for the price — then $130. At the moment,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Buds/dp/B07F6VM1S3/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=echo+buds&amp;qid=1606161150&amp;sr=8-1"> they’re discounted much further</a>, now running $80 — which makes them a solidly competitive deal.</p>

		Richard is CMO of <a href="https://www.cheetahdigital.com/">Cheetah Digital</a>, a cross-channel customer engagement solution provider. As an expert in zero-party data, he is committed to helping brands provide a value exchange with consumers through the lifecycle in return for consumer attention, engagement and loyalty. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">2020 has brought about much-needed social movements. In June, activists launched the <a href="https://www.stophateforprofit.org/">Stop Hate for Profit</a> campaign, a call to hold social media companies like Facebook accountable for the hate happening on their platforms.</p>
<p>The idea was to pull advertising spending to wake these social platforms up. More than 1,200 businesses and nonprofits joined the movement, including brands such as The North Face, Patagonia and Verizon. I led my company, Cheetah Digital, to join alongside some of our clients like Starbucks and VF Corp.</p>
<p>Stop Hate for Profit highlighted social media hitting its tipping point. Twitter and Snapchat chose to stand up against hate speech, banning political ads and taking action to flag misinformation. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> unfortunately, has not yet been as proactive, or at best it’s been sporadic in its response.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While many thought the movement would come and go, the reality is it has only just begun. With America conducting arguably its most divisive election in history, these problems won&#8217;t just go away. For marketers, Stop Hate for Profit is more than a social movement — it is pointing to an issue with ad tech as a whole.</p>
<p>I believe we are seeing the downfall of ad tech as we know it with social media boycotts and data privacy leading the charge.</p>
<h2>The social media quagmire</h2>
<p>In May, Forrester released a report titled <a href="https://go.forrester.com/press-newsroom/brands-its-ok-to-break-up-with-social-media/#:~:text=And%2068%25%20don't%20think,can%20prove%20the%20impact%20quantitatively.">&#8220;It’s OK to Break Up with Social Media&#8221;</a> that contained statistics indicating that consumers are fed up with social media: 70% of respondents said they don’t trust social media platforms with their data. Only 14% of consumers believe the information they read on social media is trustworthy. 37% of online adults in the U.S. believe social media does more harm than good.</p>
<p>Here is the reality we need to get back to: Social media isn’t built for marketers to reach consumers. In the beginning of the social media craze, brands rushed to get on board and join the conversations. What many brands discovered is these channels became a platform for customer complaints not for building positive brand perception. Furthermore, the social platforms marketers flocked to as an avenue to reach customers began charging marketers just to get to the customers.</p>

<p>The algorithms that define what content you see unfortunately make it harder for people to see opposing views, and this more than anything else polarizes society further. If you start looking at QAnon content, very soon that’s all the algorithms feed you. You might spend more time on social platforms fueling their ad dollars, but you have also lost a grip on reality. Marketers must admit things have gone too far on social media and it is okay to move on.</p>
<h2>Privacy matters</h2>
<p>Imagine you are in need of a minor surgery. Perhaps you take an Uber ride to the specialist for a consultation. Next, you go get the surgery and it is successful. Soon you find yourself at home recovering and all is well. That is, until you start scrolling Facebook. Suddenly advertisements pop up for medical malpractice lawyers, but you haven’t told anyone about the surgery and you certainly didn’t post about it on social media.</p>
<p>Here you are, just wanting to rest and recover at home, but instead you are being bombarded by advertisements. So how did those ads get there? You left a digital footprint, your data was sold and now you&#8217;re being hit with intrusive ads. To me, this story crystallizes the abuse ad tech has been fostering in the world around us. There’s an utter invasion of privacy and consumers aren’t blind to it.</p>
<p>Data privacy has been a focus of conversation for marketers for several years now. Just this year, America saw the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) go into effect and become enforceable. This legislation gives back control of data to the consumer. In June, <a href="https://www.exchangewire.com/blog/2020/06/26/apple-announces-changes-to-idfa-brazil-blocks-whatsapp-pay/#:~:text=In%20a%20blog%20post%20detailing,user%20data%20for%20advertising%20purposes.">Apple announced updates</a> to make it harder for apps and publishers to track location data and use it for ad targeting. At the beginning of August, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/meredith-kroger-first-party-data-cpg-advertisers/">Meredith and Kroger announced a partnership</a> to provide first-party sales data for advertising efforts in an attempt to move off of cookies. It is clear data privacy is not a fad going away anytime soon.</p>
<h2>Where do marketers go from here?</h2>
<p>I believe the future of marketing is the trust economy. The Stop Hate for Profit campaign, the invasion of privacy and shifting attitudes and behaviors of consumers point to the end of an era where marketers relied upon third-party data. Trust is now the most impactful economic power, not data. We conducted research earlier this year with eConsultancy, and our findings revealed that <a href="https://www.cheetahdigital.com/press-release/cheetah-digital-research-reveals-2020-consumer-pov-towards-privacy-messaging-loyalty">39% of U.S. consumers don’t like personal ads driven from cookie data</a>. People don’t want to be tracked and targeted as they click around the web. Ad tech’s roof is caving in and marketers must adjust.</p>
<p>The old methods of marketing won’t carry you through into the era of the trust economy. It is time to look to new channels and revisit old channels. We have to shift back to the channels where we own what is being said. Advertising on social platforms should be focused on driving consumers to owned channels where you can capture their permissions and data to connect with them directly. Consider email as a channel to focus on.</p>
<p>Don’t worry — it works. That same eConsultancy report found nearly three out of four consumers made a purchase in the last 12 months from an email sent by a brand or retailer and massively outperformed social ads when it came to driving sales. Similarly <a href="https://www.cheetahdigital.com/press-release/cheetah-digital-research-reveals-2020-consumer-pov-towards-privacy-messaging-loyalty">nine times as many U.S. consumers</a> want to increase their participation in loyalty programs in 2020 than those that want to reduce their involvement. You have to ensure you are owning your data and loyalty programs are a treasure trove of consumer data you own. Emily Collins from Forrester does a good job of explaining why you can achieve this with a true <a href="https://www.cheetahdigital.com/signals/forrester-emily-collins-loyalty-strategy-rewards">loyalty strategy, not just a rewards program</a>.</p>
<p>Your goal should be to build direct connections to consumers. Building trust means offering a value exchange for data and engagement, not going and buying it from a third-party. Fatemah Khatibloo, a principal analyst for Forrester wrote, “<a href="https://www.cheetahdigital.com/blog/zero-party-data-explainer#:~:text=%E2%80%9CZero%2Dparty%20data%20is%20that,brand%20to%20recognize%20her.%E2%80%9D%20%2D">Zero-party data</a> is that which a customer intentionally and proactively shares with a brand. It can include purchase intentions, personal context, and how the individual wants the brand to recognize her.” This zero-party data is foundational for the trust economy and you should check out her advice on <a href="https://www.cheetahdigital.com/signals/forrester-fatemeh-khatibloo-zero-party-data-privacy-personalization">how it helps you navigate privacy and personalization</a>.</p>
<h2>Take responsibility</h2>
<p>The trust economy is really about asking yourself, as a marketer, what you stand for. How do you view your relationship with consumers? Do you care? What kind of relationship do you want? Privacy has to be part of this. Accountability is crucial. We must be accountable to where we are putting our money. It’s time to stop supporting hate, propping up the worst of society and fueling division. Start taking responsibility, caring about social issues and building meaningful relationships with consumers built on trust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sequoia-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sequoia-capital">Sequoia Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the renowned Silicon Valley venture capital firm that has backed companies like Apple, Google, Dropbox, Airbnb and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stripe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stripe">Stripe, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> recently disclosed that it had opened its first office in Europe. To staff up, it hired partner Luciana Lixandru away from rival Accel Partners.</p>
<p>Even without an official European presence, Sequoia has quietly operated in the region for more than a decade, first investing in Klarna in 2010. Other Europe-founded companies in its portfolio include Baaima, CEGX, Charlotte Tilbury, Dashlane, Evervault, FON Wireless, Front, Graphcore, Mapillary, Metaswitch Networks, n8n, Remote, Skyscanner, Songkick, Tessian, Tourlane, UiPath, Unity and 6Winderkinder (Wunderlist).</p>
<p>Yet, it is only now that the VC firm is putting people on the ground here in Europe, starting with an office in London that has a remit to invest across the continent.</p>
<p>Working alongside Lixandru is junior investor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/02/sequoia-europe/">George Robson, who joined from Revolut</a>. Most recently, Sequoia recruited Zoe Jervier Hewitt from EQT as head of talent in Europe. And finally, Matt Miller, a Sequoia U.S. veteran, is also part of the European efforts and plans to relocate next year, while I also understand that Sequoia&#8217;s Doug Leone will be spending a lot of his time in Europe.</p>
<p>Last week at the virtual &#8220;Node by Slush&#8221; event, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnjPCtG87dU">I interviewed Lixandru and Miller</a> and teased out some important details about Sequoia&#8217;s plans.</p>
<h2>1. Sequoia now believes Europe is producing market leaders ahead of Silicon Valley</h2>
<p>&#8220;There has been this evolution and maturity of the tech ecosystem that has been really meaningful, that has attracted us to want to put down boots on the ground and be more invested in Europe than ever before,&#8221; said Sequoia partner Matt Miller.</p>
<p>&#8220;One change is in the attitudes of young people. Europe has always been this place where there&#8217;s been incredible talent coming out of the computer science programs, across the universities across the continent and the U.K., and these young people previously, were going into careers in investment banking and consulting are bigger conglomerates. And now that those young people are interested in startups and technology careers, that&#8217;s fueling a lot of great ideas and a lot of great talent.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a long time this question of, when will there be a $10 billion plus startup, and now there&#8217;s multiple of them across the continent. And now the question has really changed: When will there be the next hundred billion dollar startup in Europe, and I think it&#8217;s just an evolution over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We find ourselves getting pulled more and more. So when … we want to invest in the best AI semiconductor company in the world, we looked at them in China, Israel and Europe. And the one we wanted to invest in was Graphcore, in Bristol [in the U.K.]. And when we looked … [to] invest in the best process automation company in the world, we looked at automation anywhere in California … and we looked at companies all over the world, and the one we wanted to invest in was UiPath in Romania. And that is increasingly becoming the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>“To some extent, success breeds success, too,&#8221; said Lixandru. &#8220;I think role models are really powerful. And the fact that there have been these category-leading companies created out of Europe, but that are winning on a global scale, like Spotify, Adyen and UiPath … I think that&#8217;s really inspirational to the next generation of founders. And I think that has helped a lot.&#8221;</p>
<h2>2. The firm will make investments out of the same fund as the U.S. and Canada</h2>
<p>&#8220;We work as one partnership across two geographies, and we invest from the same pool of capital across both geographies,&#8221; explained Lixandru. &#8220;And the rationale behind that is exactly what Max talked about. We want to be able to partner with category leading companies, and if they start in Paris, or in Stockholm, or in San Francisco, for us, it does not make a difference. We want to partner with them early. And we want to be able to help them on the ground early … whether they start here in Europe or in the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>Related to this, Sequoia will share carry — the fund&#8217;s profits — with partners across the U.S. and Europe, regardless of where partners reside or where the deal was sourced.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that I love the most about Sequoia having been here close to nine years now is the way that we operate is very, very team centric, and that everybody is compensated the same amount in a fund, whether or not it is the investment that they lead or the investment that their partner led,&#8221; said Miller. &#8220;So when we make an investment, we lock arms together as a team, and we work collectively to help that company be successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miller said portfolio companies in Europe also get to work with Sequoia&#8217;s operational supporting partners in the U.S., too. &#8220;And the economic model is one that supports that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>3. Sequoia will continue building out a team on the ground in Europe<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This holiday season the next generation of gamers, bless their hearts, will be hoping to receive the next generation of gaming consoles. But confusing branding by the console makers — not to mention a major shortage of consoles — could lead to disappointment during the unwrapping process. Before making any big promises this year, you&#8217;ll want to be completely clear on two things: which console you&#8217;re actually trying to get, and how much of a challenge it might be to get one.</p>
<p>By the way, it&#8217;s totally understandable if you&#8217;re a little lost — particularly on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> end, the branding is a little weird this time around. Even the lifelong gamers on our staff have mixed up the various Xbox names a few times.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not 100% sure which <em>brand</em> of console your kid (or partner or whoever) has, go take a look right now. An Xbox will have a big X somewhere on a side without cables coming out of it, and a PS4 will have a subtler &#8220;PS&#8221; symbol embossed on it. The &#8220;Pro&#8221; has three &#8220;layers&#8221; and the regular one has two.</p>
<p>Okay, now that you know what you&#8217;ve got, here are the new versions that they want:</p>
<h2>Sony PlayStation 5</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ps5-not-ps4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2066497" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ps5-not-ps4.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="347" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ps5-not-ps4.jpg 1312w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ps5-not-ps4.jpg?resize=150,51 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ps5-not-ps4.jpg?resize=300,102 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ps5-not-ps4.jpg?resize=768,260 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ps5-not-ps4.jpg?resize=680,231 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ps5-not-ps4.jpg?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/">PlayStation 5</a>, or PS5 for short, is the newest gaming console from Sony. It&#8217;s the one your kids want if they already have a PlayStation 4 or even a PlayStation 4 <em>Pro</em>, which they might have gotten a year or two back.</p>
<p>The PS5 is more powerful than the PS4, but it also plays most PS4 games, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about a game you just bought for a birthday or whatever. It has some fancy new features for fancy new TVs, but you don&#8217;t need to worry about that — the improved performance is the main draw.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Review: Sony&#8217;s PlayStation 5 is here, but next-generation gaming is still on its way&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/review-sonys-playstation-5-is-here-but-next-generation-gaming-is-still-on-its-way/embed/#?secret=oS6tjNQXvl" data-secret="oS6tjNQXvl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There are two versions of the PS5, and the only real difference between them is that one has a disc drive for playing disc-based games; they both come with a controller and are about the same size. The one with the drive costs $500 and is the one you should choose if you&#8217;re not completely certain the recipient would prefer the driveless &#8220;Digital Edition.&#8221; Saving $100 up front is enticing, but consider that some titles for this generation will cost $70, so the capability to buy used games at half-price might pay for itself pretty quickly.</p>
<p>The PS5 doesn&#8217;t come with any &#8220;real&#8221; next-generation games, and the selection this season is going to be pretty slim. But your best bet for pretty much any gamer is Spider-Man: Miles Morales. I&#8217;ve played it and its predecessor — which Miles Morales comes with — and it&#8217;s going to be the one everyone wants right off the bat. (Its violence is pretty PG, like the movies.)</p>
<p>The PS4&#8217;s controllers sadly won&#8217;t work on PS5 games. But don&#8217;t worry about getting any extra ones or charging stands or whatnot right now, unless your gamer plays a lot of games with other people on the couch already.</p>
<h2>Microsoft Xbox Series X</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/xbox-series-x-not-one-x.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2066498" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/xbox-series-x-not-one-x.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="246" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/xbox-series-x-not-one-x.jpg 1436w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/xbox-series-x-not-one-x.jpg?resize=150,36 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/xbox-series-x-not-one-x.jpg?resize=300,72 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/xbox-series-x-not-one-x.jpg?resize=768,185 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/xbox-series-x-not-one-x.jpg?resize=680,163 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/xbox-series-x-not-one-x.jpg?resize=50,12 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X</a> is the latest gaming console from Microsoft, replacing the Xbox One X and One S. Yes, the practice of changing the middle word instead of the last initial is difficult to understand, and it will be the reason lots of kids unwrap last year&#8217;s new console instead of this year&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The Xbox Series X is more powerful than the Xbox One X, but should also play almost all the old games, so if you bought something recently, don&#8217;t worry that it won&#8217;t be compatible. There are lots of fancy-sounding new features, but you don&#8217;t need to worry about those or buy them separately — stuff like HDR and 4K all depend on your TV, but any TV from the last few years will look great.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="z7XBJxBOeS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/review-the-xbox-series-x-is-ahead-of-its-time/">Review: Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Series X is ahead of its time</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Review: Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Series X is ahead of its time&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/review-the-xbox-series-x-is-ahead-of-its-time/embed/#?secret=z7XBJxBOeS" data-secret="z7XBJxBOeS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There are two versions of the next Xbox, and they have significant differences. The $500 Xbox Series X is the &#8220;real&#8221; version, with a disc drive for old and used games, and all the power-ups Microsoft has advertised. This one is almost certainly the one any gamer will be expecting and hoping to get.</p>
<p>Like Sony, Microsoft has a version of the Xbox that has no disc drive: the $300 Xbox Series S. Confusingly, this is the same price, same color, and nearly the same name and type of console as last generation&#8217;s Xbox <em>One</em> S, so first of all be sure you&#8217;re not buying the One. The Xbox Series S is definitely &#8220;next-gen,&#8221; but has a bit less power than the Series X, and so will have a few compromises in addition to the lack of a drive. It&#8217;s not recommended you get this one unless you know what you&#8217;re doing or really need that $200 (understandable).</p>
<p>For a day-one game, there isn&#8217;t really a big must-have exclusive. Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Valhalla is probably a good bet, though, if bloody violence is okay. If not, honestly a gift certificate or subscription to the &#8220;Game Pass&#8221; service that provides free games is fine.</p>
<p>No need for extra controllers — the Xbox Series X supports the last-gen&#8217;s controllers. Genuine thanks to Microsoft for that one.</p>
<h2>Difficulty level: Holiday 2020</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2070480" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PS5-header.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2070480" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2070480" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PS5-header.jpg" alt="A PS5 and controller." width="1024" height="732" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PS5-header.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PS5-header.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PS5-header.jpg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PS5-header.jpg?resize=768,549 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PS5-header.jpg?resize=680,486 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PS5-header.jpg?resize=1536,1098 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PS5-header.jpg?resize=2048,1464 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PS5-header.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2070480" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldewey/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Now that you know which console to get (again … a PlayStation <em>5</em> or an Xbox <em>Series</em> X), I&#8217;ve got some bad news and some good news.</p>
<p>The<strong> bad</strong> news is they&#8217;re probably (read: definitely) going to be sold out. Microsoft and Sony are pumping these things out as fast as they can, but the truth is they really rushed this launch to make it in time for the holidays and won&#8217;t have enough to go around.</p>
<p>Resist the urge to buy the &#8220;next best&#8221; in last year&#8217;s model — the new ones are a major change and are replacements, not just upgrades, for the old ones. It would literally be better for a kid to receive a pre-order receipt for a new console than a brand new old one. And don&#8217;t go wild trying to find one on eBay or whatever — this is going to be a very scammy season and it&#8217;s better to avoid that scene entirely.</p>
<p>The pandemic also means you probably can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t want to wait in line all night to grab a unit in person. Getting a console will almost certainly involve spending a good amount of time on the websites of the major retailers … and a good bit of luck. Follow electronics and gaming shops on Twitter and bookmark the consoles&#8217; pages to check for availability regularly, but expect each shipment to be sold out within a minute or two and for the retailer&#8217;s website to crash every single time.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t buy them a Nintendo Switch, either, unless they&#8217;ve asked for one of course. The Switch is fantastic, but it&#8217;s completely different from the consoles above.</p>
<p>The <strong>good</strong> news is they won&#8217;t be missing out on much right now. Almost every game worth having for the next year will be available on the new and old consoles, and in some cases players may be able to start their game on one and continue it on the next. Good luck figuring out exactly which games will be enhanced, upgraded or otherwise carried between generations (it&#8217;s a patchwork mess), but any of the hot new games is a good bet.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Strong e-commerce sales are predicted to help lift overall holiday retail spending in the U.S., according to forecasts released today by the <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-expects-holiday-sales-will-grow-between-36-and-52-percent">National Retail Federation</a> (NRF) and <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/">eMarketer</a>. Both firms expect to see overall retail sales growth during November and December, though the market may be impacted by slowing brick-and-mortar sales.</p>
<p>Of the two, NRF had the more optimistic forecast. It estimates U.S. holiday sales during November and December will increase between 3.6% and 5.2% year-over-year, for a total between $755.3 billion and $766.7 billion. That&#8217;s compared with a 4% increase in 2019 to $729.1 billion, and an average of a 3.5% increase over the past five years.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077640" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077640" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2077640" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-1.54.18-PM-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="793" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-1.54.18-PM-1.jpg 1870w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-1.54.18-PM-1.jpg?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-1.54.18-PM-1.jpg?resize=300,232 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-1.54.18-PM-1.jpg?resize=768,595 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-1.54.18-PM-1.jpg?resize=680,527 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-1.54.18-PM-1.jpg?resize=1536,1189 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-1.54.18-PM-1.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077640" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NRF</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Growth will come from online and other non-store sales, which are included in the total, which will increase between 20% and 30% to reach between $202.5 billion and $218.4 billion. That&#8217;s up from $168.7 billion last year.</p>
<p>NRF&#8217;s takeaway is that consumers are willing to spend &#8212; perhaps because of the challenging year that 2020 has been, rather than despite it.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all they’ve been through, we think there’s going to be a psychological factor that they owe it to themselves and their families to have a better-than-normal holiday,&#8221; noted NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz. &#8220;There are risks to the economy if the virus continues to spread, but as long as consumers remain confident and upbeat, they will spend for the holiday season,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The firm also noted Americans may have reduced their spending in other categories, like personal services, travel and entertainment due to the pandemic, which could increase the money they have for retail spending.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/emarketer" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="emarketer">eMarketer, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> on the other hand, paints a less rosy picture when it comes to overall sales.</p>
<p>The firm predicts that total holiday season retail sales will see the lowest growth rate at just 0.9% year-over-year. This growth will come from the e-commerce sector, which will see its highest growth rate &#8212; 35.8% &#8212; since the firm began tracking retail sales in 2008. Brick-and-mortar sales, on the other hand, will decline 4.7%.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2077604" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-4.png" alt="" width="1000" height="900" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-4.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-4.png?resize=150,135 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-4.png?resize=300,270 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-4.png?resize=768,691 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-4.png?resize=680,612 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-4.png?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The discrepancy between these two firms&#8217; estimates have to do with how they calculate &#8220;retail sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>eMarketer&#8217;s estimates include auto and gasoline sales, but exclude restaurants, travel, and event sales. NRF&#8217;s figures, on the other hand, exclude auto, gasoline and restaurants.</p>
<p>However, both agree on an e-commerce surge. NRF notes online sales were already up 36.7% year-over-year in the third quarter &#8212; in part, due to early holiday shopping. This year, some <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/earlier-start-holiday-shopping-season-embraced-consumers">42% of consumers had started shopping earlier</a> than usual, it recently found. Plus, retail sales were up 10.6% in October 2020 versus October 2019, in aggregate, its forecast noted.</p>
<p>But whether it&#8217;s 20% to 30% growth or 35.8%, depending on the firm, it&#8217;s clear e-commerce is saving the day here.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2077602" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-6.png" alt="" width="1000" height="900" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-6.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-6.png?resize=150,135 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-6.png?resize=300,270 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-6.png?resize=768,691 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-6.png?resize=680,612 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-6.png?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>NRF also expects seasonal hiring to be in line with recent years, as retailers hire between 475,000 and 575,000 seasonal workers compared with 562,000 in 2019. Some of that hiring may have already taken place in October, due to early shopping, it said.</p>
<p>Though <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/black-friday" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="black-friday">Black Friday <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> may not see the same levels of in-person shopping as in years past, brick-and-mortar retailers have made it easier to shop digitally, then either have items shipped home, picked up in-store, or even curbside. Outside of Amazon, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/walmart-wmt-q3-2021-earnings-.html">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/target-tgt-q3-2020-earnings.html">Target</a> have particularly benefited from investments in e-commerce, as both retailers easily beat Wall St. expectations in their latest earnings reports, released just ahead of the holiday quarter.</p>
<p>Online, however, Cyber Monday will continue to rule, however, eMarketer says.</p>

<p>Of the five big online shopping days in 2020, eMarketer says Cyber Monday will again beat out Black Friday in terms of overall e-commerce sales, at $12.89 billion compared with Black Friday&#8217;s $10.20 billion. But Thanksgiving Day will see the most year-over-year growth in e-commerce sales, at 49.5%, followed by Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, Cyber Sunday and Cyber Monday.</p>

<p>In a mobile forecast, <a href="https://content-new.appannie.com/en/insights/mobile-minute/black-friday-cyber-monday-2020-mobile-shopping/">analytics firm App Annie predicted</a> Americans would spend over 110 million hours in shopping apps on Android devices during the two-week period consisting of Black Friday and Cyber Monday weeks. It noted the pandemic had already accelerated mobile device usage to 4 hours, 20 minutes per day, and Americans spent over 61 million hours shopping during the week of Prime Day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;The Queen&#8217;s Gambit&#8221; is setting viewership records at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/netflix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="netflix">Netflix, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the streaming service said today.</p>
<p>Like all the viewership data that Netflix has released this year, these new numbers reflect <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/netflix-q4-earnings-3/">how many people &#8220;chose to watch&#8221;</a> — in other words, how many people watched at least two minutes of a given show or movie. In the case of &#8220;The Queen&#8217;s Gambit,&#8221; the number is 62 million households for the first 28 days of release, making it Netflix&#8217;s most popular scripted limited series ever.</p>
<p>You may have noticed some qualifiers there. &#8220;The Queen&#8217;s Gambit&#8221; beat out other limited series, like co-creator Scott Frank&#8217;s previous show &#8220;Godless,&#8221; but not Netflix&#8217;s biggest ongoing hits, such as &#8220;The Witcher&#8221; (76 million households watching season one). It also fell just a bit short of the limited-but-unscripted documentary series &#8220;Tiger King,&#8221; which reached <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/netflix-tiger-king-64-million/">64 million households</a> during its first four weeks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The numbers are still pretty impressive for a series with what seems like a decidedly uncommercial premise — following a troubled young woman as she rises through the ranks of competitive chess, eventually challenging the Soviet Union&#8217;s world champion. But the series has benefited from excellent reviews (<a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_queens_gambit">100% on Rotten Tomatoes</a>) and the fact that it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/08/original-content-podcast-the-queens-gambit-is-the-historical-chess-drama-we-need-right-now/">very, very good</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, its impact can be seen outside Netflix&#8217;s viewing numbers. The 37-year-old Walter Tevis novel on which it&#8217;s based has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/trade-fiction-paperback/">a New York Times bestseller</a>, while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/arts/television/chess-set-board-sales.html">sales of chess sets have increased dramatically</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three years ago when Scott Frank … first approached us about adapting &#8216;The Queen’s Gambit&#8217; — Walter Tevis’ 1983 book about a young chess prodigy — we felt it was a compelling tale,&#8221; Netflix&#8217;s vice president for original series Peter Friedlander wrote <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/the-queens-gambit-Netflix-most-watched-scripted-limited-series">in a blog post</a>. &#8220;Beth is an underdog who faces addiction, loss and abandonment. Her success — against the odds — speaks to the importance of perseverance, family, and finding, and staying true to yourself.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Milana Lewis, CEO and co-founder of music tech startup <a href="https://stem.is/">Stem</a>, started the fundraising process long before she actually asked any investors for money (dig the well before you’re thirsty — it’s the best way). She recommends that other founders do the same.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, Milana started working at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/united-talent-agency" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="united-talent-agency">United Talent Agency <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (UTA), one of the world’s leading talent agencies. When tasked with finding the best tools and technologies that UTA’s clients could use to self-distribute their work, she discovered a glaring gap.</p>
<p>“There were all these tools built for the distribution of content, monetization of content and audience development,” she says. “The last piece missing was the financial aspect.” The entertainment industry desperately needed a platform that would help artists manage the financial side of their business — and that’s how the idea for Stem was born.</p>
<p>Because UTA had its own investment branch, called <a href="https://www.unitedtalent.com/ventures/">UTA Ventures</a>, Milana’s job also introduced her to some brilliant investors. Years later, when it was time to fundraise for Stem, those connections played a pretty big role.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-2586856/ep-172-how-i-raised-it-with-milana-lewis-of-stemis">episode of How I Raised It</a>, Milana shared how Stem has landed some superstar investors and raised a little under $22 million.</p>
<h2>1. Bring investors along for the ride — from the very start</h2>
<p>Milana’s involvement with UTA Ventures exposed her to the investor experience and put her in the same room as people like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/gary-vaynerchuk" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="gary-vaynerchuk">Gary Vaynerchuk, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Jonathon Triest from Ludlow Ventures, Anthony Saleh from Wndrco and Scooter Braun.</p>
<p>After meeting them the first time, she made sure to nurture those relationships, and she was “honest and vulnerable” about the fact that she wanted to be an entrepreneur one day.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing how much people will help and support you along in that journey,” Milana says. Investors “get excited about making early-stage investments because they want to identify that person before anyone else does.”</p>
<p>As her idea for Stem came together, she shared that with them, too. Over the course of a year, she provided regular updates on her vision, like how she was building out her team, and she also called them for occasional advice.</p>
<p>By the time she approached some of them for funding, she didn’t even need to present a full pitch. By then, they already knew enough about Stem, and about Milana as a businesswoman. Her pitch meeting with Gary Vaynerchuk — the first person to invest — ended up being just 15 minutes long.</p>
<p>“I brought people on my entrepreneurial journey in the beginning,” Milana says. “The biggest piece of advice I could give is to start raising a year before you start raising. Start building relationships and data points.”</p>

<h2>2. Become best friends with systems and deadlines</h2>
<p>For each round, Milana put together a lead list — a list of potential investors who she either met socially or through business. Each time, she wanted to have at least 100 names on this list.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/J442-ti-Dhg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is set to launch its sixteenth Starlink mission on Monday at 9:34 p.m. EST (6:34 p.m. PST). This launch will carry 60 of the company&#8217;s broadband internet satellites to low-Earth orbit, where they&#8217;ll join the existing constellation and contribute to its growing network of eventually global coverage. The launch is also significant because it will potentially set a new record for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/falcon-19ff" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="falcon-19ff">Falcon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> 9 rocket reusability — this marks the seventh flight for the first stage booster flying tonight.</p>
<p>The booster <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is using for this mission previously flew in August, June and January of this year, as well as May 2019, January 2019 and also September 2018. And that&#8217;s not the only way that this is SpaceX&#8217;s most reusable flight ever — the fairing covering the payload of satellites on top of the rocket includes one half that flew on one mission previously, and another half that supported not one, but two prior missions before being recovered and refurbished.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;ll also be furthering SpaceX&#8217;s mission with Starlink, which is ultimately to provide fast, low-latency and relatively low-cost broadband internet access to hard-to-reach areas around the world. SpaceX has launched nearly 900 satellites for Starlink to date, and began operating its &#8220;Better Than Nothing&#8221; early beta in parts of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/canada-c0c7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="canada-c0c7">Canada <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> last week, in addition to the areas in the U.S. where it&#8217;s offering this early access service.</p>
<p>The launch livestream will begin above at around 15 minutes prior to liftoff, or at around 9:19 p.m. EST (6:19 p.m. PST).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The space industry, once dominated by government-funded programs and a small handful of corporations, has seen a surge in startups in recent years. And with startups aplenty, the venture firms can never be far behind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has been refused permission to dismiss 11 people at its EMEA headquarters in Amsterdam by the Dutch Employee Insurance Agency (UWV), the ride hailing company has confirmed.</p>
<p>The affected individuals did not take up an earlier severance offer as part of wider Uber layoffs earlier this year.</p>
<p>Uber announced major global layoffs of around 15% of its workforce in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/uber-is-laying-off-3700-as-rides-plummet-due-to-covid-19/">May</a> &#8212; which included around 200 staff based in Amsterdam &#8212; blaming the cuts on changes to demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Late last week, Dutch newspaper <a href="https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/11/20/uwv-uber-mag-werknemers-niet-ontslaan-a4020835">NRC</a> reported that Uber had been refused permission to fire the staff as the UWV had found there were no grounds for dismissal.</p>
<p>Per its report, affected Uber employees had faced pressure to accept Uber&#8217;s severance offer &#8212; saying they were disconnected from its internal systems the day after being informed of termination via Zoom video call and were then sent daily reminders to accept dismissal with Uber telling them &#8216;their position was ceasing to exist&#8217;.</p>
<p>Dutch law requires employers to obtain approval from the UWV for planned redundancies. But the majority of the affected staff in this instance accepted its severance offer before the agency had made a decision. <a href="https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/11/20/uwv-uber-mag-werknemers-niet-ontslaan-a4020835">Local press reports</a> suggest many of those affected were expats &#8212; who may have been unaware of their labor rights under Dutch law.</p>
<p>We reached out to Uber with questions &#8212; and a company spokesperson sent us this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Earlier this year we made the difficult decision to reduce our global headcount due to the dramatic impact of the pandemic, and the unpredictable nature of any eventual recovery. The headcount reductions in our EMEA Headquarters in Amsterdam are part of those efforts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Uber also told us it does not agree with the UWV&#8217;s decision to refuse permission for it to dismiss the 11 employees who had not accepted severance, adding that it will review the decision before determining how to proceed.</p>
<p>It said the severance packages offered to the ~200 affected employees included at least 2.5 months of salary, health benefits to the end of the year, outplacement/recruitment support and additional support for Uber-sponsored visa holders.</p>

This funding was led by Tiger Global Management, and included participation by a host of new investors, including Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Baillie Gifford, Iconiq Capital, General Catalyst and more. This brings the company&#8217;s total raised so far to nearly $700 million, as the startup is poised to launch its first-ever fully 3D-printed orbital rocket next year.</p>
<p>LA-based Relativity had a big 2020, completing work on a new 120,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Long Beach. Its rocket construction technology, which is grounded in its development and use of the largest metal 3D printers in existence, suffered relatively few setbacks due to COVID-19-related shutdowns and work stoppages as it involves relatively few actual people on the factory floor managing the 3D printing process, which is handled in large part by autonomous robotic systems and software developed by the company.</p>
<p>Relativity also locked in a first official contract from the U.S. government this year, to launch a new experimental cryogenic fluid management system on behalf of client <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lockheed-martin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lockheed-martin">Lockheed Martin, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as part of NASA&#8217;s suite of Tipping Point contracts to fund the development of new technologies for space exploration. It also put into service its third-generation Stargate 3D metal printers &#8212; the largest on Earth, as mentioned.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Relativity Space is raising a massive $500M round at $2.3B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/relativity-space-is-raising-a-massive-500m-round-at-2-3b-valuation/embed/#?secret=NzK4vHQSpU" data-secret="NzK4vHQSpU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s ambitions are big, so this new large funding round should provide it with fuel to grow even more aggressively in 2021. It&#8217;s got new planned initiatives underway, both terrestrial and space-related, but CEO and founder <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/tim-ellis-3" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="tim-ellis-3">Tim Ellis <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> specifically referred to Mars and sustainable operations on the red planet as one possible application of Relativity&#8217;s tech down the road.</p>
<p>In prior conversations, Ellis has alluded to the potential for Relativity&#8217;s printers when applied to other large-scale metal manufacturing &#8212; noting that the cost curve as it stands makes most sense for rocketry, but could apply to other industries easily as the technology matures. Whether on Mars or on Earth, large-scale 3D printing definitely has a promising future, and it looks like Relativity is well-positioned to take advantage.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be talking to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/">Ellis at our forthcoming TC Sessions: Space event</a>, so we&#8217;ll ask him more about this round and his company&#8217;s aspirations, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The EPA just released its findings on the Mustang Mach-E, and it&#8217;s a mixture of good news and bad news. Depending on the model, the EPA says the Mach-E is good for just 211 miles to 300 miles on a charge. On the one hand, the Mach-E matched Ford&#8217;s range target, with the EPA agreeing with Ford&#8217;s range. On the other hand, the range is well under that found in competing vehicles, which puts the Mach-E on its backfoot as it enters the competitive electric vehicle market. Ford <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/ford-drops-the-price-of-its-all-electric-mustang-mach-e-to-stay-fully-competitive-2/">dropped the price of the Mach-E</a> in September.</p>
<p>The Mach-E will come in two powertrain variants: standard-range and extended-range, with both options available in a dual-motor, AWD setup. The extended-range option nets buyers an additional 60-70 miles of range, with this option delivering 270 miles for the AWD version and 300 for the RWD version. The standard range Mach-E comes in at 211 miles for AWD and 230 miles for RWD.</p>
<p>Those figures are nearly identical to what Ford targeted with the Mach-E, signaling the automaker&#8217;s improving engineering quality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With a max range of 300 miles on a two-wheel-drive model, the Mach-E range falls well short of the Tesla Model 3, available in 400 mile-range variants for similar prices as the Mustang Mach-E. Tesla&#8217;s more comparable Model Y also has a superior range to the Mustang Mach-E. Tesla&#8217;s crossover has a max range of 326 miles with the dual-motor AWD version compared to Mach-E&#8217;s 270 miles for a similar configuration.</p>
<p>The Mustang Mach-E is Ford&#8217;s first major electric vehicle. Customers will start taking delivery of pre-orders this December. The vehicle is launching in a space that&#8217;s increasingly becoming more competitive. Along with Tesla, the Mustang Mach-E must sell against the fantastic Polestar 2, Audi&#8217;s growing line of electric vehicles, and Kia/Hyundai&#8217;s affordable electric crossovers. Some have longer range, and others are less expensive than Ford&#8217;s first EV.</p>
<p>The Mustang Mach-E is just the start of Ford&#8217;s electric offering, and the automaker likely understood the range would fall short of the market leaders. The goal is seemingly to kick off Ford&#8217;s EV stable with an exciting, affordable vehicle, and the Mach-E seems to fit that role despite the short range.</p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s note: This article previously listed the Polestar 2 as having a ranging similar to the Model 3. That&#8217;s incorrect and has been fixed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A spate of startups focused on mental health recently made enough noise as a group that they caught the eye of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a> podcast crew. Sadly, the segment we&#8217;d planned to discuss this topic was swept away by a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/21/how-the-pandemic-drove-the-ipo-wave-we-see-today/">blizzard of IPO filings</a> that piled up like fresh snow.</p>
<p>But in preparation, I reached out to <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/">CB Insights</a> for new data on the mental health startup space that they were kind enough to supply. So this morning we&#8217;re going to dig into it.</p>
<p>Regular readers of The Exchange will recall that we last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/funding-for-mental-health-focused-startups-rises-in-2020/">dug into overall wellness venture capital investment in August</a>, noting that it was mental health startups inside the vertical that were seeing the most impressive results.</p>

<hr />
<p>I wanted to know what had happened even more recently.</p>
<p>After all, Spring Health recently <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spring-health-raises-76-million-in-series-b-financing-301176026.html">raised $76 million</a> for its service that helps companies offer their workers mental health benefits, <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/mantra-health-tackles-college-mental-healthcare-closed-loop-virtual-care">Mantra Health disclosed</a> that it has raised $3.2 million to help with college-age mental health issues and Joon Care announced $3.5 million in new capital to &#8220;grow its remote therapy service for teens and young adults,&#8221; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/joon-raises-3-5m/">per GeekWire</a>.</p>
<p>Sticking to theme, Headway just raised $32 million to build a platform that &#8220;helps people search for and engage therapists who accept insurance for payments,&#8221; according <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/headway-raises-26m-to-help-people-find-therapists-and-therapists-to-accept-insurance/">to our own reporting</a>, and online therapy provider <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/talkspace-said-to-work-with-advisers-on-possible-sale?sref=gni836kR">Talkspace is pursuing a sale</a> &#8212; it looks like an active time in the mental health startup realm.</p>

<h2>The state of mental health venture investing</h2>
<p>To prepare the ground, let&#8217;s talk about the general state of healthcare investing in the venture capital world. Per <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cb-insights" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cb-insights">CB Insights&#8217; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/healthcare-trends-q3-2020/">Q3 healthcare VC report</a>, venture capital deal volume and venture capital dollar volume reached new record highs in the sector during Q3 2020.</p>
<p>The quarter&#8217;s 1,539 rounds and $21.8 billion in invested capital were each comfortably ahead of prior records set in Q2 2018 for round volume (1,431) and Q2 2020 for dollar volume ($18.4 billion) for healthcare startups.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://superpeer.com">Superpeer</a>, a startup that helps experts share and monetize their knowledge online, is announcing that it has raised $8 million in additional funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/superpeer/">As I wrote in March</a>, the Superpeer platform allows experts to promote, schedule and charge for one-on-one video calls with anyone who might want to ask for their advice.</p>
<p>In addition to announcing funding, the startup is also moving beyond one-on-one sessions by launching paid channels, where experts can charge a subscription fee for access to larger group sessions with video and chat. Co-founder and CEO Devrim Yasar suggested that channels allow <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/superpeer" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="superpeer">Superpeer <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> experts to be more accessible, reaching a larger audience by hosting sessions that cost less money to watch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It can be hard to say, &#8216;Hi, I&#8217;m Anthony Ha, if you want to talk to me, my hourly rate is $500,&#8217; &#8221; Yasar said. (To be clear: I would never say that.) &#8220;But if you have a channel where anyone can subscribe for $1 or $5, that makes you feel better that you are accessible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Plus, you can still offer (and charge more for) one-on-one meetings, say for subscribers who still have &#8220;burning questions&#8221; after a channel session.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the midst of the pandemic, we&#8217;re seeing a widespread embrace of online mentoring and content as a new source of revenue. Last week, for example, Squarespace </span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/squarespace-member-areas/">launched a new paywall feature called Member Areas</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, and I&#8217;ve also written about </span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/prox/">another video mentoring platform called Prox</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></p>
<p>Yasar acknowledged that things are getting pretty competitive, but he said that Superpeer is trying to build the most attractive brand for public intellectuals and thought leaders — he described the vision (half-jokingly, half-proudly) as &#8220;OnlyFans for brains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are an intellectual, if you have an audience, if you are a TED speaker with 30 million views on your video, you&#8217;ve never had a platform to really monetize that audience,&#8221; Yasar said. &#8220;All you could do is maybe write a book and sell that, you could be a guest at someone else&#8217;s event [but not much else]. Those people don&#8217;t want to go to YouTube or Instagram, that&#8217;s not the brand that they associate themselves with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond branding, Yasar said that Superpeer has also worked hard on the technology side to create a lightweight video experience in the browser.</p>
<p>The new round comes from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/acrew-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="acrew-capital">Acrew Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Audacious Ventures, Homebrew, Moxxie Ventures, Brianne Kimmel, Scott Belsky and OnDeck, and it brings Superpeer&#8217;s total funding to $10 million.</p>
<p>Yasar said the startup will be expanding its growth, partnership and revenue teams. It also will be offering financial support for experts through a brand ambassador program, though the company is still working out the details.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;d like to see the platform in action, I&#8217;ll also be <a href="https://superpeer.com/nihal/event/eniac-extras-1">talking to Yasar and his investors</a> at Eniac Ventures tomorrow in a free session at noon Eastern.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gatik-ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gatik-ai">Gatik, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the autonomous vehicle startup focused on the &#8220;middle mile,&#8221; is already using its self-driving box trucks to deliver customer online grocery orders for Walmart. Now, the company — freshly stocked with $25 million in Series A funding — is expanding up into Canada with a partnership with retail giant Loblaw.</p>
<p>Gatik said Monday that five autonomous box trucks in Toronto will be used to deliver goods for Loblaw starting in January 2021. The fleet will be used seven days a week on five routes along public roads. All vehicles will have a safety driver as a co-pilot. This deployment, which follows a 10-month pilot in the Toronto area, marks the first autonomous delivery fleet in Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;As more Canadians turn to online grocery shopping, we&#8217;ve looked at ways to make our supply chain more efficient. Middle-mile autonomous delivery is a great example,&#8221; Loblaw Digital senior vice president Lauren Steinberg said in a statement. &#8220;With this initial rollout in Toronto, we are able to move goods from our automated picking facility multiple times a day to keep pace with PC Express online grocery orders in stores around the city.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike other autonomous delivery companies, Gatik isn&#8217;t targeting consumers. Instead, the startup is using its autonomous trucks to shuttle groceries and other goods from large distribution centers to retail locations. For Loblaw, the company will equip Ford Transit 350 box trucks with refrigeration units, lift gates and its autonomous self-driving software.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Gatik adds autonomous box trucks to its &#8216;middle mile&#8217; game plan&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/gatik-adds-autonomous-box-trucks-to-its-middle-mile-game-plan/embed/#?secret=vXFrJPm7Wl" data-secret="vXFrJPm7Wl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Retailers know the biggest inefficiencies in their logistics operations often exist in the middle-mile, typically between automated picking facilities and retail locations,&#8221; Gatik CEO and co-founder Gautam Narang said in a statement. &#8220;This is where Gatik lives and succeeds, and is the reason we&#8217;re able to offer immediate value to our customers. We are delighted to partner with Loblaw in addressing this critical piece of their supply chain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gatik&#8217;s &#8220;middle mile&#8221; B2B focus has attracted customers like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/walmart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="walmart">Walmart, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as well as investors, including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wittington-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wittington-ventures">Wittington Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/innovation-endeavors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="innovation-endeavors">Innovation Endeavors, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which co-led the company&#8217;s Series A round. FM Capital and Intact Ventures, along with existing investors Dynamo Ventures, Fontinalis Partners and AngelPad also participated in the round that was announced alongside the Loblaw partnership. Gatik has raised $29.5 million to date.</p>
<p>The company said it plans to use the funding to build out operations across North America and hire more employees at its Palo Alto, California and Toronto facilities. Narang said Gatik is also pushing to expand its retail partnerships and fleet deployments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Throughout the year we saw an increase of 30% to 35% in orders from our customer base, and we expect this trend to continue,&#8221; Narang said. &#8220;We will continue to bring autonomous delivery into the mainstream, driving substantial efficiencies in supply chain logistics for retailers across North America and beyond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gatik said it has completed more than 30,000 revenue-generating autonomous orders for multiple customers across North America.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today is introducing a new feature that will allow users in the U.S. to collect food, clothing and other necessities for people in need. The feature, called &#8220;Drives,&#8221; is being made available through Facebook&#8217;s existing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/community_help/?page_source=fb_marketing_covid_mar_campaign">Community Help hub</a>, which is the place where Facebook centralizes requests and offers for help within a local community.</p>
<p>The Community Help hub was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/08/community-help/">launched</a><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2017/02/empowering-people-to-help-one-another-within-safety-check/"> in 2017</a> as a way for Facebook users to centralize their resources in the wake of a crisis, like a man-made, accidental or natural disaster, ranging from weather events to terrorist attacks, and more. In 2020, however, the feature has been put to broader use as a part of Facebook&#8217;s COVID-19 efforts, which even saw a version of Community Help feature scaled globally to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/facebook-launches-a-global-version-of-its-community-help-feature-in-response-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/">help those impacted</a> by the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Now, with the economic crisis created by the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., millions are out of work and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/12-million-americans-set-to-lose-unemployment-benefits-by-years-end.html">12 million may lose</a> their unemployment benefits in December when CARES Act provisions lapse. <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/reports-on-impact-of-the-pandemic-on-women-at-home-and-in-business/">Food insecurity</a> and an inability to pay bills, including rent and mortgage payments, as well as manage other household expenses, are <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/tracking-the-covid-19-recessions-effects-on-food-housing-and">impacting millions as well</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Drives, Facebook will allow users to create and share their own efforts in collecting items for those in need, like a Canned Food Drive that&#8217;s looking to gather items for local shelters, a Clothing Drive, or any other event where someone is working to collect items to help others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077481" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077481" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2077481" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png 2516w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077481" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>To create a Drive, type &#8220;Community Help&#8221; into Facebook Search to find the shortcut that takes you to the Community Help hub. From there, click the &#8220;Request or Offer Help&#8221; button, and on the bottom sheet that appears, click &#8220;Create Drive.&#8221; You can then fill out the form, setting a goal for the number of items you want to collect. When you post the Drive, others will be able to see what&#8217;s still needed with this goal tracker. Once created, the Drive will appear in your News Feed and Timeline like a regular post, in addition to appearing in Community Help.</p>
<p>The feature is rolling out starting today, but Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/give-back-during-holidays-season-of-giving/">blog post originally said</a> the feature may not be widely available to all for &#8220;weeks.&#8221; That would be unfortunate, given that many people likely want to run holiday-related Drives within the hub to help get food for holiday meals or toys for families in need, for example. (After publication of our article, Facebook updated the blog post to say &#8220;coming days&#8221; and emailed TechCrunch to say it will expedite the feature to ensure it arrives in time for the holidays.)</p>
<p>Facebook notes that all posts in Community Help, including Drives, are reviewed to ensure they don&#8217;t violate Facebook’s Community Standards or its Community Help Product Policies. These policies prohibit insensitive and promotional content, spam, inauthentic posts and posts from users under 18, among other things. If posts are found to be in violation, they&#8217;re taken down, the company says.</p>
<p>Drives is one of several efforts around holiday giving that Facebook announced today. The company also says it will match up to $7 million in eligible donations to U.S. nonprofits on Giving Tuesday (December 1), and is running its own fundraiser, &#8220;Peace Through Music: A Global Event For Social Justice&#8221; exclusively on Facebook Live. The event, on December 1 at 12 PM ET, will feature Aloe Blacc, Billie Eilish, Becky G, Carlos Santana &amp; Cindy Blackman Santana, Killer Mike, Ringo Starr, Skip Marley, and others. The event will support the <a href="https://playingforchange.org/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://playingforchange.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606231545346000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2wZvOQGoakivLWUlLtUhi6">Playing for Change Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UNFPA/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/UNFPA/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606231545346000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ea_TYppokXkdcQU92LCvF">United Nations Population Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sankofadotorg/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/sankofadotorg/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606231545347000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1VeD1g03_7Wi_xLMKZ0viq">Sankofa</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/silkroadproject/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/silkroadproject/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606231545347000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0x1T3zf1Lq8vURW5e1YapH">Silkroad</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rockandrollhalloffame" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/rockandrollhalloffame&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606231545347000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ybrgwEVlyT0s1tFHHsH0E">The Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will soon gain new fundraising tools. Today, Instagram users can fundraise with stickers on Stories and on Instagram Live. A new feature will allow Instagram users to post fundraisers to their Instagram Feed, too, but Facebook didn&#8217;t offer a time frame as to when that feature would launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An <a href="https://neweconomics.org/uploads/files/NEF_DATA-INADEQUACY.pdf">analysis</a> of the total cost to UK businesses if the country fails to gain an adequacy agreement from the European Commission once it leaves the bloc at the end of the year &#8212; creating barriers to inbound data flows from the EU &#8212; suggests the price in pure compliance terms could be between £1BN and £1.6BN.</p>
<p>The assessment of the economic impacts if the UK is deemed a third country under EU data rules has been carried out by the <a href="https://neweconomics.org">New Economics Foundation</a> (NEF) think tank and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/european-institute/">UCL&#8217;s European Institute</a> research hub &#8212; with the researchers  conducting interviews with over 60 legal professionals, data protection officers, business representatives, and academics, from the UK and EU.</p>
<p>They are estimating that the average compliance cost for an affected micro business will be £3,000; or £10,000 for a small business; £19,555 for a medium business; and £162,790 for a large business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This extra cost stems from the additional compliance obligations – such as setting up standard contractual clauses (SCCs) – on companies that want to continue transferring data from the EU to the UK,&#8221; they write in the report. &#8220;We believe our modelling is a relatively conservative estimate as it is underpinned by moderate assumptions about the firm-level cost and number of companies affected.&#8221;</p>
<p>An adequacy agreement refers to a status that can be conferred on a country outside the European Economic Area (as the UK will be once the Brexit transition is over) &#8212; if the EU&#8217;s executive deems the levels of data protection in the country are essentially equivalent to what&#8217;s provided by European law.</p>
<p>The UK has said it wants to gain an adequacy agreement with the EU as it works on implementing the 2016 referendum vote to leave the bloc. But there are doubts over its chances of obtaining the coveted status &#8212; not least because of surveillance powers enshrined in UK law since the 2013 Snowden disclosures (which revealed the extent of Western governments&#8217; snooping on digital data flows).</p>
<p>Broad powers that sanction UK state agencies&#8217; digital surveillance have faced a number of legal challenges under UK and EU law.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yvqOzFF99z"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/27/uk-mass-surveillance-regime-dealt-another-blow-in-court/">UK surveillance regime dealt another blow in court</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK surveillance regime dealt another blow in court&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/27/uk-mass-surveillance-regime-dealt-another-blow-in-court/embed/#?secret=yvqOzFF99z" data-secret="yvqOzFF99z" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The government has also signalled an intention to &#8216;liberalize&#8217; domestic data laws as it leaves the EU &#8212; writing in a national data strategy published in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/uk-wants-pandemic-levels-of-data-sharing-to-be-the-new-normal/">September</a> that it wants to ensure data is not &#8220;inappropriately constrained&#8221; by regulations &#8220;so that it can be used to its full potential”.</p>
<p>But any moves to denude the UK&#8217;s data protection standards risk an &#8216;inadequate&#8217; finding by the Commission.</p>
<p>Europe&#8217;s top court, meanwhile, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits/">set a clear line</a> that governments cannot use national security to bypass general principles of EU law, such as proportionality and respect for privacy.</p>
<p>Another major &#8212; and highly pertinent &#8212; ruling by the CJEU this summer invalidated an adequacy status the Commission had previously conferred on the US, striking down the EU-US Privacy Shield transatlantic data transfer mechanism. It does not bode well for the UK&#8217;s chances of adequacy.</p>
<p>The court also made it clear that the most used alternative for international transfers (a legal tool called Standard Contractual Clauses, aka SCCs) must face proactive scrutiny from EU regulators when data is flowing to third countries where citizens&#8217; information could be at risk.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9m9Fv5VLqd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Europe&#8217;s top court strikes down flagship EU-US data transfer mechanism</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s top court strikes down flagship EU-US data transfer mechanism&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/embed/#?secret=9m9Fv5VLqd" data-secret="9m9Fv5VLqd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The thousands of companies that had been relying on Privacy Shield to rubberstamp their EU to US data flows are now scrambling for alternatives on a case by case basis &#8212; with vastly inflated legal risk, complexity and administration requirements.</p>
<p>The same may be true in very short order for scores of UK-based data controllers that want to continue being able to receive inbound data flows from users in the EU after the end of the Brexit transition.</p>
<p>Earlier this month the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) put out 38 pages of guidance for those trying to navigate new legal uncertainty around SCCs &#8212; in which it warned there may be situations where no supplementary measures will suffice to ensure adequate protection for a specific transfer.</p>
<p>The solution in such a case might require relocation of the data processing to a site within the EU, the EDPB said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Although the UK has high standards of data protection via the Data Protection Act 2018, which enacted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in UK law, an EU adequacy decision is not guaranteed,&#8221; the NEF/UCL report warns. &#8220;Potential EU concerns with UK national security, surveillance and human rights frameworks, as well as a future trade deal with the US, render adequacy uncertain. Furthermore, EUUK data flows are at the whim of the wider Brexit process and negotiations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Per their analysis, if the UK does not get an adequacy decision it will face an increased risk of GDPR fines due to increased compliance requirements.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/20/wtf-is-gdpr/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> sanctions financial penalties for violations of the framework that can scale up to 4% of an entity&#8217;s global annual turnover or €20M, whichever is greater.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The report also predicts a reduction in EU-UK trade, especially digital trade; reduced investment (both domestic and international); and the relocation of business functions, infrastructure, and personnel outside the UK.</span></p>
<p>The researchers argue that more research is needed to support a wider macroeconomic assessment of the value of data flows and adequacy decisions &#8212; saying there&#8217;s a paucity of research on &#8220;the value of data flows and adequacy decisions in general&#8221; &#8212; before adding: <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;EU-UK data flows are a crucial enabler for thousands of businesses. These flows underpin core business operations and activities which add significant value. This is not just a digital tech sector issue – the whole economy relies on data flows.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The report makes a number of recommendations &#8212; including urging the UK government to make &#8220;relevant data and modelling tools&#8221; available to support empirical research on the social and economic impacts of data protection, digital trade, and the value of data flows to help shape better public policy and debate.</p>
<p>It also calls for the government to set aside funds for struggling UK SMEs to help them with the costs of complying with Brexit&#8217;s legal data burden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our report concludes that no adequacy decision has the potential to be a contributing factor which undermines the competitiveness of key UK services and digital technology sectors, which have performed extremely strongly in recent years. Although we do not want to exaggerate the impacts &#8212; and no adequacy decision is far from economic armageddon &#8212; this outcome would not be ideal,&#8221; they add.</p>

<p>TC Sessions is definitely worth your time, especially if you’re an early-stage founder. You get to connect to people in your field and learn from founders who are literally a year into your same journey. Plus, you can meet and talk to the movers and shakers — the people who are making it happen. — Jens Lehmann, technical lead and product manager, SAP</p>
<p>“TC Sessions offers several big benefits. First, networking opportunities that result in concrete partnerships. Second, the chance to learn the latest trends and how technology will evolve. Third, the opportunity for unknown startups to connect with other companies and build brand awareness.” — Karin Maake, senior director of communications at FlashParking</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://avepoint.com/">AvePoint</a>, a company that gives enterprises using Microsoft Office 365, SharePoint and Teams a control layer on top of these tools, announced today that it would be going public via a SPAC merger with <a href="https://apexacquisitioncorp.com/">Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation</a> in a deal that values AvePoint at around $2 billion.</p>
<p>The acquisition brings together some powerful technology executives, with Apex run by former <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oracle" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oracle">Oracle <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CFO Jeff Epstein and former <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/goldman-sachs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="goldman-sachs">Goldman Sachs <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> head of technology investment banking Brad Koenig, who will now be working closely with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/avepoint" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="avepoint">AvePoint&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Tianyi Jiang. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777921/000121390019018376/f424b4091719_apextech.htm">Apex filed for a $305 million SPAC</a> in September 2019.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the transaction, Apex’s balance of $352 million plus a $140 million additional private investment will be handed over to AvePoint. Once transaction fees and other considerations are paid for, AvePoint is expected to have $252 million on its balance sheet. Existing AvePoint shareholders will own approximately 72% of the combined entity, with the balance held by the Apex SPAC and the private investment owners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jiang sees this as a way to keep growing the company. &#8220;Going public now gives us the ability to meet this demand and scale up faster across product innovation, channel marketing, international markets and customer success initiatives,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way.</p>

<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/avepoint-grabs-200m-series-c-for-microsoft-cloud-governance-tools/">raised $200 million in January</a> this year led by Sixth Street Partners (formerly TPG Sixth Street Partners), with additional participation from prior investor Goldman Sachs, meaning that Koenig was probably familiar with the company based on his previous role.</p>
<p>The company has raised a total of $294 million in capital before today’s announcement. It expects to generate almost $150 million in revenue by the end of this year, with ARR growing at over 30%. It&#8217;s worth noting that the company&#8217;s ARR and revenue has been growing steadily since Q12019. The company is projecting significant growth for the next two years with revenue estimates of $257 million and ARR of $220 million by the end of 2022.</p>

<p>The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. Upon close the company will continue to be known as AvePoint and be publicly traded on Nasdaq under the new ticker symbol AVPT.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.curehydration.com/">Cure Hydration</a> is announcing that it has raised $2.6 million in seed funding as it brings a healthier approach to the sports beverage market.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/lauren-picasso" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="lauren-picasso">Lauren Picasso, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> whose past roles include serving as director of marketing at Jet.com, told me that she became interested in the market after training for a triathlon; she&#8217;d often feel dehydrated even after drinking lots of water. (This is something I also struggled with while training for a marathon last year — yes, I&#8217;m only mentioning this because I really want you to know that I ran a marathon.)</p>
<p>The obvious solution was to drink Gatorade or something similar to replenish her electrolytes, but Picasso said, &#8220;When I started looking for electrolyte products that were healthy and effective, I realized everything on the market still uses a base of sugar.&#8221; For example, 20 ounces of Gatorade&#8217;s Thirst Quencher contains <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/is-gatorade-bad-for-you#cons-of-gatorade">36 grams of sugar</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So Picasso and the Cure team developed a new beverage <a href="https://www.curehydration.com/pages/why-cure">based on the World Health Organization&#8217;s Oral Rehydration Solution</a>, which Picasso said is &#8220;primarily used to help people suffering from diseases like cholera,&#8221; and which has saved &#8220;millions of lives and is proven to hydrate as effectively as an IV drip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cure uses the ORS as a foundation to create a range of flavored beverages (it&#8217;s adding the new flavors Ruby Riot Grapefruit and Laser Focus Matcha). The core ingredients include coconut water and pink Himalayan salt, while everything is organic and vegan, with no added sugars.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077457" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077457" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2077457" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Cure Hydration" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077457" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cure-hydration" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cure-hydration">Cure Hydration</p></div></p> <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>
<p>The startup sells these drinks in the form of powders that you mix with water. On its website, they cost $20.99 for a pack of 14, or $16.79 if you subscribe. (The company donates 1% of proceeds to the women&#8217;s sports nonprofit <a href="https://www.sheissport.com">SheIS</a>.) Picasso said early customers have tended to be amateur athletes and people who need help staying hydrated due to chronic illnesses and other health conditions.</p>
<p>The product is also available in stores like CVS, Walmart and Whole Foods. Picasso said that one of her goals with the funding is to continue expanding Cure&#8217;s retail footprint beyond its current 4,200 locations across the United States.</p>
<p>She also plans to develop new products beyond hydration, though she said they will stay true to the company&#8217;s &#8220;guiding principles&#8221; that all its products are &#8220;backed by science&#8221; and &#8220;taste delicious.&#8221; The company has a medical advisory board that includes Dr. Roshini Rajapaksa, a gastroenterologist; Dr. Dana Cohen, the author of &#8220;Quench&#8221;; and nutritionist Brooke Alpert, author of &#8220;The Sugar Detox.&#8221;</p>
<p>The round was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lerer-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lerer-ventures">Lerer Hippeau, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from M3 Ventures, Litani Ventures, Andy Roddick, Nas, Matthew Dellavedova, Casper CEO Philip Krim, mParticle CEO Michael Katz, Thrive Market CEO Nick Green and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, more than ever, consumers are prioritizing health in their daily lives and looking for products that are not only effective, but better-for-you,&#8221; said Lerer Hippeau principal Caitlin Strandberg in a statement. &#8220;Lauren is an exceptional operator and we&#8217;ve been impressed with her ability to bring a WHO-approved formulation to market without compromising on product quality or efficacy. With this cash infusion and retail expansion, we&#8217;re excited to see Cure get into even more hands.&#8221;</p>
