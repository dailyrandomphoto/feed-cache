		<div class="contributor-byline__bio">
		Mark Sullivan was a federal law enforcement agent for nearly 35 years and the director of the U.S. Secret Service from 2006 to 2013.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Cybercriminals are getting more and more adept at exploiting the latest trend or issue of high public interest to spread malware and steal personal data from unsuspecting users.</p>
<p>Whether it’s an app related to your favorite TV show, government health updates about COVID or tracking missed package deliveries, the result is too often the same: infected devices leading to fraud or outright theft.</p>
<p>Basic cybersecurity hygiene is the key to protecting your devices against the most common types of malware, but we also need security built into technology to prevent these sophisticated cyberattacks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245654" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Secret Service is certainly best known for protecting the president. But its other primary mission is to safeguard the nation’s financial infrastructure and payment systems to preserve the integrity of the economy from a wide range of financial and electronic crimes, including U.S. counterfeit currency, bank and financial institution fraud, illicit financing operations, identity theft, access device fraud and cybercrimes.</p>
<p>With the prevalence of mobile devices in today’s world, that means that, as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recommends, “users should avoid — and enterprises should prohibit on their devices — sideloading of apps and the use of unauthorized app stores.”</p>
<p>The pandemic has been a boon to cybercriminals, taking “advantage of an opportunity to profit from our dependence on technology to go on an<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> internet crime spree</a>,” said Paul Abbate, deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p>The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center registered<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-the-internet-crime-complaint-center-2020-internet-crime-report-including-covid-19-scam-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 791,790 complaints in 2020</a>, nearly double the previous year’s total and the largest year-over-year increase ever recorded. One particularly insidious example was text messages that encouraged users to download an app to make vaccine appointments but then sent malware to every device in that user&#8217;s contacts that could steal personal data or banking information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this year, the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) alerted the public to a new form of malware that induced a user to click on a link to track a supposedly missed package delivery, a common occurrence during the pandemic. The link downloaded a malware app, called FluBot, which could then compromise a user’s bank and other financial account details. Cybersecurity researchers discovered “the volume of malicious [FluBot] SMS messages can number in the<a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/flubot-android-malware-spreading-rapidly-through-europe-may-hit-us-soon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> tens of thousands per hour</a>.” Hackers are even capitalizing on the popularity of the hit television show “Squid Game” with a<a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/beware-the-squid-game-app-installing-malware-onto-peoples-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> new wave of cybercrimes</a> targeting mobile devices using malware hidden in apps related to the show.</p>
<p>Mobile devices are now the primary access point for the internet, with <a href="https://www.perficient.com/insights/research-hub/mobile-vs-desktop-usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61% of all website visits</a> in the United States in 2020 coming on mobile devices, cementing the trend that only became the majority in 2019. This is reflected in the increased targeting of mobile devices with cyberattacks, with complaints of phishing and smishing attacks &#8212; emails or SMS text messages with malicious links &#8212; to the FBI<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> more than doubling in 2020</a>, rising from 114,702 in 2019 to 241,342 last year.</p>
<p>As we enter the holiday shopping season, during which one survey indicates that <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/ecommerce/2021/11/mobile-commerce-holiday-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 55% of shoppers</a> will make at least one purchase with a mobile device, it is essential that device owners take precautions to protect themselves from attacks.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/avoiding-banking-malware">NCSC recommends</a> that users follow basic protections, like frequently backing up their devices, using virus detection software and only installing “new apps onto your device from the app store your manufacturer recommends.” That guidance mirrors that from the DHS, which also included recommendations that operating systems, apps and other software should be updated regularly and that users and enterprises adopt multifactor authentication.</p>
<p>Simple cyber hygiene recommendations form a layered defense against attacks, dramatically reducing the threat of unauthorized access to mobile devices. Yet as critical and effective as these user actions are, cybercriminals utilize sophisticated techniques that exploit human psychology and behaviors to deceive users and penetrate devices.</p>
<p>These kinds of attacks, called social engineering attacks, utilize human interactions and social skills to trick users into allowing attackers access to their devices or systems, sometimes even getting users to disable optional security protections. Attacks like FluBot, fake vaccination sites and malicious “Squid Game” apps are all examples of social engineering.</p>
<p>According to DHS’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, mobile device owners may be more vulnerable to social engineering attacks through text messages because mobile devices’ “integration of email, voice, text messages and web browser functionality<a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> increases the likelihood</a> that users will fall victim to engineered malicious activity.”</p>
<p>The White House’s Cybersecurity Summit earlier this year identified ways beyond cyber hygiene to protect against unauthorized access: “We need to transition to where technology is built securely by default. … We need to know we’re buying secure tech,” a senior White House official <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/08/25/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-the-presidents-upcoming-cybersecurity-meeting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>.</p>
<p>Secure-by-design mobile devices would build cyber hygiene protections into the device, removing human psychology from the security equation. Just as seat belts and air bags started as options for car buyers, they are now mandatory safety equipment in all cars.</p>
<p>Basic cyber hygiene protections like multifactor authentication or prohibitions on downloading apps from outside official app stores can be built into systems by design. Mobile devices with these kinds of protections baked in from the start would not be nearly as vulnerable to social engineering attacks even if the device owner was, like most people, interested in a hit television show or worried about a pandemic.</p>
<p>The public should follow the basic cyber hygiene recommendations of our cybersecurity agencies. But we also need to short-circuit sophisticated social engineering attacks and build high-security protections into the design of our technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spain&#8217;s government has agreed on the details of a draft startup law &#8212; passing the baton to the parliament to debate and potentially amend the plan ahead of a vote to turn it into actual law.</p>
<p>The Council of Ministers <a href="https://portal.mineco.gob.es/en-us/comunicacion/Pages/211210_agenda.aspx">announced</a> adoption of the draft text today which it said contains important measures to cut red tape and remove bureaucratic obstacles for founding and investing in startups in Spain.</p>
<p>The package also targets reforms at stock options and access to visas in a bid to make the country a more attractive place for entrepreneurs and digital talent.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245970" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://portal.mineco.gob.es/en-us/comunicacion/Pages/211210_agenda.aspx">press release</a>, Spain&#8217;s government said the package of incentives includes what it touted as &#8220;the EU’s most beneficial treatment of returns on stock options&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ministers have agreed to raise the tax exemption on stock option income from €12,000 to €50,000 per year.</p>
<p>The draft also stipulates that taxation is delayed until the date of settlement &#8212; either when the stocks are sold or if the company goes public.</p>
<p>Other notable tax measures include a reduction in Corporate Tax and Non-Resident Income Tax (which drops from 25% to 15%) for four years &#8212; which aims to tackle a major barrier given startups typically aren&#8217;t focused on booking revenue in their early years (yet, under the current rules, are expected to pay the same rate of tax as more established businesses).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The maximum deductible amount for investments in new or recently created companies is also raised (from €60,000 to €100,000 per year), while the deduction rate goes from 30% to 50% and the period for considering a company ‘recently created’ is extended, per the draft adopted by ministers.</p>
<p>The reform also looks set to tackle another key complaint of local founders: The cost and bureaucracy of setting up a startup in Spain &#8212; which has led some founders to establish their business elsewhere in Europe even if they subsequently build their product out of offices in the country.</p>
<p>Under the draft law, ministers say the procedures for setting up a company will be &#8220;streamlined&#8221; into a single step and can be completed online without needing to pay a notary or registry expenses.</p>
<p>Startups will also be able to use an online portal to make business declarations and access benefits, per the release.</p>
<p>Olivier Plante, co-founder of a local keyboard startup, ThingThing &#8212; which develops <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/fleksy-raises-series-a-to-expand-its-keyboard-sdk-biz-after-10x-growth/">Fleksy</a> (a keyboard SDK business) out of offices in Spain &#8212; said he felt forced to incorporate his startup in the UK back in 2015 &#8212; because of relative costs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were like three years not making a dime,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;First months we needed a lot of money to get started, registry, stocks, banks, notary (they are parasites tbh)&#8230;etc. That&#8217;s why we founded the company in the UK &#8212; it costs us 70 GBP instead of ~5k EUR in Spain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plante welcomed the reform package &#8212; saying that for him the two most important components are simplifying set-up for startups and the reduction in corporate tax rates in the early years.</p>
<p>The current approach is essentially &#8220;killing entrepreneurial spirit from day 1&#8221;, per Plante, or else limiting the pool of possible founders to those who are in a position to save enough money to get going. &#8220;Often, the real entrepreneurs have less means,&#8221; he noted, adding: &#8220;And Spain doesn&#8217;t enable the poor to become rich at the source.&#8221;</p>
<p>A local startup association, <a href="https://asociacionstartups.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>startups asociación españa</em></a>, also welcomed the adoption of the draft text by the Council of Ministers &#8212; although it said it&#8217;s still waiting to see all the detail of the full text once that&#8217;s published.</p>
<p>It also said it&#8217;s hoping the parliament will go even further in improving the proposal &#8212; suggesting it should further increase the number of years for a business to be deemed a startup; and &#8212; potentially (assuming the draft has not done so) &#8212; make changes to limiting requirements (such as a startup needing to have 60% of staff in Spain to qualify; or revenue of (only) up to €5M).</p>
<p>The association was most fulsome in its praise of the planned boost to tax deduction for startup investors &#8212; dubbing that &#8220;excellent news that puts us on an equal footing with others successful ecosystems&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reform package contains a number of other measures to incentivize entrepreneurialism &#8212; such as entrepreneurs who are simultaneously working as employees at another job no longer being required to contribute twice to the Social Security system (which disincentives bootstrapping); and plans for establishing sandboxes or trial licences in regulated sectors to foster the development of novel services and MVPs.</p>
<p>Although it remains to be seen how the parliament may amend specific details.</p>
<p>In terms of timeframe, a government source told TechCrunch it believes the law will be approved in the first half of 2022 &#8212; however they noted that the deadline allows until the end of the year.</p>
<p>On the funding front, Spain&#8217;s government has an investment target of up to €4BN to direct toward fostering startup growth &#8212; including drawing on European Union coronavirus recovery funding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/saudi-human-rights-activist-represented-eff-sues-spyware-maker-darkmatter-violating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a lawsuit</a> against spyware maker DarkMatter, along with three former members of U.S. intelligence or military agencies, for allegedly hacking the iPhone of a prominent Saudi human rights activist.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Loujain al-Hathloul, who claims she was among the victims of an illegal hacking campaign orchestrated by DarkMatter and three former U.S. intelligence officers hired by the UAE following the Arab Spring protests.</p>
<p>The former NSA operatives — named in the lawsuit as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/expressvpn/">ExpressVPN</a> CIO Daniel Gerike, Marc Baier and Ryan Adams — were part of the Project Raven hacking program, an effort by the UAE to spy on human rights activists, politicians, journalists and dissidents opposed to the government during the Arab Spring protests.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245948" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Back in September, the three former spies agreed to pay a cumulative $1.7 million after admitting to violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and prohibitions on selling sensitive military technology under a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Justice Department. </span>They are also permanently banned from any jobs involving computer network exploitation, working for certain UAE organizations, exporting defense articles or providing defense services.</p>
<p>Al-Hathloul — best known for her efforts in calling for greater women&#8217;s rights in Saudi Arabia — claims the ex-spies exploited a vulnerability in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/imessage/">iMessage</a> to illegally hack into her iPhone in order to secretly monitor her communications and location. This, she claims, led to her “arbitrary arrest by the UAE’s security services and rendition to Saudi Arabia, where she was detained, imprisoned and tortured.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/alhathloul-v-darkmatter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit</a> alleges Gerike, Baier and Adams purchased malicious code from a U.S. company and intentionally directed the code to Apple servers in the U.S. to reach and place malicious software on al-Hathloul’s iPhone in violation the CFAA. It also alleges that they aided and abetted in crimes against humanity due to the fact the hacking of al-Hathloul’s phone was part of the UAE’s widespread and systematic attack against human rights defenders and activists.</p>
<p>The EFF, which filed the lawsuit alongside law firms Foley Hoag LLP and Boise Matthews LLP, says this is a “clear-cut” case of device hacking, whereby “DarkMatter operatives broke into al-Hathloul’s iPhone without her knowledge to insert malware, with horrific consequences.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Project Raven went beyond even the behaviour that we have seen from <a href="https://www.itpro.co.uk/security/spyware/361529/nso-group-ceo-quits-us-sanctions-pegasus-spyware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSO Group</a>, which has been caught repeatedly having sold software to authoritarian governments who use their tools to spy on journalists, activists and dissidents,&#8221; said Eva Galperin, cybersecurity director at EFF. &#8220;DarkMatter didn&#8217;t merely provide the tools; they oversaw the surveillance program themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, al-Hathloul said:</p>
<blockquote><p>No government or individual should tolerate the misuse of spy malware to deter human rights or endanger the voice of the human conscious. This is why I have chosen to stand up for our collective right to remain safe online and limit government-backed cyber abuses of power.</p>
<p>I continue to realize my privilege to possibly act upon my beliefs. I hope this case inspires others to confront all sorts of cybercrimes while creating a safer space for all of us to grow, share and learn from one another without the threat of power abuses.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This morning, employees were notified via email by the Better board of directors that Garg would be taking time off effective immediately after the “very regrettable events over the last week.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move came, according to an employee who wished not to be named, after the digital mortgage company hired a crisis firm earlier this week. For those of us following the drama over the past week &#8212; over the past year, really &#8212; it was not a surprise.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245988" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More details around the executive’s behavior have emerged, including in emails that surfaced this week in which Garg <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkpgkm/bettercom-ceo-called-top-investor-sewage-said-making-company-money-would-earn-employees-freedom?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=vice_facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR29-4py26TZPqQoPhq59VxO2wnYtsCvr584dnzNjdN04ndklDgq0j0Tmzs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">berated his own investors, </a>Vice reported. He already had a reputation for using abusive language in emails to employees, but the treatment toward his investors was yet another shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the email to employees sent this morning, the board said that during the interim period, CFO Kevin Ryan would be assuming the responsibilities of CEO. It also acknowledged that it had engaged “an independent 3rd party firm to do a leadership and cultural assessment,” the results of which would be “taken into account to build a long-term sustainable and positive culture at Better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the decision may be too little, too late. TechCrunch has spoken with multiple current and former employees who remain skeptical that a toxic culture can be reversed that quickly. Those same employees shared that the CEO&#8217;s so-called &#8220;apology&#8221; &#8212; which came after the resignations of the company&#8217;s heads of PR, marketing and communications &#8212; was widely viewed as insincere damage control.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One employee said she had been thinking of resigning even before the recent events, but they finally pushed her over the edge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garg &#8220;leads by fear,” she said, preferring not to be named. “Nothing is ever good enough. He would threaten employees to work harder, faster and not be lazy, but there was never clarity on what the consequences might be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pressure seemingly intensified over the past few months as the company took a hit when the number of refinancings declined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It wasn’t a shock that the market had turned on us,” the employee said. “But the model’s predictions were that it wouldn’t happen this quickly. There just seemed to be more underlying anxiety after the SoftBank investment over the summer and with the SPAC approaching. But they could have been more transparent and just admit they overhired people last year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company laid off 9% of its staff last week, one day after receiving a $750 million cash infusion as part of an amended SPAC agreement. While it was not the first (or likely the last) company to lay off workers via Zoom in this pandemic era, the way it was handled seemed to offend even casual observers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another sign of panic was that the company, after declaring itself remote-first, was suddenly asking people to return in-person. This was confusing to many, including those who had already moved and bought houses in other cities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In mid-November, </span><a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/better-com-forecasts-another-rough-quarter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HousingWire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported on preliminary results published by Better’s SPAC partner, Aurora Acquisition Corp., revealing that the digital lender expected a net loss between $85 million and $100 million in the third quarter. And the forecast looked even worse for the fourth quarter, according to an </span><a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-326251/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S-4 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</span></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to HousingWire: “The filing noted that the fluctuations in interest rates – which affect refis more than purchase business – and a recent reorganization of Better’s sales and operations teams has put pressure on the company’s net income and will continue to do so for the foreseeable next quarter, as the company attempts to find footing in a purchase market.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is after a year in which Garg received a $25 million cash bonus: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2020, after previously requesting an equity-based award, our CEO was paid a one-time discretionary bonus of $25.0 million as determined by the Board based on his 2020 performance,&#8221; the S4 filing said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, one former employee said her colleagues that stayed on were being asked to take pay cuts and not receiving bonuses. She added that during the pandemic, despite being remote, customer-facing employees were forced to clock in breaks at exactly 15 minutes and 30 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we went over by even one minute, we&#8217;d be talked down to by managers,” she told TechCrunch. “Some team members even had talkings-to by senior managers on this matter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same employee also scoffed at the notion that Better lived up to its image of being a fintech where opportunities to grow were plentiful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Better advertised itself as a powerful fintech startup where all who wanted to grow within the ecosystem, could. This was untrue,” she said. “There were virtually no opportunities for growth, raise, department collaboration, etc. Managers were sales machines and regardless of career paths, there was no room to succeed. … At Better, we were essentially taught to push customers/callers for rate locks, regardless of their intention.”</span></p>
<p>Better did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.nuvocargo.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvocargo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a logistics startup out to help simplify the challenges of cross-border trade,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised $20.5 million in a round led by Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round valued the New York-based startup at $180 million, more than double the $70 million it was valued at when it raised $12 million in April.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it still had most of that cash in the bank when Tiger approached it.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245821" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We didn’t need the capital, but Tiger showed real conviction and moved fast with their term sheet,” said Nuvocargo co- founder and CEO Deepak Chhugani.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup claims to pair its technology with a “team of experts” to integrate end-to-end movement of cargo in “a single platform.” Specifically, it offers an all-in-one service that rolls freight forwarding, customs brokerage, cargo insurance and even trade financing into one UI-friendly software and app. The company claims it gives </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">its customers more visibility and better data to understand their supply chain.</span></p>
<div class="section-header-wrapper ng-star-inserted">
<div class="section-title-wrapper"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Let’s dig a bit deeper into this. Importers and exporters that need to move products between the United States and Mexico typically have to work with a number of different vendors to help with different pieces of that process.</span></div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A truckload from Mexico to the U.S. will have to hire a trucking company in Mexico. To find that company, you might have to go through a broker. Then when the truck gets to the border, you have to deal with all this paperwork to actually get an export out of Mexico imported into the U.S.,” Chhugani explained. “You also have to then hire another company to help you move the trailer from Mexico to the U.S.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s called a transfer carrier for the unacquainted. Then on top of that, the vendor has to go through the same process in the U.S. to find a trucking company to get the product to its final destination.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Midsize companies either have to form logistics departments in-house to deal with all the complexities, different currencies, laws and vendors, or, they hire brokers and freight forwarders to help with pieces of the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With our flagship offering, we go to companies and say, ‘we can take care of that entire experience for you,’” Chhugani said. “We have the infrastructure, the transportation network, the compliance and the software to help you move those products end to end. It’s kind of a one-stop shop. In that way, we become an extension of our customers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Nuvocargo mainly focuses on the transportation aspect of moving the goods. Down the line, it’s rolling out a series of other products and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already, the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has revealed the first of a series of financial products it is building &#8212; QuickPay for carriers, which is essentially a cash advance product for the truckers in Nuvocargo’s marketplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been in a small private beta for a couple of months and the adoption has been extremely exciting,” Chhugani said. “QuickPay for carriers has been growing processing volumes by 35% weekly and recently crossed seven figures in annualized transaction volume in just a few short weeks since launch.”</span></p>
<p>With an estimated 10 million trucks moving <span class="il">cargo</span> between Mexico and the United States each year, <span class="il">Nuvocargo</span> estimates the market for QuickPay at around $20 billion annually.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supply chain issues have dominated headlines for some time now, and what Nuvocargo is building has great potential to improve efficiencies along the trade corridor between the U.S. and Latin America, according to Tiger’s John Curtius.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2245833" style="width: 1588px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245833" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2245833 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-11.58.44-AM.jpg" alt="" width="1578" height="1362" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-11.58.44-AM.jpg 1578w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-11.58.44-AM.jpg?resize=150,129 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-11.58.44-AM.jpg?resize=300,259 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-11.58.44-AM.jpg?resize=768,663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-11.58.44-AM.jpg?resize=680,587 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-11.58.44-AM.jpg?resize=1536,1326 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-11.58.44-AM.jpg?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1578px) 100vw, 1578px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245833" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nuvocargo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it began operations in late 2019, Nuvocargo has been growing its revenues by about 30% month over month. While he declined to reveal hard revenue figures, Chhugani expects Nuvocargo will generate “tens of millions of dollars” in annual revenue in 2022. It’s also on track to close this year with 5x revenue growth compared to 2020. The company has tripled its team since announcing its Series A in April, from 30 to about 90.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also participating in the latest round of funding is The Flexport Fund, Kavak COO Federico Ranero and existing backers such as QED Investors, NFX and ALLVP. Prior Nuvocargo investors include Y Combinator, Nubank founder David Velez and the co-founders of several unicorns, including Deel, Rappi, Ramp and Loft, among others. The additional funding brings Nuvocargo’s total raised to date to $37.8 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The U.S.-Mexico cross-border trade is poised for growth in the coming years with Mexico&#8217;s growing manufacturing sector,” said Hursh Narain, partner at The Flexport Fund. &#8220;Deepak is an incredible founder that understands the current state and has vision for a digital future state.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvocargo fits the fund&#8217;s thesis that customers in global logistics are better served hiring digitally native service providers than they are trying to layer software on top of the old, offline world, added Ben Braverman, chief customer officer at Flexport and partner at The Flexport Fund.</span></p>

<p>We got into the Lyft mafia, garbage, and why our local truckers are giving us creator economy vibes. Or more specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/kenyas-pariti-raises-2-85m-led-by-harlem-capital-to-develop-startup-ecosystems-in-emerging-markets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenya’s Pariti raised $2.85M led by Harlem Capital to develop startup ecosystems in emerging markets</span></a>, proving yet again how Africa&#8217;s entrepreneurial scene is one not to miss. The empowerment trend continued with TrueNorth&#8217;s <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/truenorth-has-raised-50-million-from-sam-altman-and-others-to-empower-independent-truckers/">$50 million fundraise to help biz-savvy independent truckers,</a> and freshly-anointed unicorn AgentSync with news, as Alex reminds us, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/agentsync-raises-75m-for-its-insurance-focused-api-business/">that insurtech is very much alive. </a></li>
<li>Opensea <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/long-time-lyft-cfo-departs-to-become-cfo-at-nft-marketplace-opensea/">got a new CFO from Lyft</a>, which led to IPO rumors, denial, and rumors about why there&#8217;s denial about going public. Plus, as Natasha notes, if you&#8217;re not leaving Lyft to join crypto, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/climactic-raj-kapoor-josh-felser/">you&#8217;re leaving Lyft to join climate. </a></li>
<li>The Trump Media SPAC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/the-sec-is-curious-about-trumps-spac-deal/">is a mess</a>, as we anticipated, frankly.</li>
<li>Mary Ann is all over the Better.com saga as its comm, marketing, PR heads all <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/better-coms-pr-comms-marketing-heads-submit-resignations-in-wake-of-layoffs-fiasco/">submitted their resignations</a> this week and CEO Vishal Garg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-apologizes-to-current-employees-for-blundering-the-execution-of-mass-layoffs/">issued a poorly-received apology</a> for how badly he effed up the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/">mass layoffs</a> <em>last</em> week &#8212; and as she hints, there&#8217;s a lot more to come.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[We need to grok how 2021 ended to understand where 2022 begins.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The 2021 IPO cycle is winding down this week as HashiCorp and Nubank priced their public debuts and listed. Happily for startup fans and the venture classes, both IPOs went well. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/iot-data-collector-samsaras-ipo-will-be-fun-to-watch/">Samsara&#8217;s IPO will come next week</a> if current calendars hold up, but that&#8217;s pretty much it for the year.</p>
<p>We made it to the end! But that doesn&#8217;t mean that we don&#8217;t have work to do. We do.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re parsing the final IPO prices of both HashiCorp and Nubank, tabulating their final pre-debut valuations and revenue multiples, and teasing out what we can learn from their early trading. The goal is to get a good handle on how strong the U.S. technology IPO market looks as 2021 ends.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2229732 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>There should be, provided no major shocks, an active 2022 IPO cycle. Our basis for that perspective is that technology valuations for public companies remain far above historical norms and the backlog of yet-private unicorns is at an all-time high. The combination reads like a recipe for a lot of flotations next year.</p>
<p>But we need to grok how 2021 ended to understand where 2022 begins.</p>
<h2>HashiCorp&#8217;s IPO</h2>
<p>HashiCorp anticipated that it would price its IPO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/hashicorps-ipo-will-place-it-among-the-most-richly-valued-open-source-tech-companies/">between $68 and $72 per share</a>. It wound up selling equity in its public debut <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/12/09/2348726/0/en/HashiCorp-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering.html">at $80 per share</a>, a massive win for the open source-focused software company.</p>
<p>Renaissance Capital <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/89098/Cloud-infrastructure-platform-HashiCorp-sets-terms-for-$1.1-billion-IPO">noted</a> that at $70 per share, HashiCorp was worth $14.2 billion. Simple math pegs the company&#8217;s fully diluted valuation with an $80 per-share price at $16.2 billion. Given that the company was last valued at around the $5 billion mark by private-market investors in early 2020, its IPO price was nothing short of revolutionary, though we might argue that it was simply underpriced in 2020, undercutting how staggering its IPO price really was.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Now with the new capital in hand, CEO Katie Spies plans to “put a foot on the gas” to push its 20% month over month growth to 25%.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As consumers think more about what they are putting in their bodies, they are also thinking about what they are feeding their pets. Driven by the global pandemic and everyone being at home with their pets, sales <a href="https://www.bioguardlabs.com/pandemic-era-pet-industry-surpasses-record-breaking-100-billion-in-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">topped $100 billion in 2020</a> in this sector.</p>
<p>Austin-based <a href="http://www.meetmaev.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maev</a>, developing human-grade raw dog food, is poised to take a share of the raw food category, announcing today it raised $9 million in a round of funding led by Springdale Ventures. The company previously raised undisclosed rounds backed by VMG Partners, Bolt and Willow Growth.</p>
<p>The idea for the direct-to-consumer pet care brand was sparked in 2018 by CEO Katie Spies and Christine Busaba. Prior to starting the company, Spies started her career as an engineer, stacking up three degrees. She worked at a startup as a product development manager, but ultimately left that behind to find a different calling. It was during that time that she became a dog walker and realized what was needed in the dog food space.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245820" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2245825" style="width: 688px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245825" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2245825" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Maev_Katie-Spies_2021_-6.jpg?w=678" alt="Maev, Katie Spies" width="678" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Maev_Katie-Spies_2021_-6.jpg 1662w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Maev_Katie-Spies_2021_-6.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Maev_Katie-Spies_2021_-6.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Maev_Katie-Spies_2021_-6.jpg?resize=768,771 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Maev_Katie-Spies_2021_-6.jpg?resize=678,680 678w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Maev_Katie-Spies_2021_-6.jpg?resize=1530,1536 1530w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Maev_Katie-Spies_2021_-6.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Maev_Katie-Spies_2021_-6.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Maev_Katie-Spies_2021_-6.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Maev_Katie-Spies_2021_-6.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Maev_Katie-Spies_2021_-6.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245825" class="wp-caption-text">Maev founder and CEO Katie Spies. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Maev </p></div></p>
<p>Though they officially started the company in 2019, Busaba and Spies didn’t launch their first product, the raw dog food, until 2020. The pandemic initially affected Maev’s ability to get started. The company had four employees and had to shift its launch plans and even push back its funding round, she said. It ended up working out, and today, it has added supplemental vitamin bars and bone broth topper to its product pipeline.</p>
<p>The food products were created alongside a team of veterinary nutritionists and clinically tested to address nutritional gaps for a healthier dog. The frozen food is made with real meats, vegetables and fruits and unlike competitor brands that have to be thawed, Maev’s products are ready-to-eat out of the freezer, Spies said.</p>
<p>“We started with three products, but we are building the future of pet care,” she added. “This grocery aisle had little innovation. There are some great products, but pet parents have accepted that healthier products mean being harder to use. We aim to make products easier and great for your dog.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maev sells its food as a subscription product, with costs averaging about $2 per meal. Over the past year, the company acquired about 2,000 customers and has 16 employees and 11 open jobs. During that time, the company has been growing both its revenue and customer bases, investing in supply chain and solidifying its innovation.</p>
<p>Now with the new capital in hand, Spies plans to “put a foot on the gas” to push its 20% month over month growth to 25%. In the next year, the company will be selling its products in an omnichannel capacity with a focus on customer retention. It is already seeing 92% of customers stick around after their first box, a statistic Spies explained is not seen frequently in other pet food brands, where the industry average is 60%.</p>
<p>She expects to invest the new capital in its headquarters move to Austin, brand awareness and hiring across marketing and supply chain. One of the company’s biggest customer requests is a chicken product, and plans are in the works to have one available in three months. Spies expects that addition to outsell its current beef product.</p>
<p>With 95 million dogs in the U.S. Spies notes the company has plenty of room to grow. There are 112 fresh pet food companies with new entrants shaking up the market over the past few years, she said. Maev is one of the latest to attract venture-backed funding, joining <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/alpha-paw-brings-in-5-2m-to-carve-out-its-niche-in-the-pet-wellness-space/">Alpha Paw</a> and <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2021/11/jinx-raises-28m-in-series-a-funding.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jinx</a> in announcing new raises in the past two months.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, pet food incumbents are also putting a paw print in the healthier food space: <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/freshpet-launches-fresh-vegetarian-dog-food-brand-spring--sprout-301368725.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freshpet launched its Spring &amp; Sprout vegetarian dog food</a> in September and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hills-pet-nutrition-partners-with-bond-pet-foods-inc-to-develop-a-craft-meat-protein-produced-through-precision-fermentation-301420943.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hill’s Pet Nutrition announced a partnership with Bond Pet Foods</a> last month to create meat proteins via fermentation for pet food applications.</p>
<p>“It’s been really interesting to watch the market evolve,” Spies said. “Today, it is great that more dog owners are educated on some of the problems with standard kibble and are skeptical about what they are feeding their dogs. However, when you boil down all of the decisions you make about your dog, this is the most important one for health and longevity.”</p>
<p>That attention to detail and care for pets is what attracted many of Maev’s investors to jump on board.</p>
<p>“We are highly particular and prescriptive in considering brands to bring into the VMG portfolio, making our investments sparse, yet strategic in those companies that have what it takes to become iconic brands,” said Carle Stenmark, partner at VMG Partners, in a written statement. “We were immediately drawn to Maev by its incredibly engaged and vocal customer base, as well as our alignment with Katie, who we believe is a world-class founder setting the standard for the next-generation of pet care.”</p>
<p>“Innovation in our space doesn’t just mean new products in different formats or packaging; instead, it’s looking at the consumer’s life and finding ways to exceed their expectations and enhance their daily routines, which includes their loved ones and furry friends,” added Dan Graham, co-founder and general partner of Springdale Ventures. “Outside of being a fantastic product at the leading edge of the better-for-you pet food movement, Katie’s passion and determination for changing the lives of pets and their owners is a journey on which we’re excited to be, especially as our first investment into the pet space, with more to come.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company launched its tool in March that help e-commerce stores and brands increase their revenue using pricing, products and trends data from other companies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fresh from its time in Y Combinator, SaaS startup <a href="https://www.anakin.company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anakin</a> raised $2 million to continue developing its software enabling e-commerce companies to see live pricing data on their competitors.</p>
<p>Mohit Prateek and Rashmi Bala started the company last September and officially launched in March to help e-commerce stores and brands increase their revenue using pricing, products and trends data from other companies. While the company’s moniker is indeed the name of a “Star Wars” character, CEO Prateek said they chose it more for name recognition than a passion for the movies.</p>
<p>Prior to starting the company, the co-founders were already working at the intersection of artificial intelligence and e-commerce at companies like Flipkart and Truefit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245790" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Prateek, in particular, just happened to be trying to solve the pricing problem at Flipkart with a large team optimizing SKUs across geographies and channels. He later left to build other startups, but continued to get inquiries from e-commerce companies for help with pricing. It was when the amount of calls increased that he asked Bala, with whom he was already working, if she wanted to build a business.</p>
<p>“We had customers even before we started building the company,” Prateek told TechCrunch. “We didn’t have a product to sell them, though, it was just me advising them on how to set it up.”</p>
<p>Here’s how the technology works: Company A prices an item, for example a tomato, and everyone else has to price their tomatoes similarly to entice buyers to buy it from them instead of Company A.</p>
<p>Rather than try to guess what the best price will be, Anakin automates the management and pricing of millions of SKUs from competitors using data like inventory to provide those insights in real time so that retailers can increase their revenue, on average, by up to 12%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Anakin started in the grocery space and has now expanded into food delivery, ridesharing and travel. Though he was not able to disclose customers, Prateek did say the company is working with some of the largest companies in those spaces.</p>
<p>In fact, prior to securing the seed round, the company was already profitable. It didn’t need to raise the round, but Anakin was running lean with just the two of them and wanted to grow fast in multiple sectors and geographies, he added.</p>
<p>The company, with a presence in San Francisco, Singapore and India, secured the new capital from Y Combinator, HOF Capital, Austen Allred, ACE &amp; Company, Integrity, Pioneer Fund and a group of angel investors.</p>
<p>So far, Anakin is growing its revenue 24% every month and is live in more than 10 countries, Prateek said. The funding will be used to hire additional employees to have more boots on the ground in other countries. The company will also invest in product development, expanding into other categories and creating a self-service tool.</p>
<p>“We started in the middle of COVID, and we were scared that it would shut us down, but even mom-and-pop stores are online and competing with Amazon,” he added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Employing a dark store model is “virtually non-existent in Canada,” according to the company.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Grocery delivery startup <a href="https://hello.gotiggy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiggy</a> is a new player in the Canadian quick commerce space, announcing Friday $6.35 million in seed funding to get its dark stores up-and-running to accommodate 15-minute deliveries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/7056/online-grocery-market-in-canada/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E-commerce sales are a $29 billion market in Canada</a>, but food delivery is still nascent. Eugene Bisovka and Razmik Sukyasov co-founded Vancouver-based Tiggy in July 2021, just about the time that <a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/instacart-begins-online-grocery-delivery-quebec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instacart announced it was beginning food delivery in Quebec</a>, giving the food delivery giant access to all 10 Canadian provinces now.</p>
<p>Many individual grocers offered their own delivery during the global pandemic, in addition to the delivery incumbents Instacart, PC Express, Inabuggy, DoorDash and Uber Eats. Tiggy is taking the approach of offering a faster delivery, with no minimum charge or no extra cost, which Bisovka told TechCrunch differentiates the company from its competitors that have longer delivery times and associated fees.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245780" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“What impressed me was that Canada has a $100 billion market and almost no food delivery players,” he added. “That was a big reason we chose this market. You can get groceries from DoorDash or Uber Eats, but it takes one hour for delivery and they charge fees, so it is not clear what the final price will be.”</p>
<p>Employing a dark store model is another differentiator, as the model is one that is “virtually non-existent in Canada,” Bisovka said. He explained that the dark store approach leads to hundreds of additional orders per day in the $25 to $30 range, with a projected contribution margin between 10% and 12%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company launched its service in September with over 1,400 SKUs, including pantry staples and fresh fruits and vegetables. It is also encouraging more consumer behavior toward on-demand shopping, for example, if you’re cooking and run out of an item or realize you don’t have it.</p>
<p>Heartland led the seed round and was joined by Global Founders Capital, FJ Labs and Redbox Ventures. With the new capital, Bisovka intends to double the amount of SKUs offered, expand Tiggy’s footprint in Vancouver with two new dark stores — it already has four stores — and enter Toronto with five stores by the end of the year. It also gives the company a solid runway to open 350 fulfillment centers across the country by 2024.</p>
<p>Though Bisovka declined to discuss growth metrics outside of having now employed 150 people in five months, Turner Novak, founder of Banana Capital, and one of the company’s early investors, said Tiggy was growing “at an impressive pace” and is already disrupting incumbents that have 1 million customers.</p>
<p>“It’s been impressive watching them over the past couple of months,” Novak added. “With the dark store model, there is more of an opportunity to stay capital efficient, though harder to launch your own fulfillment. If you can do it, you will have more longevity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.earnr.co.uk/">Earnr</a> is a new finance and tax service aimed at the UK creator economy and people doing ‘side-hustle’ businesses. It’s now secured £650,000 to launch an app aimed at ‘solopreneurs’. The round was led by <a href="https://7pc.co/">7percent Ventures</a>, and was joined by Antler and FJ Labs.</p>
<p>The startup deals with the financial and tax admin side of their new venture which works with private personal bank account. The app provides a hub of financial tools and services for these self-employed side-hustlers, providing digital bookkeeping and accountancy services, automates tax returns, and comes with access to expert help.</p>
<p>Anyone earning less than £3k from their side hustle can submit their tax return for free, and over that Earnr charges a flat £99 fee. </p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245951" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>CEO Enzo Ottens said: “Many of us in the Earnr team started our own side hustles during the UK’s many lockdowns and although doing this is getting easier than ever, finance and tax admin is always where complexity and the risk of expensive mistakes lurk… So we’ve built a service that does it all for you, and automatically with a minimum of hands-on input.” <br />
 <br />
Andrew J Scott, Founding Partner at 7percent Ventures, said: &#8220;We backed Enzo and the Earnr team because of their ambition to disrupt the half-trillion-dollar accounting sector globally using A.I. At 7percent we love startups which aim to fundamentally transform laggard industries and Earnr were aligned on the fastest way to do that, starting today with tax returns for side earners.” </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is facing the prospect of imminent extradition to the US after the UK High Court granted an appeal by the US government against an earlier (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/uk-judge-denies-us-request-to-extradite-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange/">January</a>) refusal by a UK judge to extradite him on mental health grounds.</p>
<p>A final decision on whether or not to grant the extradition will be made by the UK secretary of state.</p>
<p>The US wants to put Assange on trial for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/arrested-wikileaks-founder-is-now-facing-u-s-extradition/">conspiracy to hack and computer misuse</a>. He also faces a number of charges under the controversial <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/julian-assange-espionage-act/">Espionage Act</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245925" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In all he faces 18 counts connected with &#8220;obtaining and disclosing defence and national security material&#8221; through the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiLeaks website</a>, primarily in 2009 and 2010 but also &#8220;to some extent since&#8221;, per a court summary.</p>

<p>Defenders of the polarizing figure argue he&#8217;s being persecuted for telling truth to power and that his extradition would have a chilling effect on journalism &#8212; given the US government is pursuing charges that include publishing classified information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Assange obtained the information from former US army solider and whistleblower, Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning, who disclosed hundreds of thousands of classified or sensitive military and diplomatic documents that Assange then published via WikiLeaks &#8212; causing huge embarrassment for the US government.</p>
<p>The leaked material included army reports and videos of airstrikes, including instances of civilian deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with hundreds of thousands of US diplomatic cables.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/usa-v-julian-assange-2/">summary of the judgement</a> issued today, the UK High Court said it has accepted a package of assurances from the US government related to the previous district judge&#8217;s concerns that Assange is a suicide risk.</p>
<p>The Court said four assurances have been offered, adding that is &#8220;satisfied&#8221; the assurances exclude the possibility of Assange being subject to “special administrative measures” &#8212; or held at a maximum security prison in Florence, Colorado, USA (either pretrial or after any conviction) vis-a-vis the acts he is currently accused of committing.</p>
<p>The US has also agreed to consent to an application by Assange to be transferred to Australia to serve his sentence if he is convicted; and agreed that while he is in custody in the US he will receive &#8220;appropriate clinical and psychological treatment as recommended by a qualified treating clinician at the prison where he is held&#8221;, per the Court summary.</p>
<p>&#8220;The court rejected various criticisms of those assurances which were argued on Mr Assange’s behalf, and was satisfied that the assurances were sufficient to meet the concerns which led to the DJ’s decision,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>A final decision on whether to allow Assange&#8217;s extradition will pass to the UK&#8217;s home secretary, Priti Patel &#8212; failing a successful appeal of the High Court&#8217;s decision.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup that has built a decentralized exchange as well as a cross-chain infrastructure to facilitate communication across layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain solutions is the latest to receive backing from Coinbase Ventures.</p>
<p>Singapore-headquartered Router Protocol said on Friday it has raised $4.1 million in a strategic funding round from Coinbase Ventures, Alameda Research, Polygon, Woodstock, Wami Capital, QCP, De-Fi Capital, Maple Block, TeraSurge Capital, Wintermute, and Shima Capital as well as several entrepreneurs. The startup also raised $485,000 in its seed round last year.</p>
<p>We have seen a proliferation of layer 1 blockchain networks that are all attempting to solve similar problems in recent years. As these layer 1 projects gain traction, they are able to attract the developer community that builds layer 2 solutions atop of their preferred blockchain.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244704" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Blockchains are like cities and you can scale them endlessly, but unless you build the connectivity infra, nobody goes there,” said Ramani Ramachandran, founder and chief executive of Router Protocol, in an interview with TechCrunch. “So we have had all these blockchains coming up, but no connectivity between them. So that was the genesis of Router Protocol,” he said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.routerprotocol.com">Router Protocol</a>, founded last year, is betting that many of these layer 1 blockchain networks will continue to operate and many more will join the fray. Its offering allows developers to seamlessly move liquidity across chains seamlessly. “There are probably about 50 blockchains, with 50 different communities and their own energy,” he said.</p>
<p>“There are going to be layer 1 scaling solutions &#8212; the Polygons of the world &#8212; and ‘Ethereum killers’ such as Aave, Solana and then we have non-EVM players such as Terra and Algorand that are coming up from different perspectives. You marry that with profusion of capital in the space. All of these players have a large warchest. Nobody is talking about less than a $1 billion warchest. The battle is not going to end anytime soon.”</p>
<p>Router Protocol’s other offering is Dfyn, which is a decentralized exchange, like Uniswap or Pancake Swap, that is built on top of Polygon. “It’s like we have a bunch of airport terminals called Dfyn, and then we have airline routes that connect these Dyfn networks. But they also connect other airports. That’s the beauty of the whole model.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ramachandran said he expects cross-chain solutions to become more popular next year. &#8220;Let&#8217;s imagine you&#8217;re on Solana blockchain and you want to sell Ethereum, but you see much better prices on Binance Smart Chain. Router will enable you to do get the best price on Binance Smart Chain with one click and bring it back to your native blockchain, which is Solana,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Trading is the most popular use case on Router Protocol today, but Ramachandran said he expects many more applications to make inroads in the future. &#8220;One you speak across borders, you can not just trade, but borrow, lend, and do cross-chain governance. Sushi, for instance, has 15 chains and 15 different communities. To get a community vote across these chains is a nightmare as you will be required to do 15 different snapshots. So that is something we can solve. You can borrow from one chain, and lend on another,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The firm plans to deploy the capital to scale its product offerings and also invest in multiple security audits, it said.</p>
<p>Getting blockchains to communicate effectively with each other is the holy grail for DeFi going forward, and we are happy to work with the team behind Router &amp; Dfyn and support their unique approach to solving this problem,&#8221; said Darius Sit, co-founder of QCP Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We anticipate future Web 3.0 activity across several multi-purpose and application-specific blockchains. Router&#8217;s XCLP will be an important cross-chain infrastructure solution enabling the flow of liquidity across chains. We are delighted to back and support the Router team in their efforts in this direction.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.breakout.vc/">Breakout Ventures</a>, a San Francisco-based seed-stage venture firm that funds what it calls creative biosciences startups, has closed the second fund in its five-year history with $112.5 million in capital commitments.</p>
<p>Both of its funds, including a $60 million debut effort that we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/breakout-ventures-spun-out-of-peter-thiels-breakout-labs-has-closed-its-debut-fund-with-60m/">wrote about</a> in 2017, are backed by Dolby Family Ventures, the Thiel Foundation, GRIDS Capital, S Cubed Capital, Chris and Crystal Sacca, Tony Fadell, and Zack Bogue and Matt Ocko of DCVC.</p>
<p>The new fund also pulled in new institutional LPs, including Cortes Capital and Cupola Funds managed by AMG National Trust.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245884" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What its high-wattage backers are betting on are two managing partners who&#8217;ve long focused on startups at the intersection of biology and technology.</p>
<p>Lindy Fishburne, a management consultant earlier in her career, spent more than a decade as the executive director of the Thiel Foundation, which awarded no-strings-attached grants to deep science startups until it became obvious to Fishburne that, given what she was seeing, it was time to start writing venture checks instead.</p>
<p>Julia Moore was meanwhile an associate director at Stanford University before joining the Thiel Foundation as a portfolio director and joining forces with Fishburne afterward at Breakout Ventures. (Moore was promoted to managing partner earlier this year; the Thiel Foundation&#8217;s model has since been retired as the two build out the Breakout Ventures footprint.)</p>
<p>Naturally, the bets the two are making were also critical to the fundraising process, and there was apparently plenty of progress to report, with a portfolio that features a number of highly valued startups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among these is Modern Meadow, a company known mostly for its lab-grown leather and that closed on <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/sustainability/modern-meadow-closes-130-million-series-c-funding-names-anna-bakst-ceo/">$130 million</a> in Series C funding back in April (at an undisclosed valuation). Breakout Ventures also wrote one of the first checks to Cytovale, a San Francisco-based company that has gone on to raise $50 million and is currently in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidprosser/2021/10/13/how-cytovale-is-set-to-transform-the-fight-against-sepsis/?sh=7e6496fc372d">final stages of clinical trials</a> of a new test for sepsis that generates results in less than 10 minutes. (Sepsis is the leading cause of death in hospitals, notes Fishburne.)</p>
<p>A third company from that first fund is <a href="https://checkerspot.com/">Checkerspot</a>, a company using synthetic biology and chemistry to produce novel bio-derived oils. Like Cytovale, it has now raised $50 million altogether, including from Viking Global Investors.</p>
<p>Breakout Ventures was an early investor in <a href="https://www.cortexyme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cortexyme</a>. The now publicly traded company is developing therapies for Alzheimer’s disease, though it encountered a related <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-27/alzheimer-s-disease-stock-cortexyme-blows-up-after-trial-failure?sref=gni836kR">setback</a> in October that sent it shares diving, and they have yet to recover.</p>
<p>Altogether, say the two, their portfolio companies have gone on to raise more than $1 billion in follow-on capital and grants. They expect the pace to pick up quickly from here, too, fueled in part by the coronavirus pandemic. Asked about the effect on Breakout by the development of vaccines to treat Covid-19, both investors say the impact was both abrupt and enduring.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been gas on the fire,&#8221; says Fishburne. &#8220;For the world to see how central science is and its capacity to now be able to move so quickly and be so responsive driven by the tools of scale that are now available, that has [created an] enormous on-ramp for our companies and the places that we play.&#8221;</p>
<p>She points, as one example, to a portfolio company called Phylagen, a San-Francisco based biotech company that combines microbial genomics and data analytics to solve complex problems like pandemic management and supply chain verification and which is currently working with several large tech companies to ensure their employees and customers that their offices are safe.</p>
<p>Moore echoes the point. &#8220;What we saw with Moderna and what we&#8217;re seeing at the board level is that [companies&#8217;] ability to code a vaccine over a weekend permanently changed the pace of innovation in biosciences. The pace at which we see our companies monitoring timelines is moving [faster] because they have more actionable information and can iterate on that information at a speed we&#8217;ve never seen before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seemingly, Breakout Ventures is also moving quickly. Already, the firm has invested in three companies with its new fund, including Parthenon Therapeutics, a two-year-old, Cambridge, Ma.-based biotech that&#8217;s developing anti-cancer therapies and which just last week announced <a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/pfizer-ventures-backed-biotech-parthenon-therapeutics-snags-65m-series-a-to-advance-its">$65 million</a> in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Asked how Parthenon fits into Breakout&#8217;s broader thesis, Moore says that while Parthenon looks like a traditional therapeutics, it&#8217;s &#8220;doing a lot of really interesting biomarker work. They&#8217;re working with a novel hypothesis. They have an interdisciplinary team that can do multiple different modalities.&#8221;</p>
<p>While tried-and-true biotech investors led the deal &#8212; in this case, Pfizer and Northpond Ventures &#8212; Breakout Ventures is more focused on its biomarker work and thinking differently about perhaps less traditional partnerships for the company. Says Moore: &#8220;We&#8217;re the ones asking: how do you move faster in looking at the pipeline with pathology and AI?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instant grocery delivery continues to be a very frothy market, but today comes news of a major funding round for one player in it that investors believe will still be standing after the hype has died down.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goflink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flink</a>, the Berlin-based startup that sells food and other essentials at supermarket prices and aims to deliver them in under 10 minutes, has confirmed that it has raised $750 million, a Series B round of funding led by a strategic backer, DoorDash, made at a pre-money valuation of $2.1 billion ($2.85 billion post-money). Flink is already present in some 60 cities across four countries, where it covers 10 million customers; the plan will be to use the funding to continue growing that footprint, both organically and potentially by snapping up rivals (we have confirmed that most of the round is in equity with a small portion in debt for acquisitions).</p>
<p>The involvement of DoorDash &#8212; which went public in December 2020, has a market cap currently of just under $57 billion, and is making its first foray into Europe with this investment (a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/doordash-to-acquire-food-delivery-company-wolt/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">€7 billion deal</a> to buy Wolt in Finland has not closed; projected date for that is the second half of 2022) &#8212; was a badly-kept secret in this fundraise, with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dd874d12-a4a3-4565-b5ce-0e52f5ade680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> of the investment <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/doordash-flink-idAFL1N2QQ0T" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emerging</a> several months ago. We can confirm that DoorDash&#8217;s investment officially closed in September, with the rest of the round completed in the months following.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245692" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Others in the round included previous backer Mubadala Capital (which backed Flink in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$240 million round</a> made as recently as June) and other unnamed new and past investors. (Previous backers also include German supermarket giant REWE, Prosus, Bond, Target Global, Northzone, Cherry Ventures and TriplePoint Capital.)</p>
<p>What&#8217;s remarkable when you consider the size of the funding is that Flink has only been around for a year, and commercially active for just seven months. In a rare interview &#8212; the company has been media-shy up to now &#8212; CEO and co-founder Oliver Merkel said he believes that part of the reason Flink has attracted attention among what is a crowded field of instant delivery startups is because of the founders&#8217; track records. Merkel spent years as a management consultant at Bain working in grocery and retail; co-founders Julian Dames and Christoph Cordes are Rocket Internet alums who respectively founded the Foodora food delivery startup and furniture e-commerce business Fashion for Home (acquired by Home24, where Cordes became CEO).</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what we bring and why could we win market leadership in such a short amount of time is because we are obsessed about how we do things&#8230; and we bring some experience to the table. We made so many mistakes elsewhere, and we hope we&#8217;ve learned from those,&#8221; Merkel said. (Another reason for wooing investors could be that he&#8217;s quite personable for a media-shy person; that last comment was delivered tongue-in-cheek, as were many of the other quips he made off the record.)</p>
<p>This round has been in the works for some months now and the story behind that speaks to volatility and hype in the market at the moment, and where Flink believes it stands out.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DoorDash had originally come to Berlin last summer looking at investing in Gorillas, one of Flink&#8217;s big rivals, but that deal fell through over differences between the two companies&#8217; management styles and longer-term growth plans. So, DoorDash began talking with Flink, where it turned out executives were more aligned in their strategies and approaches to growth. (Gorillas instead raised money from another strategic, Delivery Hero, as part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whopping $1 billion round</a>.)</p>
<p>Flink, meanwhile, fresh off its own funding round, was fending with M&amp;A. Specifically, the startup had been tapped by both e-commerce and delivery behemoth Amazon, as well as by another U.S. instant grocery delivery player GoPuff, as an acquisition target.</p>
<p>Both approaches didn&#8217;t go anywhere &#8212; depending on who you ask, because Flink&#8217;s valuation was too high; or because Flink wasn&#8217;t interested in selling. At the same, Flink was also looking at a potential merger with Gorillas &#8212; a massive consolidation play that also didn&#8217;t happen at the time.</p>
<p>Whether Gorillas and Flink do ultimately join up, consolidation will likely come one way or the other as the many companies in instant delivery that have popped up in the last couple of years &#8212; spurred by the pandemic and changes in how people shopped and moved around &#8212; struggle to get profitable, reach positive unit economics, find new customers, and raise more money. GoPuff has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/after-acquiring-dija-and-fancy-instant-grocery-startup-gopuff-launches-in-the-uk-en-route-to-european-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buying up smaller instant delivery startups in Europe</a> to expand and scale, as has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getir</a>.</p>
<p>And we found out too that Flink itself came close to buying another instant delivery company, Cajoo in France, apparently for the grand sum of €1, before Cajoo instead <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/cajoo-raises-40-million-for-its-instant-grocery-delivery-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opted to raise $40 million</a>.</p>
<p>(TechCrunch has confirmed the above details with executives across the companies.)</p>
<p>Putting all that M&amp;A intrigue to one side, though, Flink has been quietly building out a strategy for how it plans to tackle the market, and it starts with how it sources groceries.</p>
<p>E-commerce is a business of economies of scale &#8212; it&#8217;s one reason why it&#8217;s so hard ultimately to compete against the behemoth that is Amazon &#8212; and the same goes for groceries, which need to be procured by the retailers that sell them.</p>
<p>Rather than try to get to a big enough scale to have the best negotiating power for buying in goods, Flink&#8217;s approach has been instead to partner with huge retailers and lean on them for those deals. In Germany, that has been its strategic backer REWE, and it has followed the same route with its launches in France and the Netherlands, although Flink has declined to disclose so far who those partners are.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flink is on a dynamic growth track, which REWE Group is supporting with its long-term commitment,&#8221; said Lionel Souque, CEO of REWE Group, in a statement on the relationship. &#8220;This also includes the operational cooperation between Flink and Rewe in the area of purchasing, which continues to develop very positively. Our decision to partner with Flink in April of this year has proven to be successful; Flink is now the number one in Quick Commerce in Germany and is ideally placed to further expand their market leadership.&#8221; (As for why a supermarket giant would be interested in a company that is essentially a rival, the logic was explained to me like this: those big supermarkets missed the boat on hard discount rivals like Aldi and Lidl, where they didn&#8217;t anticipate just how competitive the latter would ultimately become, taking away chunks of market share and customers. Now, the idea is to avoid making the same mistake and instead collaborate earlier and more closely with the next big thing to stay abreast of whatever growth might come.)</p>
<p>In the process of growing, the aim for Flink has been to keep the concept of instant grocery delivery as normal as possible and delivered to as wide a range of consumers as possible, not just young urbanites with disposable cash.</p>
<p>&#8220;People in big cities are spoiled,&#8221; Merkel said. &#8220;They get all the new innovations and services, but when we opened in Regensburg&#8221; &#8212; a significantly smaller town in the south of the country where Flink is now also operating &#8212; &#8220;it was crazy, the amount of business we got from day one. It&#8217;s an indication that our model works everywhere. We want to be the supermarket for everyone. Our pricing is supermarket pricing, and our products appeal not just to hipsters but the fireman, the teacher. Normal people.&#8221; It currently offers some 2,500 items in its biggest markets, and following its wide-appeal approach, that selection likely will grow over time.</p>
<p>What will be worth watching also is how Flink grows its talent. At a moment when there are remains a lot of scrutiny &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/eu-gig-economy-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potentially some big changes ahead</a> &#8212; over the rights that gig workers have at the companies where they operate, Flink says that its focus is &#8220;<span class="s1">fully employed riders with unlimited contracts at a massive scale to cope with customer demand.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The company says that on average, its customers are taking multiple orders each week, an engagement metric that caught the eye of DoorDash and will be something to watch as part of how the two companies potentially collaborate together in the future.</p>
<p><span class="s1">&#8220;We’ve been impressed by Flink&#8217;s growth and customer retention,&#8221; said Prabir Adarkar, CFO of DoorDash, in a statement. &#8220;Oliver, Julian, Christoph, and their team share our operator mindset and bring a wealth of industry experience. It&#8217;s not surprising that in less than a year of operating they have established themselves as the leader in key European markets.&#8221; </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;This funding round is a watershed moment for Flink as it continues on its hyper growth trajectory,&#8221; added&nbsp;Amer Alaily of Mubadala. &#8220;We are excited to watch them disrupt the instant grocery delivery space amidst an enormous market opportunity in Germany, France, the Netherlands and beyond &#8211; and we look forward to remaining a trusted partner to Oliver, Julian, Christoph and their team.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tyson Clark, a general partner with Alphabet&#8217;s venture arm, GV, has passed away unexpectedly at age 43. GV CEO David Krane just issued a statement about the team&#8217;s loss, writing, &#8220;With great sadness, we share the news that Tyson Clark, our friend and GV general partner, passed away yesterday due to sudden complications from a health issue. We are stunned and shattered by this loss. The GV team extends our deepest sympathies to Tyson&#8217;s family and loved ones. We are privileged to know his warmth, intellect, integrity, mentorship and humor. We will miss him profoundly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clark, a father of three, joined GV six years ago to focus on enterprise technology, including startups in the SaaS application and data center infrastructure spaces.</p>
<p>He joined the powerful investing unit after working briefly at Andreessen Horowitz in corporate development and, before that, working in corporate development at Oracle and as an investment banker for Morgan Stanley.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245803" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Clark was one of a small if growing pool of Black investors in the most senior positions of the venture industry. Further, Clark was just as rare, if not more so, as a VC who&#8217;d served his country. Indeed, he spent six years in the U.S. Navy, where he served as a nuclear propulsion submarine officer. (He very recently <a href="https://www.gv.com/news/hover-hiring-military-veterans/">hosted a conversation</a> about &#8220;attracting more vets into tech&#8221; with fellow veteran and entrepreneur A.J. Altman, whose company, <a href="https://hover.to/">Hover</a>, creates 3D models of properties and is backed by GV.)</p>
<div class="ajR h4">
<p>Clark &#8212; who studied industrial engineering at Stanford and who had an MBA from Harvard Business School &#8212; talked with TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/vareto-raises-24m-from-gv-menlo-and-all-star-angels-to-reinvent-financial-planning-for-enterprises/">in October</a> about his latest investment, Vareto.</p>
<p>He was also actively investing during the height of the pandemic, including meeting with &#8212; and funding &#8212; founders remotely.  In December of last year, for example, he led a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/17/gv-leads-9-million-investment-in-open-source-product-analytics-platform-posthog/">Series A</a> round for PostHog, an open source product analytics platform whose founder he had not met in person previously.</p>
<p>As it happens, Clark spoke last year with Sonal Chokshi, editor-in-chief at Andreessen Horowitz, for a virtual summit, alongside panelists Kara Nortman of Upfront Ventures and Connie Chan of Andreessen Horowitz. The discussion centered on the investors&#8217; career paths, and proved refreshingly candid.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Asked by Chokshi about the one &#8220;key skill&#8221; that set him up to be an investor, Tyson didn&#8217;t talk about his personality or intelligence or ability to synchronize information, as might some VCs. He said instead: &#8220;You can teach how to invest. You can teach how to interact on a board. But you can’t teach a network. You show up with your network.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also had instructive, no-nonsense advice to offer when Chokshi asked him about sourcing and attribution within venture firms and how much it matters who gets credit for a particular investment. &#8220;Internally, play it cool,&#8221; he&#8217;d said. &#8220;It’s not about attribution internally.&#8221; Externally, he&#8217;d added, &#8220;it’s all about attribution. You want to make sure that people know the deals you’ve done, where you’ve been influential. But internally, it can be very political as you claim credit for a deal. You’ve got to navigate the political structure within your firm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clark separately <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-08-24/black-venture-capitalists-confront-silicon-valley-s-quiet-racism?sref=gni836kR">spoke very openly</a> last year to Bloomberg about being one of the most prominent Black VCs in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>During the renewed attention paid to the Black Lives Matter movement in the spring of 2020, he wondered whether he had done enough to support Black founders and worried he was coming up short. “Have I been so complicit that I’ve traded success for not making a difference?” Clark told the outlet. “Humbly, there are a group of people in my position who want to do something, but feel like we don’t have enough power yet to be influential on this topic. It’s painful for all of us to feel this helplessness.”</p>
<p>Clark will undoubtedly be missed by many, including founders and other team members whose lives he touched. The dozens of companies with which he worked over the years include Evident.io, a company <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2018/palo-alto-networks-closes-acquisition-of-evident-io">acquired</a> by Palo Alto Networks in 2018; Obsidian Security, an identity protection startup; and a digital life insurance company called Ethos.</p>
<p>Clark also served on the boards of the San Francisco Museum of Art; Summer Search, an organization that works with high school students from low-income communities to overcome systemic inequities; and Resurge International, an international non-profit focused on healing impoverished patients who suffer from congenital abnormalities or injuries, with a focus on burn victims.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/italy-fines-amazon-1-3-billion-for-abusing-its-market-position/">Italy fines Amazon $1.3B:</a></strong> The fine is due to the U.S. e-commerce giant having “abused its dominant market position and pushed third-party sellers to use the company’s logistics service Fulfillment by Amazon,” TechCrunch reports, citing the Italian Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato. Most tech fines are too small to even note. This one will sting.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/e-commerce-aggregator-merama-gets-its-horn-after-just-12-months-in-business/"><strong>Build a unicorn with this one weird trick:</strong></a> All you have to do, it appears, is tell investors that you are raising capital to launch or aggregate e-commerce brands in a particular market, and, viola, unicorn status. That’s our takeaway from not only covering dozens of rounds in the e-commerce rollup market lately and the fact that Merama went from zero-to-unicorn in less than a year.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/eu-gig-economy-proposal/"><strong>The EU gets ready to change the gig labor market:</strong></a> If your company depends on using contract labor in the European Union, bad news. Things are likely changing in the coming years. Per our own <a href="https://twitter.com/riptari" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha Lomas</a>, “EU lawmakers have formally proposed legislation for the gig economy they hope will improve conditions for platform workers across the bloc.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the day’s mix of startup happenings, one more piece of data for you to chew on. Silicon Valley may be seeing its status as the The Startup Market being challenged both at home and abroad, but another market is not changing as quickly. Namely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/work-bench-report-finds-just-1-9-of-venture-investment-going-to-female-enterprise-founders/">the funding landscape for women founding business-focused software companies</a>. Given just how big a chunk of the startup market such businesses comprise, the gender gap is staggering. (A small shoutout to our own <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ron Miller</a> for his <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller/status/1469025851664646152" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent reporting on inequities</a> in the startup industry is in order, I think.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/robotic-research-raises-228m-series-a-to-build-out-commercial-autonomous-offerings/">Robotic Research raises nearly a quarter billion dollars:</a> </strong>$228 million, to be clear, which is darn close. What does the company do? It turns out that Robotic Research has “spent the last two decades developing on- and off-road autonomous vehicles for the Department of Defense.” So, yes, this is another huge funding round for autonomous vehicles. Let’s hope that this check is indicative of progress <em>made</em>, instead of progress <em>anticipated</em>, regarding the huge problem space that the startup is tackling.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/petra-emerges-from-stealth-with-30m-raised-for-tunnel-boring-robot-swifty/"><strong>Today in Very Good startup names:</strong></a> If you were founding a startup that made underground drilling tech, what would you call it? Perhaps <a href="https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Petra_(Civ6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Petra</em></a><em>? </em>That would be a good name. And the robot itself? How about <em>Swifty</em>? Well, if you thought those would be good names, the Petra crew would agree. They just raised a $30 million Series A for their very not boring boring work.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/ledger-to-launch-crypto-debit-card/"><strong>Ledger to launch crypto debit card:</strong></a> If you own a lot of crypto, how to actually spend the stuff can be an issue. Ledger is working on a debit card to help the crypto-rich use that wealth IRL. In the meatspace, if you will. Coinbase has a similar product, to give an example. Even the Hodl Gang have to pay rent.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/deed-raises-10m-for-its-workplace-giving-platform/">Deed’s better corporate giving platform lands $10M:</a></strong> Many companies have a corporate giving plan in place. Some companies, for example, match employee charitable giving. Deed wants to help more companies do more with their giving work. The startup just landed $10 million for its efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Today in $8.5M-$8.7M rounds: </strong>Rare is it that we see two rounds with the same dollar amount under the $10 million mark. Today we have effectively three. First, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/bird-buddy-smart-bird-feeder-funding/">Bird Buddy raised $8.5 million</a></strong> for its smart bird feeder tech, no joke. Second, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/airplane-internal-tools/">Airplane raised $8.5 million</a></strong> for its developer workflow automation service. And <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/mio-raises-8-7m-series-a-to-make-enterprise-messaging-interoperable/">Mio raised $8.7 million</a></strong> to help make enterprise messaging services like Slack and Teams interoperable.</li>
<li>And then there was <strong>Rho</strong>, which is seeing its corporate spend product rapidly scale. So quickly in fact that investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/rho-raises-75-million-series-b-for-its-one-stop-corporate-spend-and-cash-management-solution/"><strong>just gave it a $75 million Series B</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Closing out today’s startup notes: Acronyms. Namely fintech acronyms. What would happen if you took B2B and smushed into BNPL? Aside from creating the simply awful B2BBNPL (B2BNPL? BBNPL? 2BNPL 2FURIOUS?) acronym, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/affirm-spinout-resolve-raises-25m-in-insight-partners-led-round-to-grow-b2b-buy-now-pay-later-offering/"><strong>Affirm spinout Resolve just raised $25 million</strong></a> for its efforts to bring the buy now, pay later payments and debt phenom to the business-to-business market.</li>

<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/usage-based-pricing-is-a-companywide-effort-not-a-pricing-strategy/">his latest guest post for TechCrunch+</a>, OpenView partner Kyle Poyar explains why usage-based pricing &#8220;is a companywide effort&#8221; that &#8220;requires ditching the old SaaS metrics playbook.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no fad: UBP went mainstream because SaaS companies that use it see dramatically higher growth and retention rates.</p>
<p>Citing examples from powerhouses like Twilio, Stripe, AWS and others, Poyar explains how UBP companies &#8220;share their customers&#8217; success&#8221; and reduce their risk of ending up with a CRM packed &#8220;with lots of unprofitable customers.&#8221;</p>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/tinder-is-partnering-with-spotify-to-launch-a-new-music-mode-feature/"><strong>Spotify and chill:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, “hanging out” to watch “Netflix” may have become an only marginally coded phrase in English of late, but with Tinder partnering with Spotify to allow users to “hear a 30-second looped preview of a potential match’s chosen song while checking out their profile,” we are curious about how long a variation of the theme will come to market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/netflix-launches-a-website-dedicated-to-news-about-renewals-exclusive-interviews-and-more/"><strong>Netflix takes on SEO spam with new website:</strong></a> American streaming giant has come out with a new website called “Tudum,” which, if you say it out loud, sounds roughly like the noise that the Netflix logo makes when you fire up its app on your television, staring down another night at home thanks to COVID-19. <em>Tudum!</em> Anyhoo, the website “will host consumer news about renewals and release dates,” TechCrunch reports. Which means that those articles about “What To Watch On Netflix November 28, 2021” may lose some of their SEO juice.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/gm-rare-earth-magnet-us-supply-chain/"><strong>GM locks in supplies to build domestic EV tech:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Deciding to build electric vehicles is a step in a longer journey that includes some delicate sourcing work. Getting one’s hands on the raw materials required for battery production is no easy task. Nor is “locking in a domestic source of rare earth minerals, alloy and finished magnets for the electric motors” work that GM has recently undertaken.</li>
