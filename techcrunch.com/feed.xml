<p>New York-based Garbo was originally founded in 2018 by Kathryn Kosmides, a survivor of gender-based violence who wanted to make it easier for everyone to be able to have the ability to look up critical information about someone&#8217;s background that could indicate a history of violence. Typically, today&#8217;s background check services are run by for-profit companies and surface a wide variety of personal information &#8212; like drug offenses or minor traffic violations &#8212; that aren&#8217;t always relevant to matters of safety and abuse. Plus, those types of charges are often levied against members of more vulnerable communities, <a href="https://medium.com/garbo/update-to-garbos-database-policy-to-create-a-more-equitable-background-check-da94028ad715">Garbo has pointed out</a>, and aren&#8217;t correlated to gender-based violence.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Garbo instead offers low-cost background checks by collecting public records and reports of violence and abuse only, including arrests, convictions, restraining orders, harassment, and other violent crimes. To use the service, a user would enter either a first and last name, or a first name and phone number &#8212; often the only information a dating app users will have on one of their matches.</p>
<p>The service will then perform what it calls an &#8220;equitable background&#8221; check, <a href="https://medium.com/garbo/update-to-garbos-database-policy-to-create-a-more-equitable-background-check-da94028ad715">meaning it will exclude drug possession charges</a> form its results, as well as traffic tickets besides DUIs and vehicle manslaughter.</p>
<p>Last year, the nonprofit launched a beta test of its technology with 500 people in the NYC area, and soon grew its waitlist to over 6,000 more entirely by word-of-mouth. Garbo later pulled the test as the team realized the technology had the potential for national scale &#8212; something they wanted to deliver before launching to the public.</p>
<p>As a small nonprofit without much in terms of financial backing, Garbo also realized a larger partner may be needed in that effort.  After Kosmides got connected with Match Group&#8217;s new head of safety, Tracey Breeden, the two companies agreed to work together on bringing the technology to a broader U.S. audience.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2125056 alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="501" height="213" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg 1484w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?resize=768,326 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?resize=680,289 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;For far too long women and marginalized groups in all corners of the world have faced many barriers to resources and safety,&#8221; said Breeden, Match Group&#8217;s Head of Safety and Social Advocacy, in a statement about today&#8217;s news. &#8220;We recognize corporations can play a key role in helping remove those barriers with technology and true collaboration rooted in action. In partnership with Match Group, Garbo’s thoughtful and groundbreaking consumer background check will enable and empower users with information, helping create equitable pathways to safer connections and online communities across tech,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>This is Match Group&#8217;s second investment in an outside safety technology provider to enhance its dating apps&#8217; feature sets. In early 2020, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/match-group-invests-in-noonlight-to-power-new-safety-features-in-tinder-and-other-dating-apps/">invested in Noonlight</a> to help it power new safety features inside Tinder and other dating apps following a damning investigative report <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/tinder-lets-known-sex-offenders-use-the-app-its-not-the-only-one">by ProPublica and Columbia Journalism Investigations</a>, published December 2019. The report had revealed how Match Group allowed known sexual predators to use its apps. It also noted that Match Group didn’t have a uniform policy of running background checks on its dating app users, putting the responsibility on users to keep themselves safe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tinder&#8217;s top competitor Bumble has been marketing itself as a more women-friendly alternative to traditional dating apps like Tinder, and has rolled out a number of features designed to keep users safe from bad actors &#8212; including, most recently, a way to prevent to prevent them from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/bumbles-new-feature-prevents-bad-actors-from-using-unmatch-to-hide-from-their-victims/">using the app&#8217;s &#8220;unmatch&#8221; option to hide from their victims.</a></p>
<p>As gaining a reputation for being an &#8220;unsafe&#8221; app could be significantly damaging to a brand like Tinder and the larger online dating industry as a whole, it&#8217;s obvious why Match Group is now investing to address this problem more directly. With the Noonlight investment, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/match-group-invests-in-noonlight-to-power-new-safety-features-in-tinder-and-other-dating-apps/">Match Group promised features</a> like a discreet way to trigger emergency services inside the Tinder app, similar to the feature found in Uber and Lyft, plus other safety features.</p>
<p>Match Group today says Garbo will use the new investment to hire in product, as well as a head of engineering and an initial team of five engineers. The team will work help to build out Garbo&#8217;s capabilities, including through the use of natural language processing and A.I.</p>
<p>Garbo will also benefit from sizable contributions of time and resources from Match Group as its gets its product fully operational and then rolled out across Match Group products, starting with Tinder. And Match Group will be helping Garbo make the nonprofit&#8217;s technology accessible to other platforms, as well &#8212; including those in non-dating app markets, like ridesharing companies.</p>
<p>The feature, once live in Tinder, may not be free however.</p>
<p>Instead, Match Group says it will work to determine the pricing based on factors like what user adoption looks like, how many people want to use it, how many searches they want to perform and other factors. It also hasn&#8217;t yet determined how deep the integration may be &#8212; whether, for example, it will link outside the app to Garbo or make it seem more like an in-app feature.</p>
<p>Match Group doesn&#8217;t have any exact time frame for the feature&#8217;s launch beyond &#8220;later this year&#8221; for Tinder to be followed by other U.S. dating apps. The company may consider looking into similar investments for its services aimed at international users in the months to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Elon Musk made $25 billion in one day. On Monday, he crowned himself “Technoking of Tesla.” In Musk-speak, this new title still translates into the Chief Executive Officer of the electric car company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eccentric billionaire is nothing if not creative with his dubs (see: Offspring named X Æ A-Xii.) Zach Kirkhorn, the company’s Chief Financial Officer, has also been bestowed the title of Master of Coin. A nod to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game of Thrones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Honestly, who knows? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new appellations were announced via a </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000156459021012981/tsla-8k_20210315.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which reads: </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Effective as of March 15, 2021, the titles of Elon Musk and Zach Kirkhorn have changed to Technoking of Tesla and Master of Coin, respectively. Elon and Zach will also maintain their respective positions as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This title change follows Musk’s announcement last month that Tesla might start accepting bitcoin as a form of payment in the near future. The cryptocurrency’s stock price hit a new high of $61,788 over the weekend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps this is Musk&#8217;s not-so-subtle way of trying to let the world know who reigns supreme, especially after being bumped by Jeff Bezos as the richest person on the planet and after being </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/elon-musk-tesla-board-sued-in-lawsuit-alleging-erratic-tweets-violate-fiduciary-duty/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued by a Tesla investor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for his continuous “erratic tweets” that potentially expose the electric vehicle company to fines and penalties that could drive its share price down. </span></p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s announcement had a negligible impact on the stock price. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla’s stock is up 1.5% in morning trading. Tesla shares had an impressive 600% soar in 2020. However, the stock is now down 20% for the year from a high of $880.82 reached January 8. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla also disclosed on Monday that Jerome Guillen, president of automotive, will now take on the role of president of Tesla Heavy Trucking. In a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/elon-musk-says-tesla-semi-is-ready-for-production-but-limited-by-battery-cell-output/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Q4 earnings call, Musk said he expects deliveries of the Tesla Semi to begin this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The engineering work on the freight-hauling truck with an all-electric powertrain is complete, but lack of availability to battery cells might halt production, Musk said during the call. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Low-code and no-code tools have been a huge hit with enterprises keen to give their operations more of a tech boost, but often lack the resources to handle more complex integrations. Today, one of the startups that has been building low-code finance tools is announcing funding to tap into that trend and expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://genesis.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genesis</a> &#8212; which has to date primarily worked with financial services companies, giving non-technical employees the tools to create ways to monitor and manage<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> real-time risk, high-frequency trades and other activities &#8212; has picked up $45 million. It plans to use to bring the tools it has already built to a wider set of verticals that have some of the same needs to manage risk, compliance, and other factors as finance &#8212; healthcare and manufacturing are two examples &#8212; as well as to continue building more into the stack. </span></p>
<p>This Series B includes a mix of financial investors along with strategic backers that speak to who already integrates with Genesis&#8217; tools on their own platforms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Led by Accel, it also includes participation from new backers GV (formerly Google Ventures) and Salesforce Ventures, in addition to existing investors Citi, Illuminate Financial and Tribeca Venture Partners, who also invested in this round. To give you an idea of who it works with, Citi, along with ING, London Clearing House, and XP Investments, are some of Genesis customers.</p>
<p>Originally conceived in 2012 in Brazil by a pair of British co-founders &#8212; Stephen Murphy (CEO) and James Harrison (CTO), who cut their teeth in the world of investment banking &#8212; Genesis had raised less than $5 million before this round, mostly bootstrapping its business and leaning on Murphy and Harrison&#8217;s existing relationships in the world of finance to grow its customer base.</p>
<p>Today, Murphy lives in and leads the business from Miami &#8212; where he moved from New York just as the Covid-19 pandemic was starting to gain steam last year &#8212; while James Harrison (CTO) leads part of the team based out of the UK.</p>
<p>As you might imagine with so little funding before now for a company going on nine years old, Genesis was doing fine financially before this Series B, so the plan is to use the funding specifically to grow faster than it could have on its own steam. The startup is not disclosing its valuation with this round.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were not really fixated on valuation,&#8221; said Murphy in an interview, who said the funding came about after a number of VCs had approached the startup. &#8220;The most important thing is the future opportunity and where we could take the company with additional funding&#8230; this will help us hyper scale up.&#8221; He did note that the term sheets contained &#8220;some amazing numbers and multiples,&#8221; given the current interest in no-code and low-code technology.</p>
<p>Indeed, the vogue for no-code and low-code tech &#8212; other well-funded names in the crowded space include startups like <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210114/p53#a210114p53" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zapier</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/airtable-raises-185m-and-launches-new-low-code-and-automation-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airtable</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/rows-formerly-dashdash-raises-16m-to-build-and-populate-web-apps-using-only-spreadsheet-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rows</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/london-based-gyana-raises-3-9m-for-a-no-code-approach-to-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gyana</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/bryter-raises-16m-for-a-no-code-platform-for-non-technical-people-to-build-enterprise-automation-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bryter</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/ushur-raises-25m-for-its-no-code-platform-to-build-customer-communication-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ushur</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/creatio-raises-68m-as-the-low-code-space-keeps-attracting-huge-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creatio</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/easysend-raises-16m-from-intel-more-for-its-no-code-approach-to-automating-b2c-interfaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasySend</a>, as well as significant launches from Google and Microsoft and other bigger players &#8212; is coming out of two trends colliding.</p>
<p>On one side, we&#8217;ve well and truly entered an era in enterprise technology &#8212; with the same trend playing out in consumer tech, too &#8212; where smart developers are taking sophisticated and complex services and putting &#8220;wrappers&#8221; around them by way of APIs and simpler (low- or no-code) interfaces, so that those sophisticated tools can in turn be integrated and implemented in more places. This saves needing to build or integrate that complexity from scratch and expands access to the processes within those wrappers.</p>
<p>On the other side, the thirst for tech knowledge has become well and truly mainstream and as a result getting far more democratized. Working in a variety of applications, using different digital tools and devices, and seeing the fruits of tech pay off are all second nature to today&#8217;s working world &#8212; whether or not you are a technologist. So it&#8217;s no surprise to see more proactive, non-technical people looking for more ways to get their hands on these tools themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;You now have a whole citizen developer world, for example business analysts who understand the solution you want but might not know how to get there,&#8221; Murphy said. &#8220;We play to seasoned developers first but the investment will help us put more low code and no code tools into place to widen the tools out to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Starting out in finance made sense not just because that was where the two founders had previously worked, but also because of the history of how different software tools were already being used. Specifically, he noted that the ubiquity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microservices</a> &#8212; which themselves are collections of services as apps &#8212; laid the groundwork for more low-code. &#8220;We saw that if we could build a low-code entry point to microservices, that would be powerful.&#8221;</p>
<p>On top of that, investment banks, he said, have a history of wanting to build things themselves to tailor to their specific needs. &#8220;Buying off the shelf means you are at the mercy of the vendor,&#8221; he said. These factors made financial services companies very receptive to what Genesis was offering.</p>
<p>While a lot of the no/low-code players are coming at the concept with specific verticals in mind &#8212; no surprise, since different verticals have very specific use cases and needs &#8212; so what&#8217;s interesting with Genesis is how the company is leveraging what it already knows about finance, and then looking at other industries that have similar demands, structures and rules.</p>
<p>Murphy said that Genesis will stay &#8220;very focused on financial markets for 2021&#8221; but that it&#8217;s identified a number of other verticals similar to it, and is actually already seeing some inbound interest from them.</p>
<p>&#8220;A number of people have already approached us from the world of healthcare,&#8221; he said, pointing out that these organizations, like financial services, face challenges around how to audit data and regulations around performing transactions. Manufacturing, meanwhile, has some parallels around the area of complex event processing similar to equity algorithmic trading, he said. (In short, this relates to how external events might trigger more transactions, not unlike how external factors affect manufacturing operations.)</p>
<p>The trend is one that analysts forecast will only grow in the coming years: Gartner, for example, says that by 2024, low-code platforms will account for no less than 65% of all app development activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Low-code promises business users the autonomy to make their own technology usage and purchase decisions while enabling them to actually build their own applications without having to rely on IT,&#8221; said Andrei Brasoveanu, a partner at Accel, said n a statement. “By bringing one of the most transformative innovations in software development to financial services, Steve and the Genesis team are taking on a huge market of legacy vendors &#8211; and winning too &#8211; while delivering on the promise of low-code. The confidence they’ve gained from serving such large institutions is proof that there’s a real and urgent need for a purpose-built low-code solution for financial markets. We’re excited to partner with Genesis and support them in delivering this across the world.&#8221; Brasoveanu is joining the startup&#8217;s board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volkswagen AG is gearing up to seize the top spot as the world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer with plans announced Monday to have six 40 Gigawatt hour (GWh) battery cell production plants in operation in Europe by 2030.</p>
<p>To get there, the automaker put in a 10-year, $14 billion order with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/swedish-battery-manufacturer-northvolt-receives-a-14-billion-order-from-vw/">Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt</a> – and that&#8217;s only one of the six planned factories. A second plant in Germany will commence production in 2025.</p>
<p>The company also announced serious investments in charging infrastructure across China, Europe and the United States. It aims to grow its fast-charging network in Europe to 18,000 stations with its partner IONITY, 17,000 charging points in China through its joint venture CAMS New Energy Technology, and to increase the number of fast-charging stations in the United States by 3,500.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

The cell also paves the way for the transition to a solid-state battery cell, which the company anticipates for the middle of the decade. VW has made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">significant investments</a> in solid-state battery manufacturer QuantumScape.</p>
<p>Volkswagen&#8217;s new Unified Premium Battery platform will be rolled out in 2023 and will be used across 80 percent of its EV models. The first to contain the new battery, the Audi Artemis, will be rolled out in 2024.</p>
<p>Scania AB, VW&#8217;s brand of heavy-duty trucks and busses, also has plans to increase its share of EVs. Departing from other major heavy-duty players that have opted for hydrogen fuel cells, company representatives on Monday said that it is unequivocally possible to electrify the heavy-duty transportation sector.</p>
<p>Looking to the battery&#8217;s end-of-life, VW said it will be able to recycle up to 95% of the battery through a process called hydrometallury.</p>

<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a> — and make sure to check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/can-you-beat-google-with-googles-brains/">Friday&#8217;s news-roundup with Danny and Natasha</a> that included some neat notes on search startups.

<li>Stripe! Stripe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/">raised new money at a new price</a> and both were rather large. Would you believe that Stripe is still not public? It isn&#8217;t! But it should be. Perhaps this is the last time it will raise before listing.</li>
<li>Also from the recent past, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/megvii-ipo-china/">Megvii filed to go public</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/nimble-robotics-scores-50m-for-its-fulfillment-automation-tech/">Nimble Robotics raised</a>.</li>
<li>The Deliveroo IPO is happening, and the £1 billion raise could value the company at £5 billion, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deliveroo-ipo-idUSKBN2B70OO">Reuters reckons</a>.</li>
<li>Oh, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/wework-unbundles-its-products-in-an-attempt-to-make-itself-over-but-will-the-strategy-work/">TechCrunch has the most recent WeWork numbers</a>.</li>

<li><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/10/employee-engagement-startup-centrical-raises-32m/">Centrical also raised for its hybrid working software</a>, which could come in demand after COVID ends.</li>

					<description><![CDATA["if you're not a graphic designer, then any incremental minute that you're spending on trying to make your deck pretty is a waste of time."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Julia Collins is the first Black woman to co-found a venture-backed unicorn. So it should come as no surprise that investors lined up to bet on her latest venture, Planet FWD.</p>
<p>Investor Sarah Kunst says Collins&#8217; branding skills are on par with Supreme, the ubiquitous lifestyle brand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing that Supreme has done incredibly well is the same thing I think some very exceptional founders like Julia can do very well, which is to build a brand that stands for something,&#8221; said Kunst. &#8220;Smart people know that the best time to get aligned with a great brand is at the drop. A Supreme shirt that costs $100 bucks in the store will cost $1,000 online. So, as an investor, I am just a kid on the street corner flipping sportswear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kunst and Collins met well before Collins even had a clear idea for Planet FWD, but the duo knew they wanted to work together in the future. Kunst essentially told Collins that, whatever she was planning to do next, Kunst wanted to invest in it, sight unseen.</p>
<p>Kunst said Collins&#8217; ability to &#8220;see around the corner&#8221; with Zume gave her the confidence to proceed. When Zume launched, there were a lot of naysayers, recalls Kunst.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you look at where the world is and there are multibillion dollar companies in the space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Some of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world, like Travis Kalanick, are leaning into ghost kitchens, which are just less efficiently delivered versions of Zume Pizza robots. To quote Wayne Gretzky, because I&#8217;m from the Midwest and therefore care about hockey a tiny bit, you want to skate to where the puck is going.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two formed a friendship and eventually, Collins started building out Planet FWD and prepping to raise. By then, the foundation was there. Kunst got in on Planet FWD&#8217;s seed round.</p>
<h2>Fundraising is a process</h2>
<p>Collins says one of the biggest lessons she learned from her time at Zume was to limit distractions and focus on one thing at a time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt this disorientation at times, and it was hard to navigate,&#8221; she said, noting that she not only was starting a company but also settling into the Bay Area. &#8220;Now, it&#8217;s much easier for me to cut through a lot of noise and focus on a single conversation, a single product&#8217;s development, a single thing that I need to get done.&#8221;</p>
<p>In that same vein, Collins has learned to be incredibly deliberate when it comes to fundraising. It&#8217;s also worth noting that she&#8217;s raised some $400 million+ in the last five years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bangalore&#8217;s fintech startup ecosystem is inching closer to delivering a new unicorn: <a href="https://www.cred.club/">CRED</a>.</p>
<p>Two-year-old CRED is in advanced stages of talks to raise about $200 million at about $2 billion valuation, three sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The new funding round, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/india-cred-raises-81m-buys-back-1-2m-shares-from-employees/">like this January&#8217;s Series C</a>, will be largely financed by existing investors, the sources said, requesting anonymity as talks are private. The round is expected to close within a month, one of them said.</p>
<p>CRED, founded by Kunal Shah, has become one of the most talked-about startups in India, in part because of the pace at which its valuation has soared.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Backed by high-profile investors including DST Global, Sequoia Capital India, Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital, and General Catalyst, CRED was valued at $806 million when it closed its Series C round in January this year and $450 million in August 2019. (TechCrunch also scooped the Series C round of CRED.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think <a href="https://twitter.com/CRED_club?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CRED_club</a> has probably scaled faster than any Indian startup I know. In two years they have created a category so strong that everyone has an opinion on it.</p>
<p>&mdash; Harshil Mathur (@harshilmathur) <a href="https://twitter.com/harshilmathur/status/1365662664752467973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>If the new deal goes through, CRED will be the fastest startup in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market to attain a $2 billion valuation. Prior to the upcoming Series D round, CRED had raised about $228 million.</p>
<p>Reached by TechCrunch early last week, CRED declined to comment. Sequoia Capital India didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The Indian startup operates an eponymous app that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/india-cred-kunal-shah/">rewards customers for paying their credit card bills on time</a> and offers deals from online brands such as Starbucks, Nykaa, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/vahdam-teas-series-c-united-states-expansion/">Vahdam Teas</a>. It had over 5.9 million customers as of January &#8212; or about 20% of the credit card holder population in the country.</p>
<p>The startup, unlike most others in India, doesn&#8217;t focus on the usual TAM of India &#8212; hundreds of millions of users of the world&#8217;s second most populated nation &#8212; and instead caters to some of the most premium audiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;India has 57 million credit cards (vs 830 million debit cards) [that] largely serves the high-end market. The credit card industry is largely concentrated with the top 4 banks (HDFC, SBI, ICICI and Axis) controlling about 70% of the total market. This space is extremely profitable for these banks – as evident from the SBI Cards IPO,&#8221; analysts at Bank of America wrote in a recent report to clients.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very few starts-ups like CRED are focusing on this high-end base and [have] taken a platform-based approach (acquire customers now and look for monetization later). Credit card in India remains an aspirational product. The under penetration would likely ensure continued strong growth in coming years. Overtime, the form-factor may evolve (i.e. move from plastic card to virtual card), but the inherent demand for credit is expected to grow,&#8221; they added.</p>

<p>CRED says it is trying to help customers improve their financial behavior. An individual needs a credit score of at least 750 to join CRED. In a recent newsletter to customers, CRED said the median credit score of its customers was 830 and at &#8220;any given point in time&#8221; more than 375,000 individuals are on the app&#8217;s waiting list, many of whom have demonstrably improved their score to join CRED.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to be responsible when you&#8217;re empowered. 80% CRED Protect members got visibility on extra interest charges and avoided late payment fees by tracking their dues on CRED. Ignorance is not always bliss. CRED members detected additional charges worth over ₹145 Crores [$20.1 million] on their statements. CRED members avoided over ₹43.5 Crores [$6 million] worth of late payment fees,&#8221; it wrote in the newsletter.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the help of regular bill payment reminders, and a seamless credit card management experience; 160,000 CRED members improved their credit scores last month. CRED members know it pays to be good as they earned cash-back worth ₹12 Crores [$1.65 million] by paying their bills on time. There&#8217;s always something to look forward to on CRED.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Anthony Geranio has played video games for the past thirteen years. The 26 year-old first time founder of <a href="https://www.1v1me.com/">1v1Me</a>, a new company that lets anyone gamble on their ability to win in a player vs. player game, tried to make it as a professional gamer, but when that didn&#8217;t work, he turned to the tech industry.</p>
<p>Geranio and his co-founder Alex Emmanuel bounced between companies like TextNow, Skillshare, and Grailed to combine both of their passions &#8212; gaming and entrepreneurship into a new company.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason I got into programming was because I wanted to be my own boss one day,&#8221; Geranio said. And even though he was making $200,000 a year working at mission driven tech companies, Geranio said he still wasn&#8217;t fulfilled.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic finally convinced Geranio and Emmanuel to take the plunge. All of Geranio&#8217;s friends had started lockdown whiling away the hours by playing poker online for money. Then poker turned into Call of Duty, which turned into Madden, which became whatever else the kids play these days (my gaming days ended with Mortal Kombat II).</p>
<p>Geranio then went to OnDeck and, after graduating, began knocking on investors&#8217; doors. The company managed to raise over $2 million from investors including On Deck, Erik Torenberg at Village Global, Turner Novak at GeltVC, Niv Dror at Shrug, SterlingVC, Ali Hamed at Crossbeam, Cody Hock and Cole Hock from UpNorth, Lightshed Ventures and BettorCapital. Notable angels also wanted in on the action including Justin Waldron, Brud founder Trevor McFedries, Ian Borthwick, Albert Cheng, Stephen Sikes and Anthony Pompliano.</p>
<p>The company is launching its app on the app store with an invite only approach, with the first invites going to content creators who already play games like Call of Duty. The longterm goal is to create content creators around wagering. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to create a network where wagering is the engagement tool,&#8221; said Geranio.</p>
<p>For now, the company is only supporting bets on games like Call of Duty and Fortnite. The service acts as a marketplace which exchanges contact information on a PlayStation or Xbox. To win a wager, competitors have to link their bank accounts, settle on an amount, and 1v1Me puts that money in escrow. Gamers stream their game on Twitch and 1v1Me monitors the game to determine the winner. Once the competition is over, the winner gets the money transferred to their account.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is launching with gamers like  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NoisyButters" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/user/NoisyButters&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615897291490000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8Z_YZ-Yyqh9iCG4lQNyNI0T6_KA">NoisyButters</a> (who invested as well), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIUXwNNq0kNXkF9E_YTnfvg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIUXwNNq0kNXkF9E_YTnfvg&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615897291490000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEeen1jsgwGIivQ6vw40Jq1s8PVog">Lunchtime</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rlaw" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.twitch.tv/rlaw&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615897291490000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHTxJFl-Lb269-HMXO5YCShS9NBKw">RLaw</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vonniezugz" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tiktok.com/@vonniezugz&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615897291490000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHfPqAA9mt7JnKG6eUqvwnHXsG8EQ">Vonniezugz</a>. </span></p>
<p>To juice signups and invites, which can either be obtained through a creator or by following the company on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/1v1me" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.twitter.com/1v1me&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615897291490000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEAHX0Qvk797PdHV5olvrNdzQWPyQ">Twitter</a> where 1v1Me will give codes away, the company is also hosting a $500 challenge to whichever competitor wins the most games at the end of the week.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I worked at YouTube, I met many gaming creators that desired to entertain their fans and hone their skills, but it can be a struggle to make significant money along the way,&#8221; said Albert Cheng, Co-lead of Socially Financed and Director of Product at Duolingo. &#8220;1v1 is the most promising platform for esports gamers to make a living, and I&#8217;m thrilled to back them on their journey.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.myzeller.com/">Zeller</a>, a payment and financial services startup founded by former Square executives, quietly raised a $25 million AUD (about $19.4 million USD) Series A last year, it announced today. The funding was led by Addition, the investment firm founded by former Tiger Global partner Lee Fixel, and included participation from returning investors Square Peg and Apex Capital. The Melbourne-based company said this is one of Australia&#8217;s largest pre-launch Series A rounds ever.</p>
<p>The startup previously raised a $6.3 million AUD (USD $4.9 million) seed round in June 2020. Zeller was was founded last year by Ben Pfisterer, Square&#8217;s former Asia Pacific and Australia head, and Dominic Yap, its strategy and growth lead. It has made 38 new hires over the past six months, growing its team to 50 people.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding will be used to expand Zeller&#8217;s product development and engineering capabilities, marketing and sales, and customer support teams as it prepares for its launch. A date hasn&#8217;t been set yet, but chief executive officer Pfisterer told TechCrunch it is &#8220;imminent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeller will offer a fully-integrated payments and financial services solution designed for small- to medium-sized businesses that currently rely on multiple providers for their payment terminals, point of sale systems, e-commerce payments, transaction accounts and credit cards. Zeller&#8217;s software is combined with a payment terminal, transaction account and business Mastercard, and intended to make it easier for businesses to accept and send payments, access funds and manage their finances. Zeller will have no lock-in contracts and one low fee for card payments.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t underestimate the challenges that come with scaling a new brand in an area dominated by entrenched banking incumbents, yet the opportunity is incredibly exciting,&#8221; said Pfisterer. &#8220;The industry experience our team has built up over the years means that we are well aware of the pain points business owners face when getting set up with a new banking or financial services provider.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that despite the growth of e-commerce, about two-thirds of transactions are still processed in person. Zeller&#8217;s &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; is currently businesses that process up to $10 million AUD annually, mostly in face-to-face transactions.</p>
<p>&#8220;They may be sole traders or employ a team, may operate across one or multiple locations and come from a variety of verticals including retail, hospitality, fixed or mobile services, events, trades and many more,&#8221; said Pfisterer. He estimated that Zeller&#8217;s market opportunity in Australia includes just under 1.5 million merchants, and it is also designed to be scalable into other markets.</p>
<p>Other payment and financial services companies in Australia include Square, eWAY, PayPal, Ayden and Stripe.</p>
<p>Pfisterer said eWAY, Stripe and Adyen tend to focus on e-commerce payment processing, &#8220;yet this is just one element of what business owners need to manage their cash flow.&#8221; Most still need to accept in-person payments, which means going to a traditional bank for a merchant terminal and account. On the other hand, PayPal and Square focus mainly on micro-merchants. &#8220;The growing pains kick in when a business starts to expand and demands a wider variety of services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeller already has plans to introduce new payment and financial services products, and integrations with tools like point-of-sale and accounting software, to scale up with businesses as they grow, he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://northvolt.com/">Northvolt,</a> the Swedish battery manufacturer which raised $1 billion in financing from investors led by Goldman Sachs and Volkswagen back in 2019, has signed a massive $14 billion battery order with VW for the next 10 years.</p>
<p>The big buy clears up some questions about where Volkswagen will be getting the batteries for its huge push into electric vehicles, which will see the automaker <a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/volkswagen-boosts-ev-production-target-15-million-2025">reach production capacity of 1.5 million electric vehicles by 2025.</a></p>
<p>The deal will not only see Northvolt become the strategic lead supplier for battery cells for Volkswagen Group in Europe, but will also involve the German automaker increasing its equity ownership of Northvolt.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the partnership agreement, Northvolt&#8217;s gigafactory in Sweden will be expanded and Northvolt agreed to sell its joint venture share in Salzgitter, Germany to Volkswagen as the car maker looks to build up its battery manufacturing efforts across Europe, the companies said.</p>
<p>The agreement between Northvolt and VW brings the Swedish battery maker&#8217;s total contracts to $27 billion in the two years since it raised its big $1 billion cash haul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Volkswagen is a key investor, customer and partner on the journey ahead and we will continue to work hard with the goal of providing them with the greenest battery on the planet as they rapidly expand their fleet of electric vehicles,&#8221; said Peter Carlsson, the co-founder and chief executive of Northvolt, in a statement.</p>
<p>Northvolt&#8217;s other partners and customers include ABB, BMW Group, Scania, Siemens, Vattenfall, and Vestas. Together these firms comprise some of the largest manufacturers in Europe.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, the company said that its cell manufacturing capacity could hit 16 Gigawatt hours and that it had sold its capacity to the tune of $13 billion through 2030. That means that the Volkswagen deal will eat up a significant portion of expanded product lines.</p>
<p>Founded Carlsson, a former executive at Tesla, Northvolt&#8217;s battery business was intended to leapfrog the European Union into direct competition with Asia&#8217;s largest battery manufacturers &#8212; Samsung, LG Chem, and CATL.</p>
<p class="Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x">Back when the company first announced its $1 billion investment round, Carlsson had said that Northvolt would need to build up to150 gigawatt hours of capacity to hit targets for. 2030 electric vehicle sales.</p>
<p>The plant in Sweden is expected to hit at least 32 gigawatt hours of production thanks, in part to backing by the Swedish pension fund firms AMF and Folksam and IKEA-linked IMAS Foundation, in addition to the big financial partners Volkswagen and Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Northvolt has had a busy few months. Earlier in March the company announced the acquisition of the Silicon Valley-based startup company Cuberg.</p>
<p>That acquisition gave Northvolt a foothold in the U.S. and established the company&#8217;s advanced technology center.</p>
<p>The acquisition also gives Northvolt a window into the newest battery chemistry that&#8217;s being touted as a savior for the industry &#8212;<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/24/1018102/lithium-metal-batteries-electric-vehicle-car/"> lithium metal batteries</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>Cuberg spun out of Stanford University back in 2015 to commercialize what the company called its next-generation battery combining a liquid electrolyte with a lithium metal anode. The company&#8217;s customers include Boeing, BETA Technologies, Ampaire, and VoltAero and it was backed by Boeing HorizonX Ventures, Activate.org, the California Energy Commission, the Department of Energy and the TomKat Center at Stanford.</p>
<p>Cuberg&#8217;s cells deliver 70 percent increased range and capacity versus comparable lithium ion cells designed for electric aviation applications. The two companies hope that they can apply the technology to Northvolt&#8217;s automotive and industrial product portfolio with the ambition to industrialize cells in 2025 that exceed 1,000 Wh/L, while meeting the full spectrum of automotive customer requirements, according to a statement.</p>
<p>“The Cuberg team has shown exceptional ability to develop world-class technology, proven results and an outstanding customer base in a lean and efficient organization,&#8221; said Peter Carlsson, CEO and Co-Founder, Northvolt in a statement. &#8220;Combining these strengths with the capabilities and technology of Northvolt allows us to make significant improvements in both performance and safety while driving down cost even further for next-generation battery cells. This is critical for accelerating the shift to fully electric vehicles and responding to the needs of the leading automotive companies within a relevant time frame.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new nanocoating from Curran Biotech could dramatically improve air filtration to prevent the spread of COVID-19 indoors.</p>
<p>Their Capture Coating technology acts as a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/curran-biotechs-capture-coating-transforms-everyday-air-filters-into-virus-fighting-front-line-tools-in-the-battle-against-covid-19-contributing-to-the-safety-of-filtered-air-301236418.html?tc=eml_cleartime">supplement to any household or commercial HVAC system by bonding to the filter fibers</a>, giving them greater hydrophobic properties. This combined effect prevents virus-carrying droplets from traveling through the filter fibers, which, without the treatment, only prevent some viral transmission.</p>
<p>“&#8217;Capture Coating&#8217; is designed to mitigate and significantly decrease viral transmission of COVID-19 through specified air filtration media by forming a breathable, flexible, non-leaching, water-repellent barrier against aqueous respiratory droplets that act as virion carriers that can potentially be recirculated through conventional air-filters,” wrote Curran Biotech founder and University of Houston physics professor Shay Curran in an email. Despite the molecular complexity of the coating, the product itself can simply be sprayed onto an HVAC system’s filter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This new droplet-targeting coating is an improvement over current filtration methods, which typically only target dry molecules. Not only do those methods often have at least some potential of viral droplet transmission, but current solutions to improve them aren’t always energy efficient.</p>
<p>“In the world where energy management is very important, that means recycling the same air in the building with the risk of cross contamination,” wrote Curran. “Taking outside air is one way to dilute the air, but that means we also lose a huge amount in terms of energy, and still don&#8217;t solve the problem of taking the virus away from places where people congregate.”</p>
<p>Indoor air ventilation remains an important tool in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 across schools, small businesses, and other public buildings, but updating old HVAC systems to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/ventilation.html">recommended CDC standards can be costly</a>. Curran hopes that his company’s approach can help address this issue, as the Capture Coating requires only a simple spray, rather than a completely new system of filters. “That really means for a few dollars when used on a standard issue MERV8, you can have huge indoor protection and stop its spread throughout the building,” he wrote.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will unreliable research bury your healthcare startup?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/will-unreliable-research-bury-your-healthcare-startup/embed/#?secret=lxwxN248kq" data-secret="lxwxN248kq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Because of the nature of the nanocoating, Curran’s technology can help prevent viral droplet transmission long after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. The <a href="https://www.curranbiotech.com/gallery">hydrophobic qualities of the coating prevent respiratory droplets</a> from actions like sneezing or coughing from passing through the filter, while the HVAC system itself retains its normal capabilities for dry molecule filtration. With the Capture Coating, common droplet-transmitting viruses like the flu or cold will also be filtered out of circulation.</p>
<p>Similarly, the nanocoating would work in preventing transmission of any variant of the COVID-19 virus, as all of those variants also undergo droplet transmission. “It does not mean we get away from taking precautions such as hand washing, wearing masks etc, but it does mean we can work indoors far more safely,” wrote Curran.</p>
<p>So far, Curran Biotech’s Capture Coating technology is in use in 11 states, and will soon be announcing partnerships with distributors and filter companies to directly provide consumers with coated filters. Curran wrote that the company has also had successful trials of the technology in New York City, and hopes to expand use of the product even further across businesses and institutions around the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://deepsee.ai/">DeepSee.ai</a>, a startup that helps enterprises use AI to automate line-of-business problems, today announced that it has raised a $22.6 million Series A funding round led by led by ForgePoint Capital. Previous investors AllegisCyber Capital and Signal Peak Ventures also participated in this round, which brings the Salt Lake City-based company&#8217;s total funding to date to $30.7 million.</p>
<p>The company argues that it offers enterprises a different take on process automation. The industry buzzword these days is &#8216;robotic process automation,&#8217; but DeepSee.ai argues that what it does is different. I describe its system as &#8216;knowledge process automation&#8217; (KPA). The company itself defines this as a system that &#8220;mines unstructured data, operationalizes AI-powered insights, and automates results into real-time action for the enterprise.&#8221; But the company also argues that today&#8217;s bots focus on basic task automation that doesn&#8217;t offer the kind of deeper insights that sophisticated machine learning models can bring to the table. The company also stresses that it doesn&#8217;t aim to replace knowledge workers but help them leverage AI to turn the plethora of data that businesses now collect into actionable insights.</p>

<p>&#8220;Executives are telling me they need business outcomes and not science projects,&#8221; writes DeepSee.ai CEO Steve Shillingford. &#8220;And today, the burgeoning frustration with most AI-centric deployments in large-scale enterprises is they look great in theory but largely fail in production. We think that’s because right now the current ‘AI approach’ lacks a holistic business context relevance. It’s unthinking, rigid, and without the contextual input of subject-matter experts on the ground. We founded DeepSee to bridge the gap between powerful technology and line-of-business, with adaptable solutions that empower our customers to operationalize AI-powered automation – delivering faster, better, and cheaper results for our users.&#8221;</p>
<p>To help businesses get started with the platform, DeepSee.ai offers <a href="https://deepsee.ai/platform/">three core tools</a>. There&#8217;s <a href="https://deepsee.ai/platform/#assembler">DeepSee Assembler</a>, which ingests unstructured data and gets it ready for labeling, model review and analysis. Then, <a href="https://deepsee.ai/platform/#atlas">DeepSee Atlas</a> can use this data to train AI models that can understand a company&#8217;s business processes and help subject-matter experts define templates, rules and logic for automating a company&#8217;s internal processes. The third tool, <a href="https://deepsee.ai/platform/#advisor">DeepSee Advisor</a>, meanwhile focuses on using text analysis to help companies better understand and evaluate their business processes.</p>
<p>Currently, the company&#8217;s focus is on providing these tools for insurance companies, the public sector and capital markets. In the insurance space, use cases include fraud detection, claims prediction and processing, and using large amounts of unstructured data to identify patterns in agent audits, for example.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a relatively limited number of industries for a startup to operate in, but the company says it will use its new funding to accelerate product development and expand to new verticals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using KPA, line-of-business executives can bridge data science and enterprise outcomes, operationalize AI/ML-powered automation at scale, and use predictive insights in real time to grow revenue, reduce cost, and mitigate risk,&#8221; said Sean Cunningham, Managing Director of ForgePoint Capital. &#8220;As a leading cybersecurity investor, ForgePoint sees the daily security challenges around insider threat, data visibility, and compliance. This investment in DeepSee accelerates the ability to reduce risk with business automation and delivers much-needed AI transparency required by customers for implementation.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ElevateBio, one of the leading biotech companies focused on gene-based therapies has raised a massive $525 million Series C round of financing, more than doubling the company&#8217;s $193 million Series B funding which closed last year. This new funding comes from existing investor Matrix Capital Management, and also adds new investors SoftBank and Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, and will be used to help the company expand its R&amp;D and manufacturing capabilities, as well as continue to spin out new companies and partnerships based on its research.</p>
<p>Cambridge, Mass-based ElevateBio was founded to bridge the world of academic research and development of cell and gene therapies with that of commercialization and production-scale manufacturing. The startup identified a need for more efficient means of brining to market the ample, promising science that was being done in developing therapeutics that leverage cellular and genetic editing, particularly in treatment of severe and chronic illness. Its business model focuses on both developing and commercializing its own therapies, and also working through long-term partnerships with academic research institutions and other therapeutics biotech companies to bring their own technologies to market.</p>
<p>To this end, ElevateBio is in the business of frequent spin-out company creation, with the new entities each focused on a specific therapeutic. The company has announced three such companies to date, including AlloVir (in partnership with Baylor College of Medicine), HighPassBio (a venture with gene-editing company Fred Hutchinson) and Life Edit Therapeutics (in partnership with AgBiome). There are additional spin-outs in the works, too, according to ElevateBio, but they are not being disclosed publicly yet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As you might expect, ElevateBio seems to have benefited from the increased appetite for biotech investment stemming from the global pandemic and its impacts. ElevateBio&#8217;s AlloVir spin-out is actually working on a T cell therapy candidate for addressing COVID-19, which is potentially effective in eliminating cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 in a patient to slow the spread of the disease and reduce its severity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, there was a debate as to whether WeWork was a tech company or more of a real estate play. At first, most people viewed WeWork as a real estate startup disguised as a tech startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as it kept scooping up more and more property, the lines continued to blur. Then we all watched as the company’s valuation plummeted and its IPO plans went up in smoke. Today, WeWork is rumored to be </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-in-talks-to-combine-with-spac-or-raise-money-privately-11611857306?mod=djemalertNEWS"><span style="font-weight: 400;">going public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via </span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/wework-could-strike-blank-check-company-merger-deal-in-1st-week-of-march-8211-wsj-62874558"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a SPAC </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">at a $10 valuation, down significantly from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the $47 billion it was valued at after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising $1 billion in its SoftBank-led Series H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> round in January 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and then-CEO Adam Neumann notoriously </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/report-weworks-adam-neumann-to-step-down-as-ceo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stepped down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later that year amid allegations of a toxic combination of arrogance and poor management. WeWork has since been very publicly trying to redeem itself and turn around investor &#8212; and public &#8212; perception.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chairman Marcelo Claure kicked off a strategic, five-year turnaround plan in earnest in February 2020. That same month, the beleaguered company named a real estate &#8212; not tech &#8212; exec as its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/01/report-wework-has-a-new-ceo-and-hes-a-real-estate-not-a-tech-exec/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new CEO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a move that set tongues wagging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeWork then also set a target of becoming </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wework-says-become-free-cash-132630453.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free cash flow positive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a year to 2022 as part of its plan, which was aimed at both boosting valuation and winning back investor trust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It likely saw the demise of competitor Knotel, which ended up </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/a-look-at-how-proptech-startup-knotel-went-from-a-1-6b-valuation-to-filing-for-bankruptcy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filing for bankruptcy </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and selling assets to an investor, and realized it needed to learn from some of that company’s mistakes.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;WeWork is apparently doing better, not that SoftBank wants you to talk about that&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/wework-is-apparently-doing-better-not-that-softbank-wants-you-to-talk-about-that/embed/#?secret=Jql6taVlu7" data-secret="Jql6taVlu7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question now is: Has WeWork legitimately turned a corner? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the implementation of its turnaround plan, the company says it has exited out of over 100 pre-open or underperforming locations. (It still has </span><a href="https://www.wework.com/locations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 800 locations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> globally, according to its website.) WeWork has also narrowed its net loss to $517 million in Q3 2020 from $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, revenue has taken a hit, presumably due to the impact of the coronavirus. Revenue slumped to $811 million the 2020 third quarter, compared with $934 million in Q3 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic presented WeWork with challenges, but also &#8212; some might say &#8212; opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many people being forced to work from home and avoiding others during the work day, the office space in general struggled. WeWork either had to adapt, or potentially deal with a bigger blow to its valuation and bottom line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeWork’s dilemma is similar to  those of real estate companies around the world. With so many companies shifting to remote work not just temporarily, but also permanently, landlords everywhere have had to adjust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, as McKinsey </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/the-effect-of-government-stimulus-on-commercial-real-estate-amid-covid-19#"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all landlords have been forced to be more flexible and restructure tenant leases. So in effect, anyone operating commercial real estate space has had to become more flexible, just as WeWork has.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, WeWork has taken a few steps to adapt. For one, it realized its membership-only plan was not going to work anymore, and a dip in membership was evidence of that. So, it worked to open its buildings to more people through new </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/wework-but-make-it-uber-b428fbe2-7fc7-4d4e-aaba-8c8aa2be537d.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2020/10/24/wework-coworking-coronavirus-office-commercial-real-estate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> options. The goal was to give people who were weary of working out of their own homes a place to go, say one day a week, to work. WeWork also saw an opportunity to work with companies to offer up its office space as a perk via an All Access offering, as well as with universities that wanted to give their students an alternative place to study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgetown did a pretty unique partnership with WeWork to have one of its locations serve as “their replacement library and common space.” And, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies like Brandwatch have recently shifted from leveraging WeWork&#8217;s traditional spaces to instead offer employees access to WeWork locations around the globe via All Access passes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeWork has also launched new product features. At the beginning of the year, the company launched </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the ability to book space on the weekend and outside of business hours. </span></p>

<h2>The unbundling of space</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked with Prabhdeep Singh, WeWork’s global head of marketplace, who is overseeing the new products and also spearheading WeWork’s shift online, to learn more about the company’s new strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’ve essentially done is unbundle our space,” he said. “It used to be that the only way to enjoy our spaces was via a bundled subscription product and monthly memberships. But we realized with COVID, the world was shifting, and to open up our platform to a broader group of people and make it as flexible as humanly possible. So they can now book a room for a half hour or get a day pass, for example. The use cases are so wide.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since On Demand launched as a pilot in New York City in August 2020, demand has steadily been climbing, according to Singh. So far, reservations are up by 65% &#8212; and revenue up by 70% &#8212; over the 2020 fourth quarter. But of course, it’s still early and they were starting from a small base. Nearly two-thirds of On Demand reservations are made by repeat customers, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the last year and a half, we’ve been really figuring out what things we want to focus on what things we don’t,” Singh said. “As a flexible space provider, we are looking at where the world is going. And while we’re a small part of the whole commercial office space industry, we are working to use technology to enable a flexible workspace experience via a great app and the digitization of our spaces.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, things seem to be looking up some. In February, WeWork says it had nearly twice as many active users compared to January. Also, people apparently like having the option to come in at off hours. Weekend bookings now account for an estimated 14.5% of total bookings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly double as many existing members purchased All Access passes in February 2020 compared to January to complement their existing private office space during COVID, the company said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the beginning of the COVID-19, WeWork saw a</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/15/success/wework-ceo-future-work/index.html?utm_term=PRV-160019770518545e993ef75ca&amp;utm_source=Work+Transformed+September+15&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=243358_1600197705203&amp;bt_ee_preview=NcSrJnseMIyhSYOHhgpWJBhg8%2Bguk%2FDdFMfL84t5SciDGnr%2BQdbNwGGFmVGUuyiT&amp;bt_ts_preview=1600197705203"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">higher departure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) than of its enterprise members, partially due to the nature of their businesses and the need to more immediately manage cash flow, the company said. But in the third quarter of 2020, SMB desk sales were up 50% over the second quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, throughout the pandemic, WeWork has seen its enterprise segment grow at nearly double the rate of its SMBs, now making up over half of the company’s total membership base.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s slowing down investing in new real estate assets in certain markets, it is still working to “right-size” its portfolio via exits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, when it comes to its finances, as of March 2, WeWork said its </span><a href="https://www.boerse-berlin.com/index.php/Bonds?isin=USU96217AA99"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bonds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were trading at the highest point since the summer of 2019, when the company failed to go public. That’s way up from a 52-week low of about 28%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At ~92% for a ~10% yield, the creditor sentiment is clearly positive and a testament to the overall market&#8217;s belief that WeWork&#8217;s flexible workspace product has a viable future in the future of real estate,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last March, WeWork’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bonds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trading at 43 cents on the dollar and S&amp;P Global had lowered WeWork’s credit rating further into junk territory and put the company on watch for further downgrades, reported </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2020/03/26/wework-mounts-charm-offensive-as-bondholders-run-for-the-exits/?sh=3dcafcfe28dd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the company is not done adapting. Singh told TechCrunch that to make WeWork’s value proposition even stronger, it’s working to offer a “business in a box.” Late last year, WeWork partnered with a number of companies to offer SMBs and startups, for example, services such as payroll, healthcare and business insurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people that come to WeWork are growing businesses,” Singh said. “So while we’ve stuck with our core business services, we’re working to offer more, as in a real suite of HR services that might be complex and expensive for a small business to manage on their own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also working to be able to offer its On Demand product globally so that people can opt to work out of a WeWork space from any of its locations around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now, we are in the largest work from home experiment,” Singh said. “I think we’re about to shift to the largest return to work experiment ever. We are just going to be very well positioned.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company appears to be trying to become a more sophisticated real estate company that may not be as flashy as the one of the Adam Neumann era, but more stable and more in demand. But is it trying to do too much, too fast?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be interesting to see how it all goes.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook will soon label all posts discussing the coronavirus vaccination with a pointer to official information about COVID-19, it <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/mark-zuckerberg-announces-facebooks-plans-to-help-get-people-vaccinated-against-covid-19/">said today</a>.</p>
<p>It also revealed it has implemented some new &#8220;temporary&#8221; measures aimed at limiting the spread of vaccine misinformation/combating vaccine hesitancy &#8212; saying it&#8217;s reducing the distribution of content from users that have violated its <a href="https://www.intern.facebook.com/help/230764881494641">policies on COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation</a>; or &#8220;that have repeatedly shared content debunked as False or Altered by our third-party fact-checking partners&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also reducing distribution of any COVID-19 or vaccine content that fact-checking partners have rated as “Missing Context”, per the blog post.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While admins for groups with admins or members who have violated its COVID-19 policies will also be required to temporarily approve all posts within their group, it said. (It&#8217;s not clear what happens if a group only has one admin and they have violated its policies.)</p>
<p>Facebook will also &#8220;further elevate information from authoritative sources when people seek information about COVID-19 or vaccines&#8221;, it added.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why users who repeatedly violate Facebook&#8217;s COVID-19 policies do not face at least a period of suspension. (We&#8217;ve asked the company for clarity on its policies. <strong>Update:</strong> Facebook said that anyone who repeatedly breaks its policies will be removed from its platform &#8212; so its latest &#8220;temporary&#8221; measures in this area are presumably aimed at tackling the &#8216;long tail&#8217; of misinformation which may linger (via content reshares etc) even after a policy-violating spreader&#8217;s account has been banned.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re continuing to expand our efforts to address COVID-19 vaccine misinformation by adding labels to Facebook and Instagram posts that discuss the vaccines,&#8221; Facebook said in the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/mark-zuckerberg-announces-facebooks-plans-to-help-get-people-vaccinated-against-covid-19/">Newsroom post</a> today.</p>
<p>&#8220;These labels contain credible information about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines from the World Health Organization. For example, we’re adding a label on posts that discuss the safety of COVID-19 vaccines that notes COVID-19 vaccines go through tests for safety and effectiveness before they’re approved.&#8221;</p>
<p>The incoming COVID-19 information labels are rolling out globally in English, Spanish, Indonesian, Portuguese, Arabic and French (with additional languages touted &#8220;in the coming weeks&#8221;), per Facebook.</p>
<p>As well as soon rolling out labels &#8220;on all posts generally about COVID-19 vaccines&#8221; &#8212; pointing users to its COVID-19 Information Center &#8212; Facebook said it would add additional &#8220;targeted&#8221; labels about &#8220;COVID-19 vaccine subtopics&#8221;. So it sounds like it may respond directly to specific anti-vaxxer misinformation it&#8217;s seeing spreading on its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will also add an additional screen when someone goes to share a post on Facebook and Instagram with an informational COVID-19 vaccine label. It will provide more information so people have the context they need to make informed decisions about what to share,&#8221; Facebook added.</p>
<p>The moves follow revelations that an internal Facebook study of vaccine hesitancy &#8212; which was reported on by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/14/facebook-vaccine-hesistancy-qanon/">Washington Post</a> yesterday after it obtained documents on the large-scale internal research effort &#8212; found a small number of US users are responsible for driving most of the content that&#8217;s hesitant about getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just 10 out of the 638 population segments [Facebook&#8217;s study divided US users into] contained 50 percent of all vaccine hesitancy content on the platform,&#8221; the Post reported. &#8220;And in the population segment with the most vaccine hesitancy, just 111 users contributed half of all vaccine hesitant content.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/">MIT Technology Review</a> also published a deep-dive article probing Facebook&#8217;s approach to interrogating, via an internal &#8216;Responsible AI&#8217; team, the impacts of AI-fuelled content distribution &#8212; which accused the company of prioritizing growth and engagement and neglecting the issue of toxic misinformation (and the individual and societal harms that can flow from algorithmic content choices which amplify lies and hate speech).</p>
<p>In the case of COVID-19, lies being spread about vaccination safety or efficacy present a clear and present danger to public health. And Facebook&#8217;s PR machine does appear to have, tardily, recognized the extent of the reputational risk it&#8217;s facing if it&#8217;s platform is associated with driving vaccine hesitancy.</p>
<p>To wit: Also today it&#8217;s announced the launch of a global COVID-19 education drive that it says it hopes will bring 50M people &#8220;closer to getting vaccinated&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;By working closely with national and global health authorities and using our scale to reach people quickly, we’re doing our part to help people get credible information, get vaccinated and come back together safely,&#8221; Facebook writes in the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/mark-zuckerberg-announces-facebooks-plans-to-help-get-people-vaccinated-against-covid-19/">Newsroom post</a> that links directly to a Facebook post by founder Mark Zuckerberg also trailing the new measures, including the launch of a tool that will show U.S. Facebook users where they can get vaccinated and provide them with a link to make an appointment.</p>
<p>Facebook said it plans to expand the tool to other countries as global vaccine availability steps up.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124926" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124926" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2124926" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-COVID_Vaccine_Product_Bundle_vaccine_finder_tool.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-COVID_Vaccine_Product_Bundle_vaccine_finder_tool.jpg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-COVID_Vaccine_Product_Bundle_vaccine_finder_tool.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-COVID_Vaccine_Product_Bundle_vaccine_finder_tool.jpg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-COVID_Vaccine_Product_Bundle_vaccine_finder_tool.jpg?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-COVID_Vaccine_Product_Bundle_vaccine_finder_tool.jpg?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-COVID_Vaccine_Product_Bundle_vaccine_finder_tool.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124926" class="wp-caption-text">Facebook&#8217;s vaccine appointment finder tool (Image credits: Facebook)</p></div></p>
<p>Facebook has further announced that the COVID-19 information portal it launched in the Facebook app in March last year which points users to &#8220;the latest information about the virus from local health ministries and the World Health Organization&#8221; is finally being brought to Instagram.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Facebook hadn&#8217;t already launched the portal on Instagram. But it&#8217;s decided to double down on fighting bad speech (related to vaccines) with better speech &#8212; saying Instagram users will get new stickers they can add to their Instagram Stories &#8220;so people can inspire others to get vaccinated when it becomes available to them&#8221;.</p>
<p>In other moves being trailed in Facebook&#8217;s crisis PR blitz today it has touted &#8220;new data and insights&#8221; on vaccine attitudes being made available to public officials via COVID-19 dashboards and maps it was already offering (the data is collected by Facebook&#8217;s Data for Good partners for the effort at Carnegie Mellon University and University of Maryland as part of the <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/symptomsurvey/">COVID-19 Symptom Survey</a>).</p>
<p>Albeit, it doesn&#8217;t specify what new information is being added there (or why now).</p>
<p>Also today it said it&#8217;s &#8220;making it easy to track how COVID-19 vaccine information is being spread on social media through <a href="https://apps.crowdtangle.com/public-hub/covid19">CrowdTangle’s COVID-19 Live Displays</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Publishers, global aid organizations, journalists and others can access real-time, global streams of vaccine-related posts on Facebook, Instagram and Reddit in 34 languages. CrowdTangle also offers Live Displays for 104 countries and all 50 states in the US to help aid organizations and journalists track posts and trends at a regional level as well,&#8221; Facebook added, again without offering any context on why it hadn&#8217;t made it easier to use this tool to track vaccine information spread before.</p>
<p>Its blog post also touts &#8220;new&#8221; partnerships with health authorities and governments on vaccine registration &#8212; while trumpeting the ~3BN messages it says have already been sent &#8220;by governments, nonprofits and international organizations to citizens through official WhatsApp chatbots on COVID-19&#8221;. (As WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted there is no simple way to quantify how many vaccine misinformation messages have been sent via the same platform.)</p>
<p>Per Facebook, it&#8217;s now &#8220;working directly with health authorities and governments to get people registered for vaccinations&#8221; (such as in the city and province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, which is using WhatsApp as the official channel to send notifications to citizens when it’s their turn to receive the vaccine).</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have partnered with ministries of health and health-focused organizations in more than 170 countries by providing free ads, enabling partners to share their own public health guidance on COVID-19 and information about the COVID-19 vaccine,&#8221; Facebook&#8217;s PR adds in a section of the post which it&#8217;s titled &#8220;amplifying credible health information and resources from experts&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of reports that <a href="http://stripe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a> was raising yet more money, the payments giant has now confirmed the details. The company has closed in on another $600 million, at a valuation of $95 billion.</p>
<p>Stripe said it will use the funding to expand its business in Europe, with a focus on its European HQ, and also to beef up its global payments and treasury network.</p>
<p>“We’re investing a ton more in Europe this year, particularly in Ireland,” said John Collison, President and co-founder of Stripe, in a statement. “Whether in fintech, mobility, retail or SaaS, the growth opportunity for the European digital economy is immense.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stripe said the financing included backing from two major insurance players. Allianz, via its Allianz X fund, and Axa are in the round, along with Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Sequoia Capital, and an investor from the founders&#8217; home country, Ireland’s National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).</p>
<p>The insurance angle may point to which direction the company is looking to go next. After all, fintech and insurance are closely aligned.</p>
<p>“Stripe is an accelerator of global economic growth and a leader in sustainable finance. We are convinced that, despite making great progress over the last 10 years, most of Stripe’s success is yet to come” said Conor O&#8217;Kelly, CEO of NTMA in a statement. “We’re delighted to back Ireland’s and Europe’s most prominent success story, and, in doing so, to help millions of other ambitious companies become more competitive in the global economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The big round, rising valuation, and growing cap table will inevitably lead to questions around where the company is standing with regards to its next steps, and whether that will include a public listing. Stripe has long kept its cards to its chest when it comes to user numbers, revenues, and profit and those details, once again, are not being disclosed with the news today, and nor has it made any comments on IPO plans.</p>
<p>Notably, the confirmation of the news today is at a lower valuation than the valuation Stripe was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2021/02/17/investors-are-now-valuing-stripe-at-115-billion/?sh=7721c7554786" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> trading at on the secondary market, which was $115 billion; and the round that closed at a $95 billion valuation was also rumored to be coming in at a higher number, over $100 billion.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether those numbers were never accurate, or if Covid had an impact on pricing, or if European investors simply drove a hard bargain.</p>
<p>The focus on growing in Europe also puts the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peter-barron-376b16a_some-personal-news-next-week-ill-be-joining-activity-6770749267343626240-E1K2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring of Peter Barron</a> &#8212; the former EMEA VP of communications for Google and a former journalist &#8212; into some context.</p>
<p>Founded in 2010 by John and his brother Patrick Collison (the CEO), Stripe is one of a wave of commerce startups that saw the value of building a simple way for developers to integrate payments into any app or site by way of a few lines of code, at a time when digital and specifically online payments were starting to take off.</p>
<p>Behind that code, the company had done all the hard work of integrating all the different and complex pieces needed to make payments work both in countries and across borders.Over the years, the company has built out a bigger platform around that, a suite of services to position itself as a one-stop shop not just for helping businesses run all of the commercial aspects of their operations, including incorporation, managing fraud, managing cashflow and more.</p>
<p>Within that, Stripe has built out a decent footprint in Europe, with the region accounting for 31 of the 42 countries where it has customers today. While Stripe may have had its start and early traction providing payments infrastructure for startups (and especially small, new startups), today that list includes a lot of big names, too. In Europe, customers include Axel Springer, Jaguar Land Rover, Maersk, Metro, Mountain Warehouse and Waitrose, alongside Deliveroo (UK), Doctolib (France), Glofox (Ireland), Klarna (Sweden), ManoMano (France), N26 (Germany), UiPath (Romania) and Vinted (Lithuania).</p>
<p>Even with heavy competition in payments and adjacent services, there is a huge opportunity for more growth. Stripe says that in the wake of Covid and the rise of people shopping considerably more across the web and apps rather than in person, currently some 14% of commerce happens online, a big shift considering that just a year ago it was about 10%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello friends, and welcome to Week in Review.</p>
<p>Last week, I talked a bit about NFTs and their impact on artists. If you&#8217;re inundated with NFT talk just take one quick look at this story I wrote this week about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/beeples-69-million-nft-sale-marks-a-potentially-transformative-moment-for-the-art-world/">the $69 million sale of Beeple&#8217;s photo collage</a>. This hype cycle is probably all the result of crypto folks talking each other up and buying each other&#8217;s stuff, but that doesn&#8217;t mean there won&#8217;t be lasting impacts. That said, I would imagine we&#8217;re pretty close to the peak of this wave, with a larger one down the road after things cool off a bit. I&#8217;ve been wrong before though&#8230;</p>
<p>This week, I&#8217;m interested in a quick look at what your kids have been talking about all these years. Yes, Roblox.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>The big thing</h2>
<p>Roblox went public on the New York Stock Exchange this week, scoring a $38 billion market cap after its first couple days of trading.</p>
<p>Investors rallied around the idea that Roblox is one of the most valuable gaming companies in existence. More than Unity, Zynga, Take-Two, even gaming giant Electronic Arts. It&#8217;s still got a ways to go to take down Microsoft, Sony or Apple though&#8230; The now-public company is so freaking huge because investors believe the company has tapped into something that none of the others have, a true interconnected creative marketplace where gamers can evolve alongside an evolving library of experiences that all share the same DNA (and in-game currency).</p>
<p>The gaming industry has entered a very democratic stride as cross-play tears down some of the walls of gaming&#8217;s platform dynamics. Each hardware platform that operates an app store of their own still has the keys to a kingdom, but it&#8217;s a shifting world with uncertainty ahead. While massive publishers have tapped cloud gaming as the trend that will string their blockbuster franchises together, they all wish they were in Roblox&#8217;s position. The gaming industry has seen plenty of Goliath&#8217;s in its day, but for every major MMO to strike it rich, it&#8217;s still just another winner in a field of disparate hits with no connective tissue.</p>
<p>Roblox is different, and while many of us still have the aged vision of the image above: a bunch of rudimentary Minecraft/Playmobile-looking mini-games, Roblox&#8217;s game creation tools are advancing quickly and developers are building photorealistic games that are wider in ambition and scope than before. As the company levels-up the age range it appeals to &#8212; both by holding its grasp on aging gamers on its platform and using souped-up titles to appeal to a new-generation &#8212; there&#8217;s a wholly unique platform opportunity here: the chance to have the longevity of an app store but with the social base layer that today&#8217;s cacophony of titles have never shared.</p>
<p>Whether or not Roblox is the &#8220;metaverse&#8221; that folks in the gaming world have been hyping, it certainly looks more like it than any other modern gaming company does.</p>

<h2>Other things</h2>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/apple-security-updates-iphone-ipad-mac-watch/">Apple releases some important security patches</a><br />
</b>It was honestly a pretty low-key week of tech news, I&#8217;ll admit, but folks in the security world might not totally buy that characterization. This week, Apple released some critical updates for its devices, fixing a Safari vulnerability that could allow attackers to run malicious code on a user&#8217;s unpatched devices. Update your stuff, y&#8217;all.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/tiktok-rolls-out-new-commenting-features-aimed-at-preventing-bullying/">TikTok gets proactive on online bullying</a><br />
</b>New social media platforms have had the benefit of seeing the easy L&#8217;s that Facebook teed itself up for. For TikTok, its China connection means that there&#8217;s less room for error when it comes to easily avoidable losses. The team announced some new anti-bullying features aimed at cutting down on toxicity in comment feeds.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/dropbox-to-acquire-secure-document-sharing-startup-docsend-for-165m/"><b>Dropbox buys DocSend</b></a><br />
Cloud storage giants are probably in need of a little reinvention, the enterprise software boom of the pandemic has seemed to create mind-blowing amounts of value for every SaaS company except these players. This week, Dropbox made a relatively big bet on document sharing startup DocSend. It&#8217;s seemingly a pretty natural fit for them, but can they turn in into a bigger opportunity?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/epic-games-buys-photogrammetry-software-maker-capturing-reality/"><b>Epic Games buys photogrammetry studio</b></a><br />
As graphics cards and consoles have hit new levels of power, games have had to satisfy desired for more details and complexity. It takes a wild amount of time to create 3D assets with that complexity so plenty of game developers have leaned on photogrammetry which turns a series of photos or scans of a real world object or environment into a 3D model. This week, Epic Games bought one of the better known software makers in this space, called <em>Capturing Reality,</em> with the aim of integrating the tech into future versions of their game engine.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/twitter-spaces-to-launch-publicly-next-month-may-include-spaces-only-tweets/"><b>Twitter Spaces launches publicly next month</b></a><br />
I&#8217;ve spent some more time with Twitter Spaces this week and am growing convinced that it has a substantial chance to kneecap Clubhouse&#8217;s growth. Twitter is notoriously slow to roll out products, but it seems they&#8217;ve been hitting the gas on Spaces, announcing this week that it will be available widely by next month.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/seth-rogen-and-evan-goldberg-want-to-be-your-weed-dealer/"><b>Seth Rogen starts a weed company</b></a><br />
There&#8217;s a lot of money in startups, there&#8217;s really never been a better time to get capital for a project&#8230; if you know the right people and have the right kind of expertise. Seth Rogen and weed are a pretty solid mental combo and him starting a weed company shouldn&#8217;t be a big shock.</p>

<h2>Extra things</h2>
<p>Some of my favorite reads from our Extra Crunch subscription service this week:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/coupang-follows-roblox-to-a-strong-first-day-of-trading/"><strong>Coupang follows Roblox to a strong first day of trading</strong></a><br />
&#8220;Another day brings another public debut of a multibillion-dollar company that performed well out of the gate.This time it’s Coupang, whose shares are currently up just over 46% to more than $51 <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/79210/Korean-e-commerce-giant-Coupang-prices-upsized-US-IPO-at-$35-above-the-upwa">after pricing at $35</a>, $1 above the South Korean e-commerce giant’s IPO price range. Raising one’s range and then pricing above it only to see the public markets take the new equity higher is somewhat par for the course when it comes to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/the-ipo-market-looks-hot-as-airbnb-and-c3-ai-raise-price-targets/">most successful recent debuts</a>, to which we can add Coupang.&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/coupang-follows-roblox-to-a-strong-first-day-of-trading/"><strong>More</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/how-nontechnical-talent-can-break-into-deep-tech/"><b>How nontechnical talent can break into deep tech</b></a><br />
&#8220;Startup hiring processes can be opaque, and breaking into the deep tech world as a nontechnical person seems daunting. As someone with no initial research background wanting to work in biotech, I felt this challenge personally. In the past year, I landed several opportunities working for and with deep tech companies.<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/how-nontechnical-talent-can-break-into-deep-tech/"><strong>More</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/does-your-vc-have-an-investment-thesis-or-a-hypothesis/"><b>Does your VC have an investment thesis or a hypothesis?</b></a><br />
&#8220;Venture capitalists love to talk investment theses: on Twitter, Medium, Clubhouse, at conferences. And yet, when you take a closer look, theses are often meaningless and/or misleading&#8230;&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/does-your-vc-have-an-investment-thesis-or-a-hypothesis/"><strong>M</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>re</strong></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has delivered another 60 Starlink satellites to orbit — meaning it has sent 180 in total to join its 1,000+ strong constellation in the past two weeks alone. Today&#8217;s launch also set a record for SpaceX for its Falcon 9 rocket reusability program, since it was the ninth flight and ninth landing for this particular first-stage booster.</p>
<p>The booster was used previously on a variety of missions, including five prior Starlink launches, as well as the Demo-1 mission for the company&#8217;s Crew Dragon capsule, which was the uncrewed test flight that proved it would work as intended from launch all the way to docking with the International Space Station and then returning back to Earth.</p>
<p>SpaceX set its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/spacex-delivers-60-more-starlink-satellites-in-first-launch-of-2021-and-sets-new-falcon-9-rocket-reusability-record/">prior reusability record in January this year</a> – another Starlink launch – using this very same refurbished first stage, which had just flown in December of last year before that. SpaceX not only wants to continue to show that it can re-fly these boosters more and more times, but also that it can turn them around quickly for their next mission, since both speed and volume will have a significant impact on launch costs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FeR7WuHAFl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/spacex-delivers-60-more-starlink-satellites-in-first-launch-of-2021-and-sets-new-falcon-9-rocket-reusability-record/">SpaceX delivers 60 more Starlink satellites in first launch of 2021, and sets new Falcon 9 rocket reusability record</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SpaceX delivers 60 more Starlink satellites in first launch of 2021, and sets new Falcon 9 rocket reusability record&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/spacex-delivers-60-more-starlink-satellites-in-first-launch-of-2021-and-sets-new-falcon-9-rocket-reusability-record/embed/#?secret=FeR7WuHAFl" data-secret="FeR7WuHAFl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Rocket reuse is of particular importance when it comes to these Starlink missions, which are happening with increasing frequency as SpaceX pushes to expand the availability of its Starlink broadband internet service globally. As mentioned, this is the third launch of 60 satellites for the constellation in just 10 days — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spacex-launches-60-new-starlink-satellites-just-one-week-after-the-last-batch/">the most recent launch happened just Thursday</a>, and the first of this trio took place the Thursday before that.</p>
<p>From here, expect SpaceX to just continue to launch at roughly this pace for the next little while, since it has two more planned Starlink launches before March is over, including one tentatively set for next Sunday. As the company is its own customer for these missions, it&#8217;s eating the cost of the launches (at least until Starlink starts operating beyond its current beta and bringing in more revenue) so re-flying boosters is a good way to help mitigate the overall spend.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Every quarter we dig into the venture capital market’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/venture-capital-is-going-to-get-even-bigger-faster-and-more-expensive-this-year/">global</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/in-2020-vcs-invested-428m-into-us-based-startups-every-day/">national</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/fintech-startups-and-unicorns-had-a-stellar-q4-2020/">sector-based results</a> to get a feel for what the temperature of the private market is at that point in time. These imperfect snapshots are useful. But sometimes, it’s better to focus on a single story to show what’s really going on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Enter <a href="https://agentsync.io/">AgentSync</a>. I covered AgentSync for the first time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/agentsync-raises-4-4m-for-its-insurtech-compliance-service/">last August</a>, when the API-focused insurtech player raised a $4.4 million seed round. It’s a neat company, helping others track the eligibility of individual brokers in the market. It’s a big space, and the startup was showing rapid initial traction in the form of $1.9 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR).</p>
<p>But then AgentSync <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/agentsync-lands-consecutive-rounds-as-insurtech-booms/">raised again in December</a>, sharing at the time of its $6.4 million round that the valuation cap had grown by 4x since its last round. And that it had seen 4x revenue growth since the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p>All that must sound pretty pedestrian; a quickly-growing software company raising two rounds? Quelle surprise.</p>
<p>But then AgentSync raised <em>again</em> this week, with another grip of datapoints. Becca Szkutak and Alex Konrad’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/midastouch/#45c2bb1c7c09">Midas Touch newsletter</a> reported the sheaf of data, and The Exchange confirmed the numbers with AgentSync CEO Niji Sabharwal. They are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Present-day revenues of less than $10 million, but with ARR growing by 6x in 2020 after 10x expansion in 2019.</li>
<li aria-level="1">No customer churn to date.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Its $25 million Series A valued the company at $220 million, which Konrad and Szkutak describe as “exactly 10x AgentSync’s valuation from eight months ago.”</li>
</ul>
<p>That means AgentSync was worth $22 million when it raised $4.4 million, and the December round was raised at a cap of around $80 million. Fun.</p>
<p>Back to our original point, the big datasets can provide useful you-are-here guidance for the sector, but it’s stories like AgentSync that I think better show what the market is really like today for hot startups. It’s bonkers fast and, even more, often backed up by material growth.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabharwal also told The Exchange that his company has closed another $1 million in ARR since the term sheet. So its multiples are contracting even before it shared its news. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021, there you have it.</span></p>
<h2>Meet Conscience.vc</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also this week I got to meet </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arianadthacker/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ariana Thacker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who is building a venture capital fund. Her route to her own venture shop included stops at Rhapsody Venture Partners, and some time at Predictive VC. Now she’s working on </span><a href="https://conscience.vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conscience.vc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or perhaps just Conscience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her new fund will invest in companies worth less than $15 million, have some form of consumer-facing business model (B2B and B2B2C are both fine, she said), and something to do with science, be it a patentable technology or other sort of IP. Why the science focus? It’s Thacker’s background, thanks to her background in chemical engineering and time as a facilities engineer for a joint Exxon-Shell project. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 takeaways from the Coursera IPO filing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/5-takeaways-from-the-coursera-ipo-filing/embed/#?secret=hOvE4RDYgY" data-secret="hOvE4RDYgY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>All that’s neat and interesting, but as we cover zero new-fund announcements on The Exchange and almost never mini-profile VCs, why break out of the pattern? Because unlike nearly everyone in her profession, Thacker was super upfront with data and metrics.</p>
<p>Heck, in her first email she included a list of her investments across different capital vehicles with actual information about the deals. And then she shared more material on different investments and the like. Imagine if more VCs shared more of their stuff? That would rock.</p>
<p>Conscience had its first close in mid-January, though more capital might land before she wraps up the fundraising process. She’s reached $4 million to $5 million in commits, with a cap of $10 million on the fund. And, she told The Exchange, she didn’t know a single LP before last summer and only secured an anchor investor last October.</p>
<p>Let’s see what Thacker gets done. But at a minimum I think she’ll be willing to be somewhat transparent as she invests from her first fund. That alone will command more attention from these pages than most micro-funds could ever manage.</p>
<h2>A whole bunch of other important shit</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The week was super busy, so I missed a host of things that I would have otherwise liked to have written about. Here they are in no particular order:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong><a href="https://falconx.io/">FalconX</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that powers crypto-trading on other platforms, raised $50 million this week. The round comes after the company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/falconx-raises-17m-to-power-its-crypto-trading-service/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $17 million last May</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I wrote about that here. Tiger Global led the round, natch, as it has led </span><a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1369642298326269955"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly every round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the last month. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><strong>FalconX</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> round matters as the company grew from what we presume was a modest trading and revenue base into something much larger. Per the company, in “less than a year” the company’s “trading volume” grew by 12x and its “net revenue” grew 46x. That’s a lot. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong><a href="https://privacera.com/">Privacera</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also raised $50 million this week. Insight Partners led the round. The deal caught my eye as it promised a “cloud-based data governance and security solution.” That reminded me of </span><a href="https://www.skyflow.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skyflow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly-growing startup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that I thought might have a similar product. </span><strong>Privacera</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO </span><a href="https://twitter.com/balaji_blog?lang=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balaji Ganesan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> politely corrected my confusion in an email saying that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Skyflow is like a vault for customer data. They replace customer data with tokens. Our focus is on data governance, so it is broader. We don&#8217;t store customer data within our solution.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fair enough. It’s still an interesting space.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then there’s </span><strong><a href="https://www.woflow.com/">Woflow</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which </span><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/11/merchant-data-platform-woflow-emerges-from-stealth-with-3-5m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VentureBeat actually got to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before I could. I chatted with the company this week, but sadly have more notes than open word count today. So let it suffice to say that the company’s model of selling structured merchant data is super cool. And the fact that it has linked up with customers in its first vertical (restaurants) like DoorDash is impressive.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its round was led by Craft Ventures, a firm that has been pretty damn active in the API-powered startup landscape in recent months. More to come on </span><strong>Woflow</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Various and Sundry</b></p>
<p>Closing, I learned a lot about software valuations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/bessemers-2021-cloud-report-provides-context-for-soaring-software-startup-valuations/">here</a>, got to noodle on the epic Roblox direct listing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/welcome-to-bloxburg-public-investors/">here</a>, dug into fintech’s venture <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/there-have-never-been-more-100m-fintech-rounds-than-right-now/">successes and weaknesses</a>, and checked out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/global-e-files-to-go-public-as-e-commerce-startups-enjoy-a-renaissance/">the Global-e IPO filing</a>. Oh, and M1 Finance raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/m1-finance-raises-another-rapid-fire-round-after-scaling-its-aum-to-more-than-3-5b/">again</a>, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/latam-corporate-spend-management-startup-clara-raises-3-5m-comes-out-of-stealth/">Clara</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/arist-adds-2m-to-its-seed-round-to-grow-its-sms-based-training-service/">Arist</a> raised small, but fun rounds.</p>
