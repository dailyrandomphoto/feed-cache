										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The startup opioid use disorder therapy service <a href="https://www.bicyclehealth.com/">Bicycle Health</a> will soon be available to patients in half the country, just three years after its launch in 2017, according to founder Ankit Gupta.</p>
<p>A serial entrepreneur whose last company, Pulse News, was acquired by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/linkedin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="linkedin">LinkedIn <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> back in 2013, Gupta left the LinkedIn in 2016 (around the time of the Microsoft acquisition) to pursue something more meaningful. He settled on trying to find a better way to address the opioid addiction epidemic, which was responsible for more than 42,000 deaths the year he left LinkedIn.</p>
<p>By 2018 deaths from overdoses would exceed 47,000, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And the problem isn&#8217;t going away. Bicycle Health&#8217;s statistics indicate that 92 million Americans are potentially at risk for developing opioid use disorder and 2 million Americans are already diagnosed as opioid addicts.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2087882" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Opioid-Use-Chart.png" alt="" width="1024" height="789" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Opioid-Use-Chart.png 1841w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Opioid-Use-Chart.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Opioid-Use-Chart.png?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Opioid-Use-Chart.png?resize=768,592 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Opioid-Use-Chart.png?resize=680,524 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Opioid-Use-Chart.png?resize=1536,1183 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Opioid-Use-Chart.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Initially, the company worked out of a clinic in Redwood City, Calif., but as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the US earlier this year and forced treatment facilities to undertake preventative measures to stop the spread of the disease, Bicycle Health began adopting virtual treatment methods.</p>
<p>Under new regulations delivered by HHS, many therapies and drug treatments that had only been available in-person were able to be distributed remotely. The change caused an explosion in remote care services and companies like Bicycle Health rushed to capitalize.</p>
<p>The company is currently offering treatment options in 18 states and is on track to be available in 25 states by the end of the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Backing that growth are a slew of individual and institutional investors led by the venture investment firm, Signalfire, which led Bicycle Health&#8217;s seed round. In all, the company has raised roughly $5.5 million from investors including Signalfire, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hustle-fund" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hustle-fund">Hustle Fund, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Romulus Capital, and individual investors like Jeff Weiner, the former chief executive of LinkedIn; Sami Inkinen, the founder of Virta Health; Rushika Fernandopulle, the founder of Iora Health; and John Simon, the co-founder of General Catalyst through his Greenlight Fund.</p>
<p>Bicycle Health both prescribes buprenorphine as a medical treatment and offers a team of health coaches to address the behavioral and mental health issues attendant with detoxifying.</p>
<p>There are three health coaches on staff to manage the care of the company&#8217;s current roster of 2,000 patients and those coaches are bolstered by 12 clinical support specialists, Gupta said.</p>
<p>Treatment is delivered and managed through the company&#8217;s mobile app, and is supplemented by regular in-home diagnostic testing to monitor a patient&#8217;s progress, according to Gupta.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Working with Goodrx, the company has been able to drive down over-the-counter costs for patients who don&#8217;t have healthcare, and Gupta said that Bicycle Health would be working with local and national healthcare providers to try and defray as much of the costs as the company can.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We want to subsidize the costs as much as possible for our patient,&#8221; he said.  </span></p>
<p>The goal, Gupta said in an interview with TechCrunch earlier this year is &#8220;making sure that this industry is making sure that they&#8217;re helping people make a change instead of keeping them stuck.&#8221;</p>
<p>And although Gupta comes from a software industry whose guiding principle has been to move fast and break things, he realizes that healthcare doesn&#8217;t work that way. &#8220;Move fast and break things is the wrong mindset for healthcare,&#8221; he said. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to build a safe space … and i don’t mean a safe space legally but a safe space where patients can be served.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><b></b><a href="https://www.zeroavia.com/?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Series%20A"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ZeroAvia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company that&#8217;s on a mission to move the world to zero-emission, hydrogen-fueled flight, has just received some corporate jet fuel in the form of a new $21.4 million cash infusion.</span></p>
<p>The investment came from the Bill Gates-backed <a href="https://www.breakthroughenergy.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breakthrough Energy Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://ecosystemintegrity.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecosystem Integrity Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which led the company&#8217;s latest round, alongside previous investors </span><a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/about/climate-pledge-fund"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, </span></a><a href="https://www.horizonsventures.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horizons Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/new-energies/shell-ventures.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shell Ventures,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://summaequity.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summa Equity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>Aviation is a huge contributor to the carbon emissions that cause global warming, and the industry, along with shipping will be one of the hardest to decarbonize. Electrification technologies have yet to account for ways to propel aircraft or move massive seafaring vessels, and a consensus is emerging among technologists that Hydrogen will be the best solution to ensure zero emissions flight can become a reality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a big believer in hydrogen from the perspective that if I have enough zero carbon hydrogen, and it’s cheap enough, then I can do anything</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; said Eric Toone, the executive managing director and science lead Breakthrough Energy Ventures. </span></p>
<p>Industry backers think that ZeroAvia may also be the ticket to solving many of the aviation industry&#8217;s problems. The company has established a partnership with British Airways and received a $16.3 million grant from the UK government to ensure that its 19-seat hydrogen-electric airplane is ready for the market by 2023.</p>
<p>Longtime investor Shell Ventures doubled down on its commitment to ZeroAvia with this round, on the back of the company&#8217;s unique approach to integrating various proven technologies to bring hybrid hydrogen-electric flight to market.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Each individual component is not unique in a sense. The powertrain is not unique, the fuel system isn’t unique&#8230; [But] bringing it all together in a system, is not just technically getting a plane in the sky but having those conversations with regulators about what do we need to change and all the steps involved in getting to a commercial play,&#8221; said Paul Bogers, the vice president of Hydrogen at Shell. </span></p>
<p>ZeroAvia is now developing and testing the certification-ready ZA-600 powertrain, which can fly a 10-20 seat aircraft up to 500 miles, the company said. And earlier this year the company completed the first commercial-scale battery electric flight and the first flight of a hydrogen fuel cell powered aircraft in September. The company said it would expect to complete a long-distance flight of 250 miles within the next three months.</p>
<p>For Val Miftakhov, the founder and chief executive of ZeroAvia and a serial entrepreneur whose last company, eMotorWerks, was sold to Enel, the flights prove out his thesis that hydrogen power is the answer for the aviation industry.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our most recent milestone achievements are closing the gap for the airline industry to begin its transition away from fossil fuels. In fact, over ten forward-looking airlines are now gearing up to implement our powertrains when they are ready in 2023,” said Miftakhov said in a statement. “Both aviation and the financial markets are waking up to the idea that hydrogen is the only meaningful path towards large-scale, zero-emission commercial flight. Powering a 100-seat plane on hydrogen is not out of the question. We feel deeply grateful to our top-tier investors for joining us in the next phase of our exciting journey; to bring in a new golden age of aviation.”</span></p>
<p>The key to the company&#8217;s success is the realization that using existing electrolyzer technologies, natural gas can be converted into hydrogen which can be used to power the aircraft&#8217;s systems, Miftakhov said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We manage fuel supply,&#8221; Miftakhov said. &#8220;We’ve done that already at the airport in Cranfield. We make our own fuel from electricity and water. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are not building new technology in the hydrogen manufacturing space. We’re utilizing partners on the electrolysis side.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The company is working with Enapter to provide the electrolyzer for now, and expects to deploy larger systems at other airfields in the UK and US as part of its ongoing demonstrations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The scale of consumption allows you to economically make fuel on site. That’s the game changer for hydrogen,&#8221; Miftakhov said. &#8220;You don’t have to transport it.. You can’t liquefy it.. You don’t have to worry about transporting it because it’s a low density fuel.. It’s a mess.. If you make it on site all of those challenges go away.. We think infrastructure is going to be fine.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>It was Miftakhov&#8217;s experience building eMotorWerks that led him to explore hydrogen as the solution for the aviation industry. &#8220;Batteries aren&#8217;t energy dense enough for the amount of energy you need for the aircraft,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Aviation is the most energy intensive form of transit&#8230; and you can&#8217;t stop in the middle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, the company will go to market with retrofits for the 10 to 20 seat aircraft in use on short haul flights across Asia and the Caribbean, Miftakhov said.</p>
<p>However, the company has relationships with seven of the biggest aircraft manufacturers in the world who are working on ways to integrate the company&#8217;s powertrains into their aircraft, Miftakhov said, and the company is on track to integrate into large passenger planes like an A320 oer a 737 by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>Transitioning to a hydrogen fleet is going to take more than the technical ability of a new breed of manufacturers though, Miftakhov said. It will also require government intervention.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By 2050 everybody wants to be zero emission and net zero. [But] we are already too late. 2050 is one vehicle lifetime away. The governments are going to come in and say we’re going to force the acceleration of the vehicle generation turnover,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p>Miftakhov wants to be ready when that regulation happens. The company has signed letters of intent with operators to retrofit over 100 aircraft already. And has laid the groundwork for working on new types of aircrafts.</p>
<p>For corporate investors like Amazon who have committed to decarbonize by 2040, the innovations and industry adoption can&#8217;t happen quickly enough.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Amazon created The Climate Pledge Fund to support the development of technologies and services that will enable Amazon and other companies to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement ten years early—achieving net zero carbon by 2040,” said Kara Hurst, VP Worldwide Sustainability, Amazon. “ZeroAvia’s zero-emission aviation powertrain has real potential to help decarbonize the aviation sector, and we hope this investment will further accelerate the pace of innovation to enable zero-emission air transport at scale.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Motional, the Aptiv-Hyundai $4 billion joint venture aimed at commercializing autonomous vehicles, plans to launch in 2023 fully driverless robotaxi services in major U.S. cities using the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lyft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lyft">Lyft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> ride-hailing network.</p>
<p>This is the first time Motional has specified a target date for its robotaxi service. And while Lyft has been a partner with Motional in Las Vegas, this is the first indication that the ride-hailing company will be autonomous vehicle company&#8217;s primary partner in its commercialization plans.</p>
<p>The announcement follows Nevada&#8217;s approval last month to allow Motional to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/motional-gets-approval-to-test-fully-driverless-vehicles-in-las-vegas/">test fully driverless vehicles</a> — without a human safety driver behind the wheel — on public roads in the state.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Motional and Lyft have been partners for three years, a relationship that kicked off with what was supposed to be a weeklong pilot program to offer rides in autonomous vehicles on the Lyft network in Las Vegas during the 2018 CES tech trade show.</p>
<p>This partnership predates the joint venture with Hyundai. At the time, Motional was known as Aptiv Autonomous Mobility Group. That temporary experiment, which has always included a human safety driver, was extended and still exists today. As of February 2020, the program had given more than 100,000 paid self-driving rides in Aptiv’s — now Motional&#8217;s — self-driving vehicles per the Lyft app.</p>
<p>Aptiv’s investment in Las Vegas expanded as those ridership numbers grew. The company opened in December 2018 a 130,000-square-foot technical center in the city to house its fleet of autonomous vehicles, as well as an engineering team dedicated to research and development of software and hardware systems, validation and mapping.</p>
<p>Motional describes today&#8217;s announcement as a &#8220;quantum leap&#8221; for the partnership. The robotaxi services will use next-generation vehicles based on a Hyundai vehicle platform. The vehicles will be integrated with sensors, computers and software to enable fully-driverless operation and remote vehicle assistance. Motional, which today uses BMW 5 Series and Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans, said the fleet will also grow &#8220;significantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The companies didn&#8217;t provide details on which cities it will offer service in or just how big these fleets will be. Motional has testing operations in Boston, Las Vegas and Pittsburgh. Motional did indicate that this robotaxi service partnership with Lyft will extend beyond the initial launch cities. That doesn&#8217;t mean Lyft will be it&#8217;s only partner. Earlier this year, Motional struck a deal with on-demand shuttle company Via to launch a shared robotaxi service for the public in a U.S. city in the first half of 2021. The companies said the aim is to develop a “blueprint” for on-demand shared robotaxis and learn how these driverless vehicles can be integrated into mass transit.</p>
<p>&#8220;This agreement is a testament to our global leadership in driverless technology. We&#8217;re at the frontier of transportation innovation, moving robotaxis from research to road,&#8221; Motional President and CEO Karl Iagnemma, said in a statement. &#8220;Our aim is to not only build safe, reliable, and accessible driverless vehicles, but to deliver them at significant scale. We&#8217;re partnering with Lyft to do exactly that.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Technical manuals and other product content may not be the first things that come to mind when you are thinking of software. But if you&#8217;ve ever found yourself in a pickle or just need some help getting something to work correctly, you know how vital they can be, and also how frustrating it can be if you cannot find what you are looking for.</p>
<p>Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.zoominsoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoomin</a>, which has built a platform that uses AI to help companies get their technical documentation in order, and natural language to help better understand what answers people are looking for, so that those content troves can be used better and across more environments, is announcing that it has raised $21 million, and picked up a strategic investor, as it comes out of stealth.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are focused on product content assets &#8212; manuals, guides, and so on &#8212; the most boring assets at every company,&#8221; Gal Oron, the CEO and co-founder, joked. &#8220;To us, it&#8217;s all gold because this is actually the information customers are looking for.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bessemer Venture Partners, strategic backer Salesforce Ventures and Viola Growth are leading the funding, which actually came in two parts while Zoomin &#8212; founded in Israel but now with operations and its CEO also in New York &#8212; was still under the radar.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have done no PR for the last four years,&#8221; said Gal Oron, who co-founded the company with Joe Gelb and Hannan Saltzman. &#8220;It&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve been very busy developing product and signing our first customers. Now, after having dozens of very big customers and nice traction, we felt like this was the time to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup now counts Imperva, Dell, Automation Anywhere and McAfee among its customers, with the companies using the Zoomin platform to better organise their content into something that can be used by both customer service agents helping people with issues, and by customers themselves if they opt to try the DIY option, wherever they might be seeing information: be it on a website, in a customer forum, over email or chat, or in a piece of software or an app itself.</p>
<p>The challenge that Zoomin is going after goes a little something like this: technical content is a boring yet necessary component for using software and hardware, especially when a user comes up against any kind of hitch.</p>
<p>The issue is that a lot of it has been written in fits and spurts, and often in a way that might not be easy for the average user to access or understand, with no easy and quick way of drilling into the content to find what you are specifically looking for. And a lot of it exists in disparate places and these days, the entry points for where a user might be looking for that information might also be as fragmented as the places where the content lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dell has no way of controlling where you might engage with a product,&#8221; Oron explained. It might be on Dell&#8217;s site, in its software, on a forum, on social media, and so on.</p>
<p>Zoomin aims to provide what Oron describes as a personalised experience for users wherever they may be searching. By that, he means that Zoomin learns what a user is working with, and what that user typically searching for, in order to connect them more quickly with the right answers. In an app, this might take the form of a widget that appears for help. On a forum, it might more likely be by way of an agent who is participating, using Zoomin&#8217;s engine to find the right answers to respond to questions.</p>
<p>For Zoomin, this has so far applied primarily to the world of B2B customer service: its product is used to organise and &#8220;orchestrate&#8221; knowledge for its customers to in turn provide to business/enterprise customers. But Oron notes that it could be just as applicable, and may well see traction over time, with non-business consumers, too, since at the end of the day they are all consumers, he noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We like to think of ourselves as consumerizing the experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to make it as easy as buying on Amazon or browsing Netflix.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wider area of &#8220;knowledge base management&#8221; or knowledge orchestration is often part of a larger customer service play, an unsurprisingly the companies that have products in a similar area include the likes of Zendesk and Hubspot. Other tech companies building solutions to help organise knowledge bases include companies like ProProfs, Helpjuice and Instrktiv.</p>
<p>Salesforce is an interesting strategic investor in that regard: it hasn&#8217;t build something like this itself in its community and service clouds, so Zoomin is a close partner to provide that option. (The startup also integrates with a number of other platforms like Oracle&#8217;s service cloud, Zendesk, Jira, SharePoint and more.)</p>
<p>“Salesforce Ventures supports bold ideas put forward by enterprise cloud companies, so we are thrilled to support Zoomin on their journey to improve how product content is experienced. We believe in the innovative team at Zoomin and their vision of increasing content accessibility,&#8221; added Alex Kayyal, partner and head of Salesforce Ventures International.</p>
<p>Investors are especially interested in the role that a company like Zoomin might be playing these days in particular: with customer service enquiries higher than ever before as more of us are working remotely, it puts a big strain on systems to triage and answer questions. This presents an opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The era of digital transformation has clearly reached product content,” said Amit Karp, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners in a statement. “As technical product content continues to grow exponentially, Zoomin allows enterprises to leverage this content as a strategic asset.”</p>
<p>Zoomin is not disclosing valuation at this stage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SF-based small satellite startup Capella Space is now exclusively offering the most cutting-edge synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery available on the commercial market. The company has now made<a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/capella-unveils-worlds-highest-resolution-commercial-sar-imagery/"> available 50cm x 50cm &#8216;Spot&#8217; imagery</a> – much higher resolution than the previous 1m x 25cm images that were the best available. SAR imagery offers advantages vs. other types of satellite-based observation, because it can operate regardless of cloud cover, air visibility, lighting (whether it&#8217;s day or night) and more.</p>
<p>Capella Space has designed, built and operated its SAR satellites entirely in-house, making it the first U.S. company to do so. Founded and led by former JPL engineer Payam Banazadeh, the company has so far launched one of its satellites to orbit, on a Rocket Lab launch that lifted off at the end of August. The company has plans to launch two more of its spacecraft on board a future SpaceX rideshare launch, potentially before year&#8217;s end.</p>

<p>Currently, Capella&#8217;s commercially available max resolution isn&#8217;t actually event technologically bound – it&#8217;s limited by a maximum set by U.S. regulators about how detailed SAR imagery can be when made available to private sector buyers. Cappella notes that it can sell even better imagery to U.S. government customers, and that it should be able to offer even 25cm x 25cm resolution imagery commercially once &#8220;regulations catch up to technologies.&#8221;</p>
<p>SAR imagery is poised to become a major disruptive shift for space-based Earth imaging, especially as the technology to achieve this level of detail becomes more generally accessible and affordable, enabling startups like Capella to provide it to commercial businesses. It&#8217;s also a rich platform upon which to layer analytics and other types of observation data for detailed insights that simply weren&#8217;t possible with the limitations of optical imaging alone. Obviously, the tech is also very much of interest to national security organizations, and Capella already has contracts in place to show that, aided by its all-American pedigree.</p>
<p>Banazadeh is joining us at our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/">TC Sessions: Space event, which kicks off later today,</a> so we&#8217;ll likely hear more about this new high-resolution imagery and its applications then.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic dry cleaning startup Presso today announced that it has closed a $1.6 million pre-seed with investment from Pathbreaker, AME Cloud Ventures, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sosv" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sosv">SOSV, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> 1517 Fund and YETI Capital. The Atlanta-based startup has developed a kiosk capable of dry cleaning a garment in around five minutes.</p>
<p>Initially focused on business travelers, with plans to install machines in hotel hallways, the COVID-19 pandemic found the startup switching focus &#8212; a fairly common story in 2020. Instead, Presso has shifted much of its efforts to film and TV production. The company says the latest generation of its tech is capable of cleaning/disinfecting up to 150 costumes in a day &#8212; a key demand as many studios have begun to ramp up production, in spite of the continuing pandemic. Netflix, HBO, Apple TV, FOX, Disney and Hulu have all approached the company about its tech.</p>

<p>This latest round brings Presso’s full funding up to $2.2 million, money it plans to spend on scaling up manufacturing, while doubling its headcount over the course of the next six or so months. I’d expect the team will also refocus some of its efforts on earlier models &#8212; like hotel delivery &#8212; once travel ramps up again in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/16/girls-death-contributed-to-by-air-pollution-coroner-rules-in-landmark-case?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">Today</a>, the acute asthma attack of primary school-aged girl in February 2013 was ruled by a UK court to be due to air pollution. It is thought to be the first ruling of its kind in the world. Only a year after Ella Kissi-Debrah died, another mother also became concerned about the effects of air quality on her daughter’s asthma and decided to do something about it.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/yoditstanton?lang=en">Yodit Stanton</a> has secured $4m in seed funding for her air monitoring startup <a href="https://www.opensensors.com/">OpenSensors</a>, in a Seed round led by <a href="https://crane.vc/">Crane Venture Partners</a> and other unnamed investors. The startup previously bootstrapped the company prior to the round, supported by customer revenues.</p>
<p>OpenSensors, uses sensors to monitor air quality and light intensity, but it&#8217;s the data platform that is the real &#8216;special source&#8217;. The startup&#8217;s technology works to reveal workplace and workforce conditions and patterns. It competes with companies like Condecco and Workplace Fabric, but takes a more &#8216;360 degree&#8217; approach.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It now has more than 30 customers with complex real estate operations across North America, Ireland, UK and Europe, in industries such as Insurance, Finance, Tech and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087898" style="width: 567px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087898" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Photo-note.jpg" alt="OpenSensors" width="557" height="474" class="size-full wp-image-2087898" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Photo-note.jpg 557w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Photo-note.jpg?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Photo-note.jpg?resize=300,255 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Photo-note.jpg?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087898" class="wp-caption-text">OpenSensors</p></div></p>
<p>Building costs are the 2nd highest expense for organizations, with office costs over £20bn per year in the UK, but even in normal, pre-pandemic times, half of that office space is unused at any point during the day and only reaches 55% peak utilization. Buildings also represent 36% of global energy usage &amp; 39% of CO2 emissions. OpenSensors tracks humidity, CO2 levels, and more to guide on the optimal capacity to reduce viral transmission, thus enabling companies to return their workforces to offices safely.</p>
<p>Stanton commented: “How we work and live are changing faster than we could have ever anticipated. There is a real opportunity for humanity to rethink how we use the physical world with sustainability in mind as well as making the design of workplaces better for people using them.”</p>
<p>Scott Sage, Partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/crane-venture-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="crane-venture-partners">Crane Venture Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said: “With data insights, real-world usage and known customer references, OpenSensors has all the ingredients to become a trusted advisor and solutions provider throughout COVID-19 and the immediate recovery, as well as supporting the shift towards more flexible working that COVID-19 has accelerated.”</p>
<p>Speaking exclusively to TechCrunch, Stanton, who also founded and runs the UK&#8217;s <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Women-Crunching-Data/">Women In Data</a> event, said: “Initially it just started as a fun hobby project. I was playing around with IoT as in my daughter has asthma, so I was monitoring air quality up in our neighborhood to try to see if I can correlate the particulates spikes and so forth with her asthma attacks. I released it as a project for my community to monitor air quality. But it became, I guess a real thing when people asked if I could manage their buildings.”</p>
<p>She said that low humidity encourages virus transmission: &#8220;So you really have to aim for around 40% humidity within an indoor environment and dry air also affects your immune system as an individual.&#8221;</p>
<p>This means that monitoring air quality has become a huge issue for companies. So it unsurprising that VCs are now backing air-quality startups like OpenSensors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pia d’Iribarne, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/stride-vc-loses-partner-pia-diribarne/">formerly of  Accel and Stride</a>, is heading up a new European early stage venture capital firm co-founded with French entrepreneur and investor Xavier Niel, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>Dubbed <a href="https://www.newwave.vc/">New Wave</a>, its debut fund of $56 million was raised in just 3 months and has already begun making investments. It is said to be targeting seed and pre-seed startups across Europe but also European founders further afield.</p>
<p>Cheque sizes will be between €500,000 and €2 million, with New Wave both leading and co-investing in rounds in what I’ve been told will be a “collaborative” approach, investing alongside and playing nicely with Europe’s business angels and other seed firms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I reached out to d’Iribarne and she confirmed the fund size and that New Wave is open for business but declined to comment further.</p>
<p>D’Iribarne is taking the role of managing partner of New Wave and is also a co-founder of the new firm. Working with her on investments is New Wave partner and co-founder Jean de La Rochebrochard, who will also continue running Kima Ventures, the angel investment vehicle of Xavier Niel.</p>
<p>D’Iribarne, who is half French and half Dutch and splits her time between London and Paris, was most recently a partner at Stride where she is said to have led the investments in Strapi, Impala, and Jow. Before that she was at Accel where she invested in Doctolib, Framer, Payfit, Selency and Shift Technology. She started her career at McKinsey &amp; Company.</p>
<p>French-born De La Rochebrochard has been running Niel’s venture arm for five years and has invested in close to 500 companies at seed stage. He has also been involved through larger commitments in Zenly, Payfit, Dice, Ibanfirst, Nabla, Alan, Impala and Openclassrooms.  He is a former partner at The Family.</p>
<p>In addition to Niel, d’Iribarne, and de La Rochebrochard, New Wave’s other co-founders are Antoine Martin (co-founder and CEO of Zenly, and a prolific angel investor), and Alex Yazdi (founder of Voodoo, and experienced angel investor).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as well as Niel, the billionaire founder of French telecoms giant Iliad (Free) and most recently the founder of Station F, sources tell me that New Wave has attracted a number of other high profile LPs, including Yuri Milner of DST, Peter Fenton from Benchmark, Philippe Laffont from Coatue, and Tony Fadell of Nest and Apple fame.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">StockX today announced its Series E funding led by Tiger Global. The $275 million funding round values the company at $2.8 billion at a post-money valuation. The company intends to use the cash to accelerate global expansion, product development, and to expand StockX&#8217;s categories. Rumors are swirling that this financing will allow the company to offer an initial public offering in 2021.</p>
<p>Tiger Global Management led the round with participation from Altimeter Capital, Sands Capital, and Whale Rock Capital Management.</p>
<p>“The quality of investors joining us is a clear signal that the market recognizes that there is incredible opportunity in e-commerce for current culture products and StockX is best positioned to meet consumer demand for those products,” said StockX CEO Scott Cutler in a released statement. “I’m thrilled to welcome our new partners to the team — their collective expertise will be invaluable as we continue to build on the momentum from the last year, and drive the growth to cement StockX’s position as the global marketplace leader.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Headquartered in downtown Detroit, Michigan, the raise marks the largest VC funding round in Michigan history. This round brings StockX&#8217;s total amount raised to $490 million.</p>
<p>StockX is seeing blockbuster growth. Since launching in 2016, the company recorded sales in 200 countries through 13 million transactions &#8212; 50% of those coming within the last 12 months. In June the company surpassed $2.5 billion in lifetime gross merchandise value. International growth is quickly growing, too, with Q3 2020 non-US trades increasing 260% over 2019 levels.</p>
<p>During the most recent quarter, the company averaged 25 million visitors per month.</p>
<p>Just prior to the Covid-19 shutdown, CEO Cutler <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/27/as-the-u-s-shuts-down-stockxs-business-is-booming-says-its-ceo/">said the impending virus was looking to be great</a> for his company. At the time he spoke about how having facilities in different regions would allow the company to better navigate shutdowns. In April, few weeks later, StockX laid off 100 people at the height of the shutdown. Shortly after the company&#8217;s outlook changed as the results speak for themselves.</p>
<p>The company opened new authentication facilities in 2020 resulting in a 50% increase of the company&#8217;s global footprint. Earlier in the year, the company opened an authentication facility in Portland, Oregon. Like other authentication centers, this location is a go-between buyers and sellers where StockX employees authenticate the products purchased and sold on the marketplace. Last month, the company opened similar facilities in Toronto and Hong Kong as it expands into key international markets.</p>
<p>StockX is targeting the Asian-Pacific market. The company opened an office in Tokyo in 2019 and a localized experience in 2020. Last month, StockX stated sell-side transactions across the region increased 500% over 2019 levels and up 1000% in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>StockX originally launched as a marketplace for sneakers where the value of the products are determined by supply and demand. Now, in 2020, the company offers the same pricing system but in more categories including streetwear, luxury good, collectables, and even hot electronics like the new PS5 and Xbox Series X. The company expects to keep expanding, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is to follow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/googles-new-tcs-include-a-brexit-easter-egg-for-uk-users/">Google&#8217;s lead</a> and move millions of UK users out of the jurisdiction of EU privacy laws to the US (which has no such comprehensive data protection framework) next year under a looming Brexit-related change to its T&amp;Cs, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-facebook-exclusive/exclusive-facebook-to-move-uk-users-to-california-terms-avoiding-eu-privacy-rules-idUSKBN28P2HH">Reuters</a> reported yesterday.</p>
<p>Confirming the switch, Facebook told the news agency: “Like other companies, Facebook has had to make changes to respond to Brexit and will be transferring legal responsibilities and obligations for UK users from Facebook Ireland to Facebook Inc.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be no change to the privacy controls or the services Facebook offers to people in the UK,&#8221; Facebook added, using phrasing that elides the fact that the switch from the EU to the US inevitably involves a radical downgrading in legal protection for data and privacy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Per Reuters, Facebook will inform users of the switch within the next six months &#8212; giving them the &#8216;option&#8217; to stop using Facebook&#8217;s services (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) if they&#8217;re unhappy with the legal switch.</p>
<p>As we reported in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/googles-new-tcs-include-a-brexit-easter-egg-for-uk-users/">February</a> when Google announced a similar legal migration for UK users, shifting them from its EU subsidiary to the US, the move is a consequence of the UK&#8217;s vote to leave the European Union &#8212; which moves it away from EU standards, including its long-standing data protection framework.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9xMRct24O7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/googles-new-tcs-include-a-brexit-easter-egg-for-uk-users/">Google&#8217;s new T&#038;Cs include a Brexit &#8216;Easter egg&#8217; for UK users</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google&#8217;s new T&#038;Cs include a Brexit &#8216;Easter egg&#8217; for UK users&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/googles-new-tcs-include-a-brexit-easter-egg-for-uk-users/embed/#?secret=9xMRct24O7" data-secret="9xMRct24O7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now, with just days before the end of the brexit transition period, it&#8217;s still not clear whether the UK will get a trade deal with the EU or leave with no deal &#8212; the latter ramping up the possibility the UK will <em>also</em> not get a data adequacy agreement from the EU, arguably making future divergence on data protection standards more likely (since there will be no &#8216;carrot&#8217; of continued friction-free EU-UK data flows to encourage continued alignment).</p>
<p>The UK has also signalled it wants a data-fuelled levelling up of the economic, publishing a National Data Strategy in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/uk-wants-pandemic-levels-of-data-sharing-to-be-the-new-normal/">September</a> that talks about making pandemic levels of data-sharing the new normal.</p>
<p>The document threw shade at the entire concept of data protection &#8212; saying the government plans to &#8220;promote domestic best practice and work with international partners to ensure data is not inappropriately constrained by national borders and fragmented regulatory regimes so that it can be used to its full potential&#8221;.</p>
<p>Since then privacy experts have <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/parliament-must-act-before-its-too-late/">expressed concern</a> that clauses in a UK-Japan (post-brexit) trade deal are weakening the UK&#8217;s existing data protection regime (which is, for now, based on transposed EU standards) &#8212; and could allow for flows of citizens&#8217; data to nations with &#8220;weak or voluntary data protection arrangements&#8221;, as the <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/commons-committee-spells-out-japan-deal-digital-risks/">Open Rights Group</a> warned last month.</p>
<p>The US is one such nation that lacks a comprehensive framework for data protection. Though California has passed its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/01/the-california-consumer-privacy-act-officially-takes-effect-today/">consumer privacy law</a> and residents voted in November to strengthen the regime. But at the federal level there&#8217;s no GDPR equivalent &#8212; yet.</p>
<p>With so much uncertainty on where exactly the UK is headed on standards post-brexit, it&#8217;s little wonder tech giants like Google and Facebook are taking the opportunity to shrink their liability under EU privacy rules &#8212; by removing the 45M+ UK users from its Dublin subsidiary&#8217;s jurisdiction, in Facebook&#8217;s case.</p>
<p>The recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Schrems II judgement</a> by Europe&#8217;s top court has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">ramped up legal risk and uncertainty</a> over EU to US transfers of personal data, giving Facebook another potential reason to rework its UK T&amp;Cs.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="87znKDJwp8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">Europe puts out advice on fixing international data transfers that&#8217;s cold comfort for Facebook</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe puts out advice on fixing international data transfers that&#8217;s cold comfort for Facebook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/embed/#?secret=87znKDJwp8" data-secret="87znKDJwp8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s not so great for UK users, given the privacy protections they&#8217;re losing.</p>
<p>But this time that&#8217;s more on brexit than big tech. And in this case brexit means that from next year UK users are going to have to hope their own government doesn&#8217;t decide to junk national privacy standards in its bid to ink trade deals with countries like the US, while trusting that Facebook (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/a-brief-history-of-facebooks-privacy-hostility-ahead-of-zuckerbergs-testimony/">er!</a>) will look out for their privacy interests.</p>
<p>Yes UK data protection law will continue to apply. (Though <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/">good luck</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">getting the ICO to stand up</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/adtech-told-to-keep-calm-and-fix-its-lawfulness-problem/">for your rights</a>.)</p>
<p>But the overarching guarantee of standards provided for by EU law is going in 2021.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/22/cloud-act-omnibus-bill-house/">US Cloud Act</a>, which was passed in 2018, already makes it easier for data on Internet services users to be passed between UK and US agencies for investigative purposes, for example.</p>
<p>While the UK government has a worrying record on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/yes-the-uk-now-has-a-law-to-log-web-users-browsing-behavior-hack-devices-and-limit-encryption/">mass surveillance</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/we-want-to-limit-use-of-e2e-encryption-confirms-uk-minister/">attacks on encryption</a>.</p>
<p>Its new &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/">child-safety-focused</a>&#8216; plan to regulate Internet services also looks set to apply pressure on digital services not to use strong encryption to allow for mandatory content monitoring and other types of identity checks.</p>
<p>So, tl;dr, brexit is shaping up to mean the opposite of taking back control in the data sphere &#8212; with less privacy and reduce online freedom speeding down the pipe for Brits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in 2018, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pinduoduo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pinduoduo">Pinduoduo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sent shock waves through the investor community when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/05/pinduoduo-is-raising-over-1-billion/">raised $1.6 billion</a> from a Nasdaq listing as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/the-incredible-rise-of-pinduoduo/">three-year-old company</a>. Online shoppers in China were excited to see its rise as an alternative to long-time market dominators Alibaba and JD.com.</p>
<p>But the startup founded by former Google engineer Colin Huang has ambitions well beyond e-commerce. It&#8217;s answering the Chinese government&#8217;s call to modernize the country&#8217;s agriculture and bolster the rural economy.</p>
<p>Life in China has become highly digital in many facets, from retail and entertainment to education and healthcare. But agriculture remains an exception. A McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Technology%20Media%20and%20Telecommunications/High%20Tech/Our%20Insights/Digital%20China%20Powering%20the%20economy%20to%20global%20competitiveness/MGI_Digital-China_Executive-summary_Dec-2017.pdf">report</a> from late 2017 showed that agriculture was among the least digitized industries in China. Pinduoduo saw an opportunity in the gap and started life by selling fruits online. Over time it has grown into a comprehensive e-commerce platform rivaling Alibaba, but agriculture &#8220;has always been close to the heart of Pinduoduo since its inception,&#8221; said Pinduoduo&#8217;s senior vice president Andre Zhu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Investing in smart agriculture is an extension of what we do and guided by our goal of promoting digital inclusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of a standalone department, the firm&#8217;s agricultural endeavor is a company- and even society-wide effort. Its strategy and investment team takes the lead to identify solutions targeting all stages of agriculture that the company can help scale up. At the implementation stage, the team might then tap its operational colleagues for contacts at various local governments and traditional farms that want to try the technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least on the downstream distribution side, on e-commerce marketplaces for agricultural products, I would say we are relatively ahead compared to the rest of the world,&#8221; Xin Yi Lim, executive director of sustainability and agriculture impact at Pinduoduo, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>In 2019, nearly 600,000 merchants sold farm produce through Pinduoduo. That translated to some 12 million farmers who supplied their fruits and vegetables to the merchants. In August, Pinduoduo pledged to sell <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/pinduoduo-145-billion-farm-produce-2025/">$145 billion worth of farm produce</a> annually by 2025. The number was $21 billion in 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s really the upstream portion that we&#8217;re hoping to encourage and drive further investment in,&#8221; Lim added.</p>
<p>As such, the e-commerce giant has been traveling up the agricultural lifecycle, from building logistics infrastructure for distribution to equipping farmers with marketing know-how. In 2019, it trained close to 500,000 farm operators through its <a href="https://mms.pinduoduo.com/daxue/home">online e-commerce business institute</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087849" style="width: 666px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087849" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087849" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinduoduo-farmers.jpg" alt="" width="656" height="438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinduoduo-farmers.jpg 656w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinduoduo-farmers.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinduoduo-farmers.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinduoduo-farmers.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087849" class="wp-caption-text">Farmers in Yunnan Province learn how to open and operate a store on Pinduoduo at the Duo Duo University. / Photo: <a href="https://investor.pinduoduo.com/corporate-blog/pinduoduos-ai-driven-duo-duo-farm-empowers-farmers-helping">Pinduoduo</a></p></div></p>
<p>When it comes to production, Pinduoduo is able to track purchase behavior from its hundreds of millions of buyers and tell farmers what they should plant and how much they should price their products, an approach in line with the firm&#8217;s larger direct-to-consumer strategy to cut traditional middlemen costs.</p>
<p>The e-commerce firm is also hoping to gather agronomic expertise for its farm suppliers. It kickstarted a <a href="https://smartagricompetition.com/en/information">smart farming competition</a> this year, calling teams from around the world to grow strawberries using artificial intelligence and connected devices. They were graded on criteria such as the fruit&#8217;s sweetness, energy and fertilizer use, and their AI strategy. The winner&#8217;s design would then be rolled out at one of the AI-powered <a href="https://investor.pinduoduo.com/corporate-blog/pinduoduos-ai-driven-duo-duo-farm-empowers-farmers-helping">Duo Duo Farms</a>, a project jointly launched by Pinduoduo and the provincial government of Yunnan to let farmers sell directly on the e-commerce platform.</p>
<p>These examples are just the tip of the iceberg of Pinduoduo&#8217;s agricultural long game. The firm doesn&#8217;t disclose exactly how much it plans to <a href="https://investor.pinduoduo.com/news-releases/news-release-details/pinduoduo-raises-funds-invest-key-opportunities-agriculture">invest in the field</a>, though Lim said &#8220;compared to some of the other players in the industry, our involvement in agriculture is definitely more comprehensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company looks for investment opportunities outside China as well. While domestic players come with more affordable hardware applications, especially drones and sensors, more mature solutions around crop modeling and prediction are found in Western countries where large commercial farms prevail, Lim noted.</p>
<p>Agritech adoption among Pinduoduo farmers is still &#8220;relatively small&#8221; because the firm&#8217;s smart farming initiative is in the early stage. But the e-commerce upstart might be well-positioned to drive the development of agritech in China.</p>
<p>Different from the U.S. and Australia, China is dominated by small-scale farms that often can&#8217;t afford to buy advanced farming equipment. Lacking demand, agritech startups have had difficulty fundraising to subsequently invest in customer acquisition and lowering their price point, Lim explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pinduoduo can already connect [agritech startups] with a wide pool of potential customers. I think that helps to ease a little bit of the initial pain point,&#8221; said Lim.</p>
<p>Finally, injecting technologies into farming could help retain talent in China&#8217;s vast rural hinterland, which is losing young labor to bigger, more affluent cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the long term, we [could] make farming more efficient and easier. There could potentially be a transformation in the whole structure of the farming industry. We could see young people feel that &#8216;I can actually be an entrepreneur. There are these tools that can give me more control over the output,'&#8221; Lim suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are potentially people who today are not farmers who could then start to see farming as a viable alternative.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yet more trouble brewing for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook: <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Australia&#8217;s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is suing the tech giant over its use, in 2016 and 2017, of the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/onavo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="onavo">Onavo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> VPN app to spy on users for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>The ACCC&#8217;s case accuses Facebook of false, misleading or deceptive conduct toward thousands of Australian consumers, after it had promoted the Onavo Protect app &#8212; saying it would keep users personal activity data private, protected and secret and not use it for any other purpose, when it was being used to gather data to help Facebook&#8217;s business.</p>
<p>“Through Onavo Protect, Facebook was collecting and using the very detailed and valuable personal activity data of thousands of Australian consumers for its own commercial purposes, which we believe is completely contrary to the promise of protection, secrecy and privacy that was central to Facebook’s promotion of this app,” said ACCC chair Rod Sims in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Consumers often use VPN services because they care about their online privacy, and that is what this Facebook product claimed to offer. In fact, Onavo Protect channelled significant volumes of their personal activity data straight back to Facebook.”</p>
<p>“We believe that the conduct deprived Australian consumers of the opportunity to make an informed choice about the collection and use of their personal activity data by Facebook and Onavo,” Sims added.</p>
<p>The ACCC alleges that between February 1, 2016 to October 2017, Facebook and its subsidiaries Facebook Israel Ltd and Onavo, Inc. misled Australian consumers by misrepresenting the function of the free-to-download Onavo Protect app.</p>
<p>The regulator says it&#8217;s seeking declarations and pecuniary penalties.</p>
<p>Reached for comment on the suit, a Facebook spokeswoman said: <i>“</i>When people downloaded <span class="il">Onavo</span> Protect, we were always clear about the information we collect and how it is used.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve cooperated with the ACCC’s investigation into this matter to date. We will review the recent filing by the ACCC and will continue to defend our position in response to this recent filing,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Facebook announced last year that it would shut the Onavo Protect app &#8212; after a backlash over how it had used the VPN app which it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/13/facebook-buys-mobile-analytics-company-onavo-and-finally-gets-its-office-in-israel/">back in 2013</a> to snoop on users.</p>

<p>Data gleaned via Onavo revealed WhatsApp to be a competitive threat to Facebook&#8217;s Messenger app. Shortly after gaining this market insight Facebook shelled out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-buying-whatsapp-for-16b-in-cash-and-stock-plus-3b-in-rsus/">$19BN to acquire the rival messaging app</a>.</p>
<p>The tech giant is now facing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">a massive antitrust case on home soil</a>, where earlier this month 46 states accused it of suppressing competition through monopolistic business practices &#8212; with the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp cited as prominent examples.</p>
<p>The FTC and US lawmakers are calling for the unwinding of those mergers and the breaking up of Facebook&#8217;s social empire as a necessity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is working to bring back the Instagram Lite app, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/instagram-lite-shuts-down-in-advance-of-a-relaunch/">months after it shut down</a> the light version offering worldwide.</p>
<p>The social conglomerate said on Wednesday that it is testing the revamped <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Lite app in India, where it hopes to “gain valuable insights” about the new offering before “a global rollout” of the app later.</p>
<p>The revamped Instagram Lite app weighs less than 2MB and delivers a “fast, reliable, and responsive” experience of the social service. The Android app supports Bangla, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu, but currently lacks a several core features of Instagram including Reels, Shopping and IGTV.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook quietly discontinued the previous iteration of Instagram Lite earlier this year. In July, Vishal Shah, VP of Product at Instagram, told TechCrunch that the company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/facebook-expands-instagram-reels-to-india/">identified some issues in the app</a> and was working to resolve those. In September, a new Lite app was <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/16/instagram-lite-is-back-and-barely-changed-after-a-4-month-hiatus-apk-download/">spotted in the wild</a>, though Facebook did not acknowledge it.</p>
<p>Lite apps are especially popular in emerging markets where most users don&#8217;t have access to high-end smartphones or fast and cheap mobile internet data. Facebook Lite app, for instance, had about 40 million monthly active users in India last month, while Messenger Lite app had about 13 million, according to mobile insight firm App Annie, data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch. (Instagram app had about 164 million users.)</p>
<p>Shah made the announcement about the revamped Instagram Lite app at Facebook Fuel for India event on Wednesday, where scores of Facebook executives including Mark Zuckerberg and Ajit Mohan outlined a number of other programs they were working on for the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Instagram also announced the second version of ‘Born on Instagram,’ a one-year-old program it has built for content creators to better understand and leverage ways to collaborate with one another and explore monetization opportunities.</p>
<p>“With the test of Instagram Lite, and the next edition of Born on Instagram, we’re aiming to democratize expression and creativity for a greater number of people in India,” said Shah.</p>
<p>At the event, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whatsapp">WhatsApp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> India head Abhijit Bose said that the company was working to launch sachet-sized health insurance offering to users in India this month. In July, WhatsApp had unveiled that it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/whatsapp-to-pilot-projects-to-deliver-credit-insurance-and-pension-to-users-in-india/">working to pilot credit, insurance, and pension services</a> in India, the instant messaging app&#8217;s biggest market by users, over the next year and a half.</p>
<p>&#8220;WhatsApp has proactively been working on several pilots to help ensure that every adult has access to the most basic critical financial and livelihood services through their mobile device. By the end of this year, we expect that people will be able to buy affordable sachet sized health insurance through WhatsApp,&#8221; Bose said today. For insurance protection, WhatsApp has partnered with SBI General, and for pension, with HDFC Pension.</p>
<p>Facebook, which identifies India as its biggest market by users, is also working with telecom giant Jio Platforms to help tens of millions of small businesses establish online presence and sell digitally. The American giant, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/">invested $5.7 billion in Jio Platforms this year</a>, are collaborating to make Jio Platforms’ JioMart e-commerce service available through WhatsApp. Some new features are coming to JioMart’s WhatsApp channel in the “coming days,” Facebook and Reliance executives teased today.</p>

<p>Logistics is one of the biggest challenges in e-commerce, especially for smaller merchants. <a href="https://hk.pickupp.io/">Pickupp</a> helps them compete in the on-demand economy with flexible, customizable delivery services. Based in Hong Kong, Pickupp also operates in Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan, and claims it can save clients an average of about 28% in logistic costs.</p>
<p>Pickupp is able to do this with an asset-light business model. Instead of operating warehouses or its own fleets, it partners with logistics companies and uses proprietary software to make delivering batches of orders more efficient.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company, which currently serves about 10,000 e-commerce merchants, announced last month it closed an undisclosed amount in Series A funding from Vision Plus Capital, Alibaba Enterpreneurs Fund, Cyperport Macro Fund, Swire Properties New Ventures and SparkLabs Taipei.</p>
<p>Pickupp currently offers three kinds of door-to-door delivery services: on-demand couriers who deliver within a four hour window, same day deliveries, and one to three day deliveries. It can also customize logistics and last-minute delivery solutions for businesses.</p>
<p>In Singapore, Pickupp runs its own e-commerce platform. Called Shop On Pickupp, the platform enables merchants to move more of their retail operations online and has been used to digitize marketplaces like the Shilin Singapore Night Market during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Before starting Pickupp, co-founder and chief executive officer Crystal Pang, a software engineer by training, was part of the team that launched Uber in Hong Kong in 2014.</p>
<p>&#8220;Around that time, I started looking into logistics, because I found out a lot of merchants were trying to use Uber cars to deliver other stuff, anything but people,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But unlike delivery services, merchants couldn’t bargain with Uber drivers—for example, negotiating discounted fees if they were able to wait longer for a vehicle. &#8220;That’s the gist of logistics, because everyone wants to get part of those cost savings,&#8221; Pang said. Sensing a market opportunity, Pang began using her software engineering background to think of a solution.</p>
<p>Pickupp was founded in December 2016 and began operating the next year. When it launched, Pickupp already had formidable rivals like Gogovan and Lalamove. But since those companies focused mainly on on-demand, point-to-point delivery, Pang saw an opportunity to tackle other parts of the supply chain.</p>
<p>&#8220;How we see ourselves compared to other logistics companies is that we fulfill all these e-commerce needs. We behave like a logistics company, but we don’t need to own anything. So we perform the function of a traditional logistics company, which in this area is SF Express or Ninja Van, that lease warehouses and operate their own fleets, but Pickupp choses a lightweight asset approach to getting it done,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Pickupp positions itself more as a data and tech company, Pang added.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can almost imagine us as a monitoring system,&#8221; she said. Pickupp partners with sorting facilities, cross-border freight forwarders and delivery vehicles, and gives merchants visibility into where orders are along the supply chain.</p>
<p>Its system keeps costs down by predicting when and where available delivery people will be available, so it can match them with batches of orders. This also prevents bottlenecks during demand spikes and makes sure couriers are used at the most capacity possible, which is especially important for holidays and major shopping events like Double Eleven and Black Friday.</p>
<p>One of Pickupp’s advantages is that its system is designed to be flexible so it can scale into new Asian markets quickly. Pang told TechCrunch that the round will be used to add more services, and invest in machine learning, predictive analytics and understanding customer purchasing behavior. The company also plans to expand into up to five new Asian markets over the next three years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.messagebird.com/">MessageBird</a>, the omnichannel cloud communications platform recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/messagebird-series-c/">valued at $3 billion</a> following a Series C round in October, has acquired London-based real-time web technologies company Pusher.</p>
<p>The acquisition price is $35 million, and sees <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pusher" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pusher">Pusher <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> co-founder and CEO Max Williams and the 25-person Pusher team join Amsterdam-headquartered <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/messagebird" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="messagebird">MessageBird <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. (In 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/24/real-time-developer-tool-startup-pusher-pulls-in-8m-in-series-a-funding/">Pusher told TechCrunch it had a team of 60</a>, so there has obviously been some cost-cutting in recent years.)</p>
<p>The Pusher product will be kept independent for existing customers, while Pusher&#8217;s tech, with its focus on in-app notifications and a developer-friendly API and SDKs built around &#8220;push,&#8221; will help plug a gap in MessageBird&#8217;s own communication platform, which is stronger in SMS and messaging-first channels such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Line and WeChat, etc. Specifically, Pusher is said to bring features like in-app messaging, push notifications and location tracking.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The deal opens up a host of new tools and features that will help MessageBird’s customers talk to their customers in even more ways than before,&#8221; says MessageBird.</p>
<p>Founded in 2011, Pusher aimed to lower the barriers for developers who want to build real-time features into their websites and apps. This was originally delivered via a general purpose real-time API and supporting cloud infrastructure, enabling app developers to more easily build things like rich push notifications, live content updates and various real-time collaboration and communication features.</p>
<p>However, more recently the company had begun rolling out additional offerings dedicated to specific real-time functionality. The first of those was Chatkit, an API and SDK intended to do a lot of the heavy lifting required to add chat functionality to an app or service. This has since been extended to also include charts and location tracking/maps. Pusher customers include GitHub, Mailchimp, CodeShip and The Financial Times.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, MessageBird was originally seen as a European or “rest of the world” competitor to U.S.-based Twilio — offering a cloud communications platform that supports voice, video and text capabilities all wrapped up in an API — but has since repositioned itself as an “Omnichannel Platform-as-a-Service” (OPaaS). The idea is to easily enable enterprises and medium and smaller-sized companies to communicate with customers on any channel of their choosing.</p>
<p>Out of the box, this includes support for WhatsApp, Messenger, WeChat, Twitter, Line, Telegram, SMS, email and voice. Customers can start online and then move their support request or query over to a more convenient channel, such as their favourite mobile messaging app, which, of course, can go with them. It’s all part of MessageBird founder and CEO Robert Vis’ big bet that the future of customer interactions is omnichannel.</p>
<p>Therefore the acquisition of Pusher looks like a good fit, overall. London and Amsterdam are close geographically and with similar time zones, while MessageBird is transforming into a remote-first company anyway. There is also arguably enough product overlap but also genuine gaps to make the pairing a no-brainer.</p>
<p>In a short call with MessageBird CEO and founder Robert Vis, he talked up Pusher’s tech and team and pressed home his belief that it is important that startups exiting find a “good home,” rather than simply being acquired and then disappearing without a trace. Likewise, if MessageBird wants to be truly omnichannel, a really good “push” API and product suite is needed. The next decision was then whether or not to acquire or build, and, in this instance, teaming up with Pusher was deemed the best way forward.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vis advised me to expect a lot more M&amp;A in the omnichannel and messaging platform space. Not just from MessageBird as it heads toward a potential IPO, but also from competitors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the midst of a major second wave of coronavirus infections across Europe, an Estonian startup that&#8217;s building an on-demand network to move food and people around in cars, on scooters and (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/bolt-launches-electric-bike-sharing-service-in-paris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most recently</a>) bikes across developed and emerging markets in EMEA is announcing a major round of funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://bolt.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bolt</a>, which covers 200 cities in 40 countries with its delivery and transportation services, has raised €150 million ($182 million at current rates) in an equity round that CEO and co-founder Markus Villig said in an interview will be used to double down on geographic expansion and to help it become the biggest provider of electric scooters in Europe.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mtakso" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mtakso">Bolt <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> currently has some 50 million customers using its services, and Villig has built the business around two main areas to differentiate it from the Ubers of the world: strong capital efficiency (or &#8220;frugality&#8221; as he describes it) and putting a heavy emphasis on services for emerging markets, alongside launches in cities like London and Paris and, soon, Berlin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This round was the first time we raised with most of the previous round still in the bank, despite the pressures of Covid&#8221; he said. &#8220;This shows the frugality of the company. Due to lockdowns, we were not as aggressive as we would have liked to be, so financially we are now in a very good position for 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>The round is being led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/d1-capital-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="d1-capital-partners">D1 Capital Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation also from Darsana Capital Partners. D1 has this year been a huge player in growth rounds for some of the very biggest startups: it has made investments in eyewear giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/warby-parker-valued-at-3-billion-raises-245-million-in-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warby Parker</a>, gaming engine maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/unity-now-valued-at-6b-raising-up-to-525m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unity</a>, car sales portal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/cazoo-the-uk-used-car-sales-portal-raises-another-311m-now-valued-at-over-2b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cazoo</a>, and fintech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/transferwise-five-unicorns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TransferWise</a>, collectively with valuations into the multiple billions of dollars.</p>
<p>On that note, Villig wouldn&#8217;t disclose what Bolt&#8217;s valuation is but said that it was closer to the multiples of 1.5x on gross merchandise value (GMV: the total figure transacted on Bolt&#8217;s platform), <em>a la</em> the recently listed DoorDash, than it is closer to &#8220;others&#8221; in the transport space that are seeing valuations closer to 0.5x GMV.</p>
<p>He also confirmed to me that Bolt is doing about €2 billion in GMV currently annually, which would give it a valuation, by his hinted calculations, of €3.5 billion ($4.3 billion). No comment from Villig on my number crunching, but he also didn&#8217;t dispute it.</p>
<p>For some context,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/bolt-the-european-on-demand-transport-company-raises-109m-on-a-1-9b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> in May of this year</a> Bolt was valued at $1.9 billion after raising just over $100 million. At the time, it said it had 30 million users, so it&#8217;s added 20 million in about six months.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s rise has been an interesting counterpoint to the likes of Uber, which built its business with early, aggressive &#8212; and as it turned out, very costly &#8212; growth into multiple markets and product areas, a number of which it has more recently been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">divesting</a> (see also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/uber-sells-air-taxi-business-elevate-to-joby-aviation-shedding-its-last-moonshot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/uber-sells-500m-stake-in-its-freight-business-as-the-ride-hailing-giant-works-to-conserve-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/uber-global-exits-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for other examples).</p>
<p>Founded originally as Taxify and slowly growing the business just around ride-hailing for a number of years in less-scrutinized emerging markets, the company rebranded in 2019 as it kicked its strategy into a higher gear, with launches in cities like London and a move into micro-mobility, primarily around electric scooters. Its current list of biggest markets reflects that mix: Villig said they were the UK, France, South Africa and Nigeria.</p>
<p>Not all of that has been smooth, with too-aggressive moves, such as a <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/taxify-stop-london-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">failed initial launch in London</a> &#8212; scuppered when regulators quickly responded to its attempt to exploit a loophole to get a license &#8212; quickly burning the company (and possibly teaching Villig a lesson he&#8217;s tried to remember going forward).</p>
<p>Even with the shift, Villig said that his aim is to keep the company operating on the same frugal ethos when it comes to considering new investments and how to grow. And that gives a potentially different cast to news of, say, Bolt rolling out <a href="https://blog.bolt.eu/en/bolt-launches-new-fourth-generation-scooter-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newer scooter models</a>, or <a href="https://blog.bolt.eu/en/climate-positive-by-the-end-of-2020-the-bolt-e-scooter-sustainability-pledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commitments</a> to carbon reduction.</p>
<p>He noted that in a year that has seen so many job losses, particularly in businesses that have seen massive drops in users and usage, Bolt has not laid off anyone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting, indeed, to see how and which companies choose to &#8220;zig&#8221; while others &#8220;zag&#8221; at the moment.</p>
<p>The food delivery business is a case in point. We are seeing a number of consolidations underway, with Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquiring Postmates</a>, and Just Eat Takeaway (itself a big <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/justeat-takeaway-7-6b-merger-approved-pair-pick-up-756m-in-new-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">merger</a>) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/just-eat-takeaway-confirms-its-gobbling-up-grubhub-in-a-7-3b-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquiring Grubhub</a>. Alongside that there have also been a number of closures of smaller players that found it too costly to try to scale. Within that context, Bolt is doubling down on food delivery, with Bolt Food in 16 countries and 33 cities and plans for more cities in the coming year.</p>
<p>&#8220;What most people have not realized is that the food part is what we are most optimistic about,&#8221; Villig said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently we are adding restaurants by the day. There are cost synergies on a lot of fronts, including the supply side, where drivers can serve passengers and food. But also today we have had to decline some drivers for car-based services because they don&#8217;t have the right licenses, but now we can offer them to carry goods on bikes, which doesn’t require that license at all. We can offer something to drivers that we weren’t able to do. And what that means is no need to spend money on finding drivers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said Bolt was &#8220;lucky&#8221; to get into food, even as late as 2019 since restaurants that were already interested were augmented by a new wave of them in the wake of the health pandemic and forced closures and reduced diners overall in venues. &#8220;They were all keen to get additional income and were eager to try out new platforms,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That willingness to find the way ahead even in what looks like a murky or hard market is what has brought investors around this time. Villig said they were already talking to a lot of them, and so it made sense to close the round to prepare for 2021.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Bolt as they continue to build a market-leading mobility platform across Europe and Africa,&#8221; said Dan Sundheim, founder of D1 Capital, in a statement. &#8220;The team has executed incredibly well during a challenging year and continues to provide millions of users with safety, flexibility and great value. We are optimistic about the growth opportunity ahead for Bolt after the COVID-19 pandemic and look forward to supporting the team as they invest in innovation over the coming years.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might not know yet of <a href="https://www.xyz.vc/">XYZ Venture Capital</a>, a four-year-old, San Francisco-based seed-stage venture firm, but many veterans of Palantir are surely aware of it. XYZ says it has already backed 22 startups whose founders came out of the data analysis company, including most notably, <a href="https://www.anduril.com/">Anduril</a>, Lucky Palmer&#8217;s defense tech startup. In fact, the founder of XYZ, Ross Fubini, says his firm wrote Anduril its first check.</p>
<p>It all dates back to a key introduction. Fubini is a Carnegie Mellon grad who cofounded an enterprise company, CubeTree, that a dozen years later, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/05/03/successfactors-acquires-social-enterprise-software-startup-cubetree-for-50-million/">sold</a> to SuccessFactors, which was itself <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2011/12/03/sap-acquires-successfactors-for-3-4-billion/">acquired</a> by SAP the next year, in 2011.</p>
<p>Then, like a lot of founders, he started writing checks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First, Fubini linked up with Mitch Kapor, another software mogul turned investor and a friend of Fubini who bought him into his <a href="https://www.kaporcapital.com/">venture firm</a> and taught him the ropes. During his one year spent with the outfit, Fubini says, he wrote seed checks into the digital care company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/omada-health-secures-4-7m-from-usvp-nea-kapor-more-to-roll-out-its-online-diabetes-prevention-program/">Omada Health</a>, the optimization platform Optimizely (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/episerver-acquires-optimizely/">acquired</a> this fall), and LendUp, the payday loan company that was <a href="https://www.axios.com/fintech-company-lendup-splitting-up-be92e13b-ec9e-4526-9f3e-d1923c441229.html">split into two</a> businesses back in 2018.</p>
<p>From Kapor Capital, it was onto Canaan Partners as a venture partner and, just three years later, to <a href="https://www.villageglobal.vc/">Village Global</a>, the early-stage venture firm that was founded in 2017 with the backing of prominent founders like Bill Gates and Reid Hoffman. (Fubini <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/16/village-global-fund/">helped cofound</a> the outfit with a handful of others.)</p>
<p>At the same time, Fubini began raising his own pool of capital under the brand XYZ Ventures, eventually launching a<a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/03/13/venture-capitalist-and-palantir-advisor-ross.html"> $70 million fund.</a></p>
<p>Now he&#8217;s turning the enterprise into a bigger organization.</p>
<p>For starters, this year, XYZ closed its second fund with $80 million in capital commitments from what Fubini says is predominately institutional investors, and it has been investing actively. Fubini says the firm has already written checks to 30 different startups that range in size from $500,000 to $4 million in exchange for 12% to 20% ownership.</p>
<p>He also brought aboard a partner: Chauncey Kerr Hamilton, who spent more than five years as a partner operations manager with First Round and was looking for a new challenge when a mutual friend introduced her to Fubini. &#8220;I kept hearing about Ross from founders and other investors and we met for coffee, then we kept meeting week after week,&#8221; she says of their earlier conversations.</p>
<p>Hamilton says she realized over time that &#8220;we&#8217;re kindred spirits.&#8221; But she has also pushed Fubini to be more public for the sake of XYZ&#8217;s portfolio companies. As a former projects editor at Wired before leaping into venture capital, she half-kiddingly refers to the &#8220;mystique&#8221; of XYZ Ventures, but she also wondered if it might be easier for founders to discuss their lead investor if they could point to more than Fubini&#8217;s LinkedIn page.</p>
<p>Certainly, it makes sense as XYZ widens its aperture beyond Palantir, which was itself long known for keeping a low profile and where Fubini&#8217;s relationship began when he introduced Palantir&#8217;s first business hire to its first engineer. That business hire, a personal friend, is today Palantir&#8217;s chief operating officer, Shyam Sankar; the second, Akash (&#8220;Aki&#8221;) Jain, a former colleague of Fubini, is now Palantir&#8217;s president.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the highest value thing I&#8217;ve done,&#8221; Fubini says of bringing the two together, which led to an early and lasting advisor role at the company, where he helped develop senior talent and work through challenges (and received advisor shares in return).</p>
<p>Indeed, he has since become a first call for some who spin out of the company. In addition to Anduril &#8212;  cofounded by former Palantir execs Matt Grimm, Trae Stephens, and Brian Schimpf &#8212; XYZ has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/saltbox-raises-3-million-to-build-co-working-for-entrepreneurs-who-need-warehouse-space-300911386.html">more recently</a> backed the the San Diego-based financial planning platform <a href="https://www.mosaic.tech/">Mosaic.</a> Cofounder Bijan Moallemi is a former finance exec at Palantir.</p>
<p>XYZ also wrote the first check for <a href="https://www.joinsaltbox.com/">Saltbox</a>, an Atlanta-based startup that&#8217;s building co-working units for founders needing warehouse space. Saltbox&#8217;s founder, Tyler Scriven, previously spent more than seven years as a chief of staff at Palantir.</p>
<p>Fubini and Hamilton stress that while a meaningful portion of XYZ&#8217;s capital has flowed into the &#8220;Palantir diaspora,&#8221; the company has other areas of interest, too, mostly enterprise related.</p>
<p>XYZ is very focused, for example, on fintech, betting on <a href="https://www.bond.tech/">Bond Technologies</a>, a company that helps brands and banks integrate their offerings. It has insure-tech investments, like the brokerage <a href="https://www.newfront.com/">Newfront Insurance</a>. And it is focused on security and counts <a href="https://www.verkada.com/">Verkada</a> among its portfolio companies, a now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/verkada-security/">highly valued outfit</a> that poorly handled a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21535089/surveillance-company-verkada-harassed-female-employees">sexual harassment situation</a> but seems to have survived it.</p>
<p>XYZ even made a direct-to-consumer bet recently, though Fubini and Hamilton aren&#8217;t talking about it just yet.</p>
<p>Mostly, they say, they&#8217;re focused on &#8220;trends we believe are exploding,&#8221; says Hamilton. Think video, she says. Think fintech infrastructure, she adds. &#8220;For fintech that&#8217;s building a new bank, we think three companies will replace the crappy software&#8221; that supports them, says Fubini.</p>
<p>As for how they wins deals against VCs when it comes to founders to whom they aren&#8217;t already connected in some way, Fubini says it&#8217;s not so complicated. Being &#8220;bizarrely honest&#8221; has proved helpful, he says. But also, he says, &#8220;If you&#8217;re good, and you work goddamn hard, you start seeing more stuff.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just six month after raising its first bit of outside funding, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/clickup" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="clickup">ClickUp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/clickup-raises-100m-series-b-as-demand-for-its-productivity-platform-soars-301192754.html">has closed $100 million</a> in new funding and reached a $1 billion valuation, a report in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/software-maker-clickup-reaches-1-billion-value-in-funding-round">Bloomberg</a> first reported.</p>
<p>The company has seen plenty of growth in the past several months to justify that new unicorn status, including doubling the amount of users to 2 million. In a press release the company also detailed it had grown revenue nine times over since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>This latest $100 million round was led by Canadian firm <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/georgian-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="georgian-partners">Georgian <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/craft-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="craft-ventures">Craft Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which led the startup&#8217;s $35 million Series A back in June. The high valuation showcases just how eager investors are to find winners in the productivity software space, which has seen massive customer gains as an industry this year, partially as a result of shifting corporate attitudes toward working from home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xf2Nn057mq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/productivity-platform-clickup-raises-35-million-from-craft-ventures/">Productivity platform ClickUp raises $35 million from Craft Ventures</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Productivity platform ClickUp raises $35 million from Craft Ventures&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/productivity-platform-clickup-raises-35-million-from-craft-ventures/embed/#?secret=xf2Nn057mq" data-secret="xf2Nn057mq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>ClickUp is aiming to further capitalize as it scales its team and product. The company of 200 has doubled in size since its last raise and is hoping to double again in the next several months, CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/zeb-brian-evans" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="zeb-brian-evans">Zeb Evans <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>ClickUp sells productivity software, but their main sell has been tying several products in that space into a single platform, aiming to reduce the number of tools their customers use. The team has recently begun integrating tools like email into their platform so that users can complete workflows inside the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just like a value play of using one app instead of three or four, it&#8217;s an efficiency play by saving so much time and frustration from having all the other different solutions,&#8221; Evans tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Even as the company continues scaling the product through weekly updates to the company&#8217;s apps, including a newly revamped iOS app which launched today (<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/android" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="android">Android <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> launches tomorrow), the team is looking toward how they can build for the long-term.</p>
<p>As to how long this cash will last, Evans isn&#8217;t making any promises. &#8220;I think this will keep us going for a while, though to be honest with you I would&#8217;ve said the same thing with the Series A,&#8221; Evans says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> is tweaking its subscription plans with a new mid-tier offering called <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/revolut" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="revolut">Revolut <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Plus — it costs £2.99 per month. Like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/n26-launches-mid-tier-subscription-plan-for-e4-90-per-month/">N26 Smart</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/monzo-plus/">Monzo Plus</a>, the new plan is a pandemic-proof package that doesn’t focus as much on travel.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years, challenger banks and alternatives to traditional bank accounts have been packaging additional services into paid plans. Essentially, those fintech startups are slowly becoming freemium software-as-a-service companies.</p>
<p>The majority of users don’t subscribe to paid plans. But a small portion is willing to pay a fixed monthly fee to access advanced features, get an insurance package and pay less in variable fees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Revolut already has two paid plans — Premium and Metal. Premium increases limits on free ATM withdrawals and foreign exchange. You also get overseas medical insurance, delayed baggage and flight insurance and winter sports coverage. You can also access advanced features, such as disposable virtual cards and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/revolut-launches-revolut-junior-to-help-you-manage-allowance/">Revolut Junior</a> accounts</p>
<p>With a Metal plan, your insurance package is a bit more thorough, with purchase protection and car hire excess. You get a tiny bit of cash back on purchases (0.1% in Europe, 1% outside of Europe capped at the monthly subscription price) and higher limits across various products.</p>
<p>Another big selling point has been card designs. With the Metal plan, as the name suggests, you get a metal card. It’s not that useful but some people like it. Premium subscribers can also choose between premium card designs.</p>
<p>Revolut Premium costs £6.99 per month and Revolut Metal costs £12.99 per month (or €7.99 and €13.99, respectively in Europe). You pay a bit less if you pay upfront for a year.</p>
<p>So what is Revolut Plus? It costs £2.99 per month, which makes it a lot more affordable than Revolut Premium. The main selling point is purchase protection provided by Qover. All paid plans now get purchase protection with different limits on damaged or stolen goods (up to £1,000, £2,500 and £10,000 depending on your plan). You can get a refund on purchases up to 90 days after buying eligible products. If you book a ticket and your event is cancelled, you could also get a refund.</p>
<p>In addition to a new card design, Revolut Plus subscribers can also use virtual cards. You can also create junior accounts with the new mid-tier plan.</p>
<p>As you can see, there’s no overseas travel insurance. You also don’t get unlimited free currency exchange (other than spread). Revolut Plus is focused on people who mostly use their Revolut account in their home country.</p>
<p>Revolut is also tweaking other plans, so it’s going to be important to check the terms and conditions before you renew your paid plan. The new Plus plan is available today in the U.K. and will be rolled out next week in the European Economic Area.</p>
