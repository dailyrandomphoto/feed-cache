										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.rentpath.com/">RentPath</a>, owner of property listing sites including Rent.com and Apartment Guide, said today <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rentpath-terminates-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-costar-group-301199185.html">it has cancelled its agreement</a> to be acquired by <a href="https://www.costar.com/">CoStar Group </a>after the Federal Trade Commission sued to block the sale.</p>
<p>CoStar, a commercial real estate data and analytics provider that also operates listing sites like Apartments.com and ApartmentFinder.com, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/costar-in-talks-to-buy-apartment-search-firm-rentpath-for-500-million-11581454921?mod=article_inline">agreed in February to buy RentPath for $588 million</a>. The all-cash deal came after <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rentpath" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rentpath">RentPath <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said it would file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. RentPath had already hired financial advisors to restructure more than $650 million in debt, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rental-website-operator-rentpath-prepares-for-debt-restructuring-11580307045?mod=article_inline">reported the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>But earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission authorized an antitrust lawsuit in federal court to block the acquisition. Daniel Francis, deputy director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/11/ftc-sues-block-costar-group-incs-proposed-acquisition-chief">said in a statement</a> that &#8220;the acquisition will eliminate price and quality competition that benefits both renters and property managers,&#8221; because CoStar and RentPath’s rivalry kept advertising rates on their platform, which include some of the most popular listing sites, low.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In its announcement today, RentPath said its chapter 11 plan remains backed by lenders, including alternative asset management firms with &#8220;strong track records of successfully investing in businesses under similar circumstances.&#8221;</p>

<p>The FTC’s lawsuit and RentPath’s decision to back out of the acquisition agreement comes as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/global-antitrust-gaining-serious-momentum/">more countries around the world </a>are cracking down on tech consolidation. While the United States has trailed behind other governments in terms of antitrust actions, that is gradually changing, with Amazon, Google and Facebook coming under more legislative scrutiny, and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">recent lawsuit </a>filed by 46 states against Facebook alleging that it bought competitors &#8220;illegally&#8221; to increase its market power.</p>
<p>The fate of the RentPath/CoStar deal may foreshadow more antitrust scrutiny for proptech companies in the United States, too. CoStar built out its business over the past decade through acquisitions and has other deals currently in the works, including listings site HomeSnap, which <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201217005228/en/FTC-Clears-CoStar-Group-to-Close-Acquisition-of-Homesnap">passed FTC review last month</a>, and a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-corelogic-m-a/costar-group-private-equity-firms-vying-to-acquire-corelogic-sources-idINKBN27D25Q">reported bid for property analytics company CoreLogic</a>. CoStar and RentPath competitor Zillow is also known for <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/acquisitions/field/organizations/num_acquisitions/zillow">building its business through a series of acquisitions</a>, including Trulia for $3.5 billion in 2014.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: Judge dismisses Apple copyright claims against <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/corellium" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="corellium">Corellium</strong></p> <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>
<p>Apple filed a lawsuit last year against Corellium, a company that allows security researchers to create virtualized iOS devices in the browser in order to discover potential security flaws.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple argued that Corellium&#8217;s product both infringes its copyright and, by circumventing built-in authentications and security checks, violates the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Today, Judge Rodney Smith <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/apples-lawsuit-against-corellium-has-been-partly-thrown-out/">dismissed Apple&#8217;s copyright claims</a> and wrote that &#8220;Corellium has met its burden of establishing fair use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith did not rule on Apple&#8217;s DMCA claims, so this legal battle isn&#8217;t over.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Podcast homepages weren’t something I gave any thought to until I launched my own standalone show. And honestly, even then I probably didn’t give enough thought to the subject. For that reason, many or most of my shows have Tumblr pages — which is, at best, a bit of a mixed blessing in 2020.</p>
<p>The biggest reason many podcasters give little consideration to the subject is the fact that most people are platform-dependent when it comes to listening. People who consume a lot of podcasts generally do so through a single platform/app, be it Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google, Stitcher, Castbox, etc. But when it comes to actually promoting your show on social media, you’re best served by sharing a link that’s platform agnostic.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing around with <a href="https://www.podpage.com/">Podpage</a> a bit today. The new offering was created by Brenden Mulligan, co-founder of app developer toolbox LaunchKit, which sold its tools to Google way back in 2016. The offering has been around for a while now, but Mulligan has offered some updates and <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/podpage-1">recently listed it on ProductHunt</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I’m digging it so far. It’s basically plug-and-play to get up and running, though you can customize a fair bit beyond that. For reference, a simple page <a href="https://www.podpage.com/riyl/">I made this morning for my podcast, RiYL</a>:</p>

<p>After a couple of hours, I’m pretty seriously considering dropping the long-standing Tumblr in favor of the service. My page is pretty simple so far, and honestly, that’s by design. Or, rather, partially by design and partially due to the fact that I haven’t been very good about updating episode art, which has kind of limited my options here (perhaps I’ll go through the 400+ episodes on some future rainy day).</p>
<p>You start by entering your podcast name, and the service goes to work, scraping the relevant information and building it into a page. From there, you can add a Patreon (or other method for monetization) and all related social media. One of the nice things about having a purpose-built service like this is how it pulls together all of the relevant information into a single spot. The sidebar features a breakdown of the different podcatchers where you can listen to the show, coupled with a signup form to get show updates.</p>
<p>On the bottom are a selection of reviews from different podcasting services. Up top is a link to the services where you can leave that feedback. There’s also a subscription link and contact form, which is a handy way of allowing people to email you without giving out personal information. Notes submitted to the form will be sent to your associated email.</p>
<p>The basic experience is free and there are currently two upgrade options. At $5 a month, you can host it on your own website and for $12, there are a bunch more customization options, along with a more fully featured website, including blog functionality and the ability to add transcripts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is testing a new feature that will surface Instagram and TikTok videos in their own dedicated carousel in the Google app for mobile devices &#8212; a move that could help the company retain users in search of social video entertainment from fully leaving Google&#8217;s platform. The feature itself expands on a test <a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/08/24/google-discover-short-videos/">launched earlier this year,</a> where Google had first introduced a carousel of &#8220;Short Videos&#8221; within<a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2819496?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en"> Google Discover</a>  &#8212; the personalized feed found in the Google mobile app and to the left of the home screen on some Android devices.</p>
<p>To be clear, this &#8220;Short Videos&#8221; carousel is different from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/google-adds-stories-to-its-search-app-for-ios-and-android/">Google&#8217;s Stories</a>, which <a href="https://blog.google/web-creators/web-stories-discover-search/">rolled out</a> in October 2020 to the Google Search app for iOS and Android. Those &#8220;Stories&#8221; &#8212; previously known as &#8220;AMP Stories&#8221; &#8212; consist of short-form video content created by Google&#8217;s online publishing partners like Forbes, USA Today, Vice, Now This, Bustle, Thrillist and others.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the &#8220;Short Videos&#8221; carousel <a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/08/24/google-discover-short-videos/">had been focused on</a> aggregating social video from other platforms, including Google&#8217;s own short-form video project Tangi, Indian TikTok competitor Trell, as well as Google&#8217;s own video platform, YouTube &#8212; which has also been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/">experimenting with short-form content</a> as of late.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The expansion to include Instagram and TikTok content in this carousel was first reported by <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-short-videos-carousel-tiktok-instagram-30662.html">Search Engine Roundtable</a> (via <a href="https://twitter.com/type_SEO/status/1343234594104111104">Brian Freiesleben&#8217;s tweet</a>). They were able to access the feature by searching for &#8220;packers&#8221; in the Google app then scrolling down the page.</p>
<p>We were able to replicate this, as well. (See below image.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091333" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091333" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2091333" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS-3.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS-3.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS-3.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS-3.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS-3.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS-3.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS-3.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS-3.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS-3.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091333" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> screenshot of Google search results</p></div></p>
<p>We found the Short Videos carousel appears when you scroll past the Google Knowledge Base box for the Green Bay Packers, followed by the the scores, Top Stories, Twitter results, Top Results, Images, Videos and other content, like a listing of the players, standings and more.</p>
<p>Both Instagram and TikTok videos were available in the Short Videos row. When clicked, you&#8217;re taken to the web version of the social platform &#8212; not the native mobile app, even if it&#8217;s installed on your device. The end result is that Google users are more likely to remain on Google, as all it takes is a tap on the back arrow to return to the search results after watching the video.</p>
<p>Google has been indexing video content for years and partnered with Twitter on 2015 to index search results. It&#8217;s not clear to what extent it has any formal relationship with Facebook/Instagram or TikTok, however. (If those companies comment, we&#8217;ll update.)</p>
<p>Google declined to formally comment or further detail its plans, but a company spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch the feature was currently being piloted on mobile devices. They clarified that means it&#8217;s a limited, early-stage feature. In other words, you won&#8217;t find the video carousel on every search query just yet. But over time, as Google scales the product, it could become an interesting tool for indexing and surfacing top video content from social media &#8212; unless, of course, the platforms choose to block Google from doing so.</p>
<p>The feature is currently available in a limited way on the Google app for mobile devices and on the mobile web, the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/apple-is-suing-corellium/">August of last year</a> Apple filed a lawsuit against the virtualization software company Corellium, arguing that the product infringed its copyright and later adding claims that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/corellium" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="corellium">Corellium&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> product violates the DMCA.</p>
<p>While the DMCA claims will still need to be settled in court, a judge in Florida has tossed out <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> copyright claims.</p>
<p>So what is Corellium? To over simplify it, Corellium allows security researchers to spin up a virtualized ARM device (including iOS devices) in a browser and take a <em>deep</em> look under the hood to discover potential security bugs. As I wrote<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/apple-is-suing-corellium/"> last year</a>:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Corellium could allow, for example, a security researcher to quickly fire up a simulated iPhone and hunt for potential bugs. If one is discovered, they can quickly load up prior versions of iOS to see how long this bug has been around. If a bug “bricks” the virtual iOS device and renders it unusable, it’s a matter of just booting up a new one rather than obtaining a whole new phone. Virtualized devices can be paused, giving researchers a detailed look at its precise state at any given moment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Writes Judge Rodney Smith in a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16064642/784/apple-inc-v-corellium-llc/">docket filed this morning</a> as first spotted by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/29/apple-corellium-lawsuit/">Washington Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Having reviewed the evidence, the Court does not find a lack of good faith and fair dealing. Further, weighing all the necessary factors, the Court finds that Corellium has met its burden of establishing fair use. Thus, its use of iOS in connection with the Corellium Product is permissible. On these grounds, Corellium’s Motion for Summary Judgment is granted on Apple’s copyright claim.</p></blockquote>
<p>Smith cites Corellium&#8217;s ability to do things like &#8220;(1) see and halt running processes; (2) modify the kernel; (3) use CoreTrace, a tool to view system calls; (4) use an app browser and a file browser; and (5) take live snapshots&#8221; as proof that the product is &#8220;not merely a repackaged version of iOS&#8221; and should be considered fair use.</p>
<p>Smith also notes repeatedly that this legal action comes after Apple considered acquiring Corellium.</p>
<blockquote><p>Between January 2018 and the summer of 2018, the parties engaged in discussions regarding Apple’s potential acquisition of Corellium. During this time, the parties met in-person and telephonically. Corellium explained to Apple the technology behind the Corellium Product and how it works, and discussed Corellium’s business and intention to commercialize the Corellium Product.</p></blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Apple had acquired the Corellium Product, the product would have been used internally for testing and validation (that is, for verifying any system weaknesses and functioning of devices).</p></blockquote>
<p>While this decision swipes away the copyright claims (potential appeals aside), there was no such swift judgement on the DMCA claims. Apple argues that Corellium is working around built-in authentications and security checks, whereas Corellium argues that such things are implemented at a hardware level and the firmware they&#8217;re dealing with (the iOS IPSW files) are “left unencrypted, unprotected, unlocked, and out in the open for the public to access, copy, edit, distribute, perform, and display.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s no denying that 2020 has been the year of the special purpose acquisition company.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, 219 SPACs have raised $73 billion, according to widely reported market research from Goldman Sachs. That&#8217;s a 462% jump from 2019 and more than traditional public offerings raised by about $6 billion. By some counts, roughly one quarter of the SPACs that have been announced will target climate-related businesses.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Since the beginning of the year, 219 SPACs have raised $73 billion.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Already, of the 78 deals that have either completed or announced a merger since 2018, just over one-third have been climate-related, <a href="https://climatetechvc.org/%F0%9F%8C%8E-hype-cycles-in-climate-spacs-and-blockchain/">as tallied by Climate Tech VC</a>. And these SPACs have outperformed the broader technology market, with the 10 climate tech companies that have completed mergers averaging a 131% return on investment versus the 50% return of the total SPAC market (assuming average offering prices of $10 per share).</p>
<p>Clearly this has been a banner year for companies that are tackling the climate crisis across a number of verticals, but can it last?</p>
<p>There are a few reasons to think that it can &#8212; led chiefly by the demand for these kinds of public offerings from institutional investors, including the pension funds, mutual funds and asset managers handling trillions of investment dollars.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The] current wave [of SPACs] is because over the past 24 months the institutional investor universe has come fully into believing that climate solutions are going to be a major growth area in the 2020s and beyond, but they weren’t seeing options available to them for investing into,&#8221; wrote longtime clean technology investor, Rob Day, in a DM.</p>
<p>&#8220;The available publicly traded &#8216;green&#8217; companies were already getting really bought up, and the private equity options were underwhelming as well (smallish in the case of VC, low returns in the case of large-format projects). Throw in a Robinhood market of retail investors with a lot of enthusiasm for EVs and such, and you have a nice recipe for this to happen.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s that time of year again. Of course, this year is going to be different (to be honest, even looking at that lead image makes me uneasy). For the first time ever, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is going all-virtual – but as usual, TechCrunch will be around to (virtually) cover it. The new format offers some unique challenges and opportunities, and we’re (virtually) here for it.</p>
<p>This year, we’re taking a different approach to help sort the signal from the noise. For past events, we’ve issued a similar form to find unique and interesting companies for our stage. While we don’t have a stage (or booth or physical presence of any sort) this year, we’re still looking to talk to as many great companies as possible.</p>
<p>Getting noticed at a show the size and scope of CES is difficult even in normal years – and that difficultly is likely to only be compounded for many smaller startups in this new all-digital format. We’re looking to get out in front of the mid-January scrum. If you’re showing off something cool or have some noteworthy news at this year’s event, fill out the form below and we’ll do the rest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After decades of global expansion and consolidation in the tech sector, antitrust is now a headline issue for the industry across the world.</p>
<p>What has been a slow and sputtering series of disparate actions over the past decade has coalesced in just the past few weeks into a rapid and comprehensive series of actions against the industry, with the United States being a notable laggard worldwide.</p>
<p>Nowhere are these actions more prominent than in China, where the competition authorities have — after many years of a reasonably laissez-faire policy to its internet giants — suddenly decided to take sweeping action against its largest tech companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That movement started after Chinese <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">regulators thwarted Ant’s record-shattering IPO in early November</a>. Ant is one of China’s most important tech companies, a fintech company that was looking at a valuation north of $300 billion and that has 1.3 billion active users globally centered on China and the overseas Chinese diaspora.</p>
<p>That regulatory action led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/pulled-ant-group-ipo-costs-alibaba-nearly-60b-in-market-cap/">a $60 billion dollar immediate drop in Alibaba’s market cap</a>, given Alibaba’s 33% stake in Ant.</p>

<p>The bad news from Beijing has continued for the tech industry though. Earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">market regulators laid out a “rectification” plan</a> for Ant, including tougher lending standards that are expected to deeply impact the high-flying company’s revenues, margins and growth. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-eyes-shrinking-jack-mas-business-empire-11609260092?mod=hp_lead_pos2">The Wall Street Journal reported this morning</a> that China also specifically intends to “shrink” Jack Ma’s own influence over his business empire, with the government itself potentially acquiring larger ownership stakes in tech companies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Beijing seems ready to force Alibaba and Tencent to play nicer with each other and create breathing space for startups outside of their two interlocking corporate webs. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/china-fines-alibaba-tencent-for-flouting-rules-in-past-deals">authorities fined Alibaba a nominal amount and also reviewed a Tencent acquisition</a>, actions that were perceived by analysts as the opening shots in a new round of antitrust intervention. More action is expected in 2021.</p>
<p>It’s not just China though that has been bringing tech companies to heel. Almost exactly a year ago, Germany-based Delivery Hero <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/15/with-4b-food-delivery-acquisition-korea-poised-to-enter-upper-tier-of-startup-hubs/">announced a $4 billion takeover of Seoul-based Baedal Minjok</a>, a popular food delivery app. Yesterday, South Korean competition authorities ordered Delivery Hero to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d882f68-9a43-4ed5-874b-c025412b7f7a">divest its existing local delivery assets to get approval for the acquisition</a> — a demand that undermined one of the reasons for acquiring Baedal Minjok in the first place. Delivery Hero has said that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-28/south-korea-orders-delivery-hero-to-sell-local-unit-for-takeover?sref=j5SuHr0s">it will sell its unit to complete the transaction</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile this month, Europe and soon-to-be-Brexited Britain <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/15/technology/big-tech-regulation-europe.html">announced a spate of new policies and regulations designed to heighten competition in the tech sector</a>, including increasing legal liabilities for illegal content, broadening transparency around services and mandating open competition on major platforms. Those <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/europe-eyeing-limits-on-how-big-tech-can-use-data-and-bundle-apps-reports/">policies have been a long-time coming</a>, but now that they are starting to gain traction, they portend huge changes on how the highest-scale tech companies can operate on the Old Continent.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jRZMXQQTXW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/europe-eyeing-limits-on-how-big-tech-can-use-data-and-bundle-apps-reports/">Europe eyeing limits on how big tech can use data and bundle apps &#8212; reports</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While many of these global policies are designed to undo the consolidation and scale of the industry, in India, regulators are working to prevent such scale in the first place. Local competition authorities there announced in November <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-01/to-avoid-tech-s-anti-trust-troubles-india-tries-a-hard-30-cap?sref=j5SuHr0s">a framework that would prevent any company from owning more than 30% of local payments volume</a> and also mandating financial interoperability standards. That policy appears to be designed to avoid the kind of fintech duopoly seen in China between Alipay and WeChat Pay.</p>
<p>With all this global antitrust action bubbling, the laggard has actually been the United States, perhaps since the largest tech giants are all headquartered domestically. While Congress, the president and dozens of state attorneys general have become increasingly strident on the scope of companies like Amazon, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Facebook, action remains very early against the giants.</p>
<p>The largest and most notable action so far has been a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">massive lawsuit by 46 states against Facebook that was filed earlier this month</a>. As we reported then, the lawsuit “alleges that the company bought competitors ‘illegally’ and in a ‘predatory manner’ in order to grow and preserve its market power. The suit cites <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp as prominent examples.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5OzpfERUhZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">Facebook hit with massive antitrust lawsuit from 46 states</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook hit with massive antitrust lawsuit from 46 states&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/embed/#?secret=5OzpfERUhZ" data-secret="5OzpfERUhZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Of course, as some of us remember from the 1990s with the U.S. government’s case against Microsoft, antitrust lawsuits often take years to fully wend their way through the courts — and often don’t even lead to much if any change in the end anyway.</p>
<p>Whether a Biden administration will dramatically change the course of these actions remains unclear, with the transition offering very limited insight as it prepares to take office next month.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, all of these antitrust actions happening simultaneously across the globe within weeks of each other portends huge regulatory fights for tech in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DNA testing technology company <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/23andme" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="23andme">23andMe <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has raised just <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1414053/000156761920021571/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">shy of $82.5 million in new funding</a>, from an offering of $85 million in total equity shares, according to a new SEC filing. The funding, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-28/23andme-raises-more-than-80-million-in-equity-financing-round?sref=gni836kR">confirmed by the Wall Street Journal</a>, comes from investors including Sequoia Capital and NewView Capital. It brings the total raised by 23andMe to date to over $850 million.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no specific agenda earmarked for this Series F round, according to a statement from the company to the WSJ, beyond general use to continue to fund and grow the business. 23andMe&#8217;s business is based on its distribution of individual home genetic testing kits, which provide customers with insights about their potential health and their family tree based on their DNA.</p>
<p>While the company&#8217;s pitch to individuals is improved health, and more knowledge about their ancestry and family tree, the company has also turned its attention to conducting research based on the data it has collected in aggregate, both for its own studies including a recent one that examined how genetic markers could affect a person&#8217;s susceptibility to COVID-19 and also for use in supporting the work of third parties — though it stresses that data is only shared in aggregate, de-identified formats for those purposes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In January, 23andMe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/layoffs-reach-23andme-after-hitting-mozilla-and-the-vision-fund-portfolio/">confirmed layoffs affecting roughly 14% of its global workforce</a>. The company&#8217;s work this year around COVID-19 has, however, perhaps put the value of its platform in a new light in the face of this pandemic and the potential of future similar global health issues that may arise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.commonground-ai.com">CommonGround</a>, a startup developing technology for what its founders describe as &#8220;4D collaboration,&#8221; is announcing that it has raised $19 million in funding.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Amir Bassan-Eskenazi and Ran Oz have launched a startup together — they also founded video networking company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigBand_Networks">BigBand Networks</a>, which won two technology-related Emmy Awards, went public in 2007 and was acquired by Arris Group in 2011. Before that, they worked together at digital compression company Optibase, which Oz co-founded and where Bassan-Eskenazi served as COO.</p>
<p>Although CommonGround is still in stealth mode and doesn&#8217;t plan to fully unveil its first product until next year, Bassan-Eskenazi and Oz outlined their vision for me. They acknowledged that video conferencing has improved significantly, but said it still can&#8217;t match face-to-face communication.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Some things you just cannot achieve through a flat video-conferencing-type solution,&#8221; Bassan-Eskenazi said. &#8220;Those got better over the years, but they never managed to achieve that thing where you walk into a bar … and there&#8217;s a group of people talking and you know immediately who is a little taken aback, who is excited, who is kind of &#8216;eh.'&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091251" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091251" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2091251" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Amir-and-Ran.jpg?w=680" alt="CommonGround founders Amir Bassan-Eskenazi and Ran Oz" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Amir-and-Ran.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Amir-and-Ran.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Amir-and-Ran.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Amir-and-Ran.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Amir-and-Ran.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Amir-and-Ran.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091251" class="wp-caption-text">CommonGround founders Amir Bassan-Eskenazi and Ran Oz. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> CommonGround</p></div></p>
<p>That, essentially, is what Bassan-Eskenazi, Oz and their team are trying to build — online collaboration software that more fully captures the nuances of in-person communication, and actually improves on face-to-face conversations in some ways (hence the 4D moniker). Asked whether this involves combining video conferencing with other collaboration tools, Oz replied, &#8220;Think of it as <em>beyond</em> video,&#8221; using technology like computer vision and graphics.</p>
<p>Bassan-Eskenazi added that they&#8217;ve been working on CommonGround for more than year, so this isn&#8217;t just a response to our current stay-at-home environment. And the opportunity should still be massive as offices reopen next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started this, it was a problem we thought some of the workforce would understand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now my mother understands it, because it&#8217;s how she reads to the grandkids.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the funding, the round was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/matrix-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="matrix-partners">Matrix Partners, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grove-ventures">Grove Ventures</a> and StageOne Ventures.</p>
<p>“Amir and Ran have a bold vision to reinvent communications,&#8221; said Matrix General Partner Patrick Malatack in a statement. “Their technical expertise, combined with a history of successful exits, made for an easy investment decision.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The space economy in the last few years has been in large part driven by the increasing cadence and reliability of launch services, and while that market will continue to grow, the new economy enabled by those launches is only just beginning to take off. If you thought the launch boom was big, just wait for when it combines with the private satellite boom.</p>
<p>The consensus among experts, company leadership and investors in the space sector is that launch has commanded an outsize share of both money and attention, both because it&#8217;s so broadly appealing and because it was a prerequisite to any kind of space-based economy.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If you thought the launch boom was big, just wait for when it combines with the private satellite boom.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But as we&#8217;ve seen over the last year, and as is expected to be further demonstrated in 2021, the launch industry is moving from investor-subsidized R&amp;D and testing to a full-fledged service economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;To date the launch industry has received 47% of the industry&#8217;s venture capital, even though it&#8217;s less than 2% of the global space economy,&#8221; said Meagan Crawford, managing partner at SpaceFund, at TC Sessions: Space last week. &#8220;We feel like that&#8217;s a problem that&#8217;s been solved, or that&#8217;s being solved. What we want to know is what is <em>enabled</em> by launch, right? What are the new things that can happen now, the new business models that close today that didn&#8217;t close three years ago when launch was not as frequent, reliable and low cost?&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vifRZKaVvM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/despite-economic-downturn-space-startup-funding-defies-gravity/">Despite economic downturn, space startup funding defies gravity</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Despite economic downturn, space startup funding defies gravity&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/despite-economic-downturn-space-startup-funding-defies-gravity/embed/#?secret=vifRZKaVvM" data-secret="vifRZKaVvM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Within the launch industry this view seems to be shared, even at companies that have yet to take a payload to orbit. Their focus is not just on proving their launch vehicle can do it, but taking their place in a massively supply-constrained (on the launch side) market by differentiating and appealing to new business models. That involves far more than building a working rocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just about mass to orbit,&#8221; said Mandy Vaughn, president of VOX Space. &#8220;It&#8217;s about all those other elements of, how can we react quickly? How can we design and produce something quickly, as well as deploy that capability, maybe in a unique way from an unexpected location? In terms of the investment landscape, it&#8217;s not just about the technology of one rocket, or what&#8217;s your ISP [in-space propulsion] compared to another&#8217;s. It really is, what is the complete vertical infrastructure and business model beyond just mass to orbit?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim Ellis, founder and CEO of Relativity Space, which will launch its first fully 3D-printed rocket in 2021, concurred in a conversation we had outside the conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing we&#8217;re watching closest is not, while it&#8217;s fun, the different launch providers, but how many new satellite companies are getting to orbit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re still seeing the market growing faster than the launch vehicle companies have been able to keep up with.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s up slightly from the firm’s past two funds, both of which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/22/for-madrona-venture-group-four-ipos-in-20-months-and-a-brand-new-fund/">were $300 million vehicles</a>. The filing comes roughly a year and a half after the firm’s last fundraise for its seventh fund. That slight increase in size is a different choice from many other VC firms these days, which have ballooned their fund sizes in pursuit of larger and later-stage deals.</p>
<p>Madrona in recent years has been on a hiring spree. It picked up <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/steve-singh" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="steve-singh">Steve Singh, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the former CEO of enterprise startup Docker, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/former-docker-ceo-steve-singh-joins-madrona/">as a managing director earlier this year</a>, and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/former-king-digital-cfo-hope-cochran-becomes-madronas-first-female-managing-director/">promoted Hope Cochran as its first female managing director</a> in 2019. She had joined the firm in 2016 as a venture partner and was formerly the CFO of mobile gaming giant King Digital and telecom services provider Clearwire. The firm has also hired several experienced enterprise hands to round its portfolio services, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/madrona-continues-hiring-spree-trilogy-veteran-katie-drucker-former-avvo-ceo-mark-britton/">including Katie Drucker and Mark Britton</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The firm is perhaps best known for its enterprise bets, and the firm has been on a tear this year writing checks.

<p>Last year, the firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/madrona-venture-group-launches-100m-acceleration-fund/">raised a $100 million Acceleration Fund</a> that was designed to take minority stakes in growth rounds at the Series B and Series C stages. No word on where that growth fund sits, or whether the firm will double down more on that strategy in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There is massive VC overcapitalization for Series A and later companies, and probably for seed as well. But there is a massive gap in the market to financially underwrite promising founders and guide them out of their current employers or schools.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/cory-levy" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="cory-levy">Cory Levy, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> who has been a long-time angel investor and startup tinkerer, launched <a href="https://www.firsttext.com">First Text</a> last year as an experiment to see what would happen if all communication barriers between founders and VCs were removed by substituting the formal pitch presentation with text messages. With one click on the website, you are texting Cory (“I have a First Text iPhone” he told me), and through him, you can connect with a panoply of VC and founder mentors like Keith Rabois at Founders Fund and Chris Farmer at SignalFire. The service hosts regular office hours and other get-to-know-you events.</p>
<p>Levy is a believer of the model, since he got his start the same way. <a href="https://twitter.com/rabois/status/14784057963450368?s=20">Almost a decade ago</a>, Levy tweeted at Rabois to fund his startup — a tweet that led to an investment and Rabois’ continued involvement in Levy’s startup experiments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/corylevy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@corylevy</a> Sure.  Deal.</p>
<p>&mdash; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/keith-rabois" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="keith-rabois">Keith Rabois <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (@rabois) <a href="https://twitter.com/rabois/status/14784057963450368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2010</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“I think there is still this barrier and friction that comes from talking with a venture capitalist on Sand Hill Road,” Levy said. It’s one thing to lower the barrier to chat with a VC though, but another to actually just get started in the first place.</p>
<p>So Levy’s latest experiment is something called <a href="https://www.zfellows.com">Z Fellows</a>. It’s essentially a one-week sabbatical program that offers $10,000 in (optional) equity investment (at a $1 billion cap … so very, very cheap money) to promising potential founders who want to explore a project outside the hustle and bustle of school or work. Levy said that “a handful of my friends are in school or working at companies and they have ideas and are working on stuff on the side” but they often say something like “I am going to quit Google and work on it.” Levy says Z Fellows is designed to allow people to take “a calculated risk” to explore a project before committing to it full time.</p>
<p>The application is <a href="https://firsttext.typeform.com/to/ieOG9YDB">open now</a> and closes January 15, with 10 fellows selected shortly thereafter. The application has eight short questions, plus name and email. Levy will select fellows with the guidance of the program’s mentors.</p>
<p>Levy said that he was inspired by the early batches of Y Combinator, whose cohorts were small and people found that mentorship was worth more than the cash offered by the accelerator. Mentors in the program include <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/naval-ravikant" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="naval-ravikant">Naval Ravikant <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> of AngelList fame, Lucy Guo from Scale AI and Dylan Field of Figma. Levy wants to “fast-track technical tinkerers into the world of Silicon Valley.”</p>

<p>The program is all virtual and will have a daily 10-minute standup meeting in the morning and an hour-long office hours and speaker talks program in the evening.</p>
<p>Levy says that Z Fellows, like First Text itself, is a long-term experiment to see whether lowering barriers to VC improves the speed of inception of new startups. “Two years from now, hopefully a couple of people have moved forward” with their projects, Levy said. He emphasized that no participant is expected to quit their company or school the day after the program, and that the conversations that start there might take months or years to mature. Right now, he intends to only do one batch — if it’s a success, Levy says other batches could be initiated.</p>
<p>So far, there have been some early successes, at least with First Text itself. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/george-sivulka" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="george-sivulka">George Sivulka, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the founder of Hebbia <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/hebbia-wants-to-make-ctrl-f-or-command-f-actually-useful-through-better-ai/">which I profiled this past October</a>, used First Text to connect with Levy, and he synced up with Ann Miura-Ko at an office hours event. A few months later, Miura-Ko led the $1.1 million pre-seed round into Hebbia, with Levy participating as an angel. Levy also pointed to Vise AI, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/meet-vise-ai-the-startup-reimagining-portfolio-management/">which we covered last year</a>, as another company that he <a href="https://twitter.com/cory/status/1338933349189111809">met by text</a> before introducing to Rabois, who invested in the company’s seed round <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vise-the-ai-powered-investment-management-platform-secures-45-million-series-b-funding-led-by-sequoia-301193062.html">before Sequoia invested a combined $59.5 million this year across its Series A and B rounds</a>.</p>
<p>It may seem simple, but sometimes the most important changes in venture and startups more generally have come from lowering that last bit of friction to action.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you build it, they will come, but they sure as hell are going to complain about everything until they do.</p>
<p>There were millions of bets made in the tech industry last year. Some of those bets involved actual venture capital dollars. Others involved individual decisions on where to live: Do you bet on the future of San Francisco or do you want to partake in the growth of some other startup hub? Are you going to launch this new feature in your product or improve one of your existing ones? Do you switch jobs or stay and double down?</p>
<p>Yet, for all those bets, just three seem to have achieved a collective and hysterical frenzy in the industry as we close out this year: a bet on the future of media, a bet on the future of (audio) media and a bet on the future of one of America’s greatest cities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/substack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="substack">Substack, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Clubhouse and Miami as a major tech hub are compelling bets. They are <i>early</i> bets, in the sense that most of the work to actually realize each of their dreams remains to be done. All three are bets of optimism: Substack believes it can rebuild journalism. Clubhouse believes it can reinvent radio with the right interactivity and build a unique social platform. And Miami is a bet that you can take a top global city without a massive startup ecosystem and agglomerate the talent necessary to compete with San Francisco, New York and Boston.</p>
<p>Yet, that optimism is not broadly endorsed by the tech commentariat, who see threats, failures and barriers from every angle.</p>
<p>I wish I could say it’s just the ennui of an industry in flux given the pandemic and constant cavalcade of chaos and bad news that’s hit us this year. That cynicism, though, has gotten deeper and more entrenched over the past few years even before coronavirus was a trending topic, even as more startups than ever are getting funding (and at better valuations!), even as more startups than ever are exiting, and those exits are collectively larger than ever as we saw earlier this month.</p>
<p>Insecurity is the fabric that runs through most of these bleak analyses. That’s particularly prominent with Substack, which sits at the nexus of insecurity in tech and insecurity in media. The criticism from tech folks seems to basically boil down to “it’s just an email service!” Its simplicity is threatening, since it seems to intimate that anyone could have built a Substack, really anytime in the last decade.</p>
<p>Indeed, they could. Substack is <i>simple</i> in its original product conception, which is a DNA it happens to share with a lot of other successful consumer startups. It <i>is</i> (or perhaps better to say now, was) just email. It’s Stripe + a CMS editor + an email delivery service. A janky version could be written in a day by most competent engineers. And yet. No one else built Substack, and that’s where the insecurity starts in the startup world.</p>
<p>From the media perspective, it’s of course been brutal the last few years in newsrooms and across publishing, so understandably, the level of cynicism in the press is already high (and journalists aren’t exactly optimistic types to begin with). Yet, most of the criticism here basically boils down to, “Why hasn’t Substack completely stopped the bloodletting of my industry in the short few years it’s been around?”</p>
<p>Maybe they will, but give the folks some goddamn time to build. The fact that a young startup is even considered to have the <i>potential</i> to completely rebuild an industry is precisely what makes Substack (and other adjacent startups in its space) such a compelling bet. Substack, <i>today</i>, cannot reemploy tens of thousands of laid-off journalists, or fix the inequality in news coverage or industry demographics, or end the plight of “fake news.” But what about a decade from now if they keep growing on this trajectory and stay focused on building?</p>
<p>The cynicism of immediate perfection is one of the strange dynamics of startups in 2020. There is this expectation that a startup, with one or a few founders and a couple of employees, is somehow going to build a perfect product on day one that mitigates any potential problem even before it becomes one. Maybe these startups are just getting popularized too early, and the people who understand early product are getting subsumed by the wider masses who don’t understand the evolution of products?</p>
<p>This pattern is obvious in the case of Clubhouse, the drama aspects we have mostly managed to avoid at TechCrunch. It’s a new social platform, with new social dynamics. No one understands what it’s going to become in the next few years. Not Paul Davison (who might, even so, have a dream of where he wants to take it), not Clubhouse’s investors, and certainly not its users. This past week, Clubhouse hosted a live &#8220;Lion King&#8221; musical event with thousands of participants. Who had that on their bingo board?</p>
<p>Are there problems with Substack and Clubhouse? For sure. But as early companies, they have the obligation to explore the terrain of what they are building, find the key features that compel users to these platforms, and ultimately find their growth formula. There will be problems — trust and safety chief among them, particularly given the nature of user-contributed content. No startup has ever been founded, however, that didn’t uncover problems along its journey. The key question we must ask is whether these companies have the leadership to fix them as they continue building. My sense — and hypothetical bet — is yes.</p>
<p>Talking about leadership, that leads us to Francis Suarez, the mayor of Miami, whose single tweet offering to help has sparked the most absurd kerfuffle of San Francisco lovers and vitriolic pessimists the world over right now.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/keith-rabois" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="keith-rabois">Keith Rabois <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and a few other VCs and founders are blazing a trail from San Francisco to Miami, linking up with the local industry to try to build something new and better than what existed before. It’s a bet on a place — an optimistic one — that the power of startups and tech can migrate outside of its central hubs.</p>
<p>What’s strange is that the cynicism around Miami here seems even less warranted than it did a decade ago. While San Francisco and distantly New York and Boston remain the clear hubs of tech startups in the U.S., cities like Salt Lake, Seattle, Portland, Chicago, Austin, Denver, Philadelphia and more have started to score some serious points. Is it <i>really</i> so hard to believe that Miami, a metro region of 5.5 million and one of the largest regional economies in the United States, might actually succeed as well? Maybe it literally just required a few major VCs to show up to catalyze the revolution.</p>
<p>Nothing got built by cynicism. “You can’t do it!” has never created a company, except perhaps to trigger a founder to start something in revolt at the fusillade of negativity.</p>
<p>It takes time though to build. It takes time to take an early product and grow it. It takes time to build a startup ecosystem and expand it into something self-sustaining. Perhaps most importantly, it takes extraordinary effort and hard work, and not just from singular individuals but a whole team and community of people to succeed. The future is malleable — and bets do pay off. So we all need to stop asking what’s the problem and pointing out flaws, and perhaps ask, what future are we building toward? What’s the bet I’m willing to back?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a year where the movie business was defined almost entirely by pauses and delays, Warner Bros. took decisive action on December 3.</p>
<p>It had only been a couple of weeks since the studio had announced that in the face of surging coronavirus numbers, it wouldn&#8217;t be delaying the Christmas release of “Wonder Woman 1984” yet again. Instead, it would launch the movie simultaneously in theaters <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/wonder-woman-1984-hbo-max/"> and on HBO Max</a>, the new streaming service from its parent company WarnerMedia.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			While media/telecom executives and Wall Street investors seem willing to make big investments for a streaming-centric future, they’ll expect to see actual profits soon.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It turned out that this decision — already described as<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/22/business/media/wonder-woman-1984-hollywood-streaming.html"> a transformative moment in the industry</a>, and potentially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/28/business/media/hollywood-coronavirus-streaming.html">the beginning of the end for theaters</a> — was just the beginning. On December 3, Warner Bros. announced that it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/warner-bros-hbo-max-simultaneous-release/">follow the exact same strategy for every movie on its theatrical slate</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>This was welcome news to moviegoers eager to finally see “In the Heights” (already delayed by about a year thanks to the pandemic) or “Dune” (ditto). But while “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins and star Gal Gadot seemed to embrace this approach, declaring that it was time to share their movie with fans, other Warner Bros. filmmakers were less enthusiastic.</p>
<p>For example, “The Dark Knight” director Christopher Nolan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/christopher-nolan-hbo-max/">complained that Warner Bros. executives “don’t even understand what they’re losing.&#8221;</a> He claimed that filmmakers had gone to bed “thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service.” (Nolan’s “Tenet” was released in theaters in the fall, and its disappointing box office numbers, particularly in the U.S., probably played a big role in Warner’s decision.)</p>
<p>And in <a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/dune-denis-villeneuve-blasts-warner-bros-1234851270/">a guest column for Variety</a>, “Dune” director Denis Villeneuve pointed his finger at AT&amp;T, which acquired Time Warner several years earlier. He suggested that the streaming-centric strategy had less to do with the pandemic and more with the underwhelming launch of HBO Max over the summer.</p>
<p>“With HBO Max’s launch a failure thus far, AT&amp;T decided to sacrifice Warner Bros.’ entire 2021 slate in a desperate attempt to grab the audience’s attention,” Villeneuve wrote.</p>
<p>Barely more than a week after the Warner Bros. announcement, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/disney-investor-day/">Disney had a big presentation of its own</a>, laying out ambitious streaming plans for the next few years, with 10 Marvel shows, 10 Star Wars shows, 15 Disney/Pixar series and 15 Disney/Pixar feature films all in the pipeline for Disney+.</p>
<p>Disney’s announcements weren’t greeted with the same uproar and controversy as Warner’s — it didn’t represent a wholesale shift in its theatrical strategy (the Marvel Studios film “Black Widow” is still scheduled for a traditional release in May, for example), and unlike <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/warnermedia" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="warnermedia">WarnerMedia, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> its announcements didn’t blindside filmmakers and throw their compensation into question.</p>
<p>Still, the message to the industry and the public was similar: While Disney isn’t abandoning theaters outright, it clearly sees streaming as its future, with the studio willing to reboot any and every intellectual property (“Turner and Hooch”! “Swiss Family Robinson”! An “Alien” TV series!) to attract potential subscribers.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this month, when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/nutanix-brings-in-former-vmware-exec-as-new-ceo/">Nutanix announced it was hiring</a> former VMware COO Rajiv Ramaswami as CEO, it looked like a good match. What&#8217;s more, it pulled a key player from a market rival. Well, it seems <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/vmware" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="vmware">VMware <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> took exception to losing the executive, and <a href="https://www.vmware.com/company/news/updates/2020/vmware-statement-litigation-rajiv-ramaswami.html">filed a lawsuit</a> against him yesterday for breach of contract.</p>
<p>The company is claiming that Ramaswami had inside knowledge of the key plans of his former company and that he should have told them that he was interviewing for a job at a rival organization.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/rajiv-ramaswami" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="rajiv-ramaswami">Rajiv Ramaswami <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> failed to honor his fiduciary and contractual obligations to VMware. For at least two months before resigning from the company, at the same time he was working with senior leadership to shape VMware’s key strategic vision and direction, Mr. Ramaswami also was secretly meeting with at least the CEO, CFO, and apparently the entire Board of Directors of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nutanix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nutanix">Nutanix, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Inc. to become Nutanix’s Chief Executive Officer. He joined Nutanix as its CEO only two days after leaving VMware,&#8221; the company wrote in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As you can imagine, Nutanix didn&#8217;t agree, countering in a statement of its own that, &#8220;VMware’s lawsuit seeks to make interviewing for a new job wrongful. We view VMware’s misguided action as a response to losing a deeply valued and respected member of its leadership team. Mr. Ramaswami and Nutanix have gone above and beyond to be proactive and cooperative with VMware throughout the transition.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time of the hiring, analyst Holger Mueller from Constellation Research noted that the two companies were primary competitors and hiring Ramawami was was a big win for Nutanix. &#8220;So hiring Ramaswami brings both an expert for multicloud to the Nutanix helm, as well as weakening a key competitor from a talent perspective,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/nutanix-brings-in-former-vmware-exec-as-new-ceo/">he told me earlier this month</a>.</p>
<p>Mueller doesn&#8217;t see much chance of the suit succeeding. &#8220;It’s been a long time since the last lawsuit happened in Silicon Valley [involving] a tech exec jumping ship. Being an &#8217;employment at will&#8217; state, these suits are typically unsuccessful,&#8221; he told me this morning.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;The interesting part of the VMware v. Nutanix lawsuit is, does a high-ranking executive interviewing with a competitor equal a break of confidentiality by itself, or does material information have to be breached to reach the point. Traditionally the right to (confidentially) interview has been protected by the courts,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what the end game would be in this type of legal action, but it does complicate matters for Nutanix as it transitions to a new chief executive. Ramaswami took over from co-founder Dheeraj Pandey, who announced plans to leave the post last summer.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed Monday in Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite the pandemic keeping us in one place most of the time, proptech is still <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/this-is-a-good-time-to-start-a-proptech-company/">taking off</a>. And not just in the U.S.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dongnae.com/">Dongnae</a> is looking to digitize the rental and home-buying market in South Korea. The startup is announcing the close of a $4.1 million seed round, led by Flybridge and MetaProp, with participation by Goodwater Capital, Maple VC and a variety of strategic angel investors in both Korea and the U.S. This brings Dongnae&#8217;s total funding to $4.8 million.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Matthew Shampine, who was born in Korea but raised in New Jersey. Running WeWork Labs, Shampine was stationed in Asia and then more specifically Korea to build out that arm of the massive coworking firm. Moving a lot, Shampine realized the massive hole in the very fragmented real estate market in Korea.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dongnae is very similar to Redfin in the U.S., giving buyers and renters a centralized place to find their new home. For now, the startup only represents the buyer/renter side, partnering with the thousands of brokers in Korea to essentially build out the country&#8217;s first true MLS (multiple listing system).</p>
<p>Some important context: The real estate market in Korea is very different than here in the states. First, most buildings have their own broker with retail space on the ground floor, meaning that there are thousands of brokers in Korea who only represent a limited number of properties. In fact, Shampine says there are about the same number of brokers in Korea as in the U.S., which has has a much bigger population.</p>
<p>Secondly, due to the fragmentation across brokers, there is no real MLS in Korea that unifies all available properties. Renters and buyers must work across dozens of brokers and usually have to go see the space in person, rather than browse photos online. This system also means that the brokers are often representing both the buyer/renter and seller, which means they aren&#8217;t always negotiating in the best interest of the buyer.</p>
<p>Dongnae partners with brokers to centralize all the listings into one place, and gives buyers and renters an interface to browse those homes. In fact, Dongnae offers a Tinder-like experience for buyers, letting them swipe left and right on homes to learn more and more about what they&#8217;re looking for and ultimately serve up the best fit.</p>
<p>Not unlike Airbnb, Dongnae goes from complex to complex and builds out the digital inventory for each listing, taking 4K photos and watermarking them and passing them back to the broker, while also listing them on Dongnae.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not necessarily a franchise but it&#8217;s a really close partnership,&#8221; said Shampine.</p>
<p>Dongnae makes money by taking a buyer-side fee, just like any other broker, which is around 8% in Korea. The team is 25 people strong and gender diversity at Dongnae is about 50/50.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket launch startup Skyroot is closing out 2020 with a key milestone in the development program for their Vikram-I launch vehicle: A successful test firing of a solid rocket propulsion stage that serves as a demonstrator of the same tech to be used in the production Vikram. This is the first time that a private Indian company has designed, built and tested a solid rocket propulsion stage in its entirety, and follows a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/indias-first-private-space-launch-startup-skyroot-succeeds-with-upper-stage-engine-fire-test/"> successful engine burn test of an upper-stage prototype earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>Skyroot also created its solid rocket stage using a carbon composite structure whose manufacturing process is entirely automated, the company says. That allows it to realize weight savings of up to five times versus use of steel, a material typically used to house solid rocket propellant stages. The goal is to use the same process in the production of the final version of Vikram-I, which will help the small launch vehicle realize big benefits in terms of cost, in addition to the reliability benefits that come with the relatively uncomplicated fundamental design of solid rockets, which have no moving parts and therefore less opportunity for failure.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/VF6DgH1jxK4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The final third-stage Vikram-1 engine will be 4x the size of this demonstrator, and Skyroot is also in the process of manufacturing four other test solid rocket motors, which have a carrying range of thrust, and which will be tested throughout the course of next year as work finishes on their construction.</p>
<p>Skyroot aims to perform its first Vikram-I launch by next December, supported in part by the Indian Space Research Organization. The company has raised $4.3 million to date, and says it&#8217;s currently in the process of raising another $15 million. which it&#8217;ll aim to close next year. It&#8217;s set to become the first private Indian company to build and operate private launch vehicles, with the regulatory framework now in place to allow that to happen since India opened up private launcher operations earlier this year.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Early in the pandemic, it was apparent that there would be worldwide lockdowns of varying degrees. So naturally, there was a run on toilet paper (and to a lesser extent, paper towels and tissues). Stores suddenly found themselves sold out of one of the most basic conveniences consumed by humans.</p>
<p>We had never seen this level of preparation, and the supply chains were not ready. They were still moving at the speed of business-as-usual, creating a gap between supply and demand.</p>
<p>Sliding further into the pandemic, this supply issue for basic goods shifted to the front-line workers who were stretching the safe limits of their personal protective equipment (PPE). This exposed the effect of a sudden change of demand in supply chains. Companies began to repurpose their production to produce protection equipment and hand sanitizer. Some to make a quick profit, others to fill a need in the supply chain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			It is time for companies and entire industries to rethink and transform their global supply chain models — in close collaboration with governments.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Governments and corporations were scrambling. There were spreadsheets floating around with offers from potential suppliers.</p>
<p>During this period, it was difficult to get an overview of the entire market, as quality, vendor search and price fluctuations caused general chaos. It was near impossible to track the origin of production, receive any information about any data related to the quality controls of production facilities. The market was flooded with bad products, fakes and so on. Think pieces started to appear with a beginner&#8217;s guide to supply chain structure.</p>
<p>Consumers began to understand that the system as it stood was not built for this type of upheaval.</p>
<h2>Corporate sourcing strategies have been challenged</h2>
<p>We have clearly witnessed that companies have little control of the supply chains. Normally most companies only have a moderately competent risk plan for tier one suppliers. We can only assume that this is why most of us are going without an Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 this holiday season. These are not products that are built with components from one source; there are multiple components and materials that go into creating one of these machines.</p>
<p>From the refining process of the outer materials, to the dyeing colors, plastic elements and the need to have low-cost production sites in low-cost countries, all contribute to possible delays in production when things are not moving as they should be. De-constructing a gaming console reveals an extremely complicated matrix of companies, processes, materials and countries.</p>
<p>If we had direct visibility into the journey of each component in a gaming console as a sort of smart-representation exposing all the materials, people involved, companies and locations, we would be able to pinpoint inefficiencies in the supply chain.</p>
<p>All these materials and components find their way in the supply chain, but their stories get lost along the way. That specific data is not available, and thus both companies and countries are struggling to create effective risk plans for world events that throw the supply chain into chaos. Currently, there is a revolution happening under the radar of most people, enabled by distributed ledger technologies (blockchain) to bring such transparency into the supply chains.</p>
<h2>Identify your vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>Understanding where the risks lie so that companies can protect themselves may require a lot of digging. It entails going far beyond the first and second tiers and mapping full supply chains, including distribution facilities and transportation hubs. This is time-consuming and expensive, which explains why most major firms have focused their attention only on strategic direct suppliers that account for large amounts of their expenditures.</p>
<p>But a surprise disruption that brings a business to a halt can be much more costly than a deep look into a supply chain.</p>
<p>The goal of the mapping process should be to categorize suppliers as low, medium, or high risk and build appropriate mitigation strategies. But this approach is only possible if we can access the data generated by different suppliers at any tier in the supply chain — and we can trust this data for analysis.</p>
<p>The aim is to have early warnings of delays or disruptions, allowing for either the diversification of sources or the stockpiling of key materials or items. Of course, that is all speculative as we have a vaccine rolling out, only months after running out of toilet paper.</p>
<h2>Pandemic and the vaccine and supply chains</h2>
<p>What we thought was a global and free market was challenged this year. Medical companies experienced a lack of capability to source some core ingredients, such as active ingredients in headache pills produced in India. Everything became a national fight to secure needed goods for one&#8217;s own country — a trend also enhanced by the increased nationalism and protectionism in trade. The need for control and visibility into supply chains was apparent and also became a priority for governments and not only the private sector.</p>
<p>With the rollout of a vaccine (or several vaccines), we not only will see the issues presented above in the sense of risk, control of sourcing and process, but quality and responsibility as well. From fakes to already active cyberattacks targeting a<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-vaccines-cyber/ibm-warns-hackers-targeting-covid-vaccine-cold-chain-supply-process-idUSL1N2II05A"> very specific point</a> of the supply chain process (vaccines must be shipped and held at a certain temperature) we’re seeing the need for decentralized logistic systems that tell the story of every touch point in production. But none of this will matter if governments cannot manage their own supply chain needs,<a href="https://t.co/tIG1k4usTF"> as we’re already seeing</a>.</p>
<p>It is possible that lessons will be learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. It is time for companies and entire industries to rethink and transform their global supply chain models — in close collaboration with governments. One thing is for sure, the pandemic has already exposed the vulnerabilities of many organizations, especially those who have a solid dependence on global sourcing for raw or finished materials.</p>
<p>The good news is that new supply chain technologies are emerging that will heighten visibility across supply chains, reducing risk and creating an infrastructure that can handle the volatility of the next pandemic. The application of distributed ledger technology has already proven to be useful as a solution to ensure accountability and trust in the data provided along the supply chain. Digital supply networks will slowly replace linear supply chain models, breaking down functional silos to create end-to-end visibility, collaboration, agility and optimization.</p>
<p>That is good news for the future, especially since we’re all experts in supply chain logistics after nearly a year of working from home, stockpiling toilet paper and clicking refresh to hopefully add one of the not-nearly-enough gaming consoles to our cart.</p>
