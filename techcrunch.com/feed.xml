					<description><![CDATA[2020 is ending better than we might have hoped.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As 2020 comes to a close, some parts of the startup world are completing a loop, ending the year where they began.</p>
<p>Startup valuations, for example, as seen in the Silicon Valley area are effectively back to where they were at the start of the year. According to <a href="http://www.fenwick.com/vcflash">a report</a> from <a href="https://www.fenwick.com/">Fenwick &amp; West</a> examining data through October in the San Francisco Bay area, the percentage of startups that raised up rounds (rounds priced higher than preceding investments) came within spitting distance of its pre-COVID levels.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/army-air-force-exchange-service" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="army-air-force-exchange-service">The Exchange <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>There are other positive signs in the data for startup bulls.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Median and average price increases for startup valuations in the Valley have both crested their 2019 averages. The gains have proven especially sharp amongst software startups, which managed somewhat epic valuation gains in October; Fenwick&#8217;s data, something <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/so-much-for-pessimism/">we&#8217;ve covered before on The Exchange</a>, lags the calendar month somewhat.</p>
<p>This morning, let&#8217;s take a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">break from IPOs</a> to look at startup health in the region still generally heralded as its promised land.</p>
<h2>Revenge of the bulls</h2>
<p>As optimism for business conditions — tech-focused startups in particular — improved in Q3, startup valuations kicked off Q4 on a strong note.</p>
<p>In October, Silicon Valley startup investments that were priced <em>up</em> from their preceding deal rose to 79%. That&#8217;s down from what Fenwick reports as 2019&#8217;s average, but a dip from 83% to 79% is not much. Notably, startups in the region managed to reach an up-round percentage of rounds in the mid-to-high-seventies over the summer, but during those months down rounds were 11% to 17% of the total.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google Photos is rolling out a series of updates to its <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/photos/relive-your-best-memories-new-features-google-photos/">Memories</a> feature, which surfaces your best photos from years past. Over the next month, Memories will be expanded to include 3D Cinematic photos, updated collage designs, and new types of Memories, the company says. These &#8220;new types&#8221; of Memories may include those of the most important people in your life or your favorite things &#8212; like sunsets, activities such as baking or hiking, or whatever else seems to matter most to you, based on the photos you upload.</p>
<p>Google notes that you can<a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/9454489"> hide specific</a> people or time periods in the app if there are parts of your photo history you don&#8217;t want to see resurfaced in Memories. You can also <a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/9454489">toggle off</a> the option to be notified about Memories, if this is not a feature you like.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087024" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087024" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2087024" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/E801_Photos_Memories_GIF_01_Memories-1.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087024" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new types of Memories come following a challenging year where users have been stuck at home due to the pandemic, and often have found diversion and entertainment in a different set of activities. Instead of going to large gatherings, like concerts or parties, or flying to new destinations, many people have stayed closer to home and spent their time with families. The new Memories will help to surface some of these &#8220;favorite activities&#8221; we engaged in during a year when people may not have taken as many personal photos as before.</p>
<p>Google Photos&#8217; new 3D Cinematic images, meanwhile, are being created using machine learning which predicts the image&#8217;s depth to produce a 3D representation of the scene. This will work even if the original photo didn&#8217;t include depth information from the camera, Google notes. The feature then animates a virtual camera for a smooth panning effect, the results of which are meant to make reliving your memories feel more vivid.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087020" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087020" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2087020" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/comparison_6.gif?w=500" alt="" width="500" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087020" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>As Google Photos creates new Cinematic Photos, you&#8217;ll be alerted through a notification. The new image will appear in the recent highlights section at the top of the photo grid. You can then share that photo with friends or family, or send it as a video.</p>
<p>You may have already spotted the new collage designs, which began to roll out to some Google Photos users earlier in December.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087022" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087022" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2087022" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0.png?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0.png 2160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0.png?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0.png?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0.png?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0.png?resize=1152,2048 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087022" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The collages let you create almost scrapbook-like designs with your photos &#8212; but instead of using paper and decorations, Google Photos will design the layouts using A.I. This includes picking the background to match the selection of photos, finding similar colors, and then using those to accent the font and the background of the collage, the company says.</p>
<p>All features will finish rolling out over the next month, Google notes. You&#8217;ll need an updated version of the Google Photos app to see the enhancements.</p>

<p>&#8220;This means you don&#8217;t have to manage multiple profiles or API credentials for different test and production environments like you would normally have if you worked in a terminal,&#8221; Vogels said. &#8220;With these credentials automatically forwarded, it is simple to start a new CloudShell session and use the pre-installed AWS tools right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of the usual AWS command-line tools will also be pre-installed and ready to go, in addition to Bash, Python, Node.js, PowerShell, VIM, git and more. That also means you&#8217;ll be able to install your own favorite tools, too. The OS won&#8217;t persist between sessions, so if you break something, you can just restart, but you will get up to 1GB of persistent storage to work with.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087406" style="width: 912px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cs_open_3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087406" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087406" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cs_open_3.png" alt="" width="902" height="587" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cs_open_3.png 902w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cs_open_3.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cs_open_3.png?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cs_open_3.png?resize=768,500 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cs_open_3.png?resize=680,443 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cs_open_3.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2087406" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> AWS</p></div></p>
<p>Users can have up to 10 concurrent shells running in each region for free. Developers who need more will have to request an increase.</p>
<p>The new service is now available in AWS&#8217;s <span title="">US East (N. Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, <span title="">Europe (Ireland)</span>, and <span title="">Asia Pacific (Tokyo)</span> regions, with more to follow.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that AWS competitors Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure already offer similar services as well &#8212; and Google also calls it <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell">Cloud Shell</a>, but with a space between the two words.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European lawmakers have introduced two<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/digital-services-act-package"> legislative proposals</a> as part of a major policy reboot to update regional rules for digital business and rein in big tech.</p>
<p>The Digital Services Act (DSA) will update the bloc&#8217;s long-standing ecommerce rules while widening requirements to define areas of additional responsibility around content &#8212; such as how platforms must handle illegal content or dangerous third party products through mechanisms like standardized reporting and verification checks.</p>
<p>The Commission says the DSA is about bringing online rules up to speed with rules that already apply for offline business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A second legislative package, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), proposes a system whereby a sub-set of key Internet players are deemed &#8216;gatekeepers&#8217; and required to abide by specific additional conditions &#8212; with the overarching goal of fostering competition in digital markets which can be prone to &#8216;winner takes all&#8217; dynamics.</p>
<p>The DMA is expected to apply to tech giants like Amazon and Google, though the Commission avoided naming any names today.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the bloc&#8217;s response to concerns that competition rules have not been able to keep pace with the market-denting power of a handful of data-mining, attention-dominating Internet giants &#8212; hence coming for them with an <em>ex ante</em> regulation that puts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/europe-to-limit-how-big-tech-can-push-its-own-services-and-use-third-party-data/">limits on practices like self-preferencing</a> and data use, and requirements to support interoperability.</p>
<p>Top-line fines under the proposals laid out today are up to between 6% (in the DSA) and 10% (in the DMA) of global annual turnover &#8212; higher than the maximum 4% allowed for under the bloc&#8217;s existing General Data Protection Regulation framework (albeit it&#8217;s hard to imagine those maximums ever being levied, as GDPR maximums haven&#8217;t &#8212; but they make for an eye-catching headline).</p>
<p>An idea the Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/europe-asks-for-views-on-platform-governance-and-competition-tools/">consulted on earlier this year</a> &#8212; to introduce a new competition tool for digital markets to prevent tipping &#8212; does not appear to have made it to the legislative proposal stage.</p>
<p>The Commission has been working on its grand plan to reboot the EU&#8217;s digital rulebook since before president Ursula von der Leyen took up her mandate a year ago. EVP <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/margrethe-vestager" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="margrethe-vestager">Margrethe Vestager <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> told Europe&#8217;s parliament in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/08/europes-recharged-antitrust-chief-makes-her-five-year-pitch-to-be-digital-evp/">October 2019</a> that new regulations are needed to build trust in digital services and thereby underpin the bloc&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/tech-driven-change-a-key-priority-for-new-ec-president/">strategic push for digitalization</a> to drive the next decades of economic growth.</p>
<p>Vestager and internal markets commissioner, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/thierry-breton" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="thierry-breton">Thierry Breton, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> are responsible for leading the digital policy package. Public <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/europe-asks-for-views-on-platform-governance-and-competition-tools/">consultations</a> on the proposals ran for many months this year. But <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/margrethe-vestager-thierry-breton-europe-big-tech-regulation-digital-services-markets-act/">internal EU debate and division</a> over exactly how to regulate digital services appears to have contributed to some of the delays though the commissioners denied it had added a last minute delay to today&#8217;s press announcement (which had already been postponed twice, from dates earlier in the month).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087368" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087368" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2087368" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-at-16.36.52.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-at-16.36.52.png 1884w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-at-16.36.52.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-at-16.36.52.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-at-16.36.52.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-at-16.36.52.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-at-16.36.52.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-at-16.36.52.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087368" class="wp-caption-text">Commission EVP Margrethe Vestager (Image credit: European Commission livestream)</p></div></p>
<p>Today marks the start of an even longer road for the Commission to secure backing for and firm up the legislative proposals with the other EU institutions &#8212; the Council and the parliament &#8212; a process that will take months at least.</p>
<p>It could in fact be years before the DSA and DMA become law and start being applied (though the Commission said the intention is to have short implementation period once both are adopted, of three months and six months respectively).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">Enforcement of existing EU digital rules</a> is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/gdpr-enforcement-must-level-up-to-catch-big-tech-report-warns/">hardly a shining example of efficient process</a>. So questions over how to translate the planned requirements for platforms, small and massive, into a functional, friction-free operational on-the-ground reality will persist. Enforcement of the DSA and DMA is slated to be the responsibility of various resourced Member State-level agencies &#8212; but with the Commission monitoring how it&#8217;s going and retaining some power to step in if required.</p>
<p>Breton denied that the planned enforcement framework will be akin to GDPR &#8212; but it&#8217;s hard to see how it won&#8217;t suffer from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">some of the same problems</a>.</p>
<p>Tech giants are also of course used to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/facebook-seeks-fresh-legal-delay-to-block-order-to-suspend-its-transatlantic-data-transfers/">flexing legal muscle to challenge European regulation</a> that threatens their business interests &#8212; so there&#8217;s no reason to think they won&#8217;t apply the same playbook to try to avoid being labelled a &#8216;gatekeeper&#8217; and getting saddled with a list of &#8216;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8217; in the first place.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: Tighter European regulation of digital business and big tech is coming down the pipe, regardless of whether it has the intended effect. Today the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/">UK also set out further details of a national plan</a> to regulate a range of online harms (also proposing fines of up to 10% of turnover), saying it will introduce an Online Safety Bill next year.</p>
<p>The European Commission also has a number of other legislative proposals in train as part of its overarching digital strategy &#8212; including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/">Data Governance Act</a> and another forthcoming data act to create a regulatory framework to encourage the reuse of industrial data; as well as plans to set risk-based rules for artificial intelligence which it&#8217;s due to unveil next year, after publishing a white paper in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais/">February</a>.</p>
<p>Highlights of the DSA and DMA proposals from today&#8217;s Commission briefing follow below.</p>
<h2>The Digital Services Act</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act-ensuring-safe-and-accountable-online-environment_en">DSA</a> will place new due diligence obligations on digital services to swiftly remove illegal content and in parallel explain what&#8217;s been done and why &#8212; as well as offering users an option to complain.</p>
<p>Online marketplaces will also have a new &#8216;Know Your Customer&#8217; obligation &#8212; to try to tackle counterfeit and/or dangerous products &#8212; meaning they will be required to verify the identity of a seller before allowing them to trade on their platform.</p>
<p>A third requirement focuses on algorithmic transparency/explainability &#8212; meaning platforms will need to explain rankings and hierarchies they generate, such as products they feature or recommend.</p>
<p>They will not, however, be required to reveal the algorithms themselves.</p>
<p>Access to key data for researchers (which will apply to larger platforms) is another requirement.</p>
<h2>The Digital Markets Act</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">DMA</a> will lay extra obligations (ex ante) on large players with significant market power, and who intermediate between a threshold level of other businesses (10,000) and users (45M) per month &#8212; who will be classified as &#8216;gatekeepers&#8217;.</p>
<p>The idea is to complement existing EU competition law, with Vestager saying the DMA has been fed by multiple antitrust cases brought against the likes of Google and Amazon, in recent years.</p>
<p>She also likened it to the approach that already applies in sectors like banking and energy.</p>
<p>Per the commissioner, gatekeeper status will depend on size (as well as turnover and market cap); the role they play in the market; and their durability (how entrenched their market position is over time).</p>
<p>Gatekeepers would also need to be active in several EU Member States.</p>
<p>Vestager briefly highlighted three of the obligations that gatekeepers will be required to live up to: Their use of data; interoperability; and self-preferencing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot use the data of the people you compete with just because you can &#8212; you have to use data silos,&#8221; said Vestager, explaining how the requirements on data use will work to create &#8220;fairness in the marketplace&#8221; by levelling the risk involved for non-gatekeepers in launching new services.</p>
<p>As well as the threat of fines, she confirmed that structural remedies (such as breaking up businesses) remain possible &#8212; such as in cases of repeat breaches of the DMA.</p>
<p>Gatekeepers will also be required to notify regulators if they intend to acquire even small businesses which would not normally trigger a notification requirement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, a YC-incubated startup that offers developers an open-source alternative to Google&#8217;s Firebase and similar platforms, today announced that it has raised a $6 million funding round led by Coatue, with participation from YC, Mozilla and a group of about 20 angel investors.</p>
<p>Currently, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/supabase" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="supabase">Supabase <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> includes support for <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/guides/database">PostgreSQL databases</a> and <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/guides/auth">authentication tools</a>, with a storage and serverless solution coming soon. It currently provides all the usual tools for working with databases &#8212; and listening to database changes &#8212; as well as a web-based UI for managing them. The team is quick to note that while the comparison with Google&#8217;s Firebase is inevitable, it is not meant to be a 1-to-1 replacement for it. And unlike <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/firebase" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="firebase">Firebase, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which uses a NoSQL database, Supabase is using PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>Indeed, the team relies heavily on existing open-source projects and contributes to them where it can. One of Supabase&#8217;s full-time employees maintains the <a href="https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/">PostgREST tool</a> for building APIs on top of the database, for example.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not trying to build another system,&#8221; Supabase co-founder and CEO Paul Copplestone told me. &#8220;We just believe that already there are well-trusted, scalable enterprise open-source products out there and they just don&#8217;t have this usability component. So actually right now, Supabase is an amalgamation of six tools, soon to be seven. Some of them we built ourselves. If we go to market and can&#8217;t find anything that we think is going to be scalable &#8212; or really solve the problems &#8212; then we&#8217;ll build it and we&#8217;ll open-source it. But otherwise, we&#8217;ll use existing tools.&#8221;</p>

<p>The traditional route to market for open-source tools is to create a tool and then launch a hosted version &#8212; maybe with some additional features &#8212; to monetize the work. Supabase took a slightly different route and launched a hosted version right away.</p>
<p>If somebody would want to host the service themselves, the code is available, but running your own PaaS is obviously a major challenge, but that&#8217;s also why the team went with this approach. What you get with Firebase, he noted, is that it&#8217;s a few clicks to set everything up. Supabase wanted to be able to offer the same kind of experience. &#8220;That&#8217;s one thing that self-hosting just cannot offer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t really get the same wow factor that you can if we offered a hosted platform where you literally [have] one click and then a couple of minutes later, you&#8217;ve got everything set up.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, he also noted that he wanted to make sure the company could support the growing stable of tools it was building and commercializing its tools based on its database services was the easiest way to do so<em>.</em></p>
<p>Like other Y Combinator startups, Supabase closed its funding round after the accelerator&#8217;s demo day in August. The team had considered doing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/08/why-safe-notes-are-not-safe-for-entrepreneurs/">SAFE round</a>, but it found the right group of institutional investors that offered founder-friendly terms to go ahead with this institutional round instead.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to cost us a lot to compete with the generous free tier that Firebase offers,&#8221; Copplestone said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s databases, right? So it&#8217;s not like you can just keep them stateless and shut them down if you&#8217;re not really using them. [This funding round] gives us a long, generous runway and more importantly, for the developers who come in and build on top of us, [they can] take as long as they want and then start monetizing later on themselves.<em>&#8220;</em></p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to continue to invest in its various tools and hire to support its growth.</p>
<p>“<span class="il">Supabase</span>’s value proposition of building in a weekend and scaling so quickly hit home immediately,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caryn-marooney/">Caryn Marooney</a>, general partner at Coatue and Facebook&#8217;s former VP of Global Communications. “We are proud to work with this team, and we are excited by their laser focus on developers and their commitment to speed and reliability.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> has a lot going on, and it&#8217;s not always easy to manage that kind of scale on your own. Today, Amazon announced that <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/twitter-selects-aws-strategic-provider-serve-timelines">Twitter has signed a multi-year agreement with AWS</a> to run its real-time timelines. It&#8217;s a major win for Amazon&#8217;s cloud arm.</p>
<p>While the companies have worked together in some capacity for over a decade, this marks the first time that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is tapping AWS to help run its core timelines.</p>
<p>&#8220;This expansion onto AWS marks the first time that Twitter is leveraging the public cloud to scale their real-time service. Twitter will rely on the breadth and depth of AWS, including capabilities in compute, containers, storage, and security, to reliably deliver the real-time service with the lowest latency, while continuing to develop and deploy new features to improve how people use Twitter,&#8221; the company explained in the announcement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Parag Agrawal, Chief Technology Officer at Twitter sees this as a way to expand and improve the company&#8217;s real-time offerings by taking advantage of AWS&#8217;s network of data centers to deliver content closer to the user. &#8220;The collaboration with AWS will improve performance for people who use Twitter by enabling us to serve Tweets from data centers closer to our customers at the same time as we leverage the Arm-based architecture of AWS <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/aws-announces-new-arm-based-instances-with-graviton2-processors/">Graviton2 instances</a>. In addition to helping us scale our infrastructure, this work with AWS enables us to ship features faster as we apply AWS’s diverse and growing portfolio of services,&#8221; Agrawal said in a statement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Twitter also has a relationship with Google Cloud. In 2018, it announced it was moving its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/03/twitter-is-moving-a-portion-of-its-infrastructure-to-google-cloud/">Hadoop clusters to GCP</a>.</p>
<p>This announcement could be considered a case of the rich getting richer as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/cloud-infrastructure-revenue-grows-33-this-quarter-to-almost-33b/">AWS is the leader</a> in the cloud infrastructure market by far with around 33% market share. Microsoft is in second with around 18% and Google is in third with 9%, <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/cloud-market-growth-rate-nudges-amazon-and-microsoft-solidify-leadership">according to Synergy Research</a>. In its most <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/amazon-crushes-q3-expectations-but-aws-growth-slowed-to-29/">recent earnings report</a>, Amazon reported that $11.6 billion in AWS revenue putting it on a run rate of over $46 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://parsec.app">Parsec</a>, a startup that&#8217;s built streaming technology for both work and play, is announcing that it has raised $25 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>This brings <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parsec-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parsec-2">Parsec&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> total funding to $33 million, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/parsec-2">according to Crunchbase</a>. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz, with the firm&#8217;s general partner Martin Casado joining the board. Previous investors Lerer Hippeau, Makers Fund, NextView Ventures and Notation Capital also participated.</p>
<p>CEO Benjy Boxer told me that since he and CTO Chris Dickson founded the company in 2016, the vision has always been &#8220;to make it easier for people to connect to their technology, software and content from anywhere, on any device.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They started out by helping gamers access their gaming PCs from other devices (the Parsec app is currently available Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, Raspberry Pi and the web).</p>
<p>&#8220;From the beginning, we thought that if we could build something that is great for gaming, it will be great for everything,&#8221; Boxer said.</p>
<p>But it was a natural transition to other use cases, since some of the people using Parsec to play games in their free time also turned out to work at TV production companies, video game companies or in other jobs where they need access to high-end workstations. That&#8217;s why the company launched <a href="https://parsec.app/teams/">Parsec for Teams</a> this year, which offers the same low-latency remote experience, while also adding features like encryption, group permissions and collaboration on the same file.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087357" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087357" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2087357" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_117.jpg?w=680" alt="Parsec screenshot" width="680" height="439" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_117.jpg 2161w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_117.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_117.jpg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_117.jpg?resize=768,496 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_117.jpg?resize=680,439 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_117.jpg?resize=1536,992 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_117.jpg?resize=2048,1323 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_117.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087357" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Parsec</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The performance of Parsec is just way above everything else,&#8221; Boxer said. &#8220;People forget they’re using Parsec.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parsec works with major gaming clients like EA, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/45cqHYDIE4CGhEE6y9VUXr/how-ubisoft-organized-playable-demos-during-a-pandemic">Ubisoft</a>, Blizzard Entertainment and Square Enix, and it&#8217;s also being used in industries like architecture, engineering and video broadcast/production/post-production.</p>
<p>And as you might imagine, the need for something like this has only increased during the pandemic. Boxer said customers have found that the platform is saving their employees more than an hour a day by eliminating the commute and giving them high-speed access to their workstations — rather than, say, having to wait an hour for a 100 gigabyte file to download.</p>
<p>And most of those clients anticipate that after the pandemic, their employees will continue for work from home for part of the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;So in that scenario, people are bringing their computers back to the office, and they can use Parsec to make sure it&#8217;s always accessible to them,&#8221; Boxer said.</p>
<p>On the consumer side, he said that where usage was previously heaviest during the weekends, during the pandemic &#8220;there&#8217;s no spike anymore on the weekends, people are playing all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boxer added that the company will continue developing the core platform, leading to improvements for both gaming and enterprise users, while there&#8217;s a separate team focused on building administrative and collaborative features.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In its latest bid to outspend the competition on podcasting exclusives, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/spotify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="spotify">Spotify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> this morning announced that it has signed a multi-year deal with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7kz7cRLYAcPiWxqiKw1nlG">Archewell Audio</a>, a new production founded by Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markel, The Duchess of Sussex. Financial details haven’t been disclosed, but given the profile of the names and the cost of previous exclusives, it seems safe to suggest the company paid a pretty penny here.</p>
<p>The first full podcast series is expected to arrive at some point in 2021, and like all Spotify podcasts, will be free for subscribers. Before then, however, Archewell and Spotify-owned Gimlet will release a holiday special co-hosted by the Duke and Duchess. As you’d imagine, that’s set to be released at some point this month. They will continue to both produce and host shows for the duration of the deal.</p>
<p>Here’s what the pair had to say in a joint statement offered to Spotify,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>What we love about podcasting is that it reminds all of us to take a moment and to really listen, to connect to one another without distraction. With the challenges of 2020, there has never been a more important time to do so, because when we hear each other, and hear each other’s stories, we are reminded of how interconnected we all are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spotify, of course, has been spending hundreds of millions over the past couple of years to build a library of exclusive podcasting content. Last month the music streaming service spent $235 million to buy ad company, Megaphone. Other high-profile acquisitions include Gimlet, The Ringer, Parcast and Anchor. The company also signed controversial host Joe Rogan to a multi-year deal in excess of $100 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the course of the last few years, Skylum made a name for itself with a set of photo-editing apps like Aurora HDR and Luminar. With <a href="https://skylum.com/luminar-ai">Luminar AI</a>, it is now launching a brand-new photo editor, starting at $79. The new application, available as a standalone product for Mac and Windows and as a plug-in for Lightroom and Photos for MacOS, was built from the ground up and offers many of the traditional photo-editing features you&#8217;re probably familiar with from the likes of Lightroom. The focus, though, is on its new AI-based tools, with a special focus on editing landscapes (and skies in general) and portrait shoots.</p>
<p>In total, Skylum added 13 AI features to the application. You can use those to improve your composition, replace the sky in your images (and relight the scene accordingly), add fog, mist and haze, and manipulate the faces and bodies of your portrait subjects by simply dragging a few sliders.</p>
<p>The idea here is to make it very easy for beginners to improve their photos while also giving pros the tools to quickly get the results they are looking for.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Our approach to AI lines up with that of the best minds in the field. What differentiates it, however, is our human-centric application of this incredibly powerful technology. In my experience, only 30% of our time is actually spent being creative,” said Alex Tsepko, CEO of Skylum. “Luminar AI uses artificial intelligence to flip those metrics. We created Luminar AI so people can focus on the outcomes and photos, and not worry so much about the editing process.”</p>

<p>For beginners, the place to start is Luminar AI&#8217;s templates, which you can think of as very advanced filters that go well beyond what <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is capable of. The application automatically classifies the image to get started (say landscape or portrait) and gives you a list of matching templates. That&#8217;s cool and often a good start, but chances are if you invest in a tool like this, you&#8217;ll want more granular control.</p>
<p>Luminar AI&#8217;s marquee feature is its Sky AI, which lets you replace the sky in your images with a few clicks. To do this, you choose from a set of pre-made skies, including sunsets, or create your own library. Either way, the application can then relight the whole scene based on what that sky looks like. It works surprisingly well. There&#8217;s also an Augmented Sky AI, which is a bit more gimmicky and lets you add birds, planes and balloons to the sky. It&#8217;s not for me, but expect to see a lot of balloons in your favorite influencers&#8217; images in the near future. For more subtle changes, you can opt for the Sky Enhancer AI, which makes your sky pop a little bit more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086862" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086862" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2086862" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="658" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg 2800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg?resize=768,494 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg?resize=680,437 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg?resize=1536,987 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg?resize=2048,1317 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2086862" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Skylum</p></div></p>
<p>For more general editing, the Accent AI tool is quite useful to adjust brightness, contrast and color, while Structure AI brings more clarity to an image.</p>
<p>Skylum promises that those adjustments won&#8217;t look unnatural, but your mileage may vary. Indeed &#8212; and this depends on your personal tastes &#8212; I found that for the best results, only moving the sliders 10 or 20 points was often enough. Anything more and you run the risk of creating some pretty garish images.</p>
<p>The portrait features include Body AI, Iris AI, Face AI and Skin AI. They make it exceedingly easy to perform the kind of retouching operations that would usually take a long time in Photoshop, be that bringing out a subject&#8217;s eyes, whitening teeth or removing blemishes from their skin.</p>

<p>But while tools to change clouds in your landscapes and add bokeh to your shots are pretty uncontroversial for anybody but the most extreme of photography purists, having tools that can easily slim down anybody&#8217;s body or face with just a few clicks is something else.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t necessarily the place to litigate the ethics of portrait retouching and the toxicity of body shaming on social networks, but it&#8217;s something to be aware of, especially given how easy Luminar AI makes it to retouch bodies and faces and how effective the tool is. For what it&#8217;s worth, I tend to find myself feeling rather queazy using this side of Luminar AI&#8217;s tools.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tive.co/">Tive</a>, a Boston-based startup, is building a hardware and software platform to help track the conditions of a shipment like say food or medicine to make sure it is stored under the proper conditions as it moves from farm or factory to market. Today, the company announced a $12 million Series A.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rre-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rre-ventures">RRE Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> led the round with help from new investor Two Sigma Ventures and existing investors NextView Ventures, Hyperplane Ventures, One Way Ventures, Fathom Ventures and other unnamed individuals. The company has now raised close to $17 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tive" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tive">Tive <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> helps companies all over the world track their shipments in a very specific way,&#8221; company co-founder and CEO Krenar Komoni told me. Using a tracking device the company created, customers can press a button, place the tracker on a palette or in a container, and it begins transmitting shipment data like temperature, shock, light exposure, humidity and location data in real time to ensure that the shipment is moving safely to market under proper conditions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said that they are the first company to create single-use 5G trackers, meaning the shipping company doesn&#8217;t have to worry about managing, maintaining, recharging or returning them (although they encourage that by giving a discount for future orders on returned items).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087288" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087288" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2087288" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-15-at-9.16.35-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="Tive tracker over computer displaying tracking data software." width="680" height="438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-15-at-9.16.35-AM.jpg 1526w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-15-at-9.16.35-AM.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-15-at-9.16.35-AM.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-15-at-9.16.35-AM.jpg?resize=768,494 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-15-at-9.16.35-AM.jpg?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-15-at-9.16.35-AM.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087288" class="wp-caption-text">Tive hardware tracker and data tracking software. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> Tive</p></div></p>
<p>The approach seems to be working. Komoni reports that revenue has grown 570% in 2020 as the product-market fit has become more acute with digitization hitting the supply chain in a big way. He says that in particular customers and investors like the company&#8217;s full-stack approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s interesting [&#8230;] and why we are resonating with customers and also why investors like it, is because we&#8217;re providing the full stack, meaning the hardware, the software, the platform and the APIs to major transportation management systems,&#8221; Komoni explained.</p>
<p>The company has 22 employees and expects to double that number in 2021. As he grows the company, Komoni says that as an immigrant founder, he&#8217;s particularly sensitive to diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m an immigrant myself. I grew up in Kosovo, came to the US when I was 17 years old, went to high school here in Vermont. I&#8217;m a US citizen, but part of who I am is being open to different cultures and different nationalities. It&#8217;s just part of my nature,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2015 and its facilities are in Boston. It has continued shipping devices throughout the pandemic, and that has meant figuring out how to operate in a safe way with some employees in the building. He expects the company will have more employees operating out of the office as we move past the pandemic. He also has an engineering operation in Kosovo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kryo, the company behind <a href="https://www.chilitechnology.com">the ChiliSleep brand</a>, is announcing that it has merged with another sleep technology company, <a href="https://www.ebbsleep.com">Ebb Therapeutics</a>, and also raised $37 million in new funding led by Ebb&#8217;s biggest investor KKR.</p>
<p>Founded in 2007, Kryo/ChiliSleep&#8217;s products include <a href="https://www.chilitechnology.com/products/chilipad-sleep-system">the chiliPAD</a>, a device designed to improve sleep by adjusting the temperature of your bed. Co-founder and CEO Tara Youngblood told me that the company has always been focused on &#8220;changing sleep through temperature regulation&#8221; — but recently, the team has also become &#8220;hungry for this software piece&#8221; that will allow them to reach consumers without hardware.</p>
<p>Ebb, meanwhile, has created <a href="https://www.ebbsleep.com/cart/?add-to-cart=59805">a cooling headband</a> that&#8217;s also supposed to help customers sleep better. Youngblood said that the two companies have &#8220;a complementary approach,&#8221; and that the merger will create a strong portfolio of combined patents.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Youngblood also said that moving forward, the company will be led by Kryo management, but she declined to comment further on whether the Ebb team will be part of the merger.</p>
<p>The plan is to launch a new software platform called Sleep.me in May, which will combine sleep-related community, content and coaching (that last piece will draw on Ebb&#8217;s existing coaching service), with free and paid offerings. Youngblood said the company will continue to sell ChiliSleep products as well, while &#8220;the Ebb product line and Ebb brand will probably go away.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087299" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087299" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2087299" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tara-Youngblood-Headshot.jpg?w=680" alt="Kryo CEO Tara Youngblood" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tara-Youngblood-Headshot.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tara-Youngblood-Headshot.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tara-Youngblood-Headshot.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tara-Youngblood-Headshot.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tara-Youngblood-Headshot.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tara-Youngblood-Headshot.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087299" class="wp-caption-text">Kryo CEO Tara Youngblood</p></div></p>
<p>Youngblood acknowledged that there&#8217;s been an explosion in sleep-related products in recent years — something she attributed to growing research and awareness around the importance of sleep to our health.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going to be different, really, with the platform is that we&#8217;re going to talk to that individual&#8221; and offer personalized advice, she said. &#8220;Thermal regulation may be a part of [your personalized approach], or it may not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Youngblood also noted that ChiliSleep has a medical advisory board that includes <a href="https://medicine.arizona.edu/person/michael-grandner-phd-mtr-cbsm-faasm">Dr. Michael Grandner</a> of the University of Arizona, <a href="http://www.cvilleneuroandsleep.com">Dr. Chris Winter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Starrett">Dr. Kelly Starrett</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Insomnia and sleep-related issues are unfortunately on the rise, but fortunately so are effective treatments to address them,&#8221; said Ali Satvat, the global head of KKR Health Care Strategic Growth, in a statement. &#8220;We are thrilled to support the merger of ChiliSleep and Ebb to bring these innovations to the market and help solve an unmet need for those who need improved sleep.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">James <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cox-4bc4" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cox-4bc4">Cox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> spent much of his professional career at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> trying to crack the problem of how to reduce congestion through ride-sharing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As one of the architects of the Uber Pool service and a longtime proponent of ride-sharing as a means to slash vehicle emissions, Cox leapt at the chance to harness technology developed at MIT that purported to perfect a dynamic routing and vehicle management system for transit authorities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That technology is at the heart of <a href="https://theroutingcompany.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://theroutingcompany.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608116439869000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFbZXxwEUxrf9vUXLq8VjyAmDhDZA">The Routing Company</a>, the startup that Cox now leads. It&#8217;s based on sofrware developed by Routing Company co-founder and chief technology officer, Alex Wallar, when he was a doctoral student at MIT focused on optimizing vehicle distributions. Working with collaborators including Daniela Rus, the director of MIT&#8217;s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and post-doc researcher Javier Alonso Mora, Wallar developed a platform that could apply real-time optimization to public transit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">In April, Wallar took the research to Menno van der Zee, and the two men developed the underlying platform that would become The Routing Company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cox came on board as an advisor to the company initially, but decided to join the ride full-time after seeing the technology that Wallar and van der Zee had developed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, with $5 million in new financing led by the MIT deeptech investment fund, <a href="http://www.engine.xyz/">The Engine</a>, and $6.5 million in total financing, the company is taking its tech to transit authorities around the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are thrilled to support The Routing Company. They have cracked the code for dynamic shared rides at scale.&#8221; said Reed Sturtevant, general partner of The Engine. &#8220;Smart ride sharing solutions for cities will have a ripple effect. Innovation in transit could quickly reduce congestion, shorten commute times for those who can&#8217;t afford to live in the city where they work, and help the environment.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The idea is to take the services that private companies had been trying to offer to consumers, and bring the benefits to everyone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The startup landscape is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/ford-is-shutting-down-chariot-shuttle-service/#:~:text=Chariot%20will%20end%20service%20on,will%20cease%20by%20February%201.&amp;text=Those%20enterprise%20routes%20in%20Austin,winding%20down%20by%20early%20March.">littered with failed private commuter services</a>, and The Routing Company hopes to circumvent the issues they faced by working with, instead of competing against, public urban transit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the US alone, public transportation is a $74 billion business&#8230; and during the COVID-19 pandemic it&#8217;s a business that&#8217;s suffering greatly.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we and all the other ridesharing companies were building shared rides algorithms in the past.. The complexity in solving the shared rides problem had not been solved in real time,&#8221; said Cox of his time at Uber. &#8220;My understanding was that it was not possible to solve it in real time. We are really making transit a customer. If you look at transit they are very good at working with high capacity routes and demand. Where they’re weaker is in low and medium density areas. This is where there’s really an opportunity to help them.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Cox sees his new company as solving a problem that specifically impacts low-income, low density communities. These areas typically aren&#8217;t serviced as well or as frequently by traditional public transit, and the tools on offer from the Routing Company give transit authorities a way to spin up a new fleet to service those areas.</p>
<p>The Routing Company sells a package that includes an app for riders, an app for drivers, and a fleet management platform for the transit agency. While it experiments with different pricing options, Cox declined to disclose how much the company is charging its initial customers, but the revenue model is based on either a per vehicle, per-month fee or on a percentage of the revenue generated per vehicle, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Each driver receives a link to download an app. The riders are capable of accessing the app in a push a button shuttle way. We have built tools to allow people to make a phone call and make an appointment with an operator,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p>The algorithms that had been developed for ride sharing in the past used an individual&#8217;s geolocation and destination to set the parameters of who would pick them up. The Routing Company flips that model by focusing on the position of an entire fleet of vehicles first and their already established routes to determine which vehicle is the best suited to pick up a passenger for a ride.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Wait times depend on the city and the number of vehicles deployed through The Routing Company, but Cox said the goal was to have passengers wait no more than 10 minutes for a pick up.  Already, one city in Scotland is using the service and The Routing Company has signed contracts with four undisclosed cities in the US an done in Australia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Plenty of people who have tried to make shuttle startups. The issue with a number of those is that the unit economics don’t work. Our approach definitely has the right technology and if we can augment public transit rather than compete with it,&#8221; Cox said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The foldable category got off to a famously rocky start. Fifteen months after the release of the first Galaxy Fold, Samsung has time to work out some of the issues with the original device in a fairly public fashion, given the world the better-received Galaxy Z Flip and Z Fold 2 this year.</p>
<p>Likely due to various stumbles from mobile manufacturers, the form factor has yet to redefine the industry in a meaningful way – but meaningful change takes time. And in case there was any doubt surrounding Samsung’s commitment to foldable displays, Mobile President <a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/featurestories/editorial-samsung-defies-one-size-fits-all-mobile-experiences-with-personalized-tech-tailor-made-for-life-in-2021">TM Roh penned a letter</a> on the company’s site, noting an expansion of the portfolio next year.</p>
<p>Whether that means an additional device or something more meaningful remains to be seen, though it does seem to suggest the arrival of at least one more affordable model. Price has certainly been a major hurdle for the adoption of these products. In the letter Roh notes that he/the company will be “sharing more in January” – perhaps an allusion to CES or a standalone Samsung event. Roh adds,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>True to our heritage of staying ahead of the curve with trailblazing mobile tech, we’ll be expanding our portfolio of foldables, so this groundbreaking category is more accessible to everyone. And while we’re already known for our revolutionary cameras, we’ll never stop trying to outdo ourselves — so be on the lookout for super-intelligent, pro-grade camera and video capabilities in 2021. We’ve also been paying attention to people’s favorite aspects of the Galaxy Note experience and are excited to add some of its most well-loved features to other devices in our lineup.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing particularly earth-shattering. With the race to 5G devices in the rear-view, the focus is seemingly back on cameras, in addition to folding screens. More after the holidays, no doubt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the course of the last year, Adobe has quietly continued to expand its tools for helping developers use PDFs in their applications. In April, the company launched a couple of SDKs, for example, which are <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2020/07/29/adobe-document-services-bring-world-class-pdf-tools-to-your-apps.html#gs.nke2rv">now known</a> as the PDF Embed API and PDF Tools API, and with that update, the company also launched its <a href="https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/dcsdk/">Adobe Document Services</a> platform. The idea here is to provide developers with easy-to-use tools to build PDFs into their applications and workflows. Today, the company is announcing a new partnership with Microsoft that brings Document Services to Power Automate, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> low-code workflow automation platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had this vision about a year and a half back where we said, &#8216;how about bringing the best of what we provide in our own apps to third-party apps as well?&#8217; &#8221; Vibhor Kapoor, Adobe&#8217;s Senior Director of Marketing for Document Services, told me. &#8220;That&#8217;s kind of the simple mindset where we said: let&#8217;s decompose the capabilities of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/acrobat" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="acrobat">Acrobat <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as microservices [and] as APIs and give it to developers and publishers because frankly, a PDF for developers and publishers has been a pain for lack of a better word. So we brought these services to life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team worked to make embedding PDFs into web experiences better, for example (and Kapoor frankly noted that previously, the developer experience had always been &#8220;very suboptimal&#8221; and that the user experience, too, was not always intuitive). Now, with Document Services and the Embed API, it&#8217;s just a matter of a few lines of JavaScript to embed a PDF.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2087105" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pdf_combine.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087105" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087105" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pdf_combine.png" alt="" width="618" height="366" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pdf_combine.png 618w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pdf_combine.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pdf_combine.png?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pdf_combine.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2087105" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p>
<p>Kapoor acknowledged that exposing these features in SDKs and APIs was a bit of a challenge, simply because the teams didn&#8217;t originally have to worry about this use case. But on top of the technical challenges, this was also a question of changing the overall mindset. &#8220;We never had a very developer-oriented offering in the past and that means that we need to build a team that understands developers, and figure out how we package these APIs and make them available,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>The new Power Automate integration brings over 20 new PDF-centric actions from the PDF Tools API to Microsoft&#8217;s platform. These will allow users to do things like create PDFs from documents in a OneDrive folder, for example, covert images to PDFs or apply optical character recognition to PDFs.</p>
<p>Since Adobe launched the platforms, about 6,000 developers have now started using it and Kapoor tells me that he is seeing &#8220;significant growth&#8221; in terms of the number of API calls that are being made. From a business perspective, adding Power Automate will also likely function as a new funnel for getting new developers on board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s only a matter of time now before drones become a key component of everyday logistics infrastructure, but there are still significant barriers between where we are today and that future – particularly when it comes to regulation. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/iris-automation-inc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="iris-automation-inc">Iris Automation <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is developing computer vision products that can help simplify the regulatory challenges involved in setting standards for pilotless flight, thanks to its detect-and-avoid technology that can run using a wide range of camera hardware. The company has raised a $13 million Series B funding round to improve and extend its tech, and to help provide demonstrations of its efficacy in partnership with regulators.</p>
<p>I spoke to Iris Automation CEO Jon Damush, and Iris Automation investor <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/tess-hatch" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="tess-hatch">Tess Hatch, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/vp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="vp">VP <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bessemer-venture-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bessemer-venture-partners">Bessemer Venture Partners, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> about the round and the startup&#8217;s progress and goals. Damush, who took over as CEO earlier this year, talked about his experience at Boeing, his personal experience as a pilot, and the impact on aviation of the advent of small, cheap and readily accessible electric motors, batteries and powerful computing modules, which have set the stage for an explosion in the commercial UAV industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve now shattered some of the barriers that have been in aerospace for the past 50 years, because you&#8217;re starting to really democratize the tools of production that allow people to make things that fly much easier than they could before,&#8221; Damush told me. &#8220;So with that, and the ability to take a human out of the cockpit, comes some interesting challenges – none more so than the regulatory environment.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The U.S. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/federal-aviation-administration" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="federal-aviation-administration">Federal Aviation Administration <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (FAA), and most airspace regulators around the world, essentially break regulations around commercial flight down into two spheres, Damush explains. The first is around operations – what are you going to do while in flight, and are you doing that the right way. The second, however, is about the pilot, and that&#8217;s a much trickier thing to adapt to pilotless aircraft.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the biggest challenges is the part of the regulations called 91.113b, and what that part of the regs states is that given weather conditions that permit, it&#8217;s the pilot on the airplane that has the ultimate responsibility to see and avoid other aircraft,&#8221;  That&#8217;s not a separation standard that says you&#8217;ve got to be three miles away, or five miles away or a mile away – that is a last line of defense, that is a safety net, so that when all the other mitigations that lead to a safe flight from A to B fail, the pilot is there to make sure you don&#8217;t collide into somebody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iris comes in here, with an optical camera-based obstacle avoidance system that uses computer vision to effectively replace this last line of defence when there isn&#8217;t a pilot to do so. And what this unlocks is a key limiting factor in today&#8217;s commercial drone regulatory environment: The ability to fly aircraft beyond visual line of sight. All that means is that drones can operate without having to guarantee that an operator has eyes on them at all times. When you first hear that, you imagine that this factors in mostly to long-distance flight, but Damush points out that it&#8217;s actually more about volume – removing the constraints of having to keep a drone within visual line of sight at all times means you can go from having one operator per drone, to one operator managing a fleet of drones, which is when the economies of scale of commercial drone transportation really start to make sense.</p>
<p>Iris has made progress towards making this a reality, working with the FAA this year as part of its integrated pilot program to demonstrate the system in two different use cases. It also released the second version of its Casia system, which can handle significantly longer range object detection. Hatch pointed out that these were key reasons why Bessemer upped its stake with this follow-on investment, and when I asked if COVID-19 has had any impact on industry appetite or confidence in the commercial drone market, she said that has been a significant factor, and it&#8217;s also changing the nature of the industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two largest industries [right now] are agriculture and public safety enforcement,&#8221; Hatch told me. &#8220;And public safety enforcement was not one of those last year, it was agriculture, construction and energy. That&#8217;s definitely become a really important vertical for the drone industry – one could imagine someone having a heart attack or an allergic reaction, an ambulance takes on average 14 minutes to get to that person, when a drone can be dispatched and deliver an AED or an epi pen within minutes, saving that person&#8217;s life. So I really hope that tailwind continues post COVID.&#8221;</p>
<p>This Series B round includes investment from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bee-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bee-partners">Bee Partners, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> OCA Ventures, and new strategic investors Sony Innovation Fund and Verizon Ventures (disclosure: TechCrunch is owned by Verizon Media Group, though we have no involvement, direct or otherwise, with their venture arm). Damush pointed out that Sony provides great potential strategic value because it develops so much of the imaging sensor stack used in the drone industry, and Sony also develops drones itself. For its part, Verizon offers key partner potential on the connectivity front, which is invaluable for managing large-scale drone operations.</p>

Syspective aims to operate a 30-satellite constellation that can provide global imaging coverage of Earth, with SAR&#8217;s benefits of being able to see through clouds and inclement weather, as well as in all lighting conditions.</p>
<p>This is Synspective&#8217;s first satellite on orbit, and it took off from Rocket Lab&#8217;s launch facility on the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand. It will operate in a sun synchronous orbit approximately 300,000 miles from Earth, and will act a a demonstrator of the startup&#8217;s technology to pave the way for the full constellation, which will provide commercially available SAR data avails both raw, and processed via the company&#8217;s in-development AI technology to provide analytics and insights.</p>
<p>For Rocket Lab, this marks the conclusion of a successful year in launch operations, which also saw the company take its key <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/complete-success-rocket-labs-booster-recovery-is-a-big-step-towards-reusability/">first steps towards making its Electron launch system partially reusable</a>. The company did have one significant setback as well, with a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/04/rocket-lab-launch-fails-during-rockets-second-stage-burn-causing-a-loss-of-vehicle-and-payloads/"> mission that failed to deliver its payloads to orbit in July</a>, but the company quickly bounced back from that failure with improvements to prevent a similar incident in future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In 2021, Rocket Lab will aim to launch its first mission from the U.S., using its new launch facility at Wallops Island, in Virginia. That initial U.S. flight was supposed to happen in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a NASA certification process for one of its systems, pushed the launch to next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tiktok">TikTok <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> this morning <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/refreshing-our-policies-to-support-community-well-being">announced</a> a new set of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=en">Community Guidelines</a> that aim to strengthen its existing policies in areas like harassment, dangerous acts, self-harm and violence, alongside the introduction of four new features similarly focused on the community&#8217;s well-being. These include updated resources for those struggling with self-harm or suicide, opt-in viewing screens that hide distressing content, a text-to-voice feature to make TikTok more accessible and an expanded set of COVID-19-related resources.</p>
<p>While many of the topics were already covered by TikTok&#8217;s Community Guidelines ahead of today&#8217;s changes, the company said the updates add more specifics to each of the areas based on what behavior it&#8217;s seen on the platform, heard through community feedback and received via input from experts such as academics, civil society organizations and TikTok&#8217;s own Content Advisory Council.</p>
<p>One update is to the guidelines related to suicide and self-harm, which have now incorporated feedback and language used by mental health experts to avoid normalizing self-injury behaviors. Specifically, TikTok&#8217;s policy on eating disorder content has added considerations aimed at prohibiting the normalization of or the glorification of dangerous weight loss behaviors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2086947" style="width: 401px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086947" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2086947" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?w=391" alt="" width="391" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png 808w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?resize=173,300 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?resize=768,1334 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?resize=391,680 391w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>Stronger policies on bullying and harassment now further detail the types of content and behaviors that aren&#8217;t welcome on TikTok, including doxxing, cyberstalking and a more extensive policy on sexual harassment. This one is particularly interesting, given that there have been some cases of TikTok users figuring out where anti-masker nurses worked &#8212; and at least <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/11/oregon-nurse-placed-on-leave-over-anti-mask-covid-19-tiktok.html">one incident led to the nurse being put on leave</a>. It&#8217;s unclear how TikTok will approach this sort of &#8220;doxxing&#8221; behavior, however, as it didn&#8217;t involve publishing a home address &#8212; only alerting an employer.</p>
<p>Another update expanded the guidelines around TikTok&#8217;s dangerous acts policy to more explicitly limit, label or remove content depicting dangerous acts and challenges. Through a new &#8220;harmful activities&#8221; section to the minor safety policy, TikTok reiterates that content promoting dangerous dares, games and other acts that may jeopardize the safety of youth is prohibited.</p>
<p>TikTok also updated its policy around dangerous individuals and organizations to focus on the issue of violent extremism. The new guidelines now describe in greater detail what&#8217;s considered a threat or incitement to violence, as well as the content that will be prohibited. This one is timely, too, as many Trump supporters have been pushing for a new civil war or other violence as a result of Trump losing the U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>In terms of new features, TikTok worked with behavioral psychologists and suicide prevention experts &#8212; including <a href="https://www.providence.org/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.providence.org/en&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH2Ghej2gRlOM8_Hel95vzkHeDr3w">Providence</a>, <a href="https://samaritanshope.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://samaritanshope.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGa3So6LwR4KgxqsSGDv2hMqkZ7qw">Samarita<wbr></wbr>ns</a><a href="https://samaritanshope.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://samaritanshope.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGa3So6LwR4KgxqsSGDv2hMqkZ7qw"> of Singapore</a> and members of its U.S. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/transparency?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tiktok.com/transparency?lang%3Den&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5GwrqBOL67DLDSZ4wr4NkSDnGtw">Content Advisory Council</a> &#8212; to create new resources that include evidence-based actions users can take for searches related to self-harm. These new resources will appear when users search for terms like &#8220;selfharm&#8221; or &#8220;hatemyself.&#8221; Access to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Crisis Text Line will continue to be available for emergency support, as before.</p>
<p>TikTok will also introduce new opt-in viewing screens that will appear on top of videos of content some may find graphic or distressing. These videos are already ineligible for the For You feed, but may not be prohibited. For example, the screens might cover violence or fighting that&#8217;s not being removed due to documentary reasons; animals in nature doing something some find upsetting &#8212; like hunting and killing their prey; or otherwise scary stuff, like horror clips.</p>
<p>When TikTok becomes aware of this disturbing content through user flagging, it will apply the screens to the videos to reduce unwanted viewing. Users who then come across the video can either tap the button at the bottom of the screen to &#8220;skip video&#8221; or the other to &#8220;watch anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, a new text-to-voice feature, aimed at accessibility, allows people to convert their typed text to a voice that plays over it in a video. This follows TikTok&#8217;s recent launch of a feature to support people with <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/making-tiktok-more-accessible-to-people-with-photosensitive-epilepsy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/making-tiktok-more-accessible-to-people-with-photosensitive-epilepsy&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFalF2i7rrcKRjmgyUgRKoGL6PQMg">photosensitive epilepsy.</a></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086945" style="width: 353px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086945" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2086945" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?w=343" alt="" width="343" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=76,150 76w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=151,300 151w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=768,1523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=343,680 343w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=774,1536 774w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=1032,2048 1032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086945" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>TikTok is also adding questions and answers about COVID-19 vaccines to its in-app coronavirus resource hub. These will be provided by public health experts, like the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), for example, and will be linked to from the Discover page, search results and via banners on COVID-19 and vaccine-related videos. The company says its COVID-19 hub has already been viewed more than 2 billion times in the last six months. TikTok is partnering with <a href="https://teamhalo.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://teamhalo.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGGTpSMEEisQvuEk3aMJhFOE6Cm5w">Team Halo</a> as well, so scientists all over the world can share the progress being made on the vaccine through video updates.</p>
<p>TikTok has been fairly aggressive about moderating content on its platform. If you scroll through the feed long enough, you&#8217;ll find users lamenting about videos of theirs that were taken down for policy violations. You&#8217;ll also come across videos where users have reuploaded another person&#8217;s deleted video in order to respond to it. It even quickly addressed much of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/tiktok-takes-down-some-hashtags-related-to-election-misinformation-leaves-others/">the election misinformation</a> that was being spread in November by blocking top hashtags, like #RiggedElection and #SharpieGate.</p>
<p>Its new policies out today also include changes that address what&#8217;s been more recent user behavior, like the calls for violence following the election.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keeping our community safe is a commitment with no finish line,&#8221; said TikTok, in its announcement today about its updates. &#8220;We recognize the responsibility we have to our users to be nimble in our detection and response when new kinds of content and behaviors emerge. To that end, we&#8217;ll keep advancing our policies, developing technology to automatically detect violative content, building features that help people manage their TikTok presence and content choices, and empowering our community to help us foster a trustworthy environment. Ultimately, we hope these updates enable people to have a positive and meaningful TikTok experience,&#8221; the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon today is launching a way for customers to create custom clothing with a new service called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/amazonmadeforyou">Made for You</a>, which lets shoppers create a custom T-shirt to their exact measurements. But unlike some companies that <a href="https://www.mtailor.com/how-it-works.html">use mobile technology to scan and measure</a> your body from an app, Amazon Fashion&#8217;s Made for You service requires users to provide the company with their height, weight, body style, and two photos of themselves to get measured for their custom fit.</p>
<p>After users provide their data, they can then choose from a selection of eight different colorways, as well as preferred sleeve and shirt lengths, necklines and fabrics.</p>
<p>To get started with Made for You, users choose between the two types of fabrics to customize the design. This includes either the Medium-weight 100% Pima Cotton shirt or the Lightweight 56% Pima Cotton, 38% Modal, and 6% Elastane tri-blend options. They can then choose other aspects of their shirt &#8212; like either a slim, classic or relaxed fit, a crew or V-neck, and short or long sleeve length, for example.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The shirts can even include your name printed on the label, as a small perk.</p>
<p>When finished, customers can view the product they customized on a virtual body double before placing the order. The experience works both on web and inside the Amazon app.</p>
<p>The custom shirts cost $25 are available to all Amazon customers in the U.S., not just Prime members.</p>

<p>At launch, influencers including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blakescott/?hl=en">Blake Scott</a> (650K followers on Instagram), <a href="https://www.instagram.com/caralynmirand/?hl=en">Caralyn Mirand</a> (253K Instagram followers), and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/scoutthecity/?hl=en">Sai de Silva</a> (330K Instagram followers) are touting the new feature on Amazon&#8217;s behalf and are featured in its marketing.</p>
<p>Custom clothing is often seen as a luxury and this process does make it more affordable. That can be helpful for those who struggle with fit due to measurements that fall outside of traditional sizing. But the service also seems to be a pretty transparent attempt to grab customer data for the Amazon Fashion business.</p>
<p>Amazon, however, characterizes Made for You as part of its ongoing efforts to eliminate online shopping challenges &#8212; this time, size and fit. Over time, the company says it wants to expand Made for You with more styles and selection, based on customer feedback.</p>

<p>The retailer has been focused on its fashion business for years, having <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/04/27/68516/amazons-echo-look-rates-your-outfits-and-slurps-up-revealing-data/">experimented in the past</a> with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/29/how-echo-look-could-feed-amazons-big-data-fueled-fashion-ambitions/">Echo Look camera</a> that would help users rate their styling choices. Today, Amazon uses data from its social feature, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/finds/ref=s9_acss_bw_cg_ggwhead_9a1_w?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0HGYNCMMYWB7VAAG78C9&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=98c55ba7-fb82-44d8-b396-63413e7f5172&amp;pf_rd_i=19419848011">#FoundItOnAmazon</a> to feed images to &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=19419848011">Style by Alexa</a>&#8221; for fashion inspiration and to drive sales. And with Prime Wardrobe and its optional styling service, Amazon attempts to learn what its customers like to wear and then automate the shopping process by curating items to try on at home in batches.</p>
<p>Though Amazon didn&#8217;t explain how it may put the collected data to use to aid its Amazon Fashion business beyond custom clothing, it did say the data was securely stored and customers could delete their data at any time by tapping the profile icon at the top left of the Made for You home page. Amazon also says the uploaded photos aren&#8217;t stored and are deleted immediately after being used to create the virtual body double and determine measurements.</p>
<p>With Amazon&#8217;s goal with all these efforts is to improve online apparel shopping, it could potentially extend to other areas &#8212; for example, by helping Amazon build out its <a href="https://ww.fashionnetwork.com/news/Amazon-fashion-fostering-over-100-private-label-brands,1156429.html">dozens of private labels</a> in apparel. And with the added data on real-world customer sizing, the retailer could learn how to better cut its clothing for the best fit. It could even be working on systems that could later help customers select their right size just from a photo, perhaps.</p>
<p>Made for You is launching today in the U.S. across web and mobile.</p>
