										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Capping off our dig into the early-stage venture capital market, we’re taking a quick look at Europe this morning. Previously, The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">tucked into the United States’ early-stage market for startup capital</a>, uncovering startups using abundant seed capital to get more done before raising a Series A, while others were using pedigree, team and market size to accelerate their first lettered raise.</p>
<p>For both cohorts, it appeared that a rapid-fire Series B could be in the offing, with VCs looking to get capital into winners early.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The Latin American venture capital market for early-stage startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/like-the-us-a-two-tier-venture-capital-market-is-emerging-in-latin-america/">had a number of similar hallmarks</a>. That shouldn’t have been surprising. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/slpierre?lang=en">Seth Pierrepont</a>, a partner at London-based Accel, “fundraising dynamics are now no longer U.S.- or European-specific &#8212; they’re global.” Fundraising over videoconferencing services like Zoom has done more than make geographical distances less impactful inside of countries &#8212; it&#8217;s even made national borders and even oceans less meaningful.</p>
<p>Is the European startup market similar to what we’ve seen in Latin America and the United States &#8212; a cognate for the North American venture capital scene, given its outsized global weight by round count and amount invested?</p>
<p>Largely, yes, a trend that appears to be shaking up prices and the talent wars. This morning, we’re taking a final look at the early-stage venture capital market, this time through a European lens, with an assist from a few investors from the continent.</p>
<h2><strong>An influx of late-stage capital</strong></h2>
<p>Broadly, early-stage venture capital rounds in Europe are happening “earlier and are larger in size,” according to <a href="https://twitter.com/vinothj?lang=en">Draper Esprit’s Vinoth Jayakumar</a>, an investor based in London. The correlate of larger rounds being raised while startups are younger is valuation expansion, according to Jayakumar, who said that prices are going up “because larger rounds are very dilutive to founders if done at normal &#8212; or in this case too low &#8212; valuations.”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the digital revolution has transformed nearly every social interaction and communication type in the past couple decades, the humble birthday card has shown surprising resiliency.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.givingli.com/">Givingli</a>, a small LA-based startup with an app aiming to challenge how Gen Z sends digital greeting cards, is picking up some seed funding from investors betting on their philosophy around modern gifting. The startup has raised a $3 million seed round led by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six, while Snap’s Yellow Accelerator also participated in the raise.</p>
<p>The wife and husband co-founding team stumbled into the world of digital greetings and gifts after abandoning physical invitations for their wedding and exploring how the digital greetings space had and hadn&#8217;t evolved. They&#8217;ve taken a mobile-first approach to tackling greetings for special events and moments where users just want to let someone know they&#8217;re thinking of them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2171425" style="width: 368px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171425" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2171425" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png" alt="" width="358" height="408" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png 2924w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png?resize=132,150 132w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png?resize=263,300 263w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png?resize=768,876 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png?resize=596,680 596w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png?resize=1347,1536 1347w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png?resize=1796,2048 1796w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171425" class="wp-caption-text">Image via Givingli</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Initially, we thought it would mainly be birthdays and categories like weddings, graduation, etc., and I think we just threw in some &#8216;just because&#8217; cards, but then that became the most popular category, by far,&#8221; CEO Nicole Emrani Green tells TechCrunch. &#8220;I think that it&#8217;s what kicked off our virality, because obviously with every Givingli sent you&#8217;re pulling someone else in and then the conversation continues.&#8221;</p>
<p>The app monetizes through a $3.99 monthly premium subscription which gives users access to a greater variety of digital greeting designs from the more than 40 artists that the startup has licensed work from. Alongside paying for premium subscriptions, users can also shop for digital gift cards to send along with their greetings. Givingli&#8217;s gift card storefront has more than 150 brands available including Amazon, Spotify, Nike and DoorDash.</p>
<p>A big sell for Givingli&#8217;s offering has been its customization. Although users are pushed to select from the hundreds of available greeting cards, they can also spice them up by adding photos or videos in addition to writing text. The aim is to create a moment that rivals messages that can be shared via email, text or on social media services.</p>
<p>“For a generation of digitally native users, it’s not surprising that the ability to like, swipe, upvote or shoot a quick text from our phones have become the predominant ways we connect with others,” said Ohanian in a press release announcing the seed round. “What first attracted me to Givingli is that Nicole and Ben acutely understood this evolution and built a platform that provides the creative tools needed to elevate those interactions and deepen connections. Whether it’s sending a digital birthday gift, or a note just because &#8211; it’s clear that Givingli has put snail mail on notice.”</p>
<p>One of the team&#8217;s big challenges has been highlighting the visibility of their native app which users download to send greetings. Last fall, the Givingli team debuted a partnership with Snap that brought their gifting service inside Snapchat via a bite-sized Snap Mini app integration. The rollout followed the startup&#8217;s participation in Snap&#8217;s Yellow Accelerator program.</p>
<p>Emrani Green says that partnership has helped bring more users to their platform, and that more than 5 million people have used Givingli to send greetings since the app launched in 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a muggy Tuesday morning in Brooklyn, electrified mobility company Revel unveiled its first electric vehicle fast charging superhub. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm joined the New York-based startup, alongside Revel’s founder and CEO Frank Reig in a ribbon cutting ceremony. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, ⁦Revel, for being an example of what we need in this country[…] Thank you for showing the county how it can be done,&#8221; said Granholm at the opening event on Tuesday.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revel’s superhub will have 25 brand-agnostic, RTM75 chargers from DC fast charging manufacturer Tritium. According to Reig, this Bed-Stuy charging station, which is open 24-7, will be the largest public charging station in North America. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.urbangreencouncil.org/sites/default/files/state_of_the_nyc_grid_urban_green_council.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than two-thirds of New York City’s energy grid is currently powered by fossil fuels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, meaning about a quarter of NYC’s greenhouse gas emissions come from electricity. The state has ambitious plans to require statewide electricity to be 70% renewable by 2030 and 100% carbon-free by 2040. This might be difficult to accomplish given the imminent shutting down of Indian Point’s two nuclear reactors which provide the city with about a quarter of its energy, according to 2018 data from the mayor’s office. In addition, most forms of renewable energy require plenty of space to harness solar or wind power, which will be doubly difficult in a dense and expensive city like New York. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of power, the superhub is located at the old Pfizer manufacturing building on Flushing Avenue, a site with seven megawatts of power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s enough power at this site and we have built this site in a future-proofing sort of way, so that every single charger can be upgraded in the future without having to dig up any infrastructure,” Reig told TechCrunch. “So if we want to put a 250 or 350 charger in two years from now, three years from now, as cars are able to accept those kinds of speeds, we can do that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revel also chose to place its charging station at the Pfizer building because it’s at “New York City’s urban core,” rather than far out at the airports or in private garages where chargers are inaccessible to the majority of New Yorkers who would ideally like to charge on the street. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/mobility-startups-can-be-equitable-accessible-and-profitable/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were on a panel recently about equity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and one of the things that Revel feels very strongly about is making sure not just this site but any site in the future as well, there won’t be parking fees to get access to the charger,” said Reig. “So as opposed to many fast chargers in New York where you have to pay a parking garage $10 to $20 to park your car, and then you have to pay for the charger, this site is completely publicly available 24-7. There are no entrance fees. The only thing you&#8217;re paying is electricity itself.”</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="J68d8frSdy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/mobility-startups-can-be-equitable-accessible-and-profitable/">Mobility startups can be equitable, accessible and profitable</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mobility startups can be equitable, accessible and profitable&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/mobility-startups-can-be-equitable-accessible-and-profitable/embed/#?secret=J68d8frSdy" data-secret="J68d8frSdy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charging up a car costs 39 cents per kilowatt hour, which turns into about $15 to $20 for a full charge, and that shouldn’t take more than 15 to 30 minutes. While drivers wait, they can access the redesigned space inside the old Pfizer building, which is now a co-working space for startups and a food giant court, because that’s what Brooklyn does.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revel’s chargers will take up about a third of the parking lot at the site, and Revel’s fleet of 50 Teslas that make up its troubled ridehail service also have designated parking where they’ll charge overnight. Reig says this makes energy demand available for individual EV owners at the hours they tend to charge their cars, which is in the morning, afternoon and early evening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reig is expecting the biggest usage of the chargers at first to come from Revel’s ridehail fleet, but the </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546955/nyc-tlc-electric-vehicle-license-taxi-vote-revel-tesla"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) voted last week to block the issuance of new for-hire vehicle licenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for electric vehicles. When </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/revel-launches-an-all-electric-rideshare-service-with-a-fleet-of-50-teslas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revel announced its new service in April</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it was hoping to skirt by on a loophole in the city’s rules that exempts wheelchair-accessible and electric vehicles from the new vehicle-for-hire cap that was designed to curb the amount of new Uber and Lyft drivers taking over the streets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re absolutely working with the TLC,” said Reig. “Obviously we&#8217;re disappointed by their recent ruling to take away the EV exemption in the future. But, you know, we&#8217;re exploring ways with them right now to get on the road, and we&#8217;re going to be finding a solution in the future. We operate legally with every product line always offered, and we&#8217;re going to continue to do that here with this business.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Add Soft Robotics to the long list of automation companies that have seen a boost in investment interest amid the pandemic. The New England-based firm <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/food-robotics-leader-soft-robotics-raises-10m-to-meet-pandemic-induced-demand-and-bring-its-3d-vision-and-ai-powered-solutions-to-market-301321728.html">announced this morning</a> a $10 million raise that serves as an extension of the $23 million Series B it announced in January of last year.</p>
<p>The extension was led by Material Impact, Scale Venture Partners and Calibrate Ventures and featured existing investors Tekfen Ventures and industrial robotics giant ABB. The latest round brings the company’s total funding to around $58 million.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, the company takes a novel approach to picking machines, with a soft, pneumatic-powered gripper that’s ideal for fragile food stuffs that might otherwise be damaged by rigid robotics. Food, of course, has been a prime target for interest in automation during the pandemic, due to labor shortages and fears of disease transmission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8jnsv10t1nc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s industrial robots are unable to deal with product variability or unstructured environments typically found across the labor challenged food supply chain in areas such as agriculture, food processing, and logistics,&#8221; Soft Robotics COO Mark Chiappetta said in a release. &#8220;With our revolutionary soft grasping, 3D perception, and AI technologies, Soft Robotics unlocks robotic automation by augmenting widely available industrial robots with true hand-eye coordination allowing them to perform tasks that traditionally could only be performed by human workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The round also sees Tyson Food’s investment wing, Tyson Ventures joining the fold. Tyson, which produces poultry, beef and pork in massive volumes, is an existing customer.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Tyson Ventures, we are continually exploring new areas in automation that can enhance safety and increase the productivity of our team members,&#8221; Tyson Ventures’ Rahul Ray said in the release. &#8220;Soft Robotics&#8217; best-in-class robotic technology, computer vision and AI platform have the potential to transform the food industry and will play a key role in any company&#8217;s automation journey.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bees are absolutely critical to the health of our agricultural system, ecosystem, and overall wellbeing as a species here on Earth. And yet bee <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/bee-extinction-worries-grow-as-species-numbers-drop">populations are decreasing and extinction concerns are growing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.beeflow.com/">Beeflow</a>, a startup that today announced the close of a $8.3 million Series A round, is looking to both save the bees and help farmers be more efficient and effective at the same time.</p>
<p>The startup uses proprietary scientific technology that essentially makes bees healthier, particularly in cold weather. A wealth of research led the company to understand that certain plant-based foods and molecules, when fed to the bees, can reduce the mortality rate of bees by up to 70 percent, and help them perform better in colder weather.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You might be wondering what I mean by performance. That&#8217;s fair.</p>
<p>Bees are the planet&#8217;s natural pollinators. They turn flowers into fruit, spreading pollen from one landing spot to another. Many farmers will &#8216;rent out&#8217; bees from beekeepers to hang out on their farms and pollinate their plants. In almost every way, the effectiveness of this can&#8217;t be measured, and the bees themselves can&#8217;t truly be controlled.</p>
<p>Beeflow&#8217;s technology ensures that the bees are healthy and strong, and can fly up to 7x more during colder weather than they&#8217;d be able to without it. This means that those bees are much more likely to effectively and efficiently pollinate crops for the farmers.</p>
<p>Beyond reducing the mortality rate of bees, the company also offers a second product called ToBEE, which trains the bees to target a specific crop, such as blueberries or almonds.</p>
<p>Combined, these Beeflow products have increased crop yields for farmers up to 90 percent.</p>
<p>Beeflow&#8217;s business model is two-fold. They have their own bees that they loan out to farmers for pollination, and also work with beekeepers to bring them into the Beeflow network. Bee keepers do not pay for Beeflow&#8217;s technology, but do hand over the rights to their relationships with farmers.</p>
<p>The startup was founded by Matias Viel, who is from Argentina, and is mostly operational in Latin America and the West Coast of the U.S., with plans to expand to the East Coast and Mexico.</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest challenge is operational and around execution,&#8221; said Viel. &#8220;There is so much demand and we need to scale our team and our operations now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The financing round was led by Ospraie Ag Science, with participation from Future Ventures&#8217; Steve Jurvetson, Jeff Wilke, Vectr Ventures, SOSV&#8217;s IndieBio and Grid Exponential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon today announced a new feature that will turn Alexa into a reading companion for children as well as new support for Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids, which personalize the child&#8217;s Alexa experience across all Echo devices in the household. The two features go hand in hand, as the Voice Profile allows Alexa to identify who&#8217;s speaking, so the device can appropriately respond to a request like &#8220;Alexa, let&#8217;s read.&#8221; Alexa will then start the reading companion experience, which Amazon is calling <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse/21556915011">Reading Sidekick</a>.</p>
<p>This feature isn&#8217;t available to all Alexa device owners, as it requires an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home">Amazon Kids+ subscription</a>. This is the $2.99 per month subscription service that also provides families with children access to thousands of kid-friendly books, TV shows, movies, educational apps and games, in addition to premium content for Echo devices, like ad-free radio stations and playlists, Audible books, and exclusive Alexa skills.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171383" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171383" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2171383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171383" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once subscribed, the child can then direct Alexa to read with them and they&#8217;ll pick up a compatible book or ebook to get started. Alexa will ask what book they&#8217;re reading and how much does the child want to read: a lot, a little, or taking turns? The feature works with the hundreds of children&#8217;s books for ages 6 to 9 that are included as part of the Amazon Kids+ subscription, including both the print or digital versions. When it&#8217;s the child&#8217;s turn reading. Alexa will listen and provide encouragement when the child is doing well, and will offer support when the child is struggling.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, support for new Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids will also begin rolling out, starting today. This opt-in feature allows parents or guardians to create a voice profile for each child in their family (up to 4 kids). When enabled, the Alexa experience will be personalized to the individual speaking. That means Alexa will automatically apply the appropriate parental controls that have been configured, automatically filter explicit music, limit calls and messages sent through Alexa only to approved contacts, and restrict the child only to the Alexa skills parents have pre-approved. Alexa will also provide the child with access to kid-friendly games, skills, music, and videos and will provide kid-friendly responses to kids&#8217; inquiries.</p>
<p>While features like these can make the Alexa experience more fun and useful for families, parents have to weigh their comfort with having their children&#8217;s voices recorded and analyzed and determine how long they would want such recordings stored. Today, Amazon uses kids&#8217; voice recordings to train its speech recognition and natural language understanding systems in order to improve Alexa&#8217;s ability to understand children&#8217;s questions and requests. In some number of cases, these recordings are also manually reviewed. Parents who don&#8217;t want to participate can delete recordings associated with their child&#8217;s history either one-by-one or all at once via the Alexa app Settings. They can also set recordings to automatically delete on an ongoing 3-month or 18-month basis and can delete recordings via voice requests.</p>
<p>However, if the parent chooses not to save the child&#8217;s recordings, they&#8217;ll not be able to go back through the history to see the requests their child has made over time from the <a href="https://parents.amazon.com/">Parent Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>Every parent will need to make a decision about what&#8217;s right for their own household before enabling features like Reading Sidekick or Voice Profiles, or, more broadly about whether they want to bring a smart speaker of any kind into their home.</p>
<p>Amazon says the new Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids should reach all Amazon customers by Friday, July 2. Reading Sidekick is available today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ask anyone looking to sell online about their customer acquisition costs compared to a few years ago, and you&#8217;ll hear a tale of woe. Channels that were once a cost-effective ground for acquiring customers, like various social networks, have become increasingly pricey real estate. Facebook&#8217;s recent <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1409609918055956483">broaching of the $1 trillion market cap threshold</a> attests to the fact.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.coopcommerce.com/">co-op</a> wants to shake up how online sellers find new customers, and it wants to do so with a spirit of collaboration at a discount. The startup announced a $5.8 million round today that closed earlier this month, evidence that it has found backers for its model that has already collected 500 brands.</p>
<p>That final figure matters because co-op is an almost uniquely collaborative company. Brands that sign up to be part of co-op include its technology on their post-purchase page, allowing for other, related items to be shown to customers who just finished buying something. By including the widget, a company&#8217;s product will be shown on the post-purchase page of another company.</p>
<p>That sounds anti-capitalist at the very least, which wouldn&#8217;t work in a venture-backed world. So, what&#8217;s the twist? The post-purchase page widget shows three or four products, giving it extra inventory that it can sell to its partnered brands. Presto, revenue.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s founder and CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/connersherline/">Conner Sherline,</a> told TechCrunch that his startup can deliver advertising space at around half the cost-per-action of Facebook and other channels; how the economics of its model scale as more brands join will be fascinating to watch.</p>
<p>The startup also offers software tooling, including a post-purchase survey feature that costs 5 cents per order for customers to leverage.</p>
<p>Sherline&#8217;s startup appears to be growing quickly. When it raised pre-seed capital last July, it had around 20 brands onboarded to its service. Today, the company is adding another 50 to 100 each month. At that rate, it could reach 1,000 brands in total by the end of the year, barring any deceleration in its ability to attract new brands to its network.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s early progress attracted <a href="https://sugarcap.com/">Sugar Capital</a> to lead its latest round, which also saw participation from <a href="https://www.bvp.com/">Bessemer Venture Partners</a> and online e-commerce giant Shopify. The Shopify check is interesting; co-op already <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/co-op-commerce-1">exists on the Shopify app store</a>, for example. TechCrunch will keep an eye out for more integrations between the two companies, something that could turbo-charge the startup&#8217;s growth.</p>
<p>There are a number of places for co-op to expand into. Sherline told TechCrunch in an interview that its collaborative network is the first thing that the company is working on. But with lots of sales data and a wealth of partners, co-op could build out partner networks aimed at other parts of the e-commerce sales life cycle pretty easily, we reckon.</p>
<p>Regardless, the company now has a multiple of the $1.6 million that it had raised before. Let&#8217;s see how quickly it can scale its brand base with the new funds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://arrows.to/">Arrows</a>, a startup building software to help software companies onboard their customers, announced that it has raised a $2.75 million round led by <a href="https://www.gradient.com/">Google&#8217;s Gradient Ventures</a>. The round was joined by a host of angels, including funds from Sprout Social founder and CEO Justyn Howard.</p>
<p>Per Arrows CEO Daniel Zarick, the company had bootstrapped until this round. That allowed the startup to allow dozens of smaller investors to take part in this funding event, including 28 micro-checks that it rolled into a single cap-table line-item thanks to an AngelList service that allows for smaller investments to be combined.</p>
<p>Arrows sells to software CEOs and heads of customer success, the people who care the most about ensuring that new customers get up and running with new digital products as quickly as possible. Per Zarick, successful customer onboarding to a new product or service can speed up adoption, helping boost revenue from usage-based products; it&#8217;s also generally known that stronger onboarding can also lead to better adoption inside of customer organizations, potentially limiting later churn.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Given the scale of the modern software market, Arrows is selling into fertile ground. That&#8217;s the reason that Zarick and his co-founder Benedict Fritz decided to stop being a two-person shop, and raise more capital. They were worried, Zarick explained, about suffocating their company without more capital.</p>

<p>Luckily for Arrows, one investor had already taken a keen eye to their work. Namely Gradient Ventures&#8217; <a href="https://twitter.com/darian314">Darian Shirazi</a>, who had reached out a number of times before the startup was even considering raising external funds. Per the Arrows CEO, Shirazi had already sent the startup his own portfolio companies as leads before he invested, some of whom have become customers. So, when Zarick and Fritz decided to pursue venture capital, there was a leading name already on hand.</p>
<p>The $2.75 million round was raised using a SAFE at a single cap, sans discount.</p>

<p>Arrows initially <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/arrows-3">launched its service in March</a>, but is revamping its pricing this week, closing its self-serve model for the near-term.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to listen to the CEO of a seed-stage startup discuss evolving from a bootstrapped model to one backed by a good-sized amount of venture funding. Zarick described to TechCrunch in an interview how much his job was changing now that the company is working to scale up to a team of around eight. The company intends to stay at that human scale for a little while.</p>
<p>Per its CEO, Arrows can get along for two years with its current capital sans revenue growth; though we&#8217;d expect that now that it has attracted seed capital, other VCs will look to pile on &#8212; a trend that we&#8217;ve seen often in recent weeks and months.</p>
<p>The Arrows product is also going to evolve in the coming months. While attacking customer onboarding teams&#8217; use of spreadsheets with modern software has worked thus far, the startup has lots of planned work ahead of it, including more integrations with external software. Let&#8217;s see how quickly we hear from Arrows again. I&#8217;ll wager anyone a high-five that it&#8217;s before the end of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New York-based construction startup <a href="https://www.toggle.is/">Toggle</a> this morning announced that it has raised an $8 million Series A. The round was led by Tribeca Venture Partners and featured Blackhorn Ventures, Point72 Ventures, New York State and Twenty Seven Ventures. It follows a $3 million seed round raised in late-2019.</p>
<p>Robotics in general have been a massively popular investment target during the pandemic. Construction startups have also begun to heat up. Early this month, Dusty announced a $16.5 million raise for its Field Printer device.</p>
<p>Toggle automates an entirely different part of the construction process. The company’s robotics technology specifically targets rebar, using robotics to assemble the foundational building material at a fraction of the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“At a time when global construction is accelerating to an unprecedented pace, Toggle offers a way to add capacity while saving time and cost on some of the largest types of projects,” cofounder and CEO Daniel Blank said in a statement, “We are especially grateful for our partners who are helping us to bring new tools and approaches to the fundamental building block of our built environment with a focus on renewable energy and sustainable urban development.”</p>
<p>Toggle says the new round will go toward expanding production on the tech. That includes increasing headcount and upgrading the production space to a new 50,000 square foot facility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch has covered Acceleprise several times over the years, including a look at its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/acceleprise-announces-26-saas-startups-from-its-trio-of-accelerators/"> mid-2020 accelerator startup batch</a> from its three accelerators. The firm has long focused on business-to-business SaaS startups, helping them get their start in a competitive global software market.</p>
<p>As of today, Acceleprise is now Forum Ventures, according to the group&#8217;s CEO and managing partner, <a href="https://twitter.com/mgcardamone?lang=en">Michael Cardamone</a>, and it has a bushel of funds to power its work. And befitting its new name, the company is now more than merely a collection of software-focused accelerators.</p>
<p>In addition to a new, larger $17 million fund for its pre-seed work, Forum Ventures has also raised its first seed fund. The new seed vehicle totals $13.2 billion, with Cardamone telling TechCrunch that the group intends to write checks ranging from $100,000 to $650,000 into rounds valued between $1 million and $4 million. It&#8217;s an actual seed fund, in other words.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s interesting that Forum has put together a seed fund that will invest both in its accelerator graduates and other SaaS companies, the firm&#8217;s new pre-seed investing vehicle is noticeably larger than its preceding accelerator fund. Why is it so much bigger? Per Cardamone, the group added a third accelerator since its last fund, helping explain the size shift.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5CWpdfu47R"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/acceleprise-announces-26-saas-startups-from-its-trio-of-accelerators/">Acceleprise announces 26 SaaS startups from its trio of accelerators</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Acceleprise announces 26 SaaS startups from its trio of accelerators&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/acceleprise-announces-26-saas-startups-from-its-trio-of-accelerators/embed/#?secret=5CWpdfu47R" data-secret="5CWpdfu47R" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The technology market is also simply more expensive in every way than it was, and Forum has expanded its staff, so more capital under management makes sense.</p>
<p>There is synergy between the pre-seed and seed funds, of course. Forum can now better defend early ownership in standout companies from its accelerator batches. But why keep the door open to investing in other startups that it didn&#8217;t help incubate? It comes back to the company&#8217;s new name, it turns out. Cardamone and the team chose Forum Ventures because of the work it has done to build a SaaS community that from time to time spins up companies that didn&#8217;t go through Forum&#8217;s programs, he said, and it wants to invest in some of them.</p>
<p>Reasonable.</p>
<p>Undergirding Forum&#8217;s new raise are results from its earlier funds. Its first accelerator fund, deployed from the end of 2014 through the next two years, has returned &#8220;86% of committed capital to date and the rest of the fund is marked at 3.36X and growing with 18 companies still live at various stages,&#8221; the firm shared in an email.</p>
<p>Funds 2 and 3 are a bit nascent yet to have similarly concrete returns; we&#8217;ll have to wait a bit to see how they perform.</p>
<p>But TechCrunch did want to know, regardless, what impact COVID-19 had on Forum and its various funds and batches. Did they catch a COVID-induced wave? We wondered if some good recent results may have helped the firm raise not only larger funds, but two of them at the same time.</p>
<p>According to Cardamone, the answer is <em>somewhat</em>. In its most recent pre-seed fund, the CEO said that its accelerator cohorts are seeing more startups raise faster seed and Series A rounds. And, as TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">has written lately</a>, they are, at times, raising Series A deals at lower ARR thresholds than we might have expected. So, it&#8217;s a good time to be putting pre-seed dollars to work, we reckon, provided that you have the deal flow.</p>
<p>Forum is now 11 people, including six women and one nonbinary individual. That&#8217;s about as diverse in gender terms as we&#8217;ve seen in the SaaS venture capital world. From its new seed fund, 53% of Forum&#8217;s investments have had a woman or otherwise underrepresented founder. Not bad.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s see if Forum can replicate its early accelerator returns with more capital, more financial vehicles and more people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://orum.ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to speed up the amount of time it takes to transfer money between banks, announced today it has raised $56 million in a Series B round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel and Canapi Ventures co-led the round, which also included participation from existing backers Bain Capital Ventures, Inspired Capital, Homebrew, Acrew, Primary, Clocktower and Box Group. The financing comes barely three months after Orum announced a $21 million Series A, and brings <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/orum-the-platform-for-frictionless-financial-infrastructure-raises-56m-in-series-b-funding-from-accel-and-canapi-ventures-to-transform-how-money-moves-301322041.html">its total raised</a> to over $82 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orum CEO Stephany Kirkpatrick launched the company in 2019 after working for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several years at LearnVest, a personal finance site founded by Alexa von Tobel that was acquired by Northwestern Mutual in 2015 for an estimated $375 million. Tobel went on to form Inspired Capital, a venture capital firm that put money in Orum’s </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/orum-io-seed--f13df00c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$5.2 million seed round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last August. Prior to that, the firm also provided Orum</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> with an &#8220;inspiration check&#8221; that was the first money into the business.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="gs">
<div class="">
<div id=":5av" class="ii gt adO">
<div id=":5am" class="a3s aiL ">
<div class="yj6qo ajU">
<div id=":5b2" class="ajR" tabindex="0" role="button" data-tooltip="Show trimmed content" aria-label="Show trimmed content" aria-expanded="false"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As a certified financial planner, Kirkpatrick says she saw firsthand what she describes as “deep cracks” in this country’s financial infrastructure. The fact that it takes days for money to move from one bank to another is not only inconvenient for many, but unnecessary, she believes.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most Americans are not familiar with the intricacies of ACH [automated clearing house) or why it takes multiple business days to move money between accounts,” Kirkpatrick said. “But none of us can allow money to wait 5-7 days to hit our accounts. It needs to be instant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her mission with Orum is straightforward even if the technology behind it is complex. Put simply, Orum aims to use machine learning-backed APIs to “move money smartly across all payment rails, and in doing so, provide universal financial access.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orum’s first embeddable product, Foresight, launched in September of 2020. It’s an automated programming interface designed to give financial institutions a way to move money in real time. The platform uses machine learning and data science to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">predict when funds are available and to identify any potential risks. Its Momentum product “intelligently” routes funds across payments rails and is powered by banking providers JPMorgan Chase and Silicon Valley Bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They power the back end of our Momentum platform that allows the money to move on a multirail basis,” Kirkpatrick told TechCrunch. “They power our access to real-time payments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orum says it serves a range of enterprise partners, including Alloy, HM Bradley, First Horizon Bank and Zero Financial (which was </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/avant-doubles-down-on-digital-banking-with-acquisition-of-zero-financial-and-its-neobank/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently acquired by Avant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The volume of transactions being conducted with Orum is growing 100% month over month, Kirkpatrick said. Most of its early growth has come from word of mouth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remote-first company prides itself on diversity — in both its employee and investor base. For one, 48% of its 55-person headcount are female, and 48% are “nonwhite,” according to Kirkpatrick. Orum also recently joined the </span><a href="https://captablecoalition.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cap Table Coalition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a partnership between high-growth startups and emerging investors who want to work to close the racial wealth gap — to allocate over 10% of its Series B round to underrepresented founders. For example, the financing includes investors such as the Neythri Features Fund, a group of South Asian women investing in the next generation of female founders and diverse teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeffrey Reitman, partner at Canapi Ventures (a firm whose LPs mostly consist of banks), told TechCrunch that those bank LPs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">conduct hundreds of millions of ACH transactions annually, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They need a path to achieving a state where funds can be transferred instantly,” he said. “Orum’s product paves the path for many players in financial services and fintech — and beyond — to partake in faster money movement without compromising key risk principles.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Reitman, the company’s major differentiators are its team, which he describes as consisting of “the best group of data scientists and engineers in the space.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many of their customers consider the team to be instrumental in helping to set the risk dials on how they fund transactions by teasing out key data and insights from historical transaction data,” he said. “Second, Orum is building one of the densest and most comprehensive data sets around the risks of money movement. Better data means better risk models, and it will be hard for other offerings to match Orum’s approach to building this rich data set.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel Partner Sameer Gandhi, who joined Orum’s board as part of the latest financing, agrees. He believes that in an 18-month period, Orum has built “game-changing technology and an exceptional team.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Orum is tackling financial infrastructure from its foundation,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of work has changed massively in the last year, and with it a rush of startups have emerged with new technology and approaches to improve how it is shaped, and specifically how human resources departments do their jobs. In the latest chapter, <a href="https://www.visier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visier</a>, a Canadian startup that has built a big-data engine to ingest and analyze information from disparate human resources and related applications to develop more accurate profiles of people and departments &#8212; useful when considering remuneration, promotions, and wider hiring budgets &#8212; has raised $125 million (USD), a Series E that the company confirms now values it at $1 billion.</p>
<p>The funding comes on the heels of the company seeing massive growth in particular in the last year, with companies scrambling more than ever before, in a new world of more hybrid and remote work, to get a better grip on how and what teams and individuals are doing. Visier said it now processes employee records for 8,000 customers, large and high-profile enterprises like Adobe, BASF, Bridgestone, Electronic Arts, McKesson, Merck KGaA and Uber that collectively represent some 12 million individual users across 75 countries.</p>
<p>New backer Goldman Sachs Asset Management is leading the round, with previous investors Sorenson Capital, Foundation Capital, Summit Partners, and Adams Street Partners also participating. Visier &#8212; pronounced &#8220;busier,&#8221; which co-founder and chairman John Schwarz joked you are <em>not</em> supposed to be when using its product &#8212; has now raised just under $220 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Schwarz described it to me, the challenge that Visier is addressing is that while everyone uses HR management tools like Workday, Success Factors, any number of payroll applications and more &#8212; on average 20 applications per department, he said &#8212; to chart a lot of basics of how an employee works day to day or month to month, a lot of that data remains in silos and so it&#8217;s hard to get a &#8220;360&#8221; view based on all of it, and that&#8217;s before considering how to take that information and benchmark it against other information outside the business.</p>
<p>The solution that Visier provides to address that is a big-data engine that it has built that can connect to any and all of those apps, ingest the data contained in it, match it up to provide visualizations of the current state of things, and increasingly also predictive insights. Today, this is done typically for HR departments, but this has applicability to managers, finance departments and really the employees themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the future we want to help everyone understand the policy today, which impacts the outcome tomorrow,&#8221; he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="p1">The move to build big data analytics targeting particular areas of an organization has been an interesting trend that has played out in other departments too such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/dooly-raises-80m-more-for-its-ai-tools-to-help-salespeople-manage-their-busywork/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/12/tidemarks-latest-release-uses-big-data-to-help-finance-look-forward-instead-of-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finance</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/quantexa-raises-64-7m-to-bring-big-data-intelligence-to-risk-analysis-and-investigations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risk analysis</a> and other areas. The idea here is not unlike what data scientists have been working on for years with wider analytics questions: tapping troves of data from disparate sources to order it better, match it up with each other, to provide insight into wider trends and activities within an organization.</p>
<p class="p1">As data science becomes more democratized &#8212; and thanks to advances in no-code and low-code tooling, turned into tools that even non-technical people can implement and use &#8212; we will likely see many more use cases where this idea gets applied. After all, data is the new oil, but unlike actual oil, we seem to be supplied with an endless amount of it these days.</p>
<p class="p1">And yes, we&#8217;ve seen a real rush of HR tools come to the market in recent years &#8212; and see a lot of funding in the current climate as their businesses see customer interest rise &#8212; they include HR platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/hibob-raises-70m-on-a-500m-valuation-for-its-new-take-on-hr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hibob</a>, HR aimed at particular verticals like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/personio-raises-125m-on-a-1-7b-valuation-for-an-hr-platform-targeting-smes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Personio</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/factorial-raises-16m-to-take-on-the-hr-world-with-a-platform-for-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Factorial</a>, or for distributed workforces like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/oyster-an-hr-platform-for-distributed-workforces-snaps-up-50m-on-a-475m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oyster</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/remote-raises-35m-to-help-orgs-with-global-workforce-payroll-benefits-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remote</a>, or those that are building supercharged org-charts like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/charthop-raises-35m-for-its-internal-org-chart-and-people-analytics-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChartHop</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">But Visier believes that there are no big-data players looking not to be primary-source repositories of information but big data integrators from other platforms. Schwarz notes that in most cases, the &#8220;competition&#8221; will be custom-made implementations built by systems integrators using Tableau or something similar but not the same as what it provides in terms of real-time analytics.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about using data from other sources,&#8221; he said, pointing out that it&#8217;s telling that Workday tried to build something like what Visier provides, but that more than half of Visier&#8217;s customers also use Workday (meaning whatever is there is not quite doing the trick).</p>
<p>“Access to information about employees and the health of an organization has never been more critical,” said Holger Staude, managing director within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “We’re excited to partner with Visier at this pivotal moment and support the company’s continued growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gympass, the exercise and corporate wellness unicorn that originated in Brazil, today announced a $220 million Series E. The company has seen tremendous growth in the last few months, as more and more people are vaccinated and flocking back to the gym.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://site.gympass.com/web/us">Gympass</a> is like ClassPass, but on steroids. However, unlike ClassPass’ BTC model, Gympass partners with employers who then pay a flat fee for the platform (an app) which then allows their employees to choose from several wellbeing plans that give them access to myriad in-person gyms and studios, and a directory of health apps, such as Calm. The offerings are broken up into the following categories: physical health, emotional health, nutrition and sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, in May, Gympass saw a record 4 million monthly check-ins across its network of more than 50,000 global partners. In fact, for some of the partners, usage hit above pre-COVID levels. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between increased anxiety rates and documented weight gain during the pandemic, it’s clear that people are eager to get active again with the hopes of improving their mental health and their waistlines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GymPass is the brainchild of Cesar Carvalho, a former McKinsey &amp; Company consultant in Brazil who was always on the road and yearned for a corporate wellness product that would comply with his hectic work schedule.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some days I worked from home, other days I worked from the office, and then there was the time I was traveling. I could never go to the gym in one place,” Carvalho told TechCrunch. “I realized that my needs were the same as others,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He decided to pursue his business idea while he was at Harvard Business School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m one of those crazy entrepreneurs that drops out of their MBA to start a company, but looking back now, it worked out okay,” he said, later telling TechCrunch that Gympass is now in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, the U.S., Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and the U.K. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch in São Paulo in 2012, the company achieved product-market fit fairly quickly, and its growth and expansion have been largely organic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, Gympass was a BTC concept, and one of its first clients was an executive at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Brazil. He liked the product so much that he eventually said to Carvalho, “Can’t I communicate this to my 5000 employees in all the cities where we have offices in Brazil?” With that question &#8211; and offer &#8211; Carvalho saw the need to pivot and build a B2B company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After only three years in Brazil, one of his biggest Brazilian clients asked Carvalho to expand to Mexico, because his company had a large presence there and he wanted to offer Gympass to its employees. And so follows most of the expansion stories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We expanded to Spain, because we worked with a Spanish bank in Mexico, and they wanted their employees in Spain to have access to our product,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round, which doubles the company’s valuation to $2.2 billion, includes participation from SoftBank, General Atlantic, More Strategic Ventures, Kaszek Ventures and Valor. Carvalho plans to use the money to grow the company in the U.S., expand its offerings, and work on making the tech smarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want [the app] to be able to recommend the best partners for your complete well-being journey based on your workout patterns, for example: ‘This is the best meditation app for you to use with your workout profile,’” Carvalho said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic significantly changed how we do medical research, and now companies are trying to figure out what trends will stay and which ones will go. One that 4G Clinical is hoping will survive the pandemic is a need for speed and flexibility in therapeutics trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4G Clinical creates software to run the back-end of a clinical trial. That means randomizing patients into treatment and placebo groups, locating medicines and placebos, keeping the supply of those medicines stocked, and, at least during the pandemic, delivering those medicines to patients. All of these tasks fall under the umbrella of Randomized Trial Supply Management, or RTSM for short. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, 4G Clinical&#8217;s software, called Prancer, uses natural language processing to take specific requirements needed to manage a clinical trial, which are often written in long, complex documents, and configures them into a platform.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fastest the company has been able to move from a phone call to the first dose in a clinical trial was 6 days – a sprint that created the software needed for a COVID-19 study during the pandemic. That was an exceptionally fast case, but in general, 4G Clinical says it can beat standard timelines by considerable margins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most vendors in the world would say that they are probably, you know, between 10 and 16 weeks from, you know, from the kicking off a study until they can dose a patient,” says Dave Kelleher, a company co-founder. “Our typical timeline is generally four to six weeks post spec signature.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, large pharmaceutical companies are capable of creating these trial management systems internally. Small companies, however, may not have the capability to do so. 4G Clinical goal is to provide a service that can be of use to both. 4G Clinical has currently designed systems for over 230 companies – though the company would not disclose the specific trials in which its systems are being used. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 strategies for building a digital health unicorn&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/4-strategies-for-building-a-digital-health-unicorn/embed/#?secret=Y1OUCuhR4C" data-secret="Y1OUCuhR4C" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4G clinical is also announcing over $200 million in a growth equity round led by Goldman Sachs. Before Goldman, the primary investment came from Boston-based Schooner Capital and First Analysis, a VC firm out of Chicago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelleher declined to say what the plans for the round were, other than company has plans to pursue more go-to-market strategies and R&amp;D, and ultimately aims to “take up as much air” in the eClinical and RTSM space as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eClinical market is expected to reach about </span><a href="https://www.gminsights.com/pressrelease/eclinical-solutions-market"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$14.7 billion by 2027</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. RTSM made up about 17 percent of market share in 2020. With the complexity of clinical trials increasing, and the number of trials growing – even after COVID-19 related issues shut many trials down in 2020 – there may be room for more growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before COVID-19, there was evidence that the amount of clinical trials had </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/resources/trends"><span style="font-weight: 400;">steadily been increasing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2000, there were 2,119 clinical trials registered at Clinicaltrials.gov. By 2010, 100,208, and by 2020, 362,532 registered by the end of the year (that includes massive slowdowns created by the pandemic for non-COVID research). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within that landscape, there is some evidence that sponsors of clinical trials are using more external applications to manage those clinical trials. Of 500 clinical operations professionals respondents </span><a href="https://www.veeva.com/eu/resources/clinical-operations-survey-report-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surveyed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Veeva (another eClinical company, keep in mind) found that 63 percent were using an RTSM system, up from about 43 percent in 2017. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4G Clinical, generally, is looking to benefit from the increased public attention to the clinical trials process, and the flexibility that the pandemic has created for sponsors to get creative with clinical trial designs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic did encourage some innovation in this regard. Take, for example, the World Health Organization’s SOLIDARITY trial, which used an adaptive trial design in which multiple drugs could be tested at once. Drugs that showed no promise mid-way through the trial could be dropped (as hydroxychloroquine was in June 2020). The adaptive part, in short, allows for mid-trial tweaks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not the traditional design of the gold-standard randomized controlled clinical trial, but it did glean a significant amount of knowledge in a short period of time. </span><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2034294"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seven months</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, three of four drugs tested showed no effect on mortality, whereas the fifth remdesivir, showed some limited promise. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The health data transparency movement is birthing a new generation of startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/the-health-data-transparency-movement-is-birthing-a-new-generation-of-startups/embed/#?secret=9o43Rd0WAf" data-secret="9o43Rd0WAf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adaptive trial designs weren’t unheard of before the pandemic – the FDA had actually released guidance on adaptive clinical trials </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/78495/download"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the post-pandemic landscape might encourage more flexibility in this regard, and with it, increase a need for software that can be tweaked to accommodate such changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that we saw some regulatory hurdles reduced as part of this process that allows for more creativity in study design,” says Kelleher. “Probably the most important thing for us is our flexibility, we can make changes to studies very rapidly – to live studies.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4G Clinical and other RTSM software like it, are looking to hone tools that already exist within clinical trials – specifically software used to actually run them. It’s an area of research that the team itself has both a personal stake in, and strong industry knowledge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelleher was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis at the age of 23 (a disease to which there is still no definitive cure), and previously founded the Portland-based ACME business consulting. His co-founder Ed Tourtellotte, lost his wife to breast cancer around the same time. Neither have a background in pharmacology, but rather, the team is tackling drug development through streamlining clinical trial software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, other companies aim to streamline clinical trial processes through A.I-based drug target identification, an especially hype-induced area of the space in which investment quadrupled to </span><a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-AI-Index-Report_Master.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$13.9 billion between 2019 and 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Clinical trial management software may seem more mundane, but it’s still an essential part of running Phase III and most Phase II studies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tourtellotte has designed bespoke software systems for major drug developers, including Pfizer’s Impala system (used in 80 percent of Pfizer’s clinical trials for the past 20 years, says Kelleher) and another system Trident, which was sold </span><a href="https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2010/10/20/BioClinica-to-launch-game-changing-IVR-IWR-platform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to Bioclinica in 2009</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (along with Tourtoulette’s company, Tourtellotte Solutions). Trident was </span><a href="https://www.genengnews.com/topics/drug-discovery/gsk-to-use-bioclinica-tool-to-manage-clinical-trials/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">utilized by GlaxoSmithKlein</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for clinical trials in 2010. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, the company has declined to confirm a total amount of funding, but in 2020, revenue grew 110 percent with just ten percent of its portfolio focused on COVID-19 related projects. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I love testing drones. It’s a lot of fun, and a nice way to mix up my standard review cycle. But I’ve altogether given up on testing them around here. Granted, living in Queens, NY presents a unique combination of obstacles, including population density, two major international airports and a prison – but restrictions have made it next to impossible to fly around here.</p>
<p>Knowing precisely where the nearest open airspace is can get tricky, particularly in large cities like New York. Today, Alphabet’s drone-delivery subsidiary Wing announced that it’s launching its OpenSky app in the U.S. on Google Play and the iOS App Store.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171186" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171186" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2171186" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/opensky.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171186" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wing</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The app was launched in Australia back in 2019 for both hobbyist and commercial drone pilots, with help from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). The U.S. version was created with input from the FAA for operation in Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) airspaces.</p>
<p>Using the app, drone operators can request approval to operate in spaces like those around areas, expediting a process that would traditionally take days or weeks to go through.</p>
<p>“Why is a drone delivery company investing in an operator app?” Wing asks rhetorically in a blog post. “Because with nearly two million registered drones in the U.S. already, regulatory compliance of all drones will allow them to share the sky safely. Moreover, compliance will ultimately expand the uses and benefits of drones &#8212; among them emergency response, commercial inspections and contactless delivery &#8212; to more people.”</p>
<p>The app is available for users in the U.S. starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Citizenry announced today that it raised $20 million in Series B funding in partnership with NextWorld Evergreen. A direct-to-consumer home decor retailer, <a href="https://www.the-citizenry.com/">The Citizenry</a> works with artisans from around the world to produce limited-edition runs of handcrafted, hand-numbered home goods. In October, The Citizenry opened its first brick-and-mortar store in New York City, and with this round of funding, The Citizenry hopes to accelerate its development into a whole-home brand.</p>
<p>Co-Founder Rachel Bentley got her start at Bain &amp; Company, where she worked in strategy consulting in global supply chains.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a lot of the challenges that were coming as a result of that, tied to income inequality, human rights, and the environment,&#8221; Bentley told TechCrunch. &#8220;But I also saw the tremendous opportunity that connections of global supply chains can create to hopefully move communities forward.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bentley and fellow co-founder Carly Nance, a brand strategist, noticed that there was a gap in the market for premium, thoughtfully crafted home goods. They took the leap to leave their corporate jobs to start The Citizenry with the aim to make a positive global impact and set more socially conscious standards for the home decor industry.</p>
<p>These are lofty goals, but Bentley&#8217;s experience in global supply chain strategy helped her develop a business model that prioritizes the fair treatment of workers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170637" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170637" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170637" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4X6A9543-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4X6A9543-1.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4X6A9543-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4X6A9543-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4X6A9543-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4X6A9543-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4X6A9543-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4X6A9543-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170637" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Citizenry</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;One of the biggest challenges in working with artisan communities is that companies are there for one season, they place a large order, and their goal is to get a really high volume at a very low price,&#8221; Bentley says. &#8220;We came in and took the opposite approach. We tried to identify groups we saw a long term potential with, that we could partner with for the next ten, twenty, fifty years, to really help grow their businesses. Having sustainable income day in and day out, not just seasonally, is where you really start to see change happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Citizenry is a member of the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO), and for over eighteen months, they&#8217;ve been going through the process to become fully verified through the WFTO&#8217;s Guarantee System. This means that the WFTO reviews every partner and conducts several day, in-person examinations of the artisans&#8217; working conditions. On average, The Citizenry pays its artisans double the local minimum wage.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170638" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170638" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170638" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Citizenry_Headshots1764.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="463" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Citizenry_Headshots1764.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Citizenry_Headshots1764.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Citizenry_Headshots1764.jpg?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Citizenry_Headshots1764.jpg?resize=768,523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Citizenry_Headshots1764.jpg?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Citizenry_Headshots1764.jpg?resize=1536,1046 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Citizenry_Headshots1764.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170638" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Citizenry</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Social responsibility is much more important to our generation than previous generations,&#8221; Bentley said. &#8220;We want to feel good about the way a product was made, because we know we&#8217;re going to be living with the ramifications of how it was made, whether that&#8217;s environmentally or in terms of human rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bentley says that the rise in farm-to-table food shopping is indicative of consumers&#8217; transition in values. But spending an extra few dollars on organic produce isn&#8217;t quite the same as shelling out $695 for a Portuguese leather headboard. So, The Citizenry may not undercut retailers like IKEA, but their price points are often cheaper than luxury home competitors like Williams-Sonoma, for example. The fact that The Citizenry can even compete with larger retailers while paying livable wages to artisans is a testament to their business model.</p>
<p>Since closing its Series A in 2019, The Citizenry has grown sales over 200%, with repeat customers driving 45% of sales. Over the same period, the company has supported 3,000 global artisan jobs. With its Series B funding, The Citizenry hopes to expand its furniture section &#8212; the most shopped category on its website &#8212; and invest in expanding its brick-and-mortar business after its SoHo store&#8217;s successful launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX&#8217;s upcoming Starship orbital test flight could end up being a veritable smorgasbord of its technological capabilities, as the company has filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to request approval to fly Starlink terminals on the spacecraft in order to &#8220;demonstrate high data rate communications&#8221; between the new launch system and the ground throughout the course of the trip to space and back.</p>
<p>SpaceX plans to show that its network of Starlink low-Earth orbit satellites can provide &#8220;unprecedented volumes of telemetry and enable communications during atmospheric reentry&#8221; even during the parts of the launch where communications signals are typically lost due to the presence of &#8220;ionized plasma&#8221; in the atmosphere during the re-entry phase (via <a href="https://twitter.com/nextspaceflight/status/1409743521964126213">Michael Baylor on Twitter</a>). If it works, it could provide better than ever live data for SpaceX during its test flight, which should help with the Starship and Super Heavy launch system&#8217;s development — and it could mean better, more spectacular views for those of us just watching from home via livestream, too.</p>
<p>Including Starlink as the communications method for telemetry and other communications during the launch is definitely a functional improvement for SpaceX if it works as described, but it&#8217;s even more of a flex for the company in terms of showing off Starlink&#8217;s capabilities. The FCC filing ones that the terminals to be installed on the spacecraft are basically just its existing consumer terminals with new exterior housings, so if it performs well that could attract the attention of more consumer broadband customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Plus, SpaceX is also talking a lot about the capabilities of Starlink as a system to replace older, more distant geostationary satellites networks to provide things like connectivity on airplanes, on ships and in other in other transportation modals. Showing that it offers solid performance during a rocket launch is definitely going to encourage partners in those areas.</p>
<p>The filing does specific that its license to operate Starlink on Starship begin on August 1, which means either it&#8217;s planned for a launch after the one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/spacex-aiming-for-first-orbital-test-launch-of-starship-in-july/">SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said the company is hoping to fly sometime in July</a>, or the date has already likely slipped to the following month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connected vehicle data startup Wejo has announced partnerships with Microsoft, Palantir and Sompo Holdings to improve its ability to collect, store and analyze data from millions of connected vehicles around the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This follows the GM-backed startup’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/gm-palantir-backed-wejo-to-go-public-via-spac/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAB15j4_LLIgYipyT2vQvTXTKPis2yUVqj62qrz6u4mz0arn1auKNqwFb52kxhKtezYBd8s3W18C1p8Oia9zphszONZf9ao4dOKumFAkS1vehge_TMlAvQ6y9ibvaFaAYvFniAQ5QAs3Xh1MUF9IBavxqZsDlr4sCtErDV6xv6vzo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcement that it would be going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virtuoso Acquisition Corp., which is expected to close later this year. A $25 million commitment from Microsoft and Sompo, combined with already-committed investors GM and Palantir, bring Wejo’s total PIPE financing to $125 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palantir has been a previous strategic investor in Wejo. In 2019, the software developer launched a Japanese joint venture with insurance provider Sompo. Now this venture’s partnership with Wejo will give the startup the chance to collect connected vehicle data in Japan, and perhaps the greater Asia-Pacific region. The company already has some live vehicles in Korea, but 95% of its data comes from the U.S., according to Richard Barlow, Wejo’s founder and CEO. Sompo will analyze Wejo’s connected vehicle data using the </span><a href="https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palantir Foundry data and analytics platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the company.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><i></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The vast majority of cars now sold globally have this ability to be connected, so there’s a huge opportunity,” Barlow told TechCruch. “We have 11 million live cars on our platform out of a supply base of about 50 million vehicles. We have over 17 OEM partners live on the platform, and we’re processing 16 billion data points a day, a peak of about 40,000 per second, which explains why we’re also excited to be backed by Microsoft and to be migrating to their Azure cloud platform.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barlow says Wejo can see 7% of all vehicles moving around New York, 6% around California and 20% around Detroit from partnerships with automakers like GM, Daimler and Hyundai. The company can either hand off raw, anonymized data — collected from vehicles with the consent of the owner — to businesses, developers or governments, or it can perform data analytics for them, which is also where the partnership with Microsoft can come in handy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Microsoft came up with a really compelling solution about how we can leverage their machine learning and AI capabilities to actually provide even more incredible products back to OEMs and key industries that want to use connected vehicle data,” said Barlow. “So Microsoft’s Azure doing that heavy lifting is really going to speed up our business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Wejo, initial applications might include traffic solutions, as well as remote diagnostics, integrated payments, advertising, retail and logistics. The two companies are also discussing the potential of using Wejo for Microsoft’s mapping solutions. Barlow says mapping companies are often typical buyers of Wejo’s data and expects to see more insurance providers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve seen 11 million instances of two vehicles coming together, and in real time, we&#8217;re getting data from both those vehicles,” said Barlow. “So we&#8217;re starting to preempt and understand the characteristics or behaviours of before and after that collision or that interaction of vehicles.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wejo collects data that can recreate a car crash, from how each driver stomped on the brakes to which airbags were deployed to the speed of impact and which sensors were destroyed. It can then share this kind of data back to the insurer to help speed up the claims and recovery process and make repairs be more accurate, said Barlow.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this data demonstrating human driving behaviors in a range of circumstances has been collected over the last seven years, making Wejo an attractive partner for companies developing autonomous technology.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://jfrog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JFrog</a>, the company best known for a platform that helps developers continuously manage software delivery and updates, is making a deal to help it expand its presence and expertise in an area that has become increasingly connected to DevOps: security. The company is acquiring <a href="https://www.vdoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vdoo</a>, which has built an AI-based platform that can be used to detect and fix vulnerabilities in the software systems that work with and sit on IoT and connected devices. The deal &#8212; in a mix of cash and stock &#8212; is valued at approximately $300 million, JFrog confirmed to me.</p>
<p>Sunnyvale-based, Israeli-founded JFrog is publicly traded on Nasdaq, where it went public last September, and currently it has a market cap of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FROG?p=FROG&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.65 billion</a>. Vdoo, meanwhile, had raised about $70 million from investors that include NTT, Dell, GGV and Verizon (disclaimer: Verizon owns TechCrunch), and when we covered its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/vdoo-raises-25m-more-to-develop-its-ai-based-security-for-iot-and-connected-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent funding round</a>, we estimated that the valuation was somewhere between $100 million and $200 million, making this a decent return.</p>
<p>Shlomi Ben Haim, JFrog&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, said that his company&#8217;s turn to focusing deeper on security, and making this acquisition in particular to fill out that strategy, are a natural progression in its aim to built out an end-to-end platform for the DevOps team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When we started JFrog, the main challenge was to educate the market on what we saw as most important priorities when it comes to building, testing and deploying software,&#8221; he said. Then sometime around 2015-2016 he said they started to realize there was a &#8220;crack&#8221; in the system, &#8220;a crack called security.&#8221; InfoSec engineers and developers sometimes work at cross purposes, as &#8220;developers became too fast&#8221; the work they were doing was inadvertently led to a lot of security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>JFrog has been building a number of tools since then to address that and to bring the collective priorities together, such as its XRay product. And indeed, Vdoo is not JFrog&#8217;s first foray into security, but it represents a significant step deeper into the hardware and systems that are being run on software. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very important leap forward,&#8221; Ben Haim said.</p>
<p>For its part, Vdoo was born out of a realization as well as a challenging mission: IoT and other connected devices &#8212; a universe of some 50 billion pieces of hardware as of last year &#8212; represents a massive security headache, and not just because of the volume of devices: each object uses and interacts with software in the cloud and so each instance represents a potential vulnerability, with zero-day vulnerabilities, CVEs, configuration and hardening issues, and standard incompliances among some of the most common.</p>
<p>While connected-device security up to now has typically focused on monitoring activity on the hardware, how data is moving in and out of it, Vdoo’s approach has been to build a platform that monitors the behavior of the devices themselves on top of that, using AI to compare that behavior to identify when something is not working as it should. Interestingly, this mirrors the kind of binary analysis that JFrog provides in its DevOps platform, making the two complementary to each other.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s notable is that this will give JFrog a bigger play at the edge, since part of Vdoo&#8217;s platform works on devices themselves, &#8220;micro agents&#8221; as the company has described them to me previously, to detect and repair vulnerabilities on endpoints.</p>
<p>While JFrog has built a lot of its own business from the ground up, it has made a number of acquisitions to bolt on technology (one example: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/21/jfrog-acquires-shippable-adding-continuous-integration-and-delivery-to-its-devops-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shippable</a>, which it used to bring continuous integration and delivery into its DevOps platform). In this case, Netanel Davidi, the co-founder and CEO of Vdoo (who previously co-founded and sold another security startup, Cyvera, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/palo-alto-networks-buys-cyber-security-company-cyvera-for-200m/">to Palo Alto Networks</a>) said that this was a good fit because the two companies are fundamentally taking the same approaches in their work (another synergy and justification for DevOps and InfoSec being more closely knitted together too I might add).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;In terms of the fit between the companies, it&#8217;s about our approach to binaries,&#8221; Davidi said in an interview, noting that the two being on the same page with this approach was fundamental to the deal. &#8220;That&#8217;s only the way to cover the entire pipeline from the very beginning, when they go you develop something, all the way to the device or to the server or to the application or to the mobile phone. That&#8217;s the only way to truly understand the context and contextual risk.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>He also made a note not just of the tech but of the talent that is coming on with the acquisition: 100 people joining JFrog&#8217;s 800.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;If JFrog chose to build something like this themselves, they could have done it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the uniqueness here is that we have built the best security team, the best security researchers, the best vulnerability researchers, the best reverse engineers, which focus not only on embedded systems, and IoT, which is considered to be the hardest thing to learn and to analyze, but also in software artifacts. We are bringing this knowledge along with us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>JFrog said that Vdoo will continue to operate as a standalone SaaS product for the time being. Updates that are made will be in aid of supporting the JFrog platform and the two aim to have a fully integrated, &#8220;holistic&#8221; product by 2022.</p>
<p>Along with the deal, JFrog reiterated financial guidance for the next quarter that will end June 30, 2021. It expects revenues of $47.6 million to $48.6 million, with non-GAAP operating income of $0.5 million to $1.5 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.00 to $0.01, assuming approximately 104 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For Full Year 2021, revenues are expected to be $198 million to $204 million, with non-GAAP operating income between $5 million and $7 million and an approximately 3% increase in weighted average diluted shares. JFrog anticipates consolidated operating expenses to increase by approximately $9-10 million for the remainder of 2021, subject to the acquisition closing.</p>
