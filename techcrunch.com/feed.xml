										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In an unexpected turn, the New York Stock Exchange <a href="https://ir.theice.com/press/news-details/2021/NYSE-Updates-Guidance-on-Delisting-Determination-for-Securities-of-Three-Issuers-in-Relation-to-Executive-Order-13959--/default.aspx">said</a> Monday that it no longer intends to delist China&#8217;s three major telecoms operators, a decision that was originally announced on December 31.</p>
<p>The initial action targeted China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom as part of the Trump Administration&#8217;s move to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-securities-investments-finance-communist-chinese-military-companies/">bar investment in companies</a> deemed to supply and support China’s military, intelligence and security services.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/ccmc/ns-ccmc_list.pdf">current blacklist</a> names 35 companies, including the parent organizations of the three listed telecoms firms as well as Huawei and China&#8217;s major chipmaker SMIC.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The reversal was made &#8220;in light of further consultation with relevant regulatory authorities,&#8221; said the exchange. The companies will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE while the exchange will continue to evaluate how the executive order applies to them and their listing status, according to the announcement.</p>
<p>The delisting of the three telecoms giants, which have been trading on NYSE for about two decades, was seen by some experts as merely symbolic. The trading volumes of these firms in New York are only a small percentage of their total tradable shares, thus the impact of the potential delisting &#8220;would be rather limited on the companies’ growth and general market performance,&#8221; <a href="http://www.csrc.gov.cn/pub/csrc_en/newsfacts/release/202101/t20210103_390001.html">said</a> the China Securities Regulatory Commission in a statement issued on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The recent move by some political forces in the U.S. to continuously and groundlessly suppress foreign companies listed on the U.S. markets, even at the cost of undermining its own position in the global capital markets, has demonstrated that U.S. rules and institutions can become arbitrary, reckless and unpredictable,&#8221; the Chinese exchange authority said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope that the U.S. side could show respect for the market and reverence for the rule of law, do more things that can benefit the order of global financial markets, the legitimate rights of investors, and the stability and development of the global economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>In recent times, a number of Chinese companies trading in the U.S. have opted for secondary listings in Hong Kong. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/27/alibaba-second-listing-hong-kong/">Alibaba</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-jd-com-listing-idUKKBN23I05W">JD.com</a> and NetEase have debuted in Hong Kong and more tech companies are reportedly weighing their homecoming. Chinese tech bosses are wary of the U.S. government&#8217;s potential clampdown, but they also hope to replicate Alibaba&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/27/alibaba-second-listing-hong-kong/">success in Hong Kong</a> and see funding opportunities in China&#8217;s new<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/china-new-tech-board/"> Nasdaq-style board</a>, which was introduced in 2019 in part to lure its tech darlings home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Using Xiami was once synonymous with having good music taste in China. The music app, which debuted around 2008 and was <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/rumor-alibaba-acquires-social-music-site-xiami">acquired by Alibaba in 2013</a>, is discontinuing its streaming service today, Xiami said in a <a href="https://h5.xiami.com/app/xiami-frontend/xm-announcement/index/index.html">notice</a> to users.</p>
<p>Xiami, which means &#8220;smalll shrimp&#8221; in Chinese, was once known for its smart discovery, elegant design, social features and support for indie musicians which helped attract a loyal following among China&#8217;s artsy, hipster types. The beginning of its decline coincided with the battle for music rights in China. A digital music behemoth was formed in 2016 when <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-to-buy-majority-stake-in-china-music-corp-creating-streaming-giant-1468470851">Tencent bought a majority stake in China Music Group</a>, which brought to Tencent a reservoir of exclusive music deals. By 2017, Tencent&#8217;s music apps <a href="https://radiichina.com/how-tencents-empire-is-making-music-pay/">controlled as much as 75%</a> of China&#8217;s music streaming market.</p>
<p>Xiami, on the other hand, lost large quantities of music rights and consequently users who converted to more resource-rich platforms, albeit grudgingly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alibaba did have a shot at online music. In 2015, the e-commerce giant <a href="https://www.alizila.com/alibaba-names-renowned-musician-gao-xiaosong-run-music-unit-2/">appointed</a> two renowned industry veterans &#8212; a songwriter and a music company executive &#8212; to steer its newly minted music group. Neither was necessarily seen as having the experience for running an internet music business. Instead of growing Xiami, they poured resources into a platform called Alibaba Planet to build artist-fan relationships. The idea didn&#8217;t take off.</p>
<p>In the meantime, newcomers like NetEase Music are holding out in their battle against Tencent&#8217;s music empire, of which dominance has endured to this day.</p>
<p>While users will lose access to the app and all their data, Xiami is not totally dead. Its copyrights-focused segment Yin Luo (音螺 or Conch Music) will continue to operate, according to the notice. But the dream of Xiami&#8217;s utopian founders, &#8220;earn music &amp; money&#8221; (hence the app&#8217;s original name &#8220;EMUMO&#8221;), a vision they laid out inside a cafe on a snowy day in Hangzhou, is surely gone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a dismal year, the global smartphone market will slowly start recovering in 2021, <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20210105-10630.html">predicts TrendForce</a>. But Huawei won’t benefit and, in fact, will fall out of the research firm’s list of the world’s top six smartphone makers by production volume.</p>
<p>In 2020, global smartphone production dropped 11% year-over-year to 1.25 billion units. This year, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/trendforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="trendforce">TrendForce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> expects it to increase by 9% to 1.36 million units, as people replace old devices and demand grows in emerging markets. But even that slight recovery is contingent on how the pandemic continues to impact the economy and the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/analysis-global-chip-shortage-threatens-idUSKBN28R0ZL">global chip shortage</a> that is currently causing production delays across almost the entire electronics industry.</p>
<p>In 2020, the top six smartphone brands in order of production volume were Samsung, Apple, Huawei, Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo. But this year TrendForce expects Huawei to slip out of that ranking, with the new top-six list comprising of Samsung, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo and Transsion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those six companies are expected to account for 80% of the global smartphone market in 2021, while Huawei will come in at seventh place.</p>
<p>The main reason for Huawei’s drop is the divestment of its budget smartphone brand, Honor. Huawei confirmed in November that it is selling Honor to a consortium of companies to save the division’s supply chain from the impact of United States government trade restrictions.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TBT8EEIfs4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/huawei-sells-budget-phone-unit-honor-to-government-distribution-partners/">Huawei sells budget phone unit Honor to state-backed firms, distribution partners</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Huawei sells budget phone unit Honor to state-backed firms, distribution partners&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/huawei-sells-budget-phone-unit-honor-to-government-distribution-partners/embed/#?secret=TBT8EEIfs4" data-secret="TBT8EEIfs4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The spin-out was meant to shield Honor from the sanctions that have hurt Huawei’s business. But &#8220;it remains to be seen whether the ‘new’ Honor can capture consumers’ attention without the support from Huawei. Also, Huawei and the new Honor will be directly competing against each other in the future, especially if the former is somehow freed from the U.S. trade sanctions at a later time,&#8221; said TrendForce’s report.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20201124-10565.html">previous report</a> published shortly after Honor’s sale was announced, TrendForce predicted that the deal, along with the global chip shortage, meant Huawei would take just 4% of the market in 2021, compared to the 17% it held in 2019, and estimated 14% in 2020. Apple is expected to take away some market share from Huawei’s high-end smartphones, while Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo will also benefit. TrendForce expects the newly spun-out Honor to take 2% market share in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SVB Financial Group agreed today to buy Boston Private Financial Holdings in Boston for $900 million in cash and stock.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big deal for SVB, which has earned a reputation over its 37-year history as a bank that&#8217;s friendly to startups, as well as venture and private equity investors. Boston Private, founded in 1987, has roughly $<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201021005941/en/Boston-Private-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Results">16.3 billion</a> in assets under management, compared with SVB Asset Management&#8217;s $1.4 billion in related assets.</p>
<p>SVB, which formed its wealth advisory business in 2011, has been pushing more aggressively into wealth management for several years, hiring Yvonne Butler, who&#8217;d previously led wealth strategies at Capital One, in the middle of 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Butler has since been adding members to the bank&#8217;s wealth management team, telling Business Insider last year of the job that &#8220;I see my job primarily as a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-bank-expanding-private-bank-and-wealth-advisory-businesses-2020-1">retention strategy</a> . . .Clients are already here. We&#8217;ve helped them grow their fund or business — and I see our role as private bank and wealth advisory as retaining.&#8221;</p>
<p>Underscoring SVB&#8217;s bid to strengthen its relationship with wealthy individuals who already have business dealings with the bank, Greg Becker, its president and CEO, said today in a release about the new tie-up: &#8220;Our clients rely on us to help increase the probability of their success — both in their business and personal lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Butler will lead the combined private banking and wealth management business with Anthony DeChellis, who has been the CEO of Boston Private for the last two years. DeChellis joined the outfit after a short stint as president of the crowdfunding platform OurCrowd and before that, as the CEO of Credit Suisse Private Banking (Americas) for more than seven years.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Boston Private shareholders will receive 0.0228 shares of SVB common stock and $2.10 of cash for each of their shares.</p>
<p>Bank stocks were generally battered in 2020, but as the Boston Globe <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/01/04/business/boston-private-be-acquired-by-svb-financial-900-million/">notes</a>, SVB&#8217;s stock is up more than 60% over the past three years because of its focus on the tech world, while Boston Private&#8217;s shares have fallen by 45%.</p>

<p>On October 24, Ma delivered fiery remarks against China&#8217;s financial system to an audience of high-rank officials. Days later the Chinese authorities abruptly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">halted Ant&#8217;s initial public offering</a>, an act believed to be linked to Ma&#8217;s controversial speech. The Chinese government subsequently told the fintech behemoth, which had thrived in a relatively lax regulatory environment, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">&#8220;rectify&#8221; its business</a> according to the law. The future of Ant hangs in the air.</p>
<p>Concurrently, Chinese regulators have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">launched an unprecedented probe</a> into Alibaba over suspected monopolistic behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ma is known for his outspoken personality and love for the limelight, so it&#8217;s no surprise that his missing from recent events, including the final episode of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-04/jack-ma-skips-cherished-tv-show-after-beijing-tightens-screws">an African TV program he created</a>, is sparking widespread chatter. From economists to journalists, the Twitter world has tuned in:</p>

<p>&#8220;Regarding the Africa&#8217;s Business Heroes competition, Mr. Ma had to miss the finale due to a schedule conflict,&#8221; an Alibaba spokesperson said.</p>
<p>While China&#8217;s Twitter equivalent Weibo has not blocked searching for &#8220;Jack Ma missing,&#8221; the posts it surfaced barely have any like or repost. Elsewhere on the Chinese internet, users are speculating inside WeChat groups that Ma was either &#8220;made vanished&#8221; or has fled the country.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Ma has long stepped back from day-to-day operations at Alibaba. In September 2019, he officially handed his helm as the company&#8217;s chairman <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/09/jack-ma-officially-retires-as-alibabas-chairman/">to his successor Daniel Zhang</a>. That said, the billionaire still holds considerable sway over the e-commerce business as a lifetime partner at the so-called <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/article?news=p180910">Alibaba Partnership</a>, a group comprising senior management ranks who can nominate a majority of the directors to the board.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unusual to see Chinese tycoons choosing to lie low in tough times. After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/richard-liu-accused-of-rape/">Richard Liu was accused of rape</a>, the flamboyant founder of JD.com, Alibaba&#8217;s archrival, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/2188891/jdcom-founder-richard-liu-no-show-chinas-biggest-political-event-despite">skipped</a> a key political event in China last year. Tencent founder Pony Ma, who already keeps a low profile, has been absent from the public eye for about a year, though the cause is his chronic &#8220;back problems,&#8221; a source told TechCrunch, and the tech boss has made <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_8474608">virtual appearances</a> at events by sending voice messages in the past year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Steel production accounts for roughly 8% of the emissions that contribute to global climate change. It is one of the industries that sits at the foundation of the modern economy and is one of the most resistant to decarbonization.</p>
<p>As nations around the world race to reduce their environmental footprint and embrace more sustainable methods of production, finding a way to remove carbon from the metals business will be one of the most important contributions to that effort.</p>
<p>One startup that&#8217;s developing a new technology to address the issue is <a href="https://www.bostonmetal.com/">Boston Metal</a>. Previously backed by the Bill Gates-financed Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund, the new company has just raised roughly $50 million of an approximately $60 million financing round to expand its operations, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1763149/000176314921000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The global steel industry may find approximately 14% of its potential value at risk if the business can&#8217;t reduce its environmental impact, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/decarbonization-challenge-for-steel#">according to studies cited by the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co.</a></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boston-metal" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boston-metal">Boston Metal, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which previously raised $20 million back in 2019, uses a process called molten oxide electrolysis (&#8220;MOE&#8221;) to make steel alloys &#8212; and eventually emissions-free steel. The first close of the funding actually came in December 2018 &#8212; two years before the most recent financing round, according to Tadeu Carneiro, the company&#8217;s chief executive.</p>
<p>Over the years since the company raised its last round, Boston Metal has grown from eight employees to a staff that now numbers close to 50. The Woburn, Massachusetts-based company has also been able to continuously operate its three pilot lines producing metal alloys for over a month at a time.</p>
<p>And while the steel program remains the ultimate goal, the company is quickly approaching commercialization with its alloy program, because it isn&#8217;t as reliant on traditional infrastructure and sunk costs according to Carneiro.</p>
<p>Boston Metal&#8217;s technology radically reimagines an industry whose technology hasn&#8217;t changed all that much since the dawn of the Iron Age in 1200 BCE, Carneiro said.</p>
<p>Ultimately the goal is to serve as a technology developer licensing its technology and selling components to steel manufacturers or engineering companies that will ultimately make the steel.</p>
<p>For Boston Metal, the next steps on the product road map are clear. The company will look to have a semi-industrial cell line operating in Woburn by the end of 2022, and by 2024 or 2025 hopes to have its first demonstration plant up and running. &#8220;At that point we will be able to commercialize the technology,&#8221; Carneiro said.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s previous investors include <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/breakthrough-energy-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="breakthrough-energy-ventures">Breakthrough Energy Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Prelude Ventures and the MIT-backed &#8220;hard-tech&#8221; investment firm, <a href="https://www.engine.xyz/">The Engine</a>. All of them came back to invest in the latest infusion of cash into the company along with Devonshire Investors, the private investment firm affiliated with FMR, the parent company of financial services giant, Fidelity, which co-led the deal alongside Piva Capital and another, undisclosed investor.</p>
<p>As a result of its investment, Shyam Kamadolli will take a seat on the company&#8217;s board, according to the filing with the SEC.</p>
<p>MOE takes metals in their raw oxide form and transforms them into molten metal products. Invented at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and based on research from MIT Professor Donald Sadoway, Boston Metal makes molten oxides that are tailored for a specific feedstock and product. Electrons are used to melt the soup and selectively reduce the target oxide. The purified metal pools at the bottom of a cell and is tapped by drilling into the cell using a process adapted from a blast furnace. The tap hole is plugged and the process then continues.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of the technology, according to the company, is its scalability. As producers need to make more alloys, they can increase production capacity.</p>
<p>“Molten oxide electrolysis is a platform technology that can produce a wide array of metals and alloys, but our first industrial deployments will target the ferroalloys on the path to our ultimate goal of steel,” said Carneiro, the company&#8217;s chief executive, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190110005097/en/Boston-Metal-Raises-20M-to-Deliver-Industrial-Scale-Electrolysis-Solution-for-High-Volume-Ferroalloys-Production">in a statement announcing the company&#8217;s $20 million financing back in 2019</a>. “Steel is and will remain one of the staples of modern society, but the production of steel today produces over two gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub>. The same fundamental method for producing steel has been used for millennia, but Boston Metal is breaking that paradigm by replacing coal with electrons.”</p>
<p>No less a tech luminary than <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/bill-gates" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="bill-gates">Bill Gates <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> himself underlined the importance of the decarbonization of the metal business.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.bostonmetal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boston Metal</a> is working on a way to make steel using electricity instead of coal, and to make it just as strong and cheap,&#8221; Gates wrote in his blog,<a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/A-question-to-ask-about-every-climate-plan"> GatesNotes</a>. Although Gates did have a caveat. &#8220;Of course, electrification only helps reduce emissions if it uses clean power, which is another reason why it’s so important to get <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/A-critical-step-to-reduce-climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zero-carbon electricity,</a>&#8221; he wrote.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: Hundreds of Google and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/alphabet" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="alphabet">Alphabet <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> employees unionize</strong></p>
<p>More than 200 employees at Google and its parent company Alphabet have announced that they have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-alphabet-employees-union/">formed the Alphabet Workers Union</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Obviously, that&#8217;s only a tiny fraction of Alphabet&#8217;s workforce of more than 130,000 employees. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html">according to The New York Times</a>, the group is a &#8220;minority union&#8221; designed to give more structure to employee activism, rather than one that negotiates for a contract. And it will also be open to contractors.</p>
<p>“This is historic—the first union at a major tech company by and for all tech workers,” said Google software engineer Dylan Baker in a statement. “We will elect representatives, we will make decisions democratically, we will pay dues, and we will hire skilled organizers to ensure all workers at Google know they can work with us if they actually want to see their company reflect their values.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has acquired social broadcasting app Breaker, the companies announced today via a combination of blog posts and tweets. The deal will see Breaker&#8217;s team joining Twitter to help &#8220;improve the health of the public conversation&#8221; on the service, as well as work on Twitter&#8217;s new audio-based networking project, Twitter Spaces. The Breaker app, however, will shut down on January 15, 2021.</p>
<p>Breaker announced the acquisition <a href="https://blog.breaker.audio/the-breaker-team-is-joining-twitter-f8c1721d66c6">on its company blog</a>, explaining why it believes its team will be a good fit at Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here at Breaker, we’re truly passionate about audio communication and we’re inspired by the ways Twitter is facilitating public conversations for people around the world,&#8221; wrote Breaker CEO Erik Berlin. &#8220;We’re impressed by the entrepreneurial spirit at Twitter and enthusiastic about the new experiences that the team is creating.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Breaker was founded in 2016 and is <a href="https://www.breaker.audio/i/about">led by both</a> CEO Berlin, previously the founder and CTO at social advertising company 140 Proof (which sold to Acuity), and CTO Leah Culver, who previously founded Pownce and Grove and co-authored web technologies OAuth and oEmbed.</p>
<p>The app had launched at a time when podcasts were still very much thought of as audio feeds and podcast apps as productivity tools &#8212; not experiences around which a community could be built. Breaker helped to change that perception by offering an app where users could like and comment on episodes, discover new podcasts by following friends, share favorite shows to social media and much more.</p>
<p>According to Culver&#8217;s tweet, she&#8217;ll be joining Twitter with a focus on Twitter Spaces, Twitter&#8217;s audio-based social networking product and Clubhouse rival. Spaces lets Twitter users chat in real time using voice instead of text, as they do today. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">new product entered beta testing in December.</a> Twitter is currently trying to work out not only the technical issues and bugs with the feature, but also the more complex issues that arise from hosting live audio, including moderation.</p>

<p>&mdash; Michael Montano (@michaelmontano) <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelmontano/status/1346213222416850944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Reached for comment, Twitter pointed to Montano&#8217;s tweet but offered no further details on the acquisition, price or broader plans.</p>
<p>Breaker says it will close in a matter of days its apps and services it built over the past years.</p>
<p>On January 15, 2021, Breaker will shut down for good. Up until that point, Breaker users will be able to export their OPML file to transfer their subscriptions to another podcasting app. Breaker recommends apps like Apple, Spotify, Stitcher, Overcast, Pocket Casts or Castro as an alternative. For those hosting a podcast on Breaker, these can be transferred elsewhere via the RSS feed.</p>
<p>The Breaker acquisition adds to a string of recent podcast M&amp;A activity. But unlike recent deals that involved podcast content, Breaker’s sale is made up of staff and technology, not podcasts themselves. This maps to Twitter’s general focus on collating content from others instead of making its own.</p>
<p>The Breaker deal, with its unannounced price, feels modest. Which means that while the company’s exit to Big Tweet is another point on the board for podcasting companies finding their way to some sort of payout, it fits the general narrative that podcasting services and podcasting content only has so much value.</p>
<p>The acquisition follows other podcast content deals in recent weeks and months, including <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/12/30/amazon-acquires-wondery-podcast/">Amazon&#8217;s $300 million acquisition of Wondery</a>, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/sirius-xm-to-buy-stitcher-podcast-service-for-300-million-report/">Sirius buying Stitcher for $300 million</a>, not to mention all the content deals Spotify has picked up as of late.</p>
<p>That another podcast service sold for around $300 million has become a running joke. That number, while impressive-sounding to the individual, is not the sort of exit that venture capitalists target. The Breaker-Twitter tie-up, then, doesn’t push back on the idea that building a company focused on podcasting is to admit to a future that will have capped future upside.</p>
<p>Whether venture capitalists pull back from podcasting investments in 2021 is not yet clear, but Breaker’s sale does little to argue that private investors shouldn’t.</p>
<p>The real winner in the Breaker deal is Twitter, as it gains key talent as it enters what is shaping up to be a buzzy new market in 2021 for voice-based social networking &#8212; an idea whose time has come, perhaps, thanks to people being stuck at home amid a pandemic. Without conferences and parties to attend, many went in search of better ways to connect online.</p>
<p>But it remains to be seen if Twitter &#8212; a service that has publicly struggled with online toxicity and moderation failures &#8212; will be able to make audio networking a safe place for users to chat, or if it will amplify Twitter&#8217;s existing challenges in these areas. It also remains to be seen if voice-based networking will have a future in a reopened, post-COVID world where we can once again meet others in real-world, public places, instead of Twitter Spaces.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The lure of subscription pricing is the guarantee of recurring revenue for your business. Once a customer flips the switch to turn on your subscription, it&#8217;s easy money:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to recognize your revenue.</li>
<li>Easy to determine your margins and profits.</li>
<li>Easy to enhance your product and extend that revenue out for months, even years.</li>
</ul>
<p>While that&#8217;s true, converting a subscription customer isn&#8217;t as simple as flipping a switch. You can build a platform, launch with fanfare, offer all sorts of incentives and trials to attract potential customers — and watch as they disengage and lapse into limbo.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Contrary to popular belief, subscription pricing doesn&#8217;t work because of the lower price point that a monthly installment allows.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the actual guarantee that comes with subscription pricing, which will happen unless you cultivate a funnel that catches potential subscribers as soon as they learn about your product and follows them until their very last sign-in.</p>
<p>I built my first subscription-model product in 1999. I&#8217;m currently in early-access on my latest, and I&#8217;ve launched a bunch more along the way.</p>
<p>While the customer dynamic has changed over the last 20 years, the conversion process has not. In fact, it&#8217;s actually gotten easier to convert and retain customers through the subscription funnel.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<h2>Why subscription pricing works</h2>
<p>Subscription pricing is a hot trend in just about every business in every industry. Pay-as-you-go is the new normal from software to retail to service.</p>
<p>In my mind, the major shift occurred when mobile phones started pricing unlimited usage per period instead of fixed or cost per minute. Once usage limits were removed, use cases exploded and the promise of a truly mobile computer was finally realized.</p>
<p>Makers of all stripes learned that lesson: From razors to video streaming to accounting software, pricing models have emerged that focus on time periods instead of units.</p>
<p>But contrary to popular belief, subscription pricing doesn&#8217;t work because of the lower price point that a monthly installment allows. It&#8217;s effective because a subscription reorients each customer&#8217;s mind from product function to value proposition.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care what kind of German engineering went into my razor blades, <strong>as long as I have working blades when I need them.</strong></p>
<p>As an entrepreneur, you probably use at least one digital subscription service to build your own product and company, if not several. In fact, just to get to the MVP of my new project, I subscribed to AWS, MailChimp, Zapier and Bubble. I&#8217;m still on the free tier of a few more services for some lower-priority features. There&#8217;s a few more I quit or never tried.</p>
<p>Thus, you know that value prop plays a big part of whether the customer will pay and stay. So reinforcing your value proposition should play a big part in every level of your customer funnel.</p>
<h2>You must catch and track customers to be effective</h2>
<p>A subscription-pricing model without an ability to track the steps in the conversion funnel will result in all the headaches of subscription pricing without any of the benefits.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<a href="https://www.ylventures.com/people/naama-ben-dov/">Naama Ben Dov</a> is an associate at YL Ventures who researches new investment opportunities, analyzes investments through thorough due diligence and provides value-add to portfolio companies.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">From COVID-19’s curve to election polls, public temperature checks to stimulus checks, 2020 was dominated by numbers — the guiding compass of any self-respecting venture capital investor.</p>
<p>As a VC exclusively focused on investments in Israeli cybersecurity, the numbers that guide us have become some of the most interesting to watch over the course of the past year.</p>
<p>The start of a new year presents the perfect opportunity to reflect on the annual performance of Israel&#8217;s cybersecurity ecosystem and prepare for what the next twelve months of innovation will bring. With the global cybersecurity market outperforming this year’s panic-stricken expectations, we carefully combed through the figures to see how Israel’s market, its strongest performer, compared — and predict what it has in store.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The cybersecurity market continues to draw the confidence of investors, who appear to recognize its heightened importance during times of crisis.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The “cyber nation” not only remained strong throughout the pandemic, but even saw a rise in fundraising, especially around application and cloud security, following the emergence of remote workflow security gaps brought on by social distancing. Encouraged by this, investors have demonstrated committed enthusiasm to its growth and M&amp;A landscape.</p>
<p>Emboldened by the sector’s overall strength and new opportunities, today’s Israeli visionaries are developing stronger convictions to build larger companies; many of them, already successful entrepreneurs, are making their own bets in the industry as serial entrepreneurs and angel investors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2092025" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2092025" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2092025" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/YLventuresinfographic.jpg" alt="YL VEntures state of the cyber nation infographic" width="1024" height="630" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/YLventuresinfographic.jpg 1430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/YLventuresinfographic.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/YLventuresinfographic.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/YLventuresinfographic.jpg?resize=768,473 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/YLventuresinfographic.jpg?resize=680,418 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/YLventuresinfographic.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2092025" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.ylventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YL Ventures <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The numbers also reveal how investors are increasingly concentrating their funds on larger seed rounds for serial entrepreneurs and the foremost industry trends. More than $2.75 billion was poured into the industry this year to back companies across all stages, a 97% increase from last year’s $1.39 billion. If its long-term slope is any indication, we can only expect it to continue to grow.</p>
<p>However, though they clearly indicate progress, the numbers still make the need for a demographic reset clear. Like the rest of the industry, Israel’s cybersecurity ecosystem must adapt to the pace of change set out by this year’s social movements, and the time has long passed for true diversity and gender representation in cybersecurity leadership.</p>
<h2><strong>Seed rounds reveal fascinating shifts</strong></h2>
<p>As the market’s biggest leaders garner experience and expertise, the bar for entry to Israel’s cybersecurity startup ecosystem has gradually risen over the years. However, this did not appear to impact this year’s entrepreneurial breakthroughs. 58% of Israel’s newly founded cybersecurity companies received seed rounds this year, totaling 64 seeded companies in 2020 compared with last year’s 61. The total number of newly founded companies increased by 5%, reversing last year’s downward trend.</p>
<p>The amount invested at seed hit an all-time high as average deal size in 2020 increased by 11%, amounting to an average of $5.2 million per deal. This continues an upward trend in average seed rounds, which have surged over the last four years due to sizable year-on-year increases. It also provides further support for a shift toward higher caliber seed rounds with a strategically focused and “all-in” approach. In other words, founders that meet the new bar for entry are raising bigger rounds for more ambitious visions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2092026" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2092026" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2092026" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/seedtrends.jpg" alt="YL ventures seed trends 2020" width="1024" height="479" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/seedtrends.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/seedtrends.jpg?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/seedtrends.jpg?resize=300,140 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/seedtrends.jpg?resize=768,360 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/seedtrends.jpg?resize=680,318 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/seedtrends.jpg?resize=1536,719 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/seedtrends.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2092026" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YL Ventures</p></div></p>
<h2><strong>Where is the money going?</strong></h2>
<p>2020 proved an exceptional year for application security and cloud security startups. Perhaps the runaway successes of Snyk and Checkmarx left strong impressions. This year saw an explosive 140% increase in application security company seed investments (such as Enso Security, build.security and CloudEssence), as well as a whopping 200% increase in cloud security seed investments (like Solvo and DoControl), from last year.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another week, another email newsletter. This time, the story is <a href="https://punchbowl.news">Punchbowl</a>, a politics-centric newsletter founded by a crop of recent Politico alums including Jake Sherman, Anna Palmer and John Bresnahan. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/03/business/media/punchbowl-playbook-capitol-hill-politics.html">Ben Smith has the story</a>, as does Maxwell Tani at the Daily Beast with <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-politico-playbook-shake-up-jake-sherman-and-anna-palmers-exit">some more juicy details</a>.</p>
<p>Why do we need another newsletter analyzing Beltway politics in a world of Politico Playbook, Axios, The Daily 202 and a hundred others? In fact, why do we need the voluminous output of tech-oriented newsletters covering startups (by my count, there are at least several thousand newsletters covering our industry)? Why, in a media world that was supposed to be all about the long-tail, does it seem that every new media startup is targeting the same single niche over and over again?</p>
<p>That’s where the cauldrons of gold come in. Media is not unlike many startup markets — there may be infinite needs for diverse products, but there are only a handful of those needs that have serious dollars attached to them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In media, these are beats like DC politics, or investment banking / M&amp;A, or VC coverage in our quaint little world of startups, where the winners get to own massive audiences and, by extension, massive dollars from subscribers and advertisers. There are thousands of other niches, but they are impoverished with limited readership, users and recourse to revenue.</p>
<p>Put another way, these are tournament markets, where the winners can take all and where it is worth the gamble to have a small chance at a massive outcome rather than a good chance at a mediocre one. In medicine, “everyone” wants to cure cancer, not some neglected tropical disease (which might well have millions of people who could benefit from a cure). After all, the Nobel Prizes don’t go to merely good science, they go for the biggest advances of the century that have the right level of notability. In startups, founders want to target the largest business and consumer markets, not the small application that might be useful but won’t become a juggernaut.</p>
<p>Unicorns are not born in small markets.</p>
<p>There are of course hugely negative externalities to this model for many markets. All that competition to dominate the “first-read newsletter” on Capitol Hill or along Sand Hill Road means that we are overwhelmed with identical analyses on the same subjects rather than being able to select from a wide spectrum of different options. We probably should have more coverage of emerging market tech or state capitols than we do today.</p>
<p>In startups, we have way too many entrants in some extremely valuable layers of fintech, for example. There are at least … 50? 100? wealth-management startups and incumbent products that focus on automated investing in ETFs (so-called “roboadvisors”). Yet, there is so much money to be made in some of these layers, that every founder with sense is essentially saying “I’ll take my chances for the reward at the end of that particular road.”</p>
<p>You would sort of think the free market would work itself out in these niches. All that competition for attention in the DC media world or for wealth management users should ultimately lower costs and divide the pie thinly enough that it becomes less attractive for new entrants and makes other niches and markets look far more relatively competitive.</p>
<p>That would be true if the pie <i>did</i> actually subdivide further and further. Experience over the last decade though has proven to me that this is quite often not the case. DC politics <i>is</i> the cauldron of gold for politics coverage, and there are one to three newsletters that will always dominate that beat. M&amp;A coverage on Wall Street <i>is</i> the cauldron of gold of business journalism, and a handful of reporters are going to own that beat by being the switchboards for all the most important sources. And VC coverage <i>is</i> the cauldron of gold for startup media, which is why TechCrunch and a few of our friendly competitors work so hard to cover it every day.</p>
<p>New markets do get invented and old markets expand and contract. There are absolutely startups that sort of come from nowhere and dazzle us with their originality and ability to create whole new categories. Yet, for every unicorn that gets its start that way, there are 10 others that get built in existing major markets and compete for the big reward offered to the winner.</p>
<p>There isn’t anything wrong with investors who want to fund the fifteenth startup in a space. It makes sense — that’s where the rewards are, or at least, where we perceive the rewards to be. What needs to change is how to make some of those other niches offer the same incentives for innovation. How can more markets offer cauldrons of gold? Is that even possible? Or are we destined to read 100 newsletters on McConnell and Schumer’s machinations while getting ads for Marcus?</p>

One of the main reasons is that each partner in the venture was apparently just pursuing their own very different strategic approach to their respective healthcare challenges, meaning there really wasn&#8217;t much &#8220;joint&#8221; in the joint venture to begin with.</p>
<p>In a statement provided to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cnbc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cnbc">CNBC, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a Haven spokesperson highlighted some of the good results that came out of the partnership over the years, including improving access to primary care and making insurance benefits packages easier to grasp for employees. Meanwhile, Amazon has made lots of progress on its own with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/amazon-care-healthcare-service/">Amazon Care program</a>, which is its internal healthcare program for employees at its Washington facilities.</p>

<p>Amazon Care includes provision of both virtual and in-person primary care doctor visits and prescription delivery. The company is also reported to be considering expansion of this service to other businesses, which signals its intent to turn it into a real business with aims very much in line with what the Haven JV had originally taken as its guiding light.</p>
<p>To be honest, the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/amazon-jpmorgan-and-berkshire-hathaway-to-build-their-own-healthcare-company/"> original announcement</a> about the JV&#8217;s founding was light on details and seemed like one of those things that comes together when very rich people talk about their shared problems over a casual afternoon hang at the club with caviar and mineral water distilled from pristine arctic ice or whatever they enjoy during their repasts, so it&#8217;s not all that surprising it didn&#8217;t materialize into anything more substantial.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aeva" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aeva">Aeva, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the lidar company started by two former Apple engineers, has raised an additional $200 million in private investment from Hong Kong hedge fund Sylebra Capital ahead of its debut as a publicly traded company.</p>
<p>The Mountain View, California-based startup announced in fall 2020 that it was merging with special purpose acquisition company InterPrivate Acquisition Corp., with a post-deal market valuation of $2.1 billion. The new investment from Sylebra, which is a current holder of InterPrivate common stock, brings the total gross proceeds it will have once it begins trading to more than<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> $560 million, according to the company.</span></p>
<p>Aeva had previously raised $120 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, including investments from Adage Capital and Porsche SE. Its combined company gross proceeds, a figure that includes $243 million held in trust by InterPrivate, was at $363 million before Sylebra stepped forward with its additional investment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Importantly, Sylebra has also entered into a one-year lock-up agreement on the majority of its investment and will vote all eligible shares in favor of the transaction. Aeva said the merger is expected to close in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Aeva co-founder and CEO Soroush Salehian called the investment a &#8220;major vote of confidence&#8221; in the company&#8217;s business model and growth plans. Aeva will use the additional $200 million to further invest into R&amp;D and scale up its programs across key verticals in automotive, consumer electronics and industrial applications, Salehian said in an emailed comment to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen an increase in customer interest for our unique 4D LiDAR technology across all of these areas in the past few months and the additional resources will allow us to address this increased demand faster,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Lidar, light detection and ranging radar, measures distance using laser light to generate a highly accurate 3D map of the world around the car. Aeva’s founders Salehian and Mina Rezk developed what they call “4D lidar,” which can measure distance as well as instant velocity without losing range, all while preventing interference from the sun or other sensors. The company’s FMCW technology also uses less power, allowing it to fold in perception software.</p>
<p>Lidar sensors are widely considered critical to the commercial deployment of autonomous vehicles. However, the sensors have numerous other use cases that lidar companies have begun to pursue as the road to commercializing autonomous vehicles has turned out to be longer than expected. In the past two years, automakers have begun to view lidar as an important sensor to be used to boost the capabilities and safety of its advanced driver assistance systems in the new cars, trucks and SUVs available to consumers. Aeva&#8217;s technology has been primarily developed for use in autonomous vehicles as well as advanced driving assistance systems, Salehian has said its technology is also piquing the interest of those in consumer electronics.</p>
<p>Aeva is one of a handful of lidar companies to eschew the traditional IPO path and go public via a SPAC merger. Velodyne and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/lidar-startup-luminar-to-go-public-via-3-4-billion-spac-merger/">Luminar have also merged</a> with SPACs to to become publicly traded companies. Lidar startup Ouster announced in December that it has agreed to go public through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Colonnade Acquisition Corp.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As we turn the page, I have a number of questions worth raising as we muck into 2021.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome to 2021, a year that could extend 2020&#8217;s startup market disruptions and excesses — or change patterns that previously performed well for early-stage tech companies and their investors.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>As we turn the page, I have a number of questions worth raising as we muck into 2021.</p>
<p>Each relates to a 2020 change that is expected to persist, by either the general market or those bullish on startups. I want to know what would need to change to shake up what became the new normal last year. After all, it&#8217;s precisely when it feels like nothing could shake up a downturn (or a boom) that things often do.</p>

<h2>1. How long can seed deal-making stay hot?</h2>
<p>As 2020 came to a close, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/us-seed-stage-investing-flourished-during-pandemic/">Natasha Mascarenhas and I reported</a> on seed investing&#8217;s strong year and its especially strong second half. How long can that pace keep up?</p>
<p>Nearly all our questions today deal with the endurance of certain conditions, namely: how long the market can keep parts of startup land red-hot.</p>
<p>When it comes to seed deal-making, Q1 and Q2 2020 saw similar levels of investment in the United States. But Q3 proved explosive, with money invested into domestic seed deals rising from around $1.5 to $1.6 billion during the first two quarters to $2.2 billion in the July-September period.</p>
<p>Q4 numbers are yet to fully come in, but it&#8217;s clear that private investors were incredibly bullish on early-stage startups in the second half of 2020. How long can that keep up? I think the answer is for a while yet, as investors have shown scant enthusiasm for slowing down their dealmaking cadence.</p>
<p>While cadence remains hot generally, seed deals should stay heated as the number of investors who are willing to invest early has increased.</p>
<p>Which brings us to our second question:</p>
<h2>2. How long can investors keep writing such quick checks?</h2>
<p>A theme that cropped up in the second half of 2020 was the pace at which investors were conducting venture capital deals. This was for a few reasons. To start, venture capitalists have raised larger funds in recent years, meaning that they need larger returns to make the math work out. This led to many investors putting money to work in younger and younger companies, hoping to get in early on a big win. That setup led to more deal competition and faster deal-making.</p>
<p>How? Two things. Investors who were already on a startup&#8217;s cap table &#8212; already part-owners, in other words &#8212; led preemptive rounds, in part to get ahead of other investors who might want to poach the succeeding deal. Other investors, knowing this, seemed to do the same math and move even faster, and earlier, to get around the defense.</p>
<p>So how long can the trend keep up? Given that many big VC firms raised in 2020, many startups picked up some tailwinds from the COVID-19 economy and exits have been strong, forever? Until something stops things? Think of it as Newton&#8217;s First Law of startup investing.</p>
<p>What could be the sudden impact to shake up the current set of conditions boosting the pace at which seed and later deals occur? An asteroid strike is probably too extreme, but inertia is one hell of a drug and markets love to stay happy.</p>
<p>Moving along, all the competition to get money to work in hot startups <em>now</em> has had another effect than the mere speed of deal-making; it has also pushed prices higher.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Research papers come out far too rapidly for anyone to read them all, especially in the field of machine learning, which now affects (and produces papers in) practically every industry and company. This column aims to collect the most relevant recent discoveries and papers — particularly in but not limited to artificial intelligence — and explain why they matter.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			A number of recently published research projects have used machine learning to attempt to better understand or predict these phenomena.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This week has a bit more &#8220;basic research&#8221; than consumer applications. Machine learning can be applied to advantage in many ways users benefit from, but it&#8217;s also transformative in areas like seismology and biology, where enormous backlogs of data can be leveraged to train AI models or as raw material to be mined for insights.</p>
<h2>Inside earthshakers</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re surrounded by natural phenomena that we don&#8217;t really understand — obviously we know where earthquakes and storms come from, but how exactly do they propagate? What secondary effects are there if you cross-reference different measurements? How far ahead can these things be predicted?</p>
<p>A number of recently published research projects have used machine learning to attempt to better understand or predict these phenomena. With decades of data available to draw from, there are insights to be gained across the board this way — if the seismologists, meteorologists and geologists interested in doing so can obtain the funding and expertise to do so.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lanl.gov/discover/news-release-archive/2020/December/1209-slow-quakes.php">The most recent discovery</a>, made by researchers at Los Alamos National Labs, uses a new source of data as well as ML to document previously unobserved behavior along faults during &#8220;slow quakes.&#8221; Using synthetic aperture radar captured from orbit, which can see through cloud cover and at night to give accurate, regular imaging of the shape of the ground, the team was able to directly observe &#8220;rupture propagation&#8221; for the first time, along the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="W3FtOD0BV6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/capella-space-now-offers-the-highest-resolution-sar-imagery-commercially-available/">Capella Space now offers the highest resolution SAR imagery commercially available</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Capella Space now offers the highest resolution SAR imagery commercially available&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/capella-space-now-offers-the-highest-resolution-sar-imagery-commercially-available/embed/#?secret=W3FtOD0BV6" data-secret="W3FtOD0BV6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The deep-learning approach we developed makes it possible to automatically detect the small and transient deformation that occurs on faults with unprecedented resolution, paving the way for a systematic study of the interplay between slow and regular earthquakes, at a global scale,&#8221; said Los Alamos geophysicist Bertrand Rouet-Leduc.</p>
<p>Another effort, which has been ongoing for a few years now at Stanford, helps Earth science researcher Mostafa Mousavi deal with the signal-to-noise problem with seismic data. Poring over data being analyzed by old software for the billionth time one day, he felt there had to be better way and has spent years working on various methods. The most recent is a way of teasing out evidence of tiny earthquakes that went unnoticed but still left a record in the data.</p>
<p><a href="https://earth.stanford.edu/news/ai-detects-hidden-earthquakes">The &#8220;Earthquake Transformer&#8221;</a> (named after a machine-learning technique, not the robots) was trained on years of hand-labeled seismographic data. When tested on readings collected during Japan&#8217;s magnitude 6.6 Tottori earthquake, it isolated 21,092 separate events, more than twice what people had found in their original inspection — and using data from less than half of the stations that recorded the quake.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091015" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EarthquakeAI1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091015" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2091015" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EarthquakeAI1.gif" alt="Map of minor seismic events detected by the Earthquake Transformer." width="1024" height="512" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2091015" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Stanford University</p></div></p>
<p>The tool won&#8217;t predict earthquakes on its own, but better understanding the true and full nature of the phenomena means we might be able to by other means. &#8220;By improving our ability to detect and locate these very small earthquakes, we can get a clearer view of how earthquakes interact or spread out along the fault, how they get started, even how they stop,&#8221; said co-author Gregory Beroza.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A court in Italy has dealt a blow to unalloyed algorithmic management after a legal challenge brought by three unions. The Bologna court ruled that a reputational-ranking algorithm used by on-demand food delivery platform <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/deliveroo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="deliveroo">Deliveroo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> discriminated against gigging delivery workers by breaching local labor laws.</p>
<p>The ruling, reported earlier in the <a href="https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/in-edicola/articoli/2021/01/02/rider-lalgoritmo-discrimina-chi-si-ammala-e-chi-sciopera/6053273/">Italian</a> <a href="https://www.ansa.it/emiliaromagna/notizie/2021/01/02/rider-cgilalgoritmo-discrimina-sentenza-tribunale-bologna_cc14c299-2c6b-411b-b677-496549ee3af1.html">press</a>, found Deliveroo&#8217;s ranking algorithm discriminated against delivery couriers because it did not distinguish between legally protected reasons for withholding labour &#8212; namely not working because a rider was sick; or exercising their protected right to strike &#8212; and more trivial reasons for not being as productive as they&#8217;d indicated they would be.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.cgil.it/rider-cgil-sentenza-tribunale-bologna-e-svolta-epocale-algoritmo-discrimina-chi-si-ammala-e-chi-sciopera/">statement</a>, the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL) called the Bologna court ruling &#8220;an epochal turning point in the conquest of trade union rights and freedoms in the digital world&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Deliveroo has been contacted for comment on the ruling. <strong>Update: </strong>A company spokesperson has now sent us this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;This judgement refers to a historic optional booking model which is not used by Deliveroo in Italy or other markets. Riders have complete flexibility to choose when to work, where to work, for little or as long as they want. This means that there is no booking system and no obligation to accept work.</span></div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;We offer self-employment because this offers the flexibility riders want. Every survey shows riders overwhelmingly value flexibility above all else &#8212; more than 80% in the latest survey. Currently Deliveroo receives thousands of requests to work as a self-employed rider each week and we have doubled the number of riders in the UK &#8212; we now work with 50,000 riders in the UK, up from 25,000 last year.&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The court ordered Deliveroo to pay €50,000 per affected rider and publish the ruling on its website, according to <a href="https://www.ansa.it/emiliaromagna/notizie/2021/01/02/rider-cgilalgoritmo-discrimina-sentenza-tribunale-bologna_cc14c299-2c6b-411b-b677-496549ee3af1.html">Ansa.it</a> &#8212; which has obtained a statement from Matteo Sarzana, general manager of Deliveroo Italy, who<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> told it the company notes the judge&#8217;s decision but does not agree with it, as well as confirming that the shift-reservation system linked to the algorithmic ranking is no longer in use in the market.  </span></p>
<p>&#8220;The fairness of our old system is confirmed by the fact that not a single case of objective and real discrimination emerged in the course of the trial. The decision is based exclusively on a hypothetical and potential evaluation without concrete evidence,&#8221; Sarzana added in the statement [which we&#8217;ve translated from Italian].</p>
<p>The on-demand delivery app has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/unions-human-rights-challenge-to-deliveroo-dismissed-by-uk-high-court/">faced down</a> a number of legal challenges on home turf &#8212; related to its classification of gig workers (as self employed couriers) and its opposition to collective bargaining rights for riders.</p>
<p>Although a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/deliveroos-flexible-labor-model-likened-to-20th-century-dockyards/">2018 inquiry led by U.K. MP Frank Field</a> likened its &#8220;flexible&#8221; labor model to 20th century dockyards &#8212; saying the dual labor market that Deliveroo generates works very well for some riders but very poorly for others.</p>
<p>The Bologna court ruling is also notable in light of<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> a number of legal challenges against other gig platforms&#8217; use of algorithms to manage large &#8220;self-employed&#8221; workforces which have been filed in Europe in recent months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This includes a group of Uber drivers who filed a challenge to Uber&#8217;s automated decision-making in the Netherlands</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/uk-uber-drivers-are-taking-its-algorithm-to-court/"> last summer</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; making reference to pan-EU data protection law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While r</span>ide-hailing company Ola is facing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/ola-is-facing-a-drivers-legal-challenge-over-data-access-rights-and-algorithmic-management/">a similar challenge</a> to its use of technological surveillance and data as a management tool to control a self-employed workforce.</p>
<p>Rulings on those cases are still pending.</p>
<p>At the same time, EU lawmakers have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">proposed</a> new laws that would require large online platforms to provide regulators with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/big-techs-blackbox-algorithms-face-regulatory-oversight-under-eu-plan/">information about how their algorithmic ranking systems function</a> &#8212; with the aim of enabling wider societal oversight of AI-fuelled giants.</p>
<p>The move to enable oversight and accountability of platforms&#8217; algorithms comes in response to concerns about a lack of transparency and the potential for<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> automated decisions to scale bias, discrimination and exploitation. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://onewayvc.com/">One Way Ventures</a>, a venture capital firm that backs immigrant founders, has closed its second fund at $57.5 million. The close comes three years after One Way announced its debut fund, a $28 million investment vehicle.</p>
<p>The new fund will allow One Way to grow their check size from $500,000 to $1 million, giving them the ability to lead institutional seed rounds at a faster clip, says founding partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/semyondukach/">Semyon Dukach</a>. The bigger fund is par for the course now that the debut fund has been invested out, but also indicates how the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/us-seed-stage-investing-flourished-during-pandemic/"> seed boom is flourishing,</a> forcing investors to recapitalize to stay competitive.</p>
<p>One Way is one of the few venture capital firms with an explicit focus on backing immigrant founders. Another firm that backs immigrants and helps them stay in the country is <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/unshackled-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="unshackled-ventures">Unshackled Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/unshackled-ventures-has-20m-to-invest-exclusively-in-immigrant-founders/"> last closed a $20 million fund in 2019.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dukach says that the firm&#8217;s immigrant focus is one of its biggest competitive advantages to get into deals. One Way says it brings together immigrant founders into one community and speaks the same language (metaphorically) of adapting to a new country, culture and environment. While COVID-19 has limited the opportunity to meet in person, the firm is experimenting with the concept of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/">virtual HQs</a> and events to bring together its portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Community and translation in a closed-door world such as venture capital is “the reason we will almost always get into the rounds,” Dukach said.</p>
<p>“We’ve been able to get into competitive rounds because we were treated like an angel who provides a lot of value, even when part of the value is just the feeling of being part of something really cool.”</p>
<p>OneWay&#8217;s investments include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/brex-brings-on-150m-in-new-cash-in-case-of-an-extended-recession/">Brex</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/08/classtag-raises-5m-for-parent-teacher-communication/">Classtag</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/african-fintech-startup-chipper-cash-raises-30m-backed-by-jeff-bezos/"> Chipper.</a> Of its <a href="https://onewayvc.com/portfolio/">48 portfolio</a> companies, two companies don’t have an immigrant co-founder. The generalist firm has bets in machine learning, fintech and edtech prominently.</p>
<p>The immigration environment during the Trump administration, both from a rhetoric <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/trump-student-visa-silicon-valley/">and policy perspective</a>, has impacted One Way, albeit lightly, according to Dukach. The firm has a venture partner in Montreal, <a href="https://www.apollo.io/people/Philippe/Kalaf/5570230473696435bb5a0e00">Philippe Kalaf</a>, to hedge against potential policy moves.</p>
<p>As for closing a fund during a pandemic and election year, One Way closed nearly double the capital it initially planned to raise, adding to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/are-vcs-cutting-checks-in-the-closing-days-of-the-2020-election/">parade of check-writing and cash in this year.</a></p>
<p>“We had a couple LPs hold off until after the election,” Dukach said. “They were more comfortable investing once Biden won.”</p>

<p>One Way is expectedly growing its team as it scores new capital. The firm <a href=" https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/one-way-ventures-expands-to-san-francisco-from-boston-with-eugene-malobrodsky-co-founder-of-consumer-privacy-company-anchorfree-joining-as-partner-301131662.html">expanded to San Francisco </a>from Boston by adding Eugene Malobrodsky, the co-founder of a consumer privacy startup, as a partner.</p>
<p>The firm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/10/venture-capital-gets-less-diverse-in-2020/">similar to many venture capital firms</a>, lags when it comes to the diversity of its decision-makers. Right now, all the partners at One Way are men. The firm plans to add <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-asoyan-55712a6/">Nadia Asoyan</a>, former executive at Robinhood and current executive at Trusted Health, as a venture partner, which is different from a general partner. The venture partner role needs sign off from a GP in order to make a decision or write a check. Other female members of the team include <a href="https://twitter.com/anniepatyk">Annie Patyk</a>, a platform associate.</p>

<p>From a portfolio perspective, One Way has backed 10 female-founded or co-founded companies out of its 50 companies. Its portfolio also includes 19 companies with minority co-founders and seven companies with Black or Latinx founders.</p>
<p>The ideal founder, according to Dukach, embodies the firm’s name in their strategy.</p>
<p>“Someone who went one way, bought the ticket without having a company or any certainty of where they’re going to end up, without having the language or the culture or the network,” Dukach said. “Someone who emerges through that? It’s just more predictive of future success. It’s more predictive of being able to disrupt a big industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Healthcare startup <a href="https://www.color.com">Color</a> has raised a sizable $167 million in Series D funding round, at a valuation of $1.5 billion post-money, the company announced today. This brings the total raised by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/color-genomics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="color-genomics">Color <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to $278 million, with its latest large round intended to help it build on a record year of growth in 2020 with even more expansion to help put in place key health infrastructure systems across the U.S. — including those related to the &#8220;last mile&#8221; delivery of COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>This latest investment into Color was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/general-catalyst-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="general-catalyst-partners">General Catalyst, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and by funds invested by T. Rowe Price, along with participation from Viking Global investors as well as others. Alongside the funding, the company is also bringing on a number of key senior executives, including Claire Vo (formerly of Optimizely) as chief product officer, Emily Reuter (formerly of Uber, where she played a key role in its IPO process) as VP of Strategy and Operations, and Ashley Chandler (formerly of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stripe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stripe">Stripe) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as VP of Marketing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think with the [COVID-19] crisis, it&#8217;s really shone the light on that lack of infrastructure. We saw it multiple times, with lab testing, with antigen testing and now with vaccines,&#8221; Color CEO and co-founder <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/othman-laraki" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="othman-laraki">Othman Laraki <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> told me in an interview. &#8220;The model that we&#8217;ve been developing, that&#8217;s been working really well and we feel like this is the opportunity to really scale it in a very major way. I think literally what&#8217;s happening is the building of the public health infrastructure for the country that&#8217;s starting off from a technology-first model, as opposed to, what ends up happening in a lot of industries, which is you start off taking your existing logistics and assets, and add technology to them.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Color&#8217;s 2020 was a record year for the company, thanks in part to partnerships like the one it formed with San Francisco to establish testing for healthcare workers and residents. Laraki told me they did about five-fold their prior year&#8217;s business, and while the company is already set up to grow on its own sustainably based on the revenue it pulls in from customers, its ambitions and plans for 2021 and beyond made this the right time to help it accelerate further with the addition of more capital.</p>
<p>Laraki described Color&#8217;s approach as one that is both cost-efficient for the company, and also significant cost-saving for the healthcare providers it works with. He likens their approach to the shift that happened in retail with the move to online sales — and the contribution of one industry heavyweight in particular.</p>
<p>&#8220;At some point, you build <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> — a technology-first stack that&#8217;s optimized around access and scale,&#8221; Laraki said. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s literally what we&#8217;re seeing now with healthcare. What&#8217;s kind of getting catalyzed right now is we&#8217;ve been realizing it applies to the COVID crisis, but also, we started actually working on that for prevention and I think actually it&#8217;s going to be applying to a huge surface area in healthcare; basically all the aspects of health that are not acute care where you don&#8217;t need to show up in hospital.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, Color&#8217;s approach is to rethink healthcare delivery in order to &#8220;make it accessible at the edge directly in people&#8217;s lives,&#8221; with &#8220;low transaction costs,&#8221; in a way that&#8217;s &#8220;scalable, [and] doesn&#8217;t use a lot of clinical resourcing,&#8221; Laraki says. He notes that this is actually very possible once you reasses the problem without relying on a lot of accepted knowledge about the way things are done today, which result in a &#8220;heavy stack&#8221; versus what you actually need to deliver the desired outcomes.</p>
<p>Laraki doesn&#8217;t think the problem is easy to solve — on the contrary, he acknowledges that 2021 is likely to be even more difficult and challenging than 2020 in many ways for the healthcare industry, and we&#8217;ve already begun to see evidence of that in the many challenges already faced by vaccine distribution and delivery in its initial rollout. But he&#8217;s optimistic about Color&#8217;s ability to help address those challenges, and to build out a &#8220;last mile&#8221; delivery system for crucial care that expands accessibility, while also making sure things are done right.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you take a step back, doing COVID testing or COVID vaccinations … those are not complex procedures at all — they&#8217;re extremely simple procedures,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What&#8217;s hard is doing them massive scale and with a very low transaction cost to the individual and to the system. And that&#8217;s a very different tooling.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The new year is kicking off with the launch of a new streaming service — <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/discovery-inc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="discovery-inc">Discovery+, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which offers programming from Discovery&#8217;s networks including HGTV, Food Network, TLC, ID, OWN, Travel Channel, Discovery Channel and Animal Planet.</p>
<p>Discovery+ actually launched in the United Kingdom and Ireland last fall through a deal with Sky, but the company is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/discovery-will-launch-its-own-streaming-service-on-january-4/">treating today as the big launch</a>, as the service becomes available in the United States.</p>
<p>Despite the crowded field of competing streaming services (including the similarly named Disney+, ESPN+, Apple TV+ and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/cbs-all-access-to-rebrand-to-paramount-expand-internationally-in-2021/">upcoming Paramount+</a>), Discovery+ is aiming to stand out with a focus on documentary and reality content — it bills itself as &#8220;the definitive nonfiction, real-life subscription streaming service.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Plus, it&#8217;s priced at just $4.99 per month, or $6.99 if you want to go ad-free. And it will be free to some <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/verizon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="verizon">Verizon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Vodafone subscribers. (Verizon owns TechCrunch.)</p>

<p>At launch, original shows available on Discovery+ include several &#8220;90 Day Fiancé&#8221; spinoffs, &#8220;Amy Schumer Learns to Cook: Uncensored,&#8221; &#8220;Bobby and Giada in Italy&#8221; with Bobby Flay, &#8220;House Hunters: Comedians on Couches Unfiltered&#8221; (in which comedians watch classic episodes of &#8220;House Hunters&#8221;), the nature documentary &#8220;Mysterious Planet,&#8221; &#8220;Judi Dench’s Wild Borneo Adventure and a whole lineup of preview episodes for the upcoming Magnolia Network.</p>
<p>Discovery says the service includes more than 55,000 total episodes, with plans to launch 1,000 hours of original content in the first year. And the content goes beyond Discovery-owned brands, with nature documentaries from the BBC and programming from A&amp;E, The History Channel and Lifetime.</p>
<p>Discovery+ is available on Amazon Fire TV devices, iOS devices, Google TV/Android TV/Chromecast devices, Microsoft Xbox One and Series S/X, Roku and Samsung smart TVs (2017 and later models). The plan is to launch in 25 markets this year, including the Nordics, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, as well as parts of Latin America and Asia.</p>
<p>“As we go live with Discovery+ today in the U.S., we are thrilled to be working with best-in-class partners to make it available everywhere our fans are,&#8221; said Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav in a statement. &#8220;Our ambition is simple: Bring consumers the definitive and most complete destination for real-life entertainment at a price point that makes this the perfect companion for every household&#8217;s streaming and TV portfolio. There is nothing like it in the market today.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new agreement between <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hulu" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hulu">Hulu <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/viacomcbs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="viacomcbs">ViacomCBS <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will bring 14 new channels to Hulu&#8217;s live TV streaming service, while also renewing the deal that allows <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hulu" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hulu">Hulu <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to carry various <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cbs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cbs">CBS <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> broadcast stations and Showtime. According to ViacomCBS, the new multiyear distribution deal will for the first time allow Hulu + Live TV subscribers to stream cable networks like BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Paramount Network, VH1, CMT, Nick Jr., TV Land, BET Her, MTV2, NickToons, TeenNick and MTV Classic.</p>
<p>With the Hulu agreement in place, the two top live TV streaming services available in the U.S. will now carry the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/viacomcbs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="viacomcbs">ViacomCBS <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> channel lineup. Hulu + Live TV is the largest of the two, with 4.1 million subscribers as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/disney-73-million-subscribers/">of Disney&#8217;s Q4 earnings</a>. Meanwhile, YouTube TV <a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/10/29/youtube-tv-subscribers/">has 3 million subscribers</a>, as of Alphabet&#8217;s Q4 earnings.</p>
<p>ViacomCBS had forged <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/05/youtube-tv-and-viacomcbs-expand-carriage-deal-adding-14-networks-1202928304/">its agreement</a> with Google-owned YouTube TV earlier in 2020, which introduced the same channel lineup and had allowed the streamer to keep carrying CBS broadcast stations and the premium subscription channel Showtime.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hulu + Live TV will now also be able to continue to carry <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cbs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cbs">CBS <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> stations including CBS Sports Network, Pop TV, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/smithsonian-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="smithsonian-2">Smithsonian <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Channel and The CW, as well as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/showtime" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="showtime">Showtime <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Offering the ViacomCBS cable lineup to live TV streamers represents a different strategy than <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/viacom" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="viacom">Viacom <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/hulus-new-live-tv-service-scores-aes-channels-loses-viacom/">had in the past</a>, before the 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/viacomcbs/">merger</a> with CBS. In previous years, <a href="https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/hulu-live-tv-service-no-viacom-networks-1202006300/">it allowed a deal with Hulu to fall through</a> as well as those with other streamers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/08/playstation-vues-streaming-tv-service-is-losing-all-viacom-channels/">like the now-shuttered PlayStation Vue</a>. In the meantime, the company focused on more traditional carriage agreements with pay TV operators.</p>
<p>During its first full year as a newly combined company, ViacomCBS in 2020 has pursued a different course. It got the major carriage deals done with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/comcast" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="comcast">Comcast, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Dish, Verizon (TechCrunch&#8217;s parent), Nextstar, Meredith, Cox and Sinclair, but it also hashed out agreements with YouTube TV and Hulu for incremental revenues.</p>
<p>For streaming service customers, however, these deals aren&#8217;t always welcome. While it&#8217;s nice to gain access to new channels, agreements like this have also resulted in increased subscription prices. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/youtube" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="youtube">YouTube <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> TV, for example, <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/youtube-tv-price-hike-viacom-cbs-channels/">hiked its price 30%</a> in June 2020 due to the addition of the ViacomCBS channels.</p>
<p>Hulu <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/hulu-will-increase-the-price-of-its-live-tv-service-again-on-december-18th/">announced</a> in November 2020 that it would also raise the prices of its Live TV service to $65 per month starting on December 18, 2020, due to the rising costs of programming. It didn&#8217;t attribute the price hike to any specific deal at the time, but it now seems clear the ViacomCBS-led expansion of its Live TV service was a factor in that decision.</p>
<p>The ViacomCBS deals with YouTube TV and now Hulu do raise the question as to how the company plans to attract customers to its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/cbs-all-access-to-rebrand-to-paramount-expand-internationally-in-2021/">forthcoming streaming service</a>, <a href="https://www.paramountplus.com/">Paramount+</a>. The service, which will be an expanded and rebranded version of CBS All Access, is set to launch in 2021. Though ViacomCBS channels are not its only draw, they do make up a fair bit of its offering, in addition to the library content, CBS channels and original series, like the new &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; shows.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to have reached an expanded agreement with Hulu that underscores the value of our powerful portfolio of brands to next-generation TV platforms and viewers,&#8221; said Ray Hopkins, president, U.S. Networks Distribution, ViacomCBS, in a statement about the new deal. &#8220;Hulu continues to be a great partner, and this agreement ensures that Hulu + Live TV subscribers are now able to enjoy the full breadth of our leading content across news, sports and entertainment for the first time.&#8221;</p>
<p>ViacomCBS didn&#8217;t specify when the new channels would become available on Hulu with Live TV.</p>
