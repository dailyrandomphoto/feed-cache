										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past year, the coronavirus crisis has spurred app usage in the United States as people stay indoors to limit contact with others. Mobile games particularly have enjoyed a boom, and among them, games from Chinese studios are gaining popularity.</p>
<p>Games released on the U.S. App Store and Google Play Store raked in a total of $5.8 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter, jumping 34.3% from a year before and accounting for over a quarter of the world&#8217;s mobile gaming revenues, according to a new report from market research firm <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HtuhOgXOApY34xjVOW513A">Sensor Tower</a>.</p>
<p>In the quarter, Chinese titles contributed as much as 20% of the mobile gaming revenues in the U.S. That effectively made China the largest importer of mobile games in the U.S., thanks to a few blockbuster titles. Chinese publishers claimed 21 spots among the 100 top-grossing games in the period and collectively generated $780 million in revenues in the U.S., the world&#8217;s largest mobile gaming market, more than triple the amount from two years before.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Occupying the top rank are familiar Chinese titles such as the first-person shooter game Call of Duty, a collaboration between Tencent and Activision, as well Tencent&#8217;s PlayerUnknown&#8217;s Battlegrounds. But smaller Chinese studios are also quickly infiltrating the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Mihoyo, a little-known studio outside China, has been turning heads in the domestic gaming industry with its hit game Genshin Impact, a role-playing action game featuring anime-style characters. It was the sixth-most highest-grossing mobile game in the U.S. during Q4, racking up over <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">$100 million in revenues in the period.</span></p>
<p>Most notable is that Mihoyo has been an independent studio since its inception in 2011. Unlike many gaming startups that covet fundings from industry titans like Tencent, Mihoyo has so far raised only a modest amount from its early days. It also stirred up controversy for skipping major distributors like Tencent and phone vendors Huawei and Xiaomi, releasing Genshin Impact on Bilibili, a popular video site amongst Chinese youngsters, and games downloading platform Taptap.</p>
<p>Magic Tavern, the developer behind the puzzle game Project Makeover, one of the most installed mobile games in the U.S. since late last year, is another lesser-known studio. Founded by a team of Tsinghua graduates with offices around the world, Magic Tavern is celebrated as one of the first studios with roots in China to have gained ground in the American casual gaming market. KKR-backed gaming company AppLovin is a <a href="http://www.gamelook.com.cn/2020/11/405281">strategic investor</a> in Magic Tavern.</p>
<p>Other popular games in the U.S. also have links to China, if not directly owned by a Chinese company. Shortcut Run and Roof Nails are works from the French casual game maker Voodoo, which received a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/tencent-takes-minority-stake-in-french-casual-games-maker-voodoo/">minority investment</a> from Tencent last year. Tencent is also a strategic investor in Roblox, the gaming platform oriented to young gamers and slated for an IPO in the coming weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/">BigCommerce</a> has partnered with Walmart to allow its customers to sell on the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer&#8217;s ecommerce marketplace, it announced this morning. Shares of Austin-based BigCommerce rose sharply in pre-market trading after the news, gaining around 10% before the bell.</p>
<p>Walmart, best-known for in-person shopping, has proven an ecommerce success story in recent years. For example, in its <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/056532643/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/Q4FY21-Earnings-Release_Final.pdf">most recent quarter</a> while Walmart as a whole grew 7.3%, its ecommerce sales advanced 69%.</p>
<p>BigCommerce has also reported strong growth in recent quarters, supported in part by partnerships similar to the one that it announced today. The ecommerce SaaS provider rolled out an integration with Wish last year, for example.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a call concerning its earnings, which were announced before the Walmart news was announced, BigCommerce CEO Brent Bellm told TechCrunch that his company had been impressed with customer uptake of the Wish integration. Regarding the Walmart partnership, in a second interview Bellm told TechCrunch that it was overdue on the BigCommerce side; given the historical success of the Wish deal, it will be curious to dig into how many of the ecommerce platform&#8217;s customers opt to sell on Walmart, and how quickly they do so.</p>
<p>TechCrunch also spoke with Walmart exec Jeff Clementz about the arrangement. He stressed Walmart&#8217;s online customer monthly-actives &#8212; 120 million, per his company &#8212; and the breadth of their demand; BigCommerce customers selling on Walmart could expand its product diversity, helping the traditionally physical retailer possible continue its rapid growth.</p>
<p>The two companies are incentivizing adoption of the deal amongst BigCommerce customers by waiving certain fees for a month for retailers that sign up to sell on Walmart; Clementz described it as the first time that his company had offered a &#8220;new-seller discount.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch has had its eye on BigCommerce for some quarters now, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/bigcommerce-files-to-go-public/">thanks in part to its 2020 IPO</a>. But the company is also interesting as its regular earnings results provide a lens into the world of ecommerce growth amongst independent digital retailers. Shopify, a chief BigCommerce rival, provides a similar view into the ecommerce world.</p>
<p>Shopify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace/">previously integrated with Walmart in the middle of 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, it will be interesting to see if the Walmart partnership helps BigCommerce continue its improving revenue growth. The company is in a marketshare race with Shopify. But while BigCommerce&#8217;s rival has posted impressive growth from its integrated solutions, like its payments service, the Austin-based company stresses what it calls a more open model. Shopify <a href="https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Discussion/Shopify-Plans-No-more-transaction-fees/td-p/122233#:~:text=If%20you%20use%20Shopify%20Payments%2C%20your%20transaction%20fees%20on%20Shopify,or%200%25%20(Unlimited).">charges many customers</a> a percentage of their transaction volume for using a third-party payment solution over its own, for example, which Bellm described as a &#8220;tax&#8221; during an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;Merchant Solutions&#8221; revenue at Shopify, which it generates &#8220;<a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/550512644/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/c3898d01-52b6-4d9b-87dc-21744e8ba90d.pdf">principally</a>&#8221; from &#8220;payment processing fees from Shopify Payments,&#8221; <a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/550512644/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Press-Release-Q4-2020.pdf">grew 116% in 2020</a> to a little over $2 billion.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So with BigCommerce collecting a partnership with Walmart to match Shopify&#8217;s own, we&#8217;re seeing not merely two ecommerce platforms go toe-to-toe on providing their customers with as much market access as they can, but two different business philosophies compete. Akin to Microsoft Teams and Slack, it&#8217;s a competition to spectate.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The concept of the &#8220;marketing cloud&#8221; &#8212; sold by the likes of Salesforce, Oracle and Adobe &#8212; has become a standard way for large tech companies to package together and sell marketing tools to businesses that want to improve how they use digital channels to grow their business.</p>
<p>Some argue, however, that &#8220;cloud&#8221;, singular, might be a misnomer: typically those tools are not integrated well with each other and effectively are run as separate pieces of software. Today a startup called Blueshift &#8212; which claims to offer an end-to-end marketing stack, by having built it from the ground up to include both traditional marketing data as well as customer experience &#8212; is announcing some funding, pointing to the opportunity to build more efficient alternatives.</p>
<p>The startup has closed a round of $30 million, a Series C that co-founder and CEO Vijay Chittoor said it will be using to expand to more markets (it&#8217;s most active in the U.S. and Europe currently) and also to expand its technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The product already has a unified format, to ingest data from multiple sources and redistribute that out to apps. Now, we want to distribute that data to more last-mile applications,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;Our biggest initiative is to scale out the notion of us being not just an app but a platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s customers include LendingTree, Discovery Inc., Udacity, BBC and Groupon, and it has seen revenue growth of 858% in the last three years, although it&#8217;s not disclosing actual revenues, nor valuation, today.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Fort Ross Ventures, with strong participation also from Avatar Growth Capital. Past investors Softbank Ventures Asia (which led its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/blueshift-announces-15m-series-b-to-expand-ai-fueled-cross-channel-marketing-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last round of $15 million</a>), Storm Ventures, Conductive Ventures and Nexus Venture Partners also invested.</p>
<p>The concept for Blueshift came out of Chittoor&#8217;s direct experience at Groupon &#8212; which acquired his previous startup, social e-commerce company Mertado &#8212; and before that a long period at Walmart Labs &#8212; which Walmart rebranded after it acquired another startup where Chittoor was an early employee, semantic search company Kosmix.</p>
<p>&#8220;The challenges we are solving today we saw first hand as challenges our customers saw at Groupon and Walmart,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The connected customer journey is creating a thousand times more data than before, and people and brands are engaging across more touchpoints. Tracking that has become harder with legacy channel-centric applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blueshift&#8217;s approach for solving that has been, he said, &#8220;to unify the data and to make decisions at customer level.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is to say, although the customer experience today is very fragmented &#8212; you might potentially encounter something about a company or brand in multiple places, such as in a physical environment, on various social media platforms, in your email, through a web search, in a vertical search portal, in a marketplace on a site, in an app, and so on &#8212; the experience for marketers should not be.</p>
<p>The company addresses this by way of a customer data platform (CDP) it markets as &#8220;SmartHub.&#8221; Designed for non-technical users although customizable by engineers if you need it to be, users can integrate different data feeds from multiple sources, which then Blueshift crunches and organises to let you view in a more structured way.</p>
<p>That data can then be used to power actions in a number of places where you might be setting up marketing campaigns. And Chittoor pointed out &#8212; like other marketing people have &#8212; that these days, the focus on that is largely first-party data to fuel that machine, rather than buying in data from third-party sources (which is definitely part of a bigger trend).</p>
<p>“Our mission is to back category-leading companies that are poised to dominate a market. Blueshift clearly stood out to us as the leader in the enterprise CDP space,” said Ratan Singh of Fort Ross Ventures in a statement. “We are thrilled to partner with the Blueshift team as they accelerate the adoption of their SmartHub CDP platform.” Singh is joining Blueshift&#8217;s board with this round.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Mozilla has further beefed up anti-tracking measures in its Firefox browser. In a blog post yesterday it announced that Firefox 86 has an extra layer of anti-cookie tracking built into the enhanced tracking protection (ETP) strict mode &#8212; which it&#8217;s calling &#8216;Total Cookie Protection&#8217;. This &#8220;major privacy advance&#8221;, as it bills it, prevents cross-site tracking [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mozilla has further beefed up anti-tracking measures in its Firefox browser. In a <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/02/23/total-cookie-protection/">blog post</a> yesterday it announced that Firefox 86 has an extra layer of anti-cookie tracking built into the enhanced tracking protection (ETP) strict mode &#8212; which it&#8217;s calling &#8216;Total Cookie Protection&#8217;.</p>
<p>This &#8220;major privacy advance&#8221;, as it bills it, prevents cross-site tracking by siloing third party cookies per website.</p>
<p>Mozilla likens this to having a separate cookie jar for each site &#8212; so, for e.g., Facebook cookies aren&#8217;t stored in the same tub as cookies for that sneaker website where you bought your latest kicks and so on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new layer of privacy wrapping &#8220;provides comprehensive partitioning of cookies and other site data between websites in Firefox&#8221;, explains Mozilla.</p>
<p>Along with another anti-tracking feature it <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/01/26/supercookie-protections/">announced</a> last month &#8212; targeting so called &#8216;supercookies&#8217; &#8212; aka sneaky trackers that store user IDs in &#8220;increasingly obscure&#8221; parts of the browser (like <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1446862">Flash storage</a>, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1898390">ETags</a>, and <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8146/protecting-against-hsts-abuse/">HSTS</a> flags), i.e. where it&#8217;s difficult for users to delete or block them &#8212; the features combine to &#8220;prevent websites from being able to &#8216;tag&#8217; your browser, thereby eliminating the most pervasive cross-site tracking technique&#8221;, per Mozilla.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a &#8220;limited exception&#8221; for cross-site cookies when they are needed for non-tracking purposes &#8212; Mozilla gives the example of popular third-party login providers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only when Total Cookie Protection detects that you intend to use a provider, will it give that provider permission to use a cross-site cookie specifically for the site you’re currently visiting. Such momentary exceptions allow for strong privacy protection without affecting your browsing experience,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>Tracker blocking has long been an arms race against the adtech industry&#8217;s determination to keep surveilling web users &#8212; and thumbing its nose at the notion of consent to spy on people&#8217;s online business &#8212; pouring resource into devising fiendish new techniques to try to keep watching what Internet users are doing. But this battle has stepped up in recent years as browser makers have been taking a tougher pro-privacy/anti-tracker stance.</p>
<p>Mozilla, for example, started making tracker blocking the default <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/30/firefox-will-soon-start-blocking-trackers-by-default/">back in 2018</a> &#8212; going on make ETP the default in Firefox in 2019, blocking cookies from companies identified as trackers by its partner, Disconnect.</p>
<p>While Apple&#8217;s Safari browser added an &#8216;Intelligent Tracking Prevention&#8217; (ITP) feature in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-adds-a-tracker-blocker-to-desktop-safari/">2017</a> &#8212; applying machine learning to identify trackers and segregate the cross-site scripting data to protect users&#8217; browsing history from third party eyes.</p>
<p>Google has also put the cat among the adtech pigeons by announcing a planned phasing out of support for third party cookies in Chrome &#8212; which it said would be coming within two years back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">January 2020</a> &#8212; although it&#8217;s still working on this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">&#8216;privacy sandbox&#8217;</a> project, as it calls it (now under the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">watchful eye of UK antitrust regulators</a>).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TndBHObz1C"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">Google proposes new privacy and anti-fingerprinting controls for the web</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google proposes new privacy and anti-fingerprinting controls for the web&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/embed/#?secret=TndBHObz1C" data-secret="TndBHObz1C" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Google has been making privacy strengthening noises since 2019, in response to the rest of the browser market responding to concern about online privacy.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/google-rolls-back-samesite-cookie-changes-to-keep-essential-online-services-from-breaking/">In April last year</a> it rolled back a change that had made it harder for sites to access third-party cookies, citing concerns that sites were able to perform essential functions during the pandemic &#8212; though this was resumed in July. But it&#8217;s fair to say that the adtech giant remains the laggard when it comes to executing on its claimed<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/googles-chrome-will-soon-get-new-privacy-features-with-better-cookie-controls-and-anti-fingerprinting-tech/"> plan to beef up privacy</a>.</p>
<p>Given Chrome&#8217;s marketshare, that leaves most of the world&#8217;s web users exposed to more tracking than they otherwise would be by using a different, more privacy-pro-active browser.</p>
<p>And as Mozilla&#8217;s latest anti-cookie tracking feature shows the race to outwit adtech&#8217;s allergy to privacy (and consent) also isn&#8217;t the sort that has a finish line. So being slow to do privacy protection arguably isn&#8217;t very different to not offering much privacy protection at all.</p>
<p>To wit: One worrying development &#8212; on the non-cookie based tracking front &#8212; is detailed in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09301">new paper</a> by a group of privacy researchers who conducted an analysis of CNAME tracking (aka a DNS-based anti-tracking evasion technique) and found that use of the sneaky anti-tracking evasion method had grown by around a fifth in just under two years.</p>
<p>The technique has been raising mainstream concerns about &#8216;unblockable&#8217; web tracking since around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/invasive-scheme-spotted-that-foxes-tracker-blockers/">2019</a> &#8212; when developers spotted the technique being used in the wild by a French newspaper website.

<p>In a nutshell the CNAME tracking technique cloaks the tracker by injecting it into the first-party context of the visited website &#8212; via the content being embedded through a subdomain of the site which is actually an alias for the tracker domain.</p>
<p>&#8220;This scheme works thanks to a DNS delegation. Most often it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record">DNS CNAME record</a>,&#8221; writes one of the paper authors, privacy and security researcher Lukasz Olejnik, in a <a href="https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/large-scale-analysis-of-dns-based-tracking-evasion-broad-data-leaks-included/">blog post</a> about the research. &#8220;The tracker technically is hosted in a subdomain of the visited website.</p>
<p>&#8220;Employment of such a scheme has certain consequences. It kind of fools the fundamental web security and privacy protections &#8212; to think that the user is wilfully browsing the tracker website. When a web browser sees such a scheme, some security and privacy protections are relaxed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be fooled by the use of the word &#8216;relaxed&#8217; &#8212; as Olejnik goes on to emphasize that the CNAME tracking technique has &#8220;substantial implications for web security and privacy&#8221;. Such as browsers being tricked into treating a tracker as legitimate first-party content of the visited website (which, in turn, unlocks &#8220;many benefits&#8221;, such as access to first-party cookies &#8212; which can then be sent on to remote, third-party servers controlled by the trackers so the surveilling entity can have its wicked way with the personal data).</p>
<p>So the risk is that a chunk of the clever engineering work being done to protect privacy by blocking trackers can be sidelined by getting under the anti-trackers&#8217; radar.</p>
<p>The researchers found one (infamous) tracker provider, Criteo, reverting its tracking scripts to the custom CNAME cloak scheme when it detected the Safari web browser in use &#8212; as, presumably, a way to circumvent Apple&#8217;s ITP.</p>
<p>There are further concerns over CNAME tracking too: The paper details how, as a consequence of current web architecture, the scheme &#8220;unlocks a way for broad cookie leaks&#8221;, as Olejnik puts it &#8212; explaining how the upshot of the technique being deployed can be &#8220;many unrelated, legitimate cookies&#8221; being sent to the tracker subdomain.</p>
<p>Olejnik documented this concern in a study back in 2014 &#8212; but he writes that the problem has now exploded: &#8220;As the tip of the iceberg, we found broad data leaks on 7,377 websites. Some data leaks happen on almost every website using the CNAME scheme (analytics cookies commonly leak). This suggests that this scheme is actively dangerous. It is harmful to web security and privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers found cookies leaking on 95% of the studies websites.</p>
<p>They also report finding leaks of cookies set by other third-party scripts, suggesting leaked cookies would in those instances allow the CNAME tracker to track users across websites.</p>
<p>In some instances they found that leaked information contained private or sensitive information &#8212; such as a user&#8217;s full name, location, email address and (in an additional security concern) authentication cookie.</p>
<p>The paper goes on to raise a number of web security concerns, such as when CNAME trackers are served over HTTP not HTTPS, which they found happened often, and could facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
<p>Defending against the CNAME cloaking scheme will require some major browsers to adopt new tricks, per the researchers &#8212; who note that while Firefox (global marketshare circa 4%) does offer a defence against the technique Chrome does not.</p>
<p>Engineers on the WebKit engine that underpins Apple&#8217;s Safari browser have also been working on making enhancements to ITP aimed at counteracting CNAME tracking.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/11338/cname-cloaking-and-bounce-tracking-defense/">blog post</a> last November, IPT engineer John Wilander wrote that as defence against the sneaky technique &#8220;ITP now detects third-party CNAME cloaking requests and caps the expiry of any cookies set in the HTTP response to 7 days. This cap is aligned with ITP’s expiry cap on all cookies created through JavaScript.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Brave browser also <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates-6/">announced</a> changes last fall aimed at combating CNAME cloaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;In version 1.25.0, uBlock Origin gained the ability to detect and block CNAME-cloaked requests using Mozilla’s terrific <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases/tag/1.25.0">browser.dns API</a>. However, this solution only works in Firefox, as Chromium does not provide the browser.dns API. To some extent, these requests can be blocked using custom DNS servers. However, no browsers have shipped with CNAME-based adblocking protection capabilities available and on by default,&#8221; it wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Brave 1.17, Brave Shields will now recursively check the canonical name records for any network request that isn’t otherwise blocked using an embedded DNS resolver. If the request has a CNAME record, and the same request under the canonical domain would be blocked, then the request is blocked. This solution is on by default, bringing enhanced privacy protections to millions of users.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the browser with the largest marketshare, Chrome, has work to do, per the researchers, who write:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because Chrome does not support a DNS resolution API for extensions, the [uBlock version 1.25 under Firefox] defense could not be applied to this browser. Consequently, we find that four of the CNAME-based trackers (Oracle Eloqua, Eulerian, Criteo, and Keyade) are blocked by uBlock Origin on Firefox but not on the Chrome version.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every new smart home device invites new questions. Questions of privacy, security and what we’re willing to give up for the sake of convenience. It’s not an anti-technology stance to welcome these conversations and assess new products as we invite them into our homes.</p>
<p>For my part, my apartment is fairly limited when it comes to smart home tech. I own two large smart speakers and a third smaller one, mostly for the convenience of networking streaming music across different rooms. My smoke detector is connected, for the peace of mind that comes with knowing that my home wasn’t on fire back when I used to leave it for extended stretches. Oh, and a couple of connected lightbulbs, mostly because why not?</p>
<p>Back when Google announced its first-party smart screen, the Home (now Nest) Hub, I thought it was a savvy decision to leave the camera off. Of course, the company included one on its larger Max device, so the option is there, if you want it. Of course, for most of these products, video cameras are a given &#8212; and understandably so, with smart screens like the new Echo Show 10 edging into the teleconferencing space as the line between work and home has become far more fuzzy for many.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2116810" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116810" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2116810" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116810" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Amazon’s gotten the message here, with the addition of a large physical shutter button on the top of the device. When slid to the right, the camera on the top right is covered by a white lens cap, contrasted against the black bezel, so it’s easy to spot across the room. Doing so will pop up a notification: “Camera off. Disabling motion.”</p>
<p>The “motion” here refers to the rotating screen &#8212; the headline feature of Amazon’s latest take on the Echo Show format. The company is positioning the new tech as a game changer for the category, and while I will say it’s done a good job implementing the feature in a way that works well and quietly, it’s precisely this new addition that reignites the privacy question.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116805" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116805" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2116805" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116805" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The notion of creating a home device that fades into its surroundings is really out the window with that feature. The Echo uses figure tracking to make sure the display is facing you at all times when using it, drawing attention to itself in the process. One can inherently know and passively understand that a device is using imaging and AI for tracking, but largely effectively ignore it. After all, we’ve got cameras on pretty much everything now. These things are a part of the social media and services we regularly use. When the device physically follows you around the room, however, this stuff is top of mind.</p>
<p>Having used the product for several days, I would say the feature feels unnecessary in most cases &#8212; and downright unnerving in some. I’ve placed the Show on my desk next to the computer where I’m typing this, and I’ve mostly disabled the feature. It’s probably something I could get used to over time, but with the relatively limited amount I’m going to spend with it, I prefer to use the product in a stationary manner, manually swiveling the display and flipping the screen angle up and down as needed. I adjust screens all of the time. It&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>Amazon will walk you through the feature during setup, including which direction you want the screen facing as a default and how much rotation it offers on either side. Keep in mind, the system really has no notion of what constitutes “straight ahead, until you adjust the setting sliders accordingly. You can adjust these later in settings, as well. There’s also a “Motion Preferences” option. Here you can limit the applications it will use to follow you, require voice to use the feature or disable it entirely.</p>

<p>Of course, I’m also someone who prefers to keep the camera shutter on while not in use, so that works out just fine. You can&#8217;t shutter the camera and have the device continue to move, since it needs to know what it&#8217;s seeing to move along with it. I will say that the moving screen has the unexpectedly nice side effect of reminding me when I’ve forgotten to disable the camera.</p>
<p>Amazon’s understandably &#8212; and thankfully &#8212; been talking up the privacy aspects since the Echo Show 10 was announced. There are eight mentions of “privacy” on the product page, but here’s the key graf:</p>
<blockquote><p>Built with multiple layers of privacy controls, including a mic/camera off button and a built-in shutter to cover the camera. Easily turn on/off motion at any time by voice, on-device, or in the Alexa app. The processing that powers screen motion happens on device &#8211; no images or videos are sent to the cloud to provide the motion feature.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2116806" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116806" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2116806" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8788.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8788.jpeg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8788.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8788.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8788.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8788.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8788.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8788.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8788.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116806" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Notably, the tracking feature uses a vague outline of a person, rather than any sort of facial tracking. The image it processes looks more like a blotchy heat map than anything recognizable as an individual or even, generally, a human (though it&#8217;s able to distinguish human figures from pets). That, in particular, has been a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/amazon-rekognition-moratorium/"> hot button topic</a> for the company.</p>
<p>The rotating feature is primarily a way to reduce user friction. Amazon notes that existing Echo Show owners will swivel their devices around when they’re, say, using it in the kitchen to cook. The front-firing audio also moves as the screen does. That’s in keeping with the company’s move away from 360-degree audio in recent Echo models. This is either a plus or a minus, depending on how you use the device, and how many people are around. It can also be used to follow you as you move around while video calling (a feature the competition has offered through zooming and cropping).</p>
<p>Amazon’s taken pains in recent generations to improve the audio on these device, prioritizing the “speaker” part of smart speaker, and the new Show certainly benefits from that. I wouldn’t use it as my primary sound system, but sitting here on my desk, it delivers a nice, full sound for its size, even with the screen obscuring a big portion of the front.</p>
<p>The 10.1-inch screen is a nice size, as well. Again, I wouldn’t use it to replace a TV or even a good laptop, but it’s good size for quick videos. It’s a shame Amazon and Google haven’t been able to play nice here, because YouTube has the market cornered on short-form videos that are perfect for this form factor. (If you’re so inclined, you can still access YouTube via the built-in browser, though it’s not exactly an elegant solution.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116809" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116809" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2116809" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116809" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Amazon Prime Video certainly has its share of good long-form content and series (it has a ton of trash, as well, but sometimes that’s fun, too), but Amazon’s best play is partnering with third-parties to bolster its offerings. And that’s another spot where Amazon has been improving the Echo experience. Netflix and Hulu are now available on the device for video, and Apple Music and Spotify have been added on the music side.</p>
<p>There are still a number of third-party apps that would be nice additions, but that’s a pretty solid starting point. Not to mention that services like Spotify can be set as the default for music playback. That’s one of those additions that genuinely reduces friction (and honestly, Amazon Music is a far less compelling service than Prime Video at the moment).</p>
<p>Zoom &#8212; arguably the most compelling addition from a software standpoint &#8212; is coming later. For now, calls are limited to other Alexa devices. Zoom and other third-party teleconference software has the opportunity to create an entire new dimension for these products, especially with the aforementioned blurring of home and work life.</p>
<p>Honestly, where the Show is currently sitting on my desk is really the perfect placement to use it for calls while working on my computer. I’m cautiously optimistic about the implementation. At the very least, it would give me a compelling reason to get more use out of that 13-megapixel camera on a regular basis.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116803" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116803" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2116803" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116803" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>For the time being, I think the most compelling case to be made for both the camera and automatic screen swiveling is as a makeshift security camera. This is another “Coming Soon” feature that requires a Guard Plus subscription. With it, you can set a geofence, with the Show doubling as a smart security camera when you leave home. The system will send an alert if a person is detected in your home while you’re out.</p>
<p>This month has seen rumors that Amazon is working on a wall-mounted smart home hub. The form factor certainly makes sense, essentially serving as an Alexa-enabled touchscreen control for your various connected devices. For the time being, between Show and the Alexa mobile app, I think the bases are covered pretty well &#8212; though such a device could certainly lend a more premium experience to the space.</p>
<p>A well-placed Show will address that need for many. Certainly it does the job for my one-bedroom apartment. You can use voice or touch to control lighting, and the screen can monitor feeds from security cameras, including, naturally, Amazon-owned Ring. Additions like these have really made the smart screen category a much more compelling and capable one.</p>
<p>At $249, it’s $20 pricier than the 2018 Show. It’s hard to say how much of the increase is due to the new mechanical turning mechanism, but Amazon offered up a cheaper model without the functionality that’s almost certainly the one I would go for, for reasons outlined above. Again, not everyone will have the same misgivings.</p>
<p>And all told, it’s a well-constructed, nice addition to the Show family and one I don’t mind moving around the old-fashioned way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s almost too simple. You get a tablet made of household chemicals that can be dissolved in water which can become a cleaning spray for the kitchen, glass and bathroom, with no need to ship the water it is dissolved into because it literally comes out of your tap. That was the premise of Munich-based startup <a href="https://www.everdrop.de/">everdrop</a> and it’s been a hit not just with consumers, but also with investors. It’s now raised an €18m ($21.8m) Series A funding round led by Felix Capital, with participation from HV Capital and Vorwerk Ventures. Everdrop now plans to develop a wider range of sustainable household products and market them across Europe, and eventually the US.</p>
<p>Launched in Dec 2019, the cleaning tablet also removes the need for single-use plastic bottles, thus appealing to environmentally conscious consumers, (unusually for a consumer good company, the startup has 110,000 <a href="http://www.instagram.com/everdrop">followers</a> on Instagram).</p>
<p>Everdrop estimates it was able to eliminate over 2.5 million single-use plastic bottles with their tabs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>David Löwe, Co-Founder of everdrop told me in an interview that while it might be possible to clone the company’s formats, it would not be easy to replicate its water hardness calculator: “Plus, the individualizing of the laundry detergent is quite unique. I think there&#8217;s no one out there in other countries who are doing that at the moment… But obviously, other companies could potentially do that too.”</p>
<p>Everdrop competes with <a href="https://www.grove.co/home">Grove Collaborative</a>, <a href="https://www.blueland.com/">Blueland</a> and to some extent The Honest Company.</p>
<p>Löwe told me: “If I&#8217;m very honest, it would be cool if the other companies would do it because this is something that I&#8217;m really convinced about. If we inspire with our success, the big corporations could finally change into more sustainable products.”</p>
<p>As well as the tablet, everdrop now has a range of sustainable laundry detergents, also microplastic-free, which addresses water hardness by tailoring the detergent to the water in the customer&#8217;s home area. This means everdrop can save up to 50% of the unnecessary surfactants in the detergent. Laundry detergent is the biggest chemical emitter in private households. Everdrop estimates its approach saves 250 tons of unnecessary surfactants from going into the environment.</p>
<p>Its latest product is a “naked” dishwasher tablet which doesn’t have the plastic wrapper that usually envelops these products.</p>
<p>David Fischer, investor at HV Capital said: “It is incredible how a truly sustainable brand such as everdrop has a similar growth trajectory in its inception year as its D2C peers Hims and DollarShaveClub.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Knowledge workers &#8212; those whose professions tend to be anchored to desks or computers &#8212; have long been the most obvious and primary focus for a lot of B2B apps and services. But as the wider world migrates to doing more and more on smartphones and other connected devices, the opportunity to build for the rest of the global workforce continues to grow. Today, one of the startups targeting smaller businesses in the area of field service is announcing a round of funding that underscores that trend.</p>
<p><a href="http://workiz.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workiz</a>, which has developed a platform to help small business in the home services space &#8212; locksmiths, removals companies, large appliance repairs, and others &#8212; book jobs, manage teams, keep in communication with customers, bill them, and also &#8212; taking a page from the world of knowledge workers &#8212; run data analytics connected to their jobs to optimize business more in the future, has closed a funding round of $13 million.</p>
<p class="p1">The funding round was oversubscribed &#8212; it actually grew to $13 million in the week between getting pitched this story and writing it &#8212; and it comes on the back of a year that has seen double-digit growth exceeding what the startup had expected to achieve in 2020, said CEO Adi (Didi) Azaria in an interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">Part of the reason has been an uplift from people spending more time working at home, putting their dwellings and the things contained in them through more wear and tear, and/or realizing that they could do some home improvement and vastly upgrade their daily environments.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;If you open the fridge too many times, things get broken and you need these guys to come in,&#8221; he said, adding that the demand from customers these days are for people to be using the same tools they are to get work done. &#8220;Many field services need software because our expectations as consumers are changing. They see it as a need.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Workiz&#8217;s CEO himself was once a locksmith, similar to co-founders Idan Kadosh and Erez Marom (who co-founded the startup with Saar Kohanovitch), but he might be better known for co-founding his previous startup, Sisense, the business analytics company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/09/sisense-nabs-another-100m-at-a-1b-valuation-for-its-big-data-business-analytics-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now valued at over $1 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Workiz is based out of San Diego and Israel, with the latter home to its R&amp;D efforts and a number of its investors. This Series B is being led by Tel Aviv&#8217;s New Era Capital Partners, with past backers Aleph, Magenta Venture Partners (which led its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/field-management-software-startup-workiz-raises-5-million-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series A</a>), Maor Investments, and TMT Investments also participating in the round.</p>
<p>Valuation is not being disclosed but there are some signs that it&#8217;s on the up for the startup. Workiz&#8217;s services &#8212; the startup&#8217;s name incidentally is pronounced not like a cute version of work, &#8220;workies&#8221;, but like &#8220;work is&#8221; as the company&#8217;s official name is actually Workiz Easy &#8212; are live in the U.S. and Canada, and it currently has some 100,000 service professionals using the platform.</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">Since the startup was founded in 2015 (originally as Send a Job), m</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ore than 12 million jobs, 100 million text messages, and $5 billion in job revenue have been initiated through it. </span></p>
<p>For a point of comparison, a direct competitor, Jobber, earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/jobber-raises-60m-as-its-platform-for-home-service-professionals-hits-100k-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed a $60 million round</a> also after hitting 100,000 service professionals on its platform.</p>
<p>Despite that competition &#8212; and it&#8217;s a crowded field, with others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/servicetitan-raises-165m-for-its-home-services-software-now-valued-at-1-65b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ServiceTitan</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/14/ge-digital-snags-servicemax-for-915-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GE&#8217;s ServiceMax</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/bigchange-raises-102m-for-a-platform-to-help-manage-service-fleets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BigChange</a> in the U.K., new approaches like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/super-raises-20m-to-fix-the-home-services-and-repairs-market-with-its-subscription-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super</a>, and many others in the market &#8212; field service remains a big market, with some 20 million businesses globally focused on home services, with 5 million in the U.S. alone.</p>
<p>The opportunity for a startup like Workiz within that is to figure out what needs are currently not being addressed as well by existing offerings, and building them into its own solution.</p>
<p>One example of that, Azaria points out, has been the company&#8217;s voice service. He notes that most field service professionals before the rise of mobile apps had organized and updated customers and head offices of their whereabouts and progress through phone calls.</p>
<p>In some cases that is not hugely efficient, since it only alerts the person you are calling, not a whole team, and sometimes the person you are speaking with is not the person who needs the update most. But, it also remains a key way to connect with customers especially when there are delays. The phone service that the company offers integrates with other details about a job, letting the call become part of the bigger work log for everyone else to see.</p>
<p>Another is scheduling, which has been a complicated issue to manage especially in cases when you have small teams of users who need to work in close conjunction with each other. Workiz&#8217;s scheduling tools essentially work like a shared Google Calendar to help match people with skills, locations and jobs to get work booked and done faster.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s toolkit, interestingly, has features that highlight business analytics too: you can currently manage call tracking, lead tracking and a live dashboard to measure how long jobs are taking and whether scheduling is mapping accurately or not. These are next-level tools that do remind me a little of Sisense and point precisely to how software and goals envisioned for the average data/knowledge worker are now being recast for those on their feet and in the field.</p>
<p>This also leaves the door open for the option to build in more lead generation into the platform, essentially creating a marketplace for field service professionals to connect with customers seeking people to do specific jobs, although it&#8217;s not an area the company is exploring for now at least.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point we focus on SaaS and making a best-of-breed solution. We&#8217;re not in the lead generation market. We try to focus because we understand how challenging it is to be a field service engineer, with phone calls, stress and disorganization,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Most of them still use pen and paper and need tools to organizse the day. Many of them can advertise or use third party companies for lead generation, although maybe in the future we might do more on that.&#8221; For now, he said, the focus will remain on tools to address their more immediate needs just to get through their workdays and helping them be more professional, to &#8220;make the service person look larger than what they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Field service management is a market ripe for disruption, with a technological approach that is both agile and competitive,&#8221; said Gideon Argov, managing at New Era Capital Partners, in a statement. &#8220;In Workiz, we found all the elements for success, coupled with passionate leadership that started from the field. We are delighted to join the Workiz team.&#8221; Argov is joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Joby Aviation, a startup that has spent a more than a decade developing an all-electric, vertical take-off and landing passenger aircraft, will become a public company through a merger with Reinvent Technology Partners, a special purpose acquisition company from well-known investor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.</p>
<p>The combined company, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, will have a pro forma implied valuation of $6.6 billion. Through the deal, Joby is capturing $1.6 billion in cash proceeds — $690 million of which will come from Reinvent&#8217;s cash in trust and an $835 million from private investors The Baupost Group, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Fidelity Management &amp; Research LLC and Baillie Gifford. A $75 million convertible note, from Uber, will also be converted into common stock at a $10 per share value.</p>
<p>While blank-check mergers typically put in place terms to prevent investors from pulling out their money, this one places a lock up on all major shareholders, including on the SPAC side, to ensure significant long-term alignment. The deal also includes an earnout structure with full vesting that cannot be realized until the share price reaches $50 per share, which implies more than a $30 billion market capitalization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Joby plans to use the capital to fund the launch of passenger service, which is expected to begin in 2024. The company still must complete certification of its aircraft and develop manufacturing facilities, but it is already on its way to achieving both.</p>

<p>Joby has agreed to a &#8220;G-1&#8221; certification basis for its aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration, which specifies the requirements that need to be met by the company&#8217;s aircraft for it to be certified for commercial operations.</p>
<p>Joby is also planning to begin construction on a 450,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, designed in conjunction with Toyota, later this year.</p>
<p>Prior to its SPAC deal, Joby had gained attention and investors over the years as it developed its eVTOL. Toyota became an important backer and partner, leading a $620 million Series C round of funding in January 2020. Nearly a year later, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/uber-sells-air-taxi-business-elevate-to-joby-aviation-shedding-its-last-moonshot/">Joby acquired Uber&#8217;s air taxi moonshot Elevate</a> as part of a complex deal. Under the terms, Uber offloaded Elevate to Joby Aviation and invested $75 million into the startup. The two companies also expanded an existing partnership.</p>
<p>The $75 million investment was in addition to a previously undisclosed $50 million investment made by Uber as part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/joby-aviation-raises-590-million-led-by-toyota-to-launch-an-electric-air-taxi-service/">Joby’s Series C financing round</a>. Uber has invested a total of $125 million into the startup. Joby Aviation had raised $820 million before its bid to become a publicly traded company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While more businesses are turning to text messages as a marketing channel, <a href="https://emotive.io">Emotive</a> CEO Brain Zatulove argued that most marketers are just treating it as another &#8220;newsletter blast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason the channel performs so well is it&#8217;s not saturated,&#8221; Zatulove said. But that&#8217;s changing, and as it does, companies will have to do more to &#8220;cut through the noise.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what he said Emotive provides, by enabling text marketing that feels like a real conversation with another human being, rather than just another email blast. He compared it to the sales associate who would greet you when you first walked into a department store, pre-COVID.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The online sales associate really didn’t exist,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what we’re trying to provide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emotive saw 466% year-over-year revenue growth in 2020 and is announcing today that it has raised $50 million in a Series B funding round that values the company at $400 million. It was led by CRV with participation from Mucker Capital, TenOneTen Ventures and Stripes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never underestimate the importance of building a product that your customers, and your customers’ customers adore,” said CRV general partner Murat Bicer in a statement. “One of the things that struck us about Emotive is the sheer amount of customer love Brian and Zack get from meal delivery services, manufacturing companies and even toddler shoe brands. Small businesses find it easy to set up campaigns and their customers genuinely prefer communicating with someone over text rather than email.”</p>
<p>Zatulove said he founded the company with Zachary Wise after they&#8217;d worked together on cannabis loyalty startup Reefer, eventually deciding there was a bigger opportunity here after their early successes with text marketing. He explained that while Emotive works with larger customers, its sweet spot is mid-sized e-commerce businesses on Shopify, Magento, Bigcommerce and Woocommerce.</p>
<p>Since those businesses usually don&#8217;t have any salespeople of their own yet, Emotive serves that function. It can start conversations around shopping cart abandonment and promote promote sales and new products, resulting in what the company says are 8% to 10% conversion rates (compared to 1% or 2% for a standard text marketing campaign). Zatuolove said the platform largely relied on human responders at first, and although it&#8217;s become increasingly automated over time, Emotive still has an internal team handling responses when necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;We never plan on losing that human touch as part of the dialogue,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We see ourselves as a human-to-human platform. That&#8217;s our biggest differentiator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emotive had previously raised $8.2 million in funding,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/emotive-6026/company_financials"> according to Crunchbase</a>. Zatulove said this new round will allow the company to continue developing the product, to grow its headcount to more than 200 people and to open offices in Atlanta and Boston. Eventually, it could also expand beyond texting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Longer term, we see ourselves more as a conversation platform, not just as a text message platform,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://recargapay.com.br/en/">RecargaPay</a>, a Brazil-based fintech that allows users to top off their prepaid cell phones online, announced this morning that they’ve closed their $70 million Series C. The company, which operates solely in Brazil, was launched in 2010 by Miami-based serial entrepreneur Rodrigo Teijeiro, who is co-founder and CEO. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike in the U.S. where most people have a cell phone plan through a major carrier, in Brazil &#8212; a country where the minimum wage is currently $1,100 reals per month (roughly $202 USD) &#8212; many people must buy calling cards at local shops to add credit to their phones, which allows them to avoid a monthly recurring bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most people were using prepaid [phones] for control because they didn’t trust the telephone companies &#8212; they didn’t want roaming fees or fees for going over etc.,” said Teijeiro. Many of us can relate to the days when we’d come home from an international trip and have an astronomical phone bill because of roaming fees, but imagine if that were a monthly occurrence?</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014, Teijeiro and his co-founders &#8212; one of whom is his brother, Alvaro, the CTO &#8212; turned the RecargaPay website into an app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Before RecargaPay, if your cell phone ran out of credits and it was 10 p.m. and you needed to make a phone call, you’d have to go out and find a shop that sold the prepaid cards to add the credits to your phone &#8212; it was super inconvenient,” Teijeiro added. Cell phones caught on quickly in Brazil because it has traditionally been difficult to obtain a landline &#8212; an ordeal that often took several months to solidify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RecargaPay originally had operations in various Latin American countries, such as Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Brazil, as well as in Spain and the U.S. But in 2016 the company decided to focus on the Brazilian market, because not only is it the biggest in LatAm, but it also has the highest penetration of credit cards. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will Brazil’s Roaring 20s see the rise of early-stage startups?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/will-brazils-roaring-20s-see-the-rise-of-early-stage-startups/embed/#?secret=zM7qA2jdHA" data-secret="zM7qA2jdHA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The number one mistake investors make when investing in LatAm is that they think that LatAm is one whole market. But especially in fintech, all the regulations are very different. That’s why it’s hard to scale in LatAm,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company makes money by charging a monthly fee of $19.99 reals. When a customer makes an online top-off on the app, they get 4% cash back because the cell phone carriers pay RecargaPay the equivalent amount, which it then passes on to the user.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">EBITDA positive according to Teijeiro</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has raised just over $100 million in capital to date and plans to use the $70 million to “expand its financial services offerings to small businesses and consumers, including further development of its popular subscription program Prime+,” the company said in a statement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Already, RecargaPay offers much more than the ability to top off your cell phone. Other features include the ability to buy gift cards, apply for and receive microloans, refill your public transportation cards and pay bills. Teijeiro explained that RecargaPay and Nubank, LatAm’s largest digital bank, are not direct competitors, but rather operate in the same ecosystem. A lot of Nubank customers who now have a credit card, thanks to the bank’s no-fee cards, can use RecargaPay to top off their cell phones, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a 2020 report by </span><a href="https://tecnoblog.net/380512/pos-pago-ultrapassa-pre-pago-em-linhas-de-celular-no-brasil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechnoBlog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Brazilian media outlet, in 2010 about 83% of cell phones in Brazil were prepaid. Today, that number is smaller, but it’s still a whopping 49%. The change started in 2012 with the advent of smartphones in Brazil and the popularization of WhatsApp. While this may sound insane, previously, Brazilians could only call others who used their same cell phone carrier &#8212; if they called people in other networks they’d incur a hefty fee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o get around this problem, Brazilians bought multiple cell phone chips from different carriers and they would have to top off these chips individually. You’d also have to remember which of your contacts used which carrier &#8212; mind-blowing, I know. So when WhatsApp launched, it eliminated that problem altogether, hence its massive penetration in the Brazilian market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RecargaPay’s Series C was co-led by Miami-based Fuel Ventures and Madrid-based IDC Ventures, with additional participation from LUN Partners, Experian Ventures and ATW Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;RecargaPay is a pioneer in the payments sector as one of the first all-in-one platforms to serve </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">such a wide array of everyday needs of Brazilians,” said Maggie Vo, Fuel Venture Capital m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">anaging general partner and chief investment officer. “We are thrilled to back a company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that is actively improving the lives of so many people by giving them more control over their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">finances, all the while challenging the status quo of banking systems.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Often people think that RecargaPay is for the unbanked, but it’s actually for the unbanked and the banked,&#8221; Teijeiro added. &#8220;What we always had in mind was to build &#8212; in the long-term &#8212; a mobile money ecosystem. Our approach was to solve problems one-by-one, and now we have a vertically integrated payment platform that offers financial services.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bay Area-based AI startup Symbio today announced its “official launch.” Backed by a total of $30 million in funding, the company has struck deals with both Nissan and Toyota to implement its software in U.S.-based factories.</p>
<p>The company says its SymbioDCS technology is capable of dramatically increasing automation with factory robots on the assembly line.</p>
<p>“To the end customer, the proposition is pretty straightforward,” CEO and co-founder Max Reynolds tells TechCrunch. “We’re improving the efficiency of their automation. The high-level goal is to increase the capacity of the factory and enable them to build more product, more quickly, more flexibly. “</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company closed a $15 million Series B in December of last year. That adds to a $12 million Series A in 2018, $2.5 million seed two years prior and a $500,000 pre-seed. This latest round was led by ACME Capital, joining existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Eclipse Ventures and The House Fund.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116975" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116975" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2116975" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Symbio_-098_press.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Symbio_-098_press.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Symbio_-098_press.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Symbio_-098_press.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Symbio_-098_press.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Symbio_-098_press.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Symbio_-098_press.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116975" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Symbio</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of exclusively providing automation solutions, Symbio is also designing the tools that enable the developers and domain experts working in manufacturing to create their own automation solutions and easily adapt them to new tasks,” UC Berkeley professor Anca Dragan said in a statement tied to the news. “To do this, they are building products that leverage AI strengths and human insight in a symbiotic way.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, the company employs around 40, mostly engineers, largely based in California. Reynolds explains that the current level of automated manufacturing in automotive is actually far lower than one might expect. “Assembly is less than 5% automated, across the board,” he says. “Even in this core vertical, there’s a ton of headroom and opportunity for growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India&#8217;s Flipkart said on Wednesday it will deploy more than 25,000 electric vehicles in its supply chain by 2030 as the Walmart-owned e-commerce giant looks to achieve a 100% transition to electric mobility in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-headquartered firm said it has partnered with leading EV makers including Hero Electric, Mahindra Electric, and Piaggio to build vehicles for its first and last mile delivery fleets across the country.</p>
<p>The announcement comes a day after rival Amazon said it had partnered with Mahindra Electric to develop “close to hundred” electric three-wheeler in India. The American e-commerce giant last year pledged to <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.in/operations/10-000-electric-vehicles-in-our-delivery-fleet-by-2025">deploy 10,000 electric vehicles</a> in the country by 2025.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Flipkart said its electric fleet will include two-wheeler, three-wheeler, and four-wheeler vehicles, all of which will be designed and assembled in India. The company said it has already started to deploy two-wheeler and three-wheeler electric vehicles in “multiple locations” in India including Delhi, Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Guwahati.</p>
<p>In recent years, New Delhi has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/india-batteries-incentives/exclusive-india-plans-4-6-billion-in-incentives-for-battery-makers-in-electric-vehicle-push-document-idINKCN26G1CP">pushed</a> to replace gasoline and diesel vehicles in India with environmentally friendly electric vehicles. Reuters reported in 2019 that the Indian government was planning to order ride-hailing firms such as Ola and Uber to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/india-electric-vehicles-2026-uber-ola/">convert 40% of their fleets to electric</a> by April 2026.</p>
<p>“Electrification of the logistics fleet is a key part of Flipkart’s larger sustainability goal and in line with our commitment to <a href="https://www.reutersevents.com/sustainability/need-speed-going-all-electric-lead-climate-decade">the Climate Group’s EV100 initiative</a>,” said Amitesh Jha, SVP of Ekart and Marketplace at Flipkart, in a statement.</p>
<p>“In this journey of making our logistics fleet completely electric by 2030, we will collaborate and work with leading local players to procure and deploy electric vehicles while supporting the required infrastructure growth. We understand the relevance of electric mobility in achieving both business and sustainability goals and are committed to paving the way for greater adoption of EVs across the country,” he added.</p>
<p>The company said over the past year it has worked to create a network of ecosystem partners across charging providers, skill development agencies, aggregators, and original equipment manufacturers.</p>
<p>The company, which is expected to publicly list later this year, identified three models that will feature in its electric vehicles fleet: Nyx series by Hero Electric, which offers extended driving range of up to 150 kilometers (93.2 miles) per charge; Treo Zor by Mahindra Electric, which features “highest-in-class payload of 550kg (1212.5 pounds)”; and Ape’ E Xtra FX by Piaggio.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: Facebook brings news sharing back to Australia</strong></p>
<p>Last week, Facebook responded to the Australian government&#8217;s proposed law requiring internet platforms to strike revenue-sharing agreements with news publishers by blocking news sharing and viewing for users in the country.

<p>Among other things, the amendments call for a two-month mediation period before Facebook is forced into arbitration with publishers, and it also says the government will consider commercial agreements that the platforms have made with local publishers before deciding whether the law applies to them.</p>
<p>William Easton, Facebook&#8217;s managing director for Australia and New Zealand, said in a statement that the amendments address &#8220;core concerns about allowing commercial deals that recognize the value our platform provides to publishers relative to the value we receive from them.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spain is preparing to push forward with pro-startup legislation, having recently unveiled a big and bold transformation plan with the headline goal, by 2030, of turning the country into &#8216;Spain Entrepreneurial Nation&#8217;, as the slightly clumsy English translation has it.</p>
<p>Prime minister Pedro Sanchez took a turn on Web Summit&#8217;s stage in December to announce the introduction of the forthcoming Startup Act &#8212; and to trumpet a new role, a high commissioner, tasked with bringing off a nationwide entrepreneurial economic transformation by working with all the relevant government ministries.</p>
<p>The broad-brush goals for the strategy are to increase growth in startup investments; attract and retain talent; promote scalability; and inject innovation into the public sector so it can bolster and support Spain&#8217;s digital development.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The aforementioned Startup Act is the first piece of dedicated legislation for the sector &#8212; and is intended to simplify starting up in Spain, as well as bringing in tax concessions and incentives for foreign investments. So it will be something of a milestone.</p>
<p>Chat to local founders and there&#8217;s a litany of administrative, tax-based and fundraising pain-points they&#8217;ll quickly point to as frustrations. Wider issues seem more cultural; startups not thinking big enough, investors lacking the necessary appetite for risk, and even &#8212; among wider society &#8212; some latent suspicion of entrepreneurs. While Spain-based investors are champing at the bit for administrative reform and better stock options. Moving the needle on all that is the Spanish government&#8217;s self-appointed mission for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke to Francisco Polo, Spain&#8217;s high commissioner overseeing delivery of the entrepreneurial strategy, to get the inside track on the plan to grow the startup ecosystem and find out which bits entrepreneurs are likely to see in action first.</p>
<p>&#8220;The high commissioner for Spain entrepreneurial nation is a new body that&#8217;s within the presidency. So for the first time we have an institution that, from the presidency, is able to help coordinate the different ministries on one single thing: Creating the first national mission. In this case this nation mission has the goal to turn Spain into the entrepreneurial nation with the greatest social impact in history,&#8221; says Polo.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we do is that work of coordination with all the ministries. Basically we have a set of internal objectives. First is what we call impacts &#8212; different sets of measures that is contained in the Spain entrepreneurial nation strategy. We also work trying to get everyone together on this national mission so we work on different alliances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally, we are also very focused on helping let the people know that Spain has made a decision to become &#8212; by 2030 &#8212; this entrepreneurial nation that is going to leave no one behind. So that&#8217;s our job.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Scaling up on the shoulders of giants</h2>
<p>The southern European nation doesn&#8217;t attract the same level of startup investment as some of its near neighbors, including the U.K., France and Germany. But in some ways Spain punches above its regional weight &#8212; with major cities like Barcelona and Madrid routinely ranked as highly attractive locations for founders, owing to relatively low costs and the pull of a Mediterranean lifestyle.</p>
<p>Spanish cities&#8217; urban density, high levels of youth unemployment and a sociable culture that&#8217;s eagerly embraced digital chatter makes an attractive test-bed for consumer-facing app-based businesses &#8212; one that&#8217;s demonstrated disruptive potential over the past decade+, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis which hit the country hard.</p>
<p>Local startups that have gained global attention over this period &#8212; for velocity of growth and level of ambition, at the least &#8212; include the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/badi-gets-30m-for-ai-aided-room-rentals/">Badi</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/22/uber-rival-cabify-has-raised-another-160m-at-a-1-4b-valuation/">Cabify</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/spains-glovo-grabs-166m-series-e-for-its-deliver-anything-app/">Glovo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/jobandtalent-tops-up-with-108m-for-its-workforce-as-a-service-platform/">Jobandtalent</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/03/red-points-closes-38m-series-c-for-its-antivirus-saas-for-brands/">Red Points</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/sherpa-a-spanish-voice-assistant-expands-series-a-to-15m-as-it-passes-5m-users/">Sherpa.ai</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/18/on-a-growth-tear-work-trip-saas-travelperk-adds-60m-to-its-series-c/">TravelPerk</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/typeform-a-platform-for-conversational-data-collection-raises-35m/">Typeform</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/wallapop-and-letgo-two-craigslist-rivals-plan-merger-to-take-on-the-u-s-market/">Wallapop</a>, to name a few.</p>
<p>Spain&#8217;s left-leaning coalition government is now looking to pick up the startup baton in earnest, to drive a broader pro-digital shift in the economy and production base &#8212; but in a way that&#8217;s socially inclusive. The shift will be based on &#8220;an ironclad principle that we leave no one behind&#8221;, said Sanchez in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/web-summit-spanish-pm-pedro-sanchez-announces-new-startup-act-and-high-commissioner-for-entrepreneurship-301185577.html">December</a>.</p>
<p>For this reason the slate of policy measures Sanchez&#8217;s government has distilled as necessary to support and grow the ecosystem &#8212; following a long period of consultation with private and public stakeholders &#8212; pays close attention to social impact. Hence the parallel goal of tackling a variety of gaps (territorial, gender, socio-economic, generational and so on) that might otherwise be exacerbated by a more single-minded rush to accelerate the size of the digital sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are a new generation of young people in government. I think in our generation we don&#8217;t understand creating a new innovation system or a new industrial-economic system if we are not also talking about its social impact,&#8221; says Polo. &#8220;That&#8217;s why at the basis of the model we have also designed inclusion policies. So all this strategy is aimed at closing the gender gap, the territorial gap, the socio-economic gap and the generational gap. So at the end of the day, by 2030, we have created the entrepreneurial nation with the highest social impact in history.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s money on the table too: Spain will be routing a portion of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/5g-ai-cybersecurity-and-renewable-energy-set-for-investment-boost-under-eu-coronavirus-recovery-plan/">&#8220;Next Generation EU&#8221;</a> coronavirus recovery funding it receives from the pan-EU pot into this &#8220;entrepreneurial&#8221; push.</p>
<p>&#8220;Specifically, for 2021, the budget assigned to the different goals of the strategy &#8212; we have more than €1.5 billion for the main measures that we want to start setting up. And for the period 2023 it&#8217;s over €4.5 billion dedicated to the rest of the measures. So basically between 2021 and 2023 we will be setting the basis/foundations of the Spain entrepreneurial nation,&#8221; says Polo.</p>

<p>Execution of the strategy will be down to the relevant ministries of government &#8212; who will be enacting projects and passing legislation, as needed &#8212; but Polo&#8217;s department is there to &#8220;guide and accompany&#8221; the various arms and branches of government on that journey; aka &#8220;to help make things happen&#8221; with a startup hat on.</p>
<p>The national strategy envisages entrepreneurship/startup innovation as the driving force at the top of a pyramid that sits atop existing sectors of the Spanish economy &#8212; &#8220;spearheading the innovative system that we want to generate&#8221;, as Polo puts it. &#8220;We are not only focusing on innovative entrepreneurship. We are also trying to create virtuous cycles between this ecosystem and the actual driving sectors of the Spanish economy &#8212; that&#8217;s why we listed a set of 10 driving sectors that represent above 60% of the GDP. And this is of utmost importance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The listed sectors where the government wants to concentrate and foster support &#8212; so those same sectors can leverage gains through closer working with digital innovation are: Industry; Tourism and culture; Mobility; Health; Construction and materials; Energy and ecological transition; Banking and finance; Digitalization and telecommunications; Agri-food; and Biotechnology.</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided we needed to make the cut at some point and we decided that putting together 60% of the GDP in Spain was a clear direction of the sectors that we could be using in order to accelerate the change that we want to see,&#8221; says Polo. &#8220;Basically what we want to shift with this model is that the innovative entrepreneurship that has been quite enclosed in the past starts working with the different driving sectors that we have in the country because they can help each other solve their different issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;So first, for example, for investment &#8212; what if big companies start investing more and more than they are actually doing? We accelerate also that path &#8212; into innovative entrepreneurship system. That is going to help close that gap&#8230; What if startups and scale-ups in Spain work together with our international companies in order to attract and retain that talent? That is going to put us as a country in a better position.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me the best example is about scaling up: Because what is better than scaling up on the shoulders of giants? We have already a big number of international of world-class companies that are in different markets so what is better than being able to scale up with a company that is already there, that has the knowledge and that can help you mature as a scale-up in a shorter period of time. So there are a lot of virtuous cycles that we can generate and that&#8217;s why we wanted to make also a broad appeal to the different driving sectors. Because we want to let the country know that everyone is called to make this a reality.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Digital divides</h2>
<p>Digital can itself divide, of course, as has been writ large during a global pandemic in which the development of children excluded from attending school in person can hinge on whether or not they have internet access and computer literacy.</p>
<p>So the principle of entrepreneurial growth being predicated upon social inclusion looks like an important one &#8212; even if pulling off major industrial transformations which will necessitate a degree of retraining and upskilling in order to bring workers of all ages along the same path is clearly not going to be easy.</p>
<p>But the 10-year time frame for &#8220;Spain Entrepreneurial Nation&#8221; looks like a recognition that inclusion requires time.</p>
<p>The long-term plan is also intended to address a common criticism of Spain&#8217;s politics being too short-termist, per Polo. &#8220;In Spain particularly it&#8217;s been a regular criticism that politics always look in the small term so this is proof that this government is also addressing the short-term issues but also is preparing Spain for the future,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;We really believe that [presenting a long-term vision is] a good thing and it&#8217;s an answer to that social demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The country has also &#8212; over the last decade or so &#8212; gained a bit of a reputation for successfully challenging digital developments over specific societal impacts in Europe&#8217;s courts. Such as, in 2010, when a Spanish citizen challenged Google&#8217;s refusal to delist outdated information about him from its index &#8212; which led, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/13/forget-me-not/">2014</a>, to Europe&#8217;s top court backing what&#8217;s colloquially referred to as the &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221;.</p>
<p>Uber&#8217;s regulation-dodging was also successfully challenged by Spanish taxi associations &#8212; leading to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/blow-to-uber-in-europe-as-top-court-rules-its-a-transport-service/">2017</a> ruling at the highest level in Europe that Uber is a transport service (and therefore subject to local urban transport rules; not just a technology platform as the ride-hailing giant had sought to claim).</p>
<p>Anti-Uber (and anti-Cabify) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/anti-uber-taxi-strikes-kick-off-again-in-spain/">strikes</a> have, meanwhile, been a quasi-regular (and sometimes violent) feature of Spain&#8217;s streets &#8212; as the taxi industry has protested at a perceived lack of enforcement of the law against app-based rivals who are not competing fairly, as it sees it.</p>
<p>And while gig platforms (even homegrown European ones) tend to try to shrug off such protests as protectionist (and/or &#8220;anti-innovation&#8221;), they have oftentimes found themselves losing challenges to the legality of their models &#8212; including most recently in the U.K. Supreme Court (which just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">slapped down Uber&#8217;s classification of drivers/riders as self employed</a> &#8212; meaning it&#8217;s liable for a slew of costs for associated benefits).</p>

<p>All of which is to say that the muscular sense of injustice that segments of Spanish society have willingly &#8212; and even viscerally &#8212; demonstrated when they feel unfair impacts flowing from shiny new tech tools should not be dismissed; rather it looks like people here have their finger on the pulse of what&#8217;s really important to them.</p>
<p>That may also explain why the government is so keen to ensure no one in Spain feels left behind as it unboxes a major packet of startup-friendly policies.</p>
<p>Among a package of some 50 support measures, the entrepreneurial strategy makes a reference to &#8220;smart regulation&#8221; and floats the idea of sandboxing for testing products publicly (i.e. without needing to worry about regulatory compliance first).</p>
<p>The idea of opening up sandboxing is popular with local gig platform Glovo. &#8220;I really believe this is key; allowing innovation to test products/services without having to go through regulatory nightmares to test. This would really drive innovation,&#8221; co-founder Sacha Michaud tells us. &#8220;This is working well in financial services but could be applied across a wide range of tech areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Attracting more investment to Spain and improving stock options so that local companies can better compete to attract talent are other key priorities for him.</p>
<p>Michaud says he&#8217;s fully supportive of the government&#8217;s entrepreneurial strategy and the Startup Act, while not expecting immediate results on account of what he expects will be a long legislative process.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s less happy about the government&#8217;s in-train plan to regulate gig platforms, though &#8212; arguing that last-mile delivery is being unfairly singled out there. This reform, which is being worked on by the Ministry of Labor, has been driven by a number of legal challenges to platforms&#8217; employment classifications of gig workers in recent years &#8212; including a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/spains-top-court-rejects-glovos-classification-of-couriers-as-self-employed/"> loss last year for Glovo in Spain&#8217;s Supreme Court</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Glovo&#8217;s case [the government] are specifically looking at regulating only riders, last-mile delivery platforms &#8212; yet still allowing over an estimated 500,000 autonomous workers in logistics, services and installations to continue,&#8221; says Michaud, dubbing this &#8220;very discriminatory; affecting literally a handful of tech companies and &#8216;protecting&#8217; the status quo of the traditional IBEX35 Spanish companies&#8221;.</p>

<p>Asked about progress on the reform of the labor law Polo says only that work is continuing. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have more transparency on the work they are doing. I have probably the same information that you have and the conversations that we have with the different companies, also the gig companies that we keep an open dialogue with,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>But when pressed on whether reforming regulations to take account of tech-driven changes to how people work is an important component of the wider entrepreneurial strategy he also emphasizes that the &#8220;ultimate goal&#8221; of the national transformation plan is &#8220;to generate more and better jobs&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are always inclined to try to foster the companies that generate these better and increasing new jobs,&#8221; says Polo. &#8220;And I&#8217;m sure that the different gig companies that we have in Spain &#8212; I know that they understand this ultimate goal. They understand the benefits for the company and for the country of following this path and that they are willing to transform and evolve as the country is also evolving.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time of writing Barcelona is also being rocked by street protests over the jailing of rapper, Pablo Hasél, over <a href="https://www.thelocal.es/20210220/the-tweets-that-landed-spanish-rapper-pablo-hasel-in-jail">certain social media postings</a> &#8212; including tweets criticising police brutality &#8212; judged, by Spanish courts, to have violated its criminal code around glorifying terrorism.</p>
<p>Spain&#8217;s laws in this area have long been denounced as draconian and disproportionate. Including by <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/02/spain-jailing-of-rapper-for-song-lyrics-and-tweets-unjust-and-disproportionate/">Amnesty International</a> &#8212; which called Hasél&#8217;s imprisonment &#8220;an excessive and disproportionate restriction on his freedom of expression&#8221;. But Polo dismisses the idea that there&#8217;s any contradiction in Spain seeking to rebrand itself as a modernizing, pro-entrepreneur nation at the same time as Spain&#8217;s courts are putting people in prison over the contents of their tweets. (Hasél is not the only artist or citizen to fall foul of this law &#8212; which has also been <a href="https://www.thelocal.es/20170416/spanish-woman-jailed-over-twitter-terrorism-jokes">infamously triggered by social media jokes</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no opposition of concepts at all,&#8221; Polo argues. &#8220;Spain is one of the most robust democracies in the world and that is something that is not us who are saying it &#8212; it&#8217;s the international rankings. And we have a rule of law. And in this case it&#8217;s a very clear case of someone who went across the limits that are established in legislation because the freedom of speech has limits of the rights of other people so it&#8217;s something that has nothing to do unfortunately with freedom of speech&#8230; The reason why Pablo Hasél is in jail is because he promoted terrorism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pressed further on how &#8220;jail time for tweets&#8221; might look to an international audience, he reiterates a recent government statement that they do intend to reform the penal code. &#8220;There are very specific things that, yes, we want to reform. Because times have advanced,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;We are a more mature country than the one we were in the 1980s. And there are specific things that we want to change in the penal code &#8212; but they have nothing to do with the recent events.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Measures to change mindsets</h2>
<p>On the broader issue of cultural challenge &#8212; aka: how to change a national mindset to be more entrepreneurial &#8212; Polo expresses confidence in his mission. He says it&#8217;s about making sure people see the big picture <em>and</em> their place in the vision of the future you&#8217;re presenting to them; so they see you&#8217;re actively working to bring them along for the ride.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one of the things that I feel confident about. Particularly based on my background prior to being in politics. That is helping change mindsets,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;In the past I was able to help tonnes of people realize that they were capable of doing things that they thought they were never capable of doing. My understanding is that in order to generate those cultural changes you need to do one thing first: That is generating a vision for the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we insist so much that by 2030 Spain is going to become an entrepreneurial nation with the greatest social impact in history and that we have a plan for that&#8230; Where we take the entrepreneurship and we help them spearhead this new innovation model. We leverage all the driving sectors of the economy so we are actually building on success; on the actual success of Spain as an international economy. And that there&#8217;s something for you in that plan. That&#8217;s why we are including in the strategy at the basis of the strategy the inclusion policies in order to close the gender gap, the territorial gap, the socio-economic gap, the generational gap.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to change cultures you need to align people into working together towards building something that is greater than themselves and I think that with the Spain entrepreneurial nation strategy we made that first step. And this is why &#8212; and this is a parenthesis &#8212; that&#8217;s why we say the [startup] law is as important as having this strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>That startup law &#8212; due to be presented shortly in draft (aka as an <em>anteproyecto de ley</em>) for approval by the Council of Ministers, before going to parliament for a wider debate process (and potential amendments) &#8212; is the first piece of legislation aligned with the wider strategy. It also looks set to be one of its first deliverables.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not clear how long it will be before Spain gets its shiny new startup law. (The country&#8217;s politics has lacked consensus for years; Sanchez&#8217;s &#8220;progressive coalition&#8221; was only put together after he tried and failed to get a full majority for his Spanish Socialist Workers&#8217; Party (PSOE) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_government_of_Pedro_Sánchez">twice in a row</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something that is difficult to say because there are laws that have a shorter and others that have a longer period of approval,&#8221; says Polo, on the timeframe for passing the legislation. &#8220;For us the important issue here is that the startup law has a full process &#8212; so it has a full agreement on every side of the hill so it becomes robust and stable legislation for the years to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>This &#8220;long awaited&#8221; regulation which the ecosystem has been calling for for &#8220;years&#8221;, per Polo, will address a number of different issues &#8212; from the first legal &#8220;definition&#8221; of startup (to reflect differentiation vs other types of companies); to measures to help startups retain and attract talent.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to reform stock options so that they become a tool in order to compete internationally for talent,&#8221; he says, noting that the idea is to enable Spain to compete with regimes already offered by countries elsewhere in Europe, such as the U.K., France and Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also we need to reform visas in order to again retain and attract that talent,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;The president also talked about incentivizing investment and having a certain degree of tax breaks &#8212; and we understand that business angels need more incentives. So we have a more ordain and logical system of investment at the pre-seed and seed stage. And many other actions &#8212; it&#8217;s the Ministry of Economy that will end up with the final text that will be passed in the Council of Ministers in the coming weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polo cautions that the law won&#8217;t instantly fix every gripe of founders and investors in Spain. Clearly it&#8217;s going to be a marathon, not a sprint.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we have a strategy,&#8221; he emphasizes. &#8220;I understand the interest in the startup law but I always say that as important as the startup law is the Spain entrepreneurial nation strategy. Because it&#8217;s in there where we address the big problems that we have as a country when it comes to the ecosystem. And in there we have pointed out four big challenges that we have.</p>
<p>&#8220;First is investment. We need to accelerate the velocity of maturity of the investment in Spain&#8230; The numbers have been growing, year after year, and they look really good. So what we want to do is to help accelerate those numbers so we are able to run faster and close the gap that we have between us and our neighbours: Basically Germany and France. That they have 4x or 5x the number of investment that we have in Spain. We really want to be in ten years in a place where Spain could be leading the investment in innovative entrepreneurship in mainland Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Second challenge: Talent. We know that in order to build the entrepreneurial nation we need all the talent that we have. So we need to develop the internal talent but we also need to attract international talent and we need to retain that talent. So that&#8217;s why we were talking about the different tools that might be included in the startup law.</p>
<p>&#8220;The third challenge is scaling up. We in Spain have a lot of companies that assimilate success to selling. And that&#8217;s great &#8212; it&#8217;s totally legitimate. But what we need as a country is to have an increasing percentage of companies in the future that do not think about selling as a synonym of success; but they think about buying other startups around the world. Of growing. Of scaling up. So they started building today the big companies that in the future by 2030 they will generate thousands of good quality jobs in Spain which is the ultimate goal and the bottom line of the strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the fourth goal: Turn the political administration into an entrepreneurial administration. Meaning that the political administration, it&#8217;s more agile. That we generate a positive benchmark. And that sometimes the public sector makes the investment that not even the riskier of venture capital funds can do. Because that&#8217;s the role of the public sector; to generate this kind of visions and to put the means in in order to achieve those. So among all the challenges that we have in the ecosystem it&#8217;s something we have put together in the strategy &#8212; that is going to addressed not only with one law but with 50 different measures that we included in the Spain entrepreneurial nation strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wider entrepreneur strategy talks about nine priority actions to be developed in the next two years via certain projects &#8212; which Polo envisages being accelerated in the near term with the help of EU coronavirus recovery funds.</p>
<p>He highlights a couple of priority projects: One to create a network to link entrepreneurs and policymakers with the wider ecosystem, and another to connect incubators and accelerators to build out a national support network for founders &#8212; both of which have been inspired by approaches taken in other European countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Among these projects we have one &#8212; <em>Oficina Nacional de Emprendimiento</em> &#8212; which is deeply inspired by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/30/what-is-la-french-tech-supposed-to-do/">La French Tech</a> in France. So we want to generate a one-stop shop for entrepreneurs, investors and the rest of the ecosystem to access all of opportunities of collaboration between the central government, regions and CP councils in order to improve entrepreneurship in their respective areas,&#8221; says Polo.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have other projects like <em>Renace</em> &#8212; which is an acronym for <em>Red Nacional de Centros de Emprendimiento &#8212; </em>and in there we&#8217;ve also been inspired by the network that Portugal has that are doing such exciting things. So what we want to do is help connect the different incubators and accelerators and venture builders that we have in Spain. So they&#8217;re at first connected and we add more value &#8212; but with one particular focus: The different gaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;With <em>Renace</em> in particular we want to help close the territorial gap. Because it&#8217;s going to be very interesting to be able to work with engineers in Cáceres for a company that is based in Barcelona. Or to work with a team of designers from the Basque country for a company that is setting up in Malaga. With <em>Renace</em> we can help integrate the country and really talk about an entrepreneurial nation and not just cities. So Spain has the potential to build that. And there are many others issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>France alone spends billions annually both on R&amp;D and on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/france-announces-4-3-billion-plan-to-support-startups/">direct support for the digital sector</a>. And even with EU funding Spain can&#8217;t hope to match the level of &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; spend of richer, northern European countries. But Polo says the plan is to make the most of what it has with the resources it can marshal &#8212; hence, with the <em>Renace</em> project, it&#8217;s about linking up existing incubators/accelerators (and adding &#8220;a new layer of value&#8221; such as via public-private partnerships).</p>
<p>&#8220;When you end up reading the Spain entrepreneurial strategy you realize it&#8217;s not a billionaire plan of money that you put on the table in order to start building this Spain entrepreneurial nation,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s instead a very robust plan in order to create that vision and putting together the different pieces that we already have &#8212; the different assets that we have as a country to start working together intelligently so we can make the best of everything that we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polo also argues that Spain is already doing well on the startup cluster front &#8212; saying it stands alone with Germany in having more than one city ranked among the top 10 &#8220;most entrepreneurial&#8221; in Europe, per such listings. More recently, he says, Spain has risen further up these listicles &#8212; as more of its cities have popped up in the &#8220;global competition for innovative entrepreneurship&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning that in different places of Spain there are many cities and regions that have the hunger to become a place that is helping entrepreneurs to create this kind of economy. And we can get many more,&#8221; he suggests, pointing to <em>Renace</em>&#8216;s hoped for value from a social inclusion angle.</p>
<p>&#8220;With <em>Renace</em> what we want to do is generate this network and add more value &#8212; provide services, get into public-private partnership in order to add the value of the different places that we have in the country. So let&#8217;s say that a company in Barcelona can find tonnes of engineers in a city like Cáceres. The company in Barcelona becomes more competitive because the salaries in Cáceres &#8212; if you pay them the best salary in Cáceres they could be two-thirds of the salary in Barcelona. So the company in Barcelona becomes more competitive. But also the engineers in the city of Cáceres who want to stay in the region, who want to stay with their family or to have a life-project in Cáceres they can stay. So this is an example of how we can close the territorial gap and also become really integrated startup nation in the full term of nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The ultimate goal of the Spain entrepreneurial nation strategy is turning Spain into a country that is able to avoid the effects of different crises. And particularly the effects of that we saw in 2008 when the most vulnerable jobs were destroyed overnight &#8212; and they were counted by tens of thousands. That particularly struck the young people with unemployment rates that were above 55%. The immigrants and the people over 50. We don&#8217;t want that to happen again. So there&#8217;s been a very profound reflection on what needed to happen in Spain for that to change. And the conclusion was that we needed to change the productive basis of the country,&#8221; he continues.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we are putting together a strategy that is going to help the innovative entrepreneurship sector spearhead these new models, this new economic model for Spain. That is going to be leveraging the different driving sectors of the economy &#8212; those ten sectors that we state in the strategy &#8212; and that as it could not be differently in a 21st century strategy, and particularly a strategy designed by a new generation of politicians and trying to respond to the ambitions of the new generations that is a strategy that is not including the social impact of this phenomenon. So that&#8217;s why we are also focused on putting together inclusion policies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polo won&#8217;t be drawn into naming any especially promising startups he&#8217;s encountered on his travels around Spain &#8212; referring instead to the &#8220;tonnes of super innovative companies&#8221; he says he&#8217;s sure will soon be disrupting business as usual in Spain and (the government hopes) internationally &#8212; from battery charging companies to retail disruptors working on new ways to make clothes. (&#8220;Different kinds of innovations that people can&#8217;t imagine,&#8221; is his pithy shorthand.)</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are trying to do every time we have an opportunity is to also promote the knowledge of these companies &#8212; and also help Spanish people and also people abroad &#8212; to know that we have everything that we need in order to succeed as a nation and become that entrepreneurial nation with the greatest social impact in history,&#8221; he adds, acknowledging that a big part of his mission is &#8220;to tell the rest of the world that we are here&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX hasn&#8217;t issued any public statement about the $850 million in fresh funding <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/16/elon-musks-spacex-raised-850-million-at-419point99-a-share.html">CNBC reported</a> it raised last week, but a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1181412/000118141221000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">published today</a> confirms the round. SpaceX&#8217;s funding was said to value the company at around $74 billion, with a per-share value set at just under $420.</p>
<p>Investment firm Sequoia led the considerable raise and has now put over $600 million into the Elon Musk-led space company overall between this and a round it participated in in 2020, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/spacex-funding-round-at-74-billion-valuation-was-led-by-sequoia?sref=gni836kR">according to Bloomberg</a>. CNBC&#8217;s report also said that a secondary sale of existing shares generated an additional $750 million in capital for the company, putting the total new money available for SpaceX&#8217;s use at $1.6 billion — not too far shy of the $2 billion it raised at a valuation of $46 billion last August.</p>
<p>That probably seems like a lot of money to raise in less than a year. But few companies — private or otherwise — have the kind of capital needs of SpaceX. While it&#8217;s been able to build a thriving launch business on the money raised during the first part of its now nearly two-decade existence, that hasn&#8217;t slowed the rate at which it&#8217;s been undertaking big new projects with tremendous upfront costs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, SpaceX is rapidly building new prototypes of its Starship, a next-generation reusable rocket with multiple times the cargo capacity of its current Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 cargo nosecone. It has flown a number of prototypes — and lost two in the process due to missed landings. The company typically has at least two new prototypes under construction simultaneously and had been operating at that pace for many months now, with a highly manual production process for both the rockets and the new engines that power them.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SpaceX launches 60 more satellites for its Starlink service on the heels of opening up access&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/spacex-launches-60-more-satellites-for-its-starlink-service-on-the-heels-of-opening-up-access/embed/#?secret=pYRqQjv6Xs" data-secret="pYRqQjv6Xs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, it&#8217;s also building out Starlink — the global broadband internet satellite constellation that it wants to scale from its current 1,000+ size to more than 12,000 for final, world-spanning coverage reach. To scale it quickly and get its service operational (which it now is, to select areas in North America), SpaceX has been launching its own dedicated Falcon 9 rockets with 60 Starlink satellites on each. Since the company is its own customer for the majority of those missions, they&#8217;re entirely operating expenditures. Musk has estimated that fully deploying Starlink will take around $10 billion.</p>
<p>Both of these projects — Starship and Starlink — carry massive upfront costs, but they also have a lot of potential long-term upside; hence the skyrocketing valuation as both efforts begin to produce positive results, between Starship&#8217;s high-altitude tests and Starlink&#8217;s initial service availability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Real estate tech startup <a href="http://sunroomrentals.com/">Sunroom Rentals</a>, which leases units on behalf of property managers and apartment owners, has raised $11 million in a Series A round of funding led by Gigafund.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ben Doherty and Zachary Maurais, former founders of the delivery app Favor, launched Sunroom in May 2018 with the mission of “boosting the profitability” of mid-size property managers and apartment owners by giving them a way to outsource their leasing operations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pair <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/16/h-e-b-acquires-texas-based-on-demand-company-favor/">sold Favor to Texas grocer H-E-B in 2018</a> and soon after shifted their focus on building out Sunroom. The Austin-based company has developed an app that it says gives renters a way to tour, apply for and lease a unit “entirely online.” COVID-19 has led to more renters wanting virtual ways to explore and secure rental units. Mobile-first, Maurais noted, is particularly appealing to millennials and Gen Zers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">“Personally, we love to create products that fulfill consumer’s most basic needs,” said Maurais, the company’s president. “With food under our belt, we decided to focus on housing.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">While one might wonder what the parallels between food delivery and housing might be beyond fulfilling consumers’ needs, CEO Doherty said the rental market in 2021 looks a lot like the food delivery market in 2013.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In 2013, Grubhub had successfully put many restaurant menus online, but most of the transactions and delivery process was still offline,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re in a similar position with the rental market, as the majority of rental listings are online, but touring, applying or leasing units is still done offline.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since its launch, Sunroom Rentals has signed more than 2,000 leases and had over 100,000 renters sign up for its services in fast-growing Austin, where it focused its initial efforts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“According to the U.S. Census, that represents roughly 10% of renters in the greater Austin metro,” Maurais said. “Instead of going shallow and wide nationally, we decided to go deep in markets, in an effort to gain network effects, which was a strategy that worked well for us at Favor.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sunroom Rentals claims that it’s leasing units five days faster than the market average. This benefits property managers, Doherty said, because they can grow quicker “while improving leasing performance.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, the company will use the funding to expand across Texas, including in Houston, San Antonio and Dallas. It will also invest in its partner portal, which aims to give owners and property managers a way to view real-time data on leasing performance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sunroom Rentals currently has 18 employees with the goal of more than doubling its headcount this year. It’s in particular looking to hire across its engineering, product and sales departments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, Gigafund led the Series A financing, which included participation from NextGen Venture Partners, Calpoly Ventures and a slew of angel investors, including Gokul Rajaram (Google &amp; Square) and Homeward’s Tim Heyl, among others. Existing backers include Founders Fund Seed, Draper Associates, Boost VC and Capital Factory (among many others). The round marked Sunroom’s first “priced” round, meaning the first time it’s given up stock.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jonathan Basset, managing partner at NextGen Venture Partners, believes Sunroom was essentially in the right place at the right time and “on trend with touchless leasing even before COVID hit.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I watched them build a profitable consumer marketplace in a competitive market with Favor and was impressed with them as operators,” he said. “These businesses have a surprising amount of similarities and I&#8217;m confident they can rise to the challenge.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Last week, TechCrunch reported on the raise of another startup operating in this increasingly crowded space. Seattle-based <a href="https://www.knockcrm.com/">Knock </a>&#8212; a company that has developed tools to give property management companies a competitive edge &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/proptech-startup-knock-raises-20m-to-grow-saas-platform-for-property-managers/">raised $20 million </a>in a growth funding round led by Fifth Wall Ventures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Knock’s goal is to provide CRM tools to modernize front office operations for these companies so they can do things like offer virtual tours and communicate with renters via text, email or social media from “a single conversation screen.” For renters, it offers an easier way to communicate and engage with landlords.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maurais said the two differ in that Knock is a CRM built for leasing agents with a SAAS model where as Sunroom is a marketplace, where renters match, tour and apply with partnered properties.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Sunroom also provides a suite of leasing &amp; analytics software to its partners and generates both transactional and subscription revenues,&#8221; he added.</p>

<h1>AGENDA</h1>
<h2>Wednesday, March 3</h2>
<p><strong>State of the Union with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Parul Koul (Google)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Grace Reckers (Office and Professional Employees International Union)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Clarissa Redwine (NYU)</a></strong></p>
<p>Labor unions have been fairly uncommon in tech. That’s finally starting to change in recent years, as workers have pushed to organize at some the industry’s biggest companies, from Alphabet to Kickstarter. Parul Koul (Google), Grace Reckers (Office and Professional Employees International Union) and Clarissa Redwine (NYU) will join us to discuss the growing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the Next Unicorn with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Arlan Hamilton (Backstage Capital)</a></strong></p>
<p>Arlan Hamilton, the founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, has raised more than $12 million to back 150 companies led by underrepresented founders. In this session, Hamilton will discuss how she vets the biggest opportunities in investment, and how to disrupt in a positive way.</p>
<p><strong>The Path Forward for Essential Tech Workers with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Vanessa Bain (Gig Workers Collective)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Jessica E. Martinez (National Council for Occupational Safety and Health)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Christian Smalls (The Congress of Essential Workers)</a></strong></p>
<p>Gig workers and warehouse workers have become essential in a pandemic-ravaged economy. In California, a law went into effect earlier this year that makes gig workers independent contractors. Meanwhile, Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama are actively seeking to form a union to ensure better protections at the workplace. You’ll hear from workers and organizers about what’s next for gig workers and tech’s contractor workforce, and what battles lie ahead for these essential workers.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Equity in Tech with Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-CA)</strong></p>
<p>The ‘pipeline problem’ is often cited as the reason for a lack of diversity in the tech industry. But it’s a myth. Congresswoman Barbara Lee, having represented the East Bay of California for almost a decade, knows all too well about the rise of tech in the Bay Area. We’ll talk with Congresswoman Lee about the opportunities before us to create an equal playing field in tech so that underrepresented investors, founders, designers, coders and the like can reap the benefits.</p>
<p><b>Identifying and Dismantling Tech&#8217;s Deep Systems of Bias with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Haben Girma (Disability Justice Lawyer)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Mutale Nkonde (AI for the People)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Safiya Umoja Noble (UCLA)</a></b></p>
<p>Nearly every popular technology or service has within it systems of bias or exclusion, ignored by the privileged but obvious to the groups affected. How should these systems be exposed and documented, and how can we set about eliminating them and preventing more from appearing in the future? AI for the People&#8217;s Mutale Nkonde, disability rights lawyer Haben Girma and author of &#8220;Algorithms of Oppression&#8221; Safiya Umoja Noble discuss a more inclusive future.</p>
<p>Sponsored by <a href="https://twitter.com/Latinx_Startups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Latinx Startup Alliance</a>:<strong> Latinx Founders Leading with Inclusion </strong></p>
<p>Latinx Founders who are leading with inclusion through diverse teams and/or supporting a diverse mission, inclusion is a part of their DNA.</p>
<p><b>Founders in Focus with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Tracy Chou (Block Party)</a></b></p>
<p>We sit down with the founders poised to be the next big disruptors in this industry. Here we chat with Tracy Chou of Block Party, which works to protect people from abuse and harassment online.</p>

<p>StartOut and Socos Lab are excited to speak at TechCrunch Justice, and cover the Inclusion Impact Indexes. Its first iteration; the StartOut Pride Economic Impact Index quantifies the economic value of under-utilized LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs. The project looks at entrepreneurs’ economic impact in terms of job creation, patents, financings, and exits in the U.S. Our agenda will be a brief introduction, a demo of the index and its current findings, and a Q&amp;A discussion with the publishers of the index.</p>

<p>It may appear that the country is accepting change – from racial diversity to equality in the workplace. However, we still have ways to go. For example, organizational diversity is still about hiring from diverse talent pools. In reality, to activate the full potential of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) requires more than a “people strategy.” Robust and sustainable work in this area requires embedding DEI principles, policies, systems, and practices into all parts of the business, including the employee and customer experience, brand culture, and overall industry/corporate citizenship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Miami is quickly becoming a symbol for the tech exodus from Silicon Valley. The area is home to a number of investors, successful tech founders and an eager local government.</p>
<p>For this survey, TechCrunch spoke to a number of investors about the area&#8217;s potential, opportunities and key players. This is the second survey TechCrunch published on the area and the first can be found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/8-miami-area-investors-assess-americas-southernmost-tech-ecosystem/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In this survey, these investors agree on several aspects of Miami. They see a huge opportunity for the region to become a major startup hub by utilizing its diverse workforce and wonderful quality of life. As they say below, the future of work is uncertain and Miami is becoming more attractive as workforces disconnect from office buildings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>Alexandra Wilkis Wilson, co-founder and managing partner, Clerisy</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now?</strong></p>
<p>Miami’s startup scene has been growing and evolving over the past 5+ years thanks to local organizations supporting entrepreneurship including, but not limited to Endeavor Miami, The Knight Foundation, The Lab, Rokk3r Labs, eMerge Americas, Miami Angels and Wyncode. Many of Miami’s entrepreneurs, investors and startups have historically had ties to Latin America. I think going forward, the Miami tech scene will certainly continue to be a conduit to Latin America as it has been in the past. However, I predict more non-Latin American founders, investors, engineers and operators from cities like New York, LA and San Francisco, will also choose to build their businesses in Miami due to higher quality of life and more attractive tax rates. This dynamic will bring more relevant talent and a larger, more robust tech ecosystem to South Florida.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>I think we will see more diverse talent flow through Miami as a result of remote work becoming the norm. If employees technically headquartered in other cities are able to work remotely from anywhere, why not try out working from home while based in sunny Miami where one can be outdoors every day of the year? I recently joined a WhatsApp chat called “Nomads in Miami” that includes a variety of intellectually curious people from all walks of life (from creatives, to entrepreneurs, to traditional professionals) who are either temporarily in Miami this winter or have made a permanent move to South Florida. This chat is reflective of new groups of people coming to experience The Magic City. Anecdotally, I’ve found that many of these people who are “testing Miami out,” had never spent significant time in Miami before. I also recently joined another WhatsApp chat #miamitechlife that includes a local community of founders, investors, executives and local leaders to meet, collaborate and network while engaging in fun activities around Miami. There is an excitement and energy in Miami right now, and I believe it’s here to stay!</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>I recently launched a growth equity fund called Clerisy with my amazing business partner Lisa Myers who was most recently a partner at L Catterton, a leader in consumer private equity. We are excited to invest in fast-growing consumer and techsumer companies doing over $10 million in revenue, are quickly scaling and need growth capital. We will fund businesses that meet our criteria in categories we like such as health and wellness, consumerization of healthcare, food and beverage, beauty, and other consumer and techsumer areas. I would be thrilled to find an investment based in Miami, however Clerisy is not focused on a specific geography. We will invest in businesses located in cities or countries where we have previous business experience and ample, relevant networks.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in, or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>The Miami tech ecosystem is smaller than in the Bay Area or New York and arguably less intense, with fewer exits so far of which to speak. Although tightly knit, it is indeed welcoming to newcomers. I think this local hospitality is because Miami has had a bit of a transient nature among some of its inhabitants due to many Latin Americans coming and going every year, depending on the political or economic situations in their respective home countries. I think it will be easier than ever to convince new hires to relocate to Miami. The more success and exits Miami’s existing startups have, the easier it will be to attract more investment at the local level and more future talent.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystem roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc.</strong></p>
<p>On a local level, Miami needs a range of people to support its startup ecosystem: founders, high-quality talent ranging from engineers to marketers to creatives, angel investors, venture capital and private equity funds, lawyers, and then ideally a loyal and engaged consumer base that proudly supports its local companies.</p>
<h2>David Goldberg, general partner, Alpaca</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now?</strong></p>
<p>Miami has everything in place to accelerate its rise to be cemented as a significant tech/startup ecosystem. It now has capital (investors), founders, talent and infrastructure, each growing by the day given the attractiveness to the area. In five years, I am confident Miami will only trail SF, NYC, LA and Boston in terms of size/deals.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a double-edged sword. In a positive sense, you’ll get founders moving here, building out remote/distributed/hybrid teams. You’ll also have individual employees living here, but working remotely for companies based in other areas. What will be harder to get is the giant company all built from scratch with everyone local. These successes (e.g., Uber in SF) create thousands of future founders, operators and investors that pay it forward in their ecosystem. Without that, it will be tough to truly crack the top tier.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>As a firm, we focus broadly on consumer, marketplaces, e-commerce infrastructure, real estate technology and fintech. Given the influx of talent, I’m not sure if Miami needs to be pigeonholed to a few sectors. Traditionally, it’s been known for travel/hospitality, healthcare tech and real estate tech, but I&#8217;m already seeing emerging trends around blockchain/crypto, fintech, remote work and even some traditional enterprise SaaS. Miami is also an incredible bridge to Latam and South America and I can see a slew of companies taking advantage of that.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>The physical dispersion can make it more difficult. Just in Miami, there are minihubs in Brickell, Wynwood/Midtown, The Grove, Coral Gables, etc. Then you have completely separate networks up north in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, etc.</p>
<p>Additionally, Miami needs a bigger focus and contribution from its universities. Silicon Valley, LA, Boston and New York each have top-tier institutions that churn out tech talent. That’s still missing here.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystem roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, I am uncovering more each day. And everyone likes to talk about the &#8220;big names&#8221; that have recently moved here, like Keith Rabois, Anthony Pompliano, Harry Hurst, Jon Oringer, etc. But I also have deference to the folks that have been here, working tirelessly for years, creating the foundation. Some that come to mind: Melissa Medina, Matt Haggman, Nico Berardi, Shervin Pishevar, Raul Moas, Nancy Dahlberg, Rebecca Danta, Moishe Mana, Laura Maydon, Brian Brackeen, Tony Jimenez, Brian Breslin, Juan Pablo Cappello, Mellissa Krinzman, Mark Kingdon, and now, of course, Mayor Francis Suarez.</p>
<h2>Mark Volcheck, founding partner, Las Olas Venture Capital</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now?</strong></p>
<p>We think that things are still very early, but are bullish on the future of Florida tech. One of the key things to work on over the next five years is the continued community building — right now, there are a lot of disparate groups and not much communication between them. Over time, that cohesiveness could really drive south Florida forward as a tech ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>We do think there will be a future for offices and in-person collaboration. Across our entire portfolio nearly all companies have some plan to retain in-person talent. The biggest benefit is that remote work has enabled people in Big Tech to work outside of Silicon Valley, and it appears Miami and South Florida, more broadly, are enjoying the benefits of that decentralization. The distribution of talent will benefit founders here locally as the old VC expectations of tech talent to be hyperconcentrated in Silicon Valley is no longer as true, and people here locally will have access to better resources.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>Our fund targets two primary themes: B2B vertical SaaS and SaaS-enabled businesses/marketplaces, and broadly what we call knowledge worker tools — DevOps, cybersecurity and other typically product-led horizontal applications. Within vertical SaaS, logistics and supply chain tech has really taken off within the last few years, with even more tailwinds due to COVID&#8217;s impact on consumer demand and delivery expectations. As logistics is a huge industry for Miami and Florida, we think startups here have a very exciting opportunity in that space. We have now funded several companies in Florida across various aspects of logistics, from final mile delivery to long-haul trucking route optimization.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>Access to capital has been a significant problem for Florida-based founders since before we started our first fund back in 2016. There are relatively few funds actively investing in tech companies here at the seed and Series A stage, and essentially none post-Series A. Companies have historically had difficulty getting attention from Silicon Valley-based VCs due to the preconceptions of Florida as a bad place to start a company. Even as recently as last year the standard line from some Bay Area investors was, &#8220;Move out of Florida if you are serious about raising money.&#8221; That said, some of these preconceptions have been deserved, as historically South Florida as a business community has been prone to falling for flash over substance and that has occasionally been true for investors and startups as well. With the buzz around Miami and Florida as a place of interest for VCs and tech, we hope that attitudes around funding Florida companies have changed, as it is clear that good businesses can be built anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystem roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc.</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to mention all of our Florida-based companies who have been heads down building great businesses here locally — ReloQuest, CarePredict, OneRail, SmartHop and Plum. They are all hiring and growing like crazy, and several have received follow-on funding from top VCs. Check them out!</p>
<h2>Maya Baratz Jordan, CEO and founding partner, Founders Factory New York</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now?</strong></p>
<p>Cities with a diverse set of well-represented industries are often fertile grounds for building interesting companies. New York is a great example. Tech ecosystems thrive in an environment where you can unearth and solve a myriad of different problems versus just the problems of a single sector. The most interesting and lucrative companies tend to focus on blindspots in big markets. The blindspots are often discovered when they emerge out of silo and there&#8217;s a creative flow between industries. This is why I believe the diversity of industries and talent is ultimately a strength for Miami.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>One of the reasons it seems a lot of people are moving to Miami now is the fact that their job may not be tethered to a geographic location and they can work where they enjoy living. Given this unique strength to encompass work/life balance, Miami can experiment with hybrid models of working environments. Perhaps the dichotomy of working in an office versus working at home is dated. Offices were created for a time when technology used to be limited and the fastest way to communicate was in person. In-person interaction is important, but perhaps there are ways we can maintain [in-person interaction] that are not necessarily tethered to an office and that incorporate more ways to integrate with one&#8217;s life.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>Consumer healthcare is an area I&#8217;ve been actively investing in, and it seems like there&#8217;s been a lot of activity in Miami in that vertical, ranging from medical robotics to remote monitoring for chronic illnesses. I&#8217;m also interested in the future of work and the creator economy, and I believe the diverse set of industries in Miami will breed interesting companies that address the need for people to lucratively pursue their passions.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in, or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>People in Miami joke that they run on &#8220;Miami time,&#8221; which is something between island time and how New Yorkers think of time.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystem roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc.</strong></p>
<p>Miami is a city built by immigrants, and that strength is what will allow Miami to thrive as a tech ecosystem; immigrants start businesses at higher rates than those who are native born. It seems like female founders in particular have been quietly building interesting and successful businesses here.</p>

<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now? The city has attracted a wide range of people over the years, including more tech and finance companies very recently. How will it add up to something more than the sum of the parts?</strong></p>
<p>If you think of Miami as a product and evaluate its adoption curve, it seems like we have reached the chasm. I.e., those of us who have been here pre-COVID are like those you&#8217;d characterize as innovators and the during-COVID crowd as the early adopters. Miami is at the point where we now need to prove we can continue on the curve from early adopters to early majority.</p>
<p>Five years from now we&#8217;ll hopefully be focused on headlines showcasing startups that are growing and hiring here, and not just about which investor has relocated here (which is also good, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but not the end-all).</p>
<p>We can also wish that Miami&#8217;s best traits — its international perspective, its racial, socioeconomic and cultural diversity — will infuse something unique and truly distinctive into the founders and investors building their businesses here.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see a future where humans stop interacting with each other IRL. While how we &#8220;work&#8221; will look very different, offices &#8220;disappearing&#8221; is a bit of a stretch. It&#8217;s more likely that we will see an evolution of what an office looks like and how it functions as a &#8220;hub.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miami is full of disjointed &#8220;neighborhood clusters.&#8221; Up until now, this has been a negative, but given the changes we are going to see in how we work, I believe this is no longer as critical. In fact, it can be seen as an advantage where someone could live/work on the beach, and go to events/meetings at their &#8220;hub,&#8221; which may be elsewhere, when needed versus being so focused on living close to your workplace since you need to commute every day.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>While we&#8217;ve been based in Miami for the last seven years, we invest globally. In fact, COVID has made it even more acceptable to not be geographically constrained. This is the precise reason you are seeing investors move here.</p>
<p>We invest in fintech, healthcare tech, consumer tech and consumer products.</p>
<p>One of our most exciting portfolio companies is based in Broward: CarePredict. With the changes that COVID has brought about, they are uniquely placed to take advantage and provide the right dose of technology that eldercare requires.</p>
<p>Within our local ecosystem, Chewy and MagicLeap have been large employers. I&#8217;m most excited to see what their employees branch out and create in the coming years.</p>
<p>We are also excited to see a growing number of exceptionally talented founders moving to Miami to start their companies. These talents may have selected San Francisco or NYC previously, which is a great opportunity for us to meet exceptional teams at the infancy of an idea.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>Angel rounds are challenging here as compared to other more mature markets where founders or folks from the startup ecosystem play a larger role in angel rounds. Most local angels are used to investing in real estate, and approach early-stage deals differently than those who may be more accustomed to the asset class.</p>
<p>Hiring top-quality talent was also traditionally more challenging here than in tier-one entrepreneurial cities. With the significant influx of remote workers in the past year and the change in perceptions about Miami, we are hopeful that local companies will be able to overcome this challenge.</p>
<p>Miami is a collection of neighborhood clusters, as I mentioned earlier. If someone is looking to relocate here, they should spend some time getting to know what works for them before they commit to a neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystem roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Venture Bites is a local grassroots organization made up of people passionate about the startup ecosystem. They organize educational sessions with key players from across the country and are also organizing a pitch competition with prominent public and private partnerships already in place.</li>
<li>Refresh Miami has been a vocal supporter and &#8220;info hub&#8221; for the community.</li>
<li>Miami Angels has been working tirelessly to get more angel investors into the startup ecosystem. There are a lot of high net worth individuals here, but it&#8217;s been historically challenging to get their attention away from real estate investing to startup investing. Hopefully, with Miami crossing the chasm it&#8217;ll bring more folks into the mix.</li>
<li>Animo Ventures and Las Olas Venture Capital are two other VC firms located in South Florida from pre-COVID days. Hopefully we&#8217;ll hear of many more setting up shop here in the coming months.</li>
<li>The Knight Foundation has been one of the most consistent supporters of the ecosystem and its impact cannot be understated.</li>
<li>500 Startups is one of the very first Silicon Valley firms to have recognized the potential of Miami, setting up an office here a few years ago. Ana and her colleagues have been instrumental in stimulating and engaging the local ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Laura González-Estéfani, founder, TheVentureCity</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now?</strong></p>
<p>If the leaps we have made in the last five years are any indication of the next five, we believe Miami will be the next big tech hub in the southern United States. We have all the right pieces to make that true: engineer/developer schools and academies, startup programs and accelerators for seed, a thriving tech community, exits from founders reinvesting in the next generation of founders, influx of new capital, quality of life that tech company founders and employees are starting to prioritize, engaged local government as we have recently seen, as well as an incredibly diverse pool of talent.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>We believe talent has no zip code and smart cities are those that attract and retain the best talent — it’s no longer just about connectivity or infrastructures exclusively. In the past, people had to relocate to work at their dream job sacrificing too much personally. 2020 has just confirmed that you don’t need to sacrifice the way you want to live your life because of a dream job. The complaint we used to hear from talent was that there were not enough mid- to senior-level roles in Miami in tech — remote work has significantly strengthened Miami. Miami is a dream destination for a lot of people in different stages of life, so we see Miami also becoming a great remote work hub for those that can be 100% remote, even if they only spend part of the year here and then migrate to other climates. The workforce has more choices now than ever before and we think people will start to really put quality of life over job location. It is a true game changer.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>We have been based in Miami for the past four years and we invest from Miami to where the best founders are. Sometimes [they are] in Miami and sometimes in other states or countries. “We are from Miami to the world.” We are now witnessing a huge internal movement from other states to Miami, but many of us moved from our countries to Miami because of the immense opportunities Miami offers. We invest in software companies disrupting traditional industries, Health tech, fintech, mobility, cybersecurity and jobs. We have also invested in marketplace business models in products disrupting travel, pets, solutions for SMBs. We love giving a first ticket from $100,000 to seed stage companies jointly with a product-led growth program or a pre-Series A to a ticket of an average of $3 million through our Fund II. We love diverse companies, international mindset and execution over anything else.</p>
<p>Miami has always been an extraordinary hub for fintech, we are closely following interesting companies in this space and obviously health tech. We have to say that we have seen very disruptive companies in proptech and also very interesting marketplaces of all kinds B2C and B2B.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>Our biggest challenge has always been fighting the biases of people around Miami. You have to experience Miami to understand the opportunities it brings. It’s a very welcoming city where so many people will help you land. The next biggest challenge is that the amount of capital that Miami moves versus how much is invested in tech is ridiculous, really a pity. For this reason we need a fund of funds that supports the local funds so that they can develop the ecosystem on this front. And I am not talking about leftovers of capital that need to meet a quota or small initiatives. I mean people investing with true conviction in the asset. That is what gets the flywheel running, capital to fund managers that chose the right entrepreneurs from Miami or outside [and] that create jobs, etc. Let’s not forget that capital attracts founders and founders develop a huge industry that creates thousands of jobs. It is not only about investing in Miami, it’s also about investing from here to the world.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc?</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of online creators and influencers have adopted mobile-friendly &#8220;link in bio&#8221; websites, like <a href="https://linktr.ee/">Linktree</a>, to point their fans to their social profiles or other content they want to promote. Today, live streaming software company Streamlabs launched its own product in this market with its new mobile website builder <a href="https://wlo.link/">Willow</a>. Its tool differentiates itself from others in this space by integrating a tipping feature directly on the landing page.</p>
<p>&#8220;Link in bio&#8221; websites have grown in popularity because social platforms like TikTok and Instagram only allow users to feature one main URL on user profiles. But online creators and influencers often have a presence on multiple sites they want their fans to know about. That&#8217;s where these custom websites come in.</p>
<p>Like most &#8220;link in bio&#8221; website builders, Willow offers a simple way to add a list of links to a customized, mobile-optimized webpage.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product itself is somewhat basic compared to those being offered by newer startups &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/beacons-debuts-a-link-in-bio-mobile-website-builder-that-helps-creators-make-money-not-just-list-links/">like Beacons</a>, for example, which lets users add links for donations, affiliate shopping, paid downloads and more. In Willow&#8217;s case, you just enter a URL and it appears on your website. You can also pick from a handful of colorful designs, each with their own style and font.</p>
<p>The online website builder lets you view your site in progress as you add links or update the design, and you can preview how it looks on mobile, tablet and desktop by clicking a button.</p>
<p>But Willow&#8217;s more interesting feature is the ability to add tipping to your website.</p>
<p>To do so, you&#8217;ll just toggle on the Tips feature from the website builder interface and then connect your PayPal account to Willow. This places a &#8220;Donate!&#8221; button at the top of your link list, so you can encourage fans to leave a tip.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116714" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116714" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116714" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="206" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png 780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=150,45 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=300,91 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=768,232 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=680,206 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=50,15 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116714" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Streamlabs</p></div></p>
<p>This feature will be the new website builder&#8217;s key selling point, given that today, creators who receive tips through social and streaming platforms often have to share the revenue from those transactions back with the platform itself. Tips through PayPal will be a more direct form of payment between fans and creators, beyond any applicable PayPal fees.</p>
<p>Streamlabs tells us it doesn&#8217;t keep any of the tip money &#8212; everything goes to the creator.</p>
<p>However, it does plan to soon monetize the new product in a different way. In a few weeks&#8217; time, the company will introduce a paid version for $5 per month that will include enhanced analytics like click-through rates and which days see the most clicks and views. The pro version will also include more custom themes.</p>

<p>Because Willow only launched today, it doesn&#8217;t have a large number of users at this time. However, a top streamer<a href="https://twitter.com/FaZeMew"> FaZe Mew </a>has already signed up, per the short Willow link (wlo.link) found on his various social media bios.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our experience building tools for live streamers inspired us to build products that cater to the greater content creator ecosystem,&#8221; said George Kurdin, Streamlabs GM. &#8220;To deliver on this mission and grow our business, we are building products that cater to more brands, businesses and individuals,&#8221; he said.</p>
