										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s efforts to bring advertising to the Oculus virtual reality platform it has spent billions of dollars building out doesn&#8217;t seem to be off to a great start.</p>
<p>The company announced last week that they were planning to roll out their first in-game ads inside the title <em>Blaston</em> from the prolific VR game developer Resolution Games, and just days later the game studio has shared that after hearing an earful from users they&#8217;ve decided to abandon the ad rollout.</p>
<p>&#8220;After listening to player feedback, we realize that Blaston isn’t the best fit for this type of advertising test,&#8221; a tweet from the <a href="https://twitter.com/BlastonGame/status/1407059903617896450">Blaston</a> account read. &#8220;Therefore, we no longer plan to implement the test. We look forward to seeing you in the arena and hope you try the Crackdown Update that went live today!&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This potential ad rollout had been particularly noteworthy because the ads were being tested inside a title from a third-party developer. Facebook has purchased a handful of VR studios in recent months and owns a number of the most popular Quest titles inside its marketplace, so the opportunity to roll out advertising with a third-party partner gave Facebook an chance to frame the advertising rollout as a way for other developers to open up their monetization channels, rather than for Facebook to do so.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The announcement last week still brought out plenty of critics in the VR community who weren&#8217;t thrilled about Facebook&#8217;s broader struggles with balancing advertising efforts with user privacy, but other users seemed to be more annoyed by the prospect of ads being rolled out inside a paid title they had already purchased. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Blaston retails for $9.99 in the Oculus store.</span></p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong><em>Resolution Games reached out to TechCrunch with a statement, floating the possibility of further ad tests down the road inside one of the developer&#8217;s free apps. &#8220;To make it clear, we realize that Blaston isn’t the best fit for this type of advertising test. As an alternative, we are looking to see if it is feasible to move this small, temporary test to our free game, Bait! sometime in the future.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Resolution Games abandoning the test before it even started is an early setback for Facebook&#8217;s VR advertising efforts that showcases just how skeptical the Oculus platform&#8217;s most vocal users still are of Facebook. In a blog post last week, Facebook sought to address early concerns with what user data would be used to serve up advertising in VR, specifically noting that conversations recorded by the headset&#8217;s microphone and images analyzed by the onboard tracking cameras would not be used.</p>
<p>Facebook saw considerable backlash last year from virtual reality fans when they shared that new headset owners would need a Facebook account in order to activate their devices. While criticism poured in following the announcement, the recently released $299 Quest 2 headset has already outsold all of Facebook&#8217;s previous VR devices combined, the company has said.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Facebook for comment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 21, 2021. The tech industry is skipping any sort of a summer slowdown. Facebook is taking on Clubhouse and Spotify, India is still figuring out how to manage its burgeoning technology industry, and everyone is raising money. Plus, we have notes on a new VC fund that has quite a twist. Let’s get into it! &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/"><strong>Facebook wants your voice:</strong></a> Facebook’s live-audio service is out, putting Big Blue in competition with Clubhouse, a buzzy startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">and Spotify</a>. In the wake of Clubhouse’s super-active early 2021, a host of Big Tech companies are looking to capture the magic that the startup managed to bottle. How successful Facebook will be at cutting in on Clubhouse’s game is not clear; so far, Facebook has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/facebook-to-launch-virtual-dating-over-messenger/">yet to dominate the dating world</a>, for example, making its entrance into the live-audio space more potential than promise of domination.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/revolut-revenue-grew-by-57-in-2020/"><strong>Consumer fintech is looking good:</strong></a><strong> </strong>New numbers from European fintech unicorn Revolut dropped today, with TechCrunch’s <a href="https://twitter.com/romaindillet">Romain Dillet</a> taking a look at the company for our publication. The gist is that Revolut had a deeply unprofitable 2020, but one that showed a real ramp toward smaller losses as it went on. I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/maybe-neobanks-will-break-even-after-all/">doodled on the company’s numbers here</a>, if that’s your thing.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/what-does-red-hats-sale-to-ibm-tell-us-about-couchbases-valuation/"><strong>IPOs keep coming:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, we’re still waiting for Robinhood to file to go public, but after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/walkme-is-going-public-lets-stroll-through-its-numbers/">WalkMe’s public debut</a> last week, there are new tech companies approaching the public markets. Couchbase filed today, kicking off the process of floating the database software company backed by Accel, Mayfield and Ignition Partners. Expect more filings in the coming weeks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups</h2>
<p>To keep proper tabs on both sides of the startup fundraising marketplace, we’re stripping VC news into its own section on occasion. Today is one such day. First, however, some startup news:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/electric-utility-bike-startup-ubco-raises-10-million-to-fund-its-global-expansion/"><strong>$10M for e-bikes:</strong></a> Ubco, a New Zealand-based electric utility bike startup, announced a $10 million raise today. The company is best known for its Ubco 2X2, an “all-wheel-drive electric motorbike that looks like a dirt bike but rides like a moped” &#8212; and looks rather fetching. Urban transit is changing as cities look to limit their car &#8212; and carbon &#8212; footprints. If trends hold, startups like Ubco could find themselves selling into a market that is moving in their direction.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/buy-now-pay-later-startup-kredivo-doubles-its-debt-facility-from-victory-park-capital-to-200m/"><strong>Consumers love debt:</strong></a> TechCrunch covered news today that Kredivo, an Indonesian buy now, pay later (BNPL) startup, added $100 million to its credit facilities. The new capital access doubles the amount of debt that Kredivo can access. The news illustrates both the global consumer appetite for rejiggered debt products that transcend traditional credit cards, as well as the willingness of investors around the world to provide BNPL companies with ever more capital access. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/as-buy-now-pay-later-startups-keep-raising-capital-a-dive-into-klarna-afterpay-and-affirms-earnings/">More on the subject here</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/music-licensing-marketplace-songtradr-raises-50m/">Music licensing remains complicated, lucrative:</a> </strong>When <a href="https://genius.com/816886">Ludacris rapped</a> that up-and-coming artists should “get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession,” he wasn’t kidding. The musical world is complicated. Mechanical licenses, platform cuts &#8212; it’s a lot. And where there’s complexity, there’s opportunity. Songtradr just raised $50 million to help license music to “high-profile names for advertising, films, TV, gaming and the like,” TechCrunch wrote in covering its latest round. Songtradr has now raised more than $100 million to fund its efforts.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/sneaker-community-startup-solesavy-raises-12-5-million-series-a-to-build-an-end-to-end-sneakersphere/">Are shoes still hot?</a> </strong>Backers of SoleSavy think so. They just put $12.5 million into the company’s Series A round. Unlike StockX &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/the-stockx-megaround-smells-like-pre-ipo-money/">which is big business these days</a> &#8212; SoleSavy isn’t a retail marketplace. Instead, it’s a company looking to build a sneaker head community. A community is like a subreddit, but on a different CMS and hosting provider, in case you’d forgotten.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Venture Capital News</h2>
<p>What educational background generates the best entrepreneurs? Every university will tell you that they are the best. Many founders manage without a degree at all. The Academy Investor Network is betting that graduates of American military academies will prove lucrative. The fund <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/academy-investor-network-usaa/">just announced a $2.5 million anchor LP for its first fund</a>, adding to capital from Scout Ventures, where co-founder Emily McMahan is a venture partner. She’s partnering with Sherman Williams in targeting a $50 million first raise.</p>
<p>Let’s see how far their thesis carries them. At least they will be able to brag with confidence that when it comes to <a href="https://www.goruck.com/pages/what-is-rucking">rucking</a> they will have the highest founder quality in the world.</p>
<h2>Seed is not the new Series A</h2>
<p>Usually, a teacher who grades students on a curve is boosting the efforts of those who didn&#8217;t perform well on the test. In the case of cloud companies, however, it&#8217;s the other way around.</p>
<p>As of Q1 2021, startups in this sector have a median Series A around $8 million, reports PitchBook. With $100+ million rounds becoming more common, company valuations are regularly boosted into the billions.</p>
<p>Andy Stinnes, general partner at Cloud Apps Capital Partners, says founders who are between angel and Series A should seek out investors who are satisfied with $200,000 to $500,000 in ARR. Usually a specialist firm, these VCs are open to betting on startups that haven&#8217;t yet found product-market fit.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/india-proposes-tougher-e-commerce-rules-following-widespread-cheating-and-unfair-trade-by-amazon-and-flipkart/"><strong>India’s tech scene deals with more government oversight:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The Indian e-commerce industry is huge, with Amazon and Walmart battling with domestic companies &#8212; or buying them, in the case of Flipkart and Walmart &#8212; for market share in a growing market. All the activity is attracting complaints and possible government intervention. TechCrunch reported today that India “proposed … banning flash sales on e-commerce platforms and preventing their affiliate entities from being listed as sellers as the South Asian market looks to further tighten rules.”</p>
<p>India’s government is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-says-concerned-with-india-intimidation-requests-3-more-months-to-comply-with-new-it-rules/">busy battling with Twitter</a>, as we’ve reported at length.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/apples-app-store-to-face-scrutiny-in-germany-as-fco-opens-market-power-proceeding/"><strong>Germany is not enthused with Apple:</strong></a><strong> </strong>With a fourth investigation opened, this time involving Apple, Germany’s oversight of competition in the tech world ratcheted up another few degrees today. In the case of Big Phone, the governmental body will “determine whether or not the iPhone maker meets the threshold of Germany’s updated competition law.” If Apple does, it would allow the country’s government to “intervene proactively” regarding the company’s activity.</p>
<p>Apple is also taking fire in its domestic market for what some perceive as heavy-handed tactics regarding its mobile app ecosystem, a market that the Cupertino-based company both moderates and extracts rents from.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/uber-to-become-the-sole-owner-of-grocery-delivery-startup-cornershop/"><strong>Uber buys Cornershop:</strong></a> Today is a notable day for Latin American tech startups as the U.S. ride-hailing giant agreed to buy the 47% of Cornershop that it doesn’t own. The price? 29 million Uber shares. That’s about $1.3 billion worth of Uber equity.</p>
<p>The car service and delivery magnate bought Postmates last year, adding to its ability to deliver more than merely rides. The Cornershop buy fits into the thesis because the smaller company is also in the delivery market.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Couchbase could double its valuation provided that investors are more interested in its faster-than-Red-Hat growth than they are worried about its history of cash consumption and growing net losses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/despite-flat-growth-ride-hailing-colossus-didis-us-ipo-could-reach-70b/">IPO rush of 2021</a> continued this week with a fresh filing from NoSQL provider <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/">Couchbase</a>. The company <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/couchbase/company_financials">raised hundreds of millions</a> while private, making its impending debut an important moment for a number of private investors, including venture capitalists.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a>, Couchbase was last valued at a post-money valuation of $580 million when it raised $105 million in May 2020. The company &#8212; despite its expansive fundraising history &#8212; is not a unicorn heading into its debut to the best of our knowledge.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to uncover whether it will be one when it prices and starts to trade, so we dug into Couchbase&#8217;s business model and its financial performance, hoping to better understand the company and its market comps.</p>
<h2>The Couchbase S-1</h2>
<p>The Couchbase <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1845022/000119312521194292/d73036ds1.htm">S-1 filing</a> details a company that sells database tech. More specifically, Couchbase offers customers database technology that includes what NoSQL can offer (&#8220;schema flexibility,&#8221; in the company&#8217;s phrasing), as well as the ability to ask questions of their data with SQL queries.</p>
<p>Couchbase&#8217;s software can be deployed on clouds, including public clouds, in hybrid environments, and even on-prem setups. The company sells to large companies, attracting 541 customers by the end of its fiscal 2021 that generated $107.8 million in annual recurring revenue, or ARR, by the close of last year.</p>
<p>Couchbase breaks its revenue into two main buckets. The first, subscription, includes software license income and what the company calls &#8220;support and other&#8221; revenues, which it defines as &#8220;post-contract support,&#8221; or PCS, which is a package of offerings, including &#8220;support, bug fixes and the right to receive unspecified software updates and upgrades&#8221; for the length of the contract.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s second revenue bucket is services, which is self-explanatory and lower-margin than its subscription products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Popular Twitch streamers <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/amouranth">Amouranth</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/indiefoxx">Indiefoxx</a> are the two latest casualties of Twitch&#8217;s ongoing battle to enforce its own confusing rules around sexually suggestive content.</p>
<p>Both creators were <a href="https://twitter.com/Amouranth/status/1406063385876250625">suspended</a> following ASMR streams that pushed the bounds of Twitch&#8217;s community guidelines forbidding content that isn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> sexual in nature but is still too risqué for a platform deeply self-conscious about its advertising business. The Amazon-owned company declined to comment on the length of the bans or what provoked them, but pointed TechCrunch toward its rules on sexual content.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that both Amouranth (Kaitlyn Siragusa) and Indiefoxx (Jenelle Dagres) will be reinstated Monday, 72 hours after their Friday ban, but both channels remained unavailable at the time of writing. Siragusa <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22543478/twitch-amouranth-indiefoxx-yoga-asmr-stream-hot-tub-meta-ban">confirmed to Polygon</a> that she was suspended after a stream in which she did yoga poses while making ear-licking sounds into a microphone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The so-called &#8220;<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/ASMR">ASMR-meta</a>&#8221; on Twitch, where streamers boost their views by whispering into their microphones or producing licking sounds, sometimes while holding yoga poses, follows the <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/05/21/lets-talk-about-hot-tub-streams/">controversy around hot tubs on Twitch</a> that exploded last month. In both instances, some Twitch creators believe that the platform&#8217;s rules are selectively enforced.</p>
<p>&#8220;With ASMR meta and crazy yoga poses, believe it or not I watched two other girls doing it to the tune of 2-5k views without any bans for months before I folded the activity into ASMR creating the infamous &#8216;ASMR&#8217; meta,&#8221; Siragusa wrote on Twitter. &#8220;Those other streamers are still unbanned and continue to do it. My sin was taking inaction as a sign of tacit acceptance, and then blowing the top off the secret and hitting 30k viewers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because both the ASMR meta and the hot tub meta were dominated by female streamers, the whole situation has attracted even more misogyny within the Twitch community, where <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/twitch-women-who-stream-say-their-biggest-obstacle-harassment-n1060016">female streamers are still regularly harassed off the platform</a>.</p>

<p>In a blog addressing the proliferation of women streaming from pools and hot tubs at the time, Twitch wrote that &#8220;being found to be sexy by others is not against our rules, and Twitch will not take enforcement action against women, or anyone on our service, for their perceived attractiveness.&#8221; The company clarified that while a bathing suit in a bedroom might break the rules, &#8220;contextually appropriate&#8221; swimwear is allowed.</p>
<p>Twitch also acknowledged the complexity of its own <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/community-guidelines/sexualcontent/">difficult to parse rules</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our intention with the Sexually Suggestive policy was to draw a line on content that is overtly or explicitly sexually suggestive, not to ban all content that could be viewed as sexually suggestive – but we acknowledge that our rules are not as clear as they could be.</p>
<p>Prohibiting every form of content that could be interpreted as suggestive would also result in far more restrictions on the video games and premium content that we currently allow, especially considering the ways that female characters are sometimes objectified or presented in a sexualized manner.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its solution at the time was to create a &#8220;Pools, Hot Tubs, and Beaches&#8221; category where that content could live. Most of Twitch&#8217;s categories are dedicated to specific games, with most of the platform&#8217;s nongaming streams listed in the popular catch-all category &#8220;Just Chatting.&#8221;</p>
<p>ASMR has its own category, with 2.4 million followers, encompassing ear-tingling ASMR streams that don&#8217;t push the boundaries of Twitch&#8217;s rules with the more recent crop of those that do. So far, instead of building out a more thoughtful way to corral sexually suggestive content, the company is opting to punish anybody who it decides crosses the line. But it&#8217;s possible that could all change: Last month, Twitch said it was working on new policies to further clarify the rules on sexually suggestive content.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Twitch — and for the female creators disproportionately affected by its uneven policies — the abundance of ear-licking streams suggests that until then, the company will be making these same determinations over and over as it tries to draw a line within a gray area of its own making.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ubco, the New Zealand-based electric utility bike startup, has raised $10 million to fund a global expansion focused on the U.S. market and scale up its commercial subscription service business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ubco’s hero product, the Ubco 2X2, is an all-wheel drive electric motorbike that looks like a dirt bike but rides like a moped. What began as a solution for farmers to get around pastures and farms easily, safely and quickly has expanded to include an urban version of the bike that caters to fleet enterprise customers, gig economy workers and city riders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its founding in 2015, the company has produced two versions of its 145-pound utility bike: The Work Bike, the original off-road vehicle, and the Adventure Bike, the newer version that’s made for city riding but can handle itself off-road. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that Ubco’s got a fresh cash infusion from the round led by Seven Peak Ventures, Nuance Capital and TPK Holdings, it hopes to continue expanding into existing verticals, like food delivery, postal service and last-mile logistics. The company already works with Domino’s in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, as well as a range of other national clients, like the New Zealand Post, the Defense Force, the Department of Conservation and Pāmu, or Landcorp Farming Limited and other local restaurants and stores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a strong enterprise market in New Zealand and have developed a strong pipeline of sales internationally,” Timothy Allan, CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While direct consumer sales make up for most of Ubco’s revenue at present, the company is pushing aggressively into enterprise, and more specifically, subscription services. The 2X2 is built on an intelligent platform that includes vehicle and power systems, cloud connectivity and data analysis, which enables the subscription model to work alongside fleet management systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ubco expects revenue to climb from $2.1 million in 2020 to $8.4 million by the end of 2021 as it pushes to increase its annual recurring revenue through subscriptions. Ubco’s subscription model, which costs about $50 to $60 per week ($75 to $85 NZD) for fleet enterprise customers, is being rolled out in New Zealand, Australia, the U.K., Europe and the U.S. this year and into 202. Consumers will get access to the subscriptions, as well, within the next couple of months, according to a spokesperson for the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allan sees subscriptions as the future of the EV industry, not just because it allows for a high chance of profitability, but also because it’s far more environmentally sustainable. As the company expands this part of its business model, it hopes to lead the circular economy space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company predicts that vehicles run through the subscription model will have four times the life expectancy as those sold outright and produce 80% less carbon overall compared to a combustion vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Subscription means we own the vehicle, so we manage the lifecycle,” said Allan. “So the first life starts at high intensity, and that might be 60,000 kilometers delivering pizza, or it might be 30,000 kilometers on a farm, which are equally hard for different reasons. Then after, that vehicle will go down to a lower intensity application. After that the battery can then be pulled out, and that might go into passive solar storage or something like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allan sees solving the end-of-life issue as a personal and professional challenge, one with room for creativity since no one has fully figured out the correct way of doing it. He says he takes a bottom-up approach when it comes to the engineering of the vehicle in a way that allows for easier recycling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like when you design a battery, fuck putting fire retardant foam into it because you can’t get it back at the end of life,” he said. “So it starts with correctly labeling, engineering with intent so that you’re designing for this type of assembly, and then your business or commercial system needs to support the concept. Now, we’ve got the advantage because the economics and incentives are aligned, and that all aligns with New Zealand’s product stewardship legislation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to perfect the circular economy through utility vehicles isn’t just about doing what’s right for the environment. Allan thinks it’ll be a smart business decision in the end, one that will draw in customers and give the company a competitive edge with enterprise clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a part of your journey with us as a customer,” said Allan. “If we can design subscriptions and the life of the vehicle in such a way that you feel good about it, that’s where we’re driving from. Most people want to do the right thing, and we can provide something that logically fits the economics, can be done at scale and can be managed holistically.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In something of an about-face, Amblin Partners, Steven Spielberg&#8217;s long-running film production company, will produce several films per year for Netflix. The deal reflects Netflix&#8217;s rising star and arguably acceptance by the legendary director of a new order to the cinematic world where home viewing is a first-class citizen.</p>
<p>The deal was <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/steven-spielbergs-amblin-partners-forms-netflix-film-partnership">announced in a press release</a> with few details except glowing quotes from Amblin and Netflix executives. All that is certain is that Amblin will produce &#8220;multiple new feature films per year&#8221; for Netflix.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the minute Ted [Sarandos, Netflix co-CEO and chief content officer] and I started discussing a partnership, it was abundantly clear that we had an amazing opportunity to tell new stories together and reach audiences in new ways,&#8221; said Spielberg in the release.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those new ways didn&#8217;t sound so amazing to Spielberg a couple years ago when he was reportedly pushing to exclude Netflix films from the Academy Awards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you commit to a television format, you’re a TV movie,” Spielberg told ITV in March of 2019. “I don’t believe films that are just given token qualifications in a couple of theaters for less than a week should qualify for the Academy Award nomination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately no real push was made, though. Whether Spielberg was misrepresented, changed his mind or just read the room, he has since tempered his position. He has said rather that he simply wants to cherish and protect &#8220;the theatrical experience&#8221; — understandable from one of the pioneers of the modern blockbuster.</p>
<p>Naturally it&#8217;s a huge get for Netflix, which will get a steady stream of Amblin features, though there&#8217;s no guarantee of a Spielberg picture. Meanwhile Amblin will continue its longtime partnership with Universal, which fills the more traditional moviemaking and distribution side of things. The company has already broken bread with streaming companies, with shows and films made for and distributed by Netflix and others, but this is most significant partnership so far.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was COVID that suggested to Spielberg and Amblin that streaming platforms are, far from going away, simply the future of the industry in many ways. In a world where the &#8220;theatrical experience&#8221; is a potential superspreader event and people are perfectly happy to watch (and pay for) a &#8220;premiere&#8221; at home, it may be better to roll with the punches and hope that things bounce back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Collectibles boomed during the pandemic and while NFT outfits like NBA Top Shot exploded as consumers flirted with newer efforts, the sneaker world grew even more mature with enthusiasts digging deeper into communities dedicated to the hobby/passion/obsession/alternative asset class.</p>
<p>Vancouver&#8217;s <a href="https://solesavy.com/">SoleSavy</a>, a sneaker community dedicated to giving fans a curated place to navigate the world of shoes, with all of its drops, news and rumors, has raised a $12.5 million Series A just months after wrapping a $2 million seed round, showcasing investor enthusiasm behind vertical-specific premium social experiences. The round was led by Bedrock Capital with participation from Dapper Labs’ CEO Roham Gharegozlou, Diplo, Bessemer Ventures and Turner Novak&#8217;s Banana Capital, among others.</p>
<p>CEO Dejan Pralica says the company has tripled its user base since its seed raise late last year, while growing its team from 10 to 37 employees in the same period.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, SoleSavy&#8217;s community is based largely around a network of Slack groups where users can discuss just about everything. Though the platform&#8217;s chat communities are organized in Slack now, Pralica sees a future where the company could build its own chat hub for members, something to further tie-in the startup&#8217;s app, website and online conversations. The more near-term goal is to grow this community into a hub of trusted buyers and sellers where a peer-to-peer member marketplace can thrive. SoleSavy is at the forefront of a new generation of more social internet marketplaces where vertical-specific communities can gather and grow inside an all-encompassing platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do envision on end-to-end platform that’s very integrated,&#8221; Pralica tells TechCrunch.&#8221;I want to make sneakers fun again and enjoyable for the people that are passionate about them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of that fun has been diminished by free-for-all chat groups that can quickly grow toxic or grow exploitative as moderators look to cash in on their networks, something SoleSavy hopes a more curated approach can bring back.</p>

<p>As my boss (and TC&#8217;s resident sneaker head) Matthew said in his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sneaker-enthusiast-group-solesavy-raises-2m-setting-the-stage-for-a-community-driven-commerce-boom/">write-up of SoleSavy&#8217;s seed raise</a> earlier this year:</p>
<blockquote><p>That positive community vibe is what Pralica says is SoleSavy’s long-term focus and differentiating factor that keeps the 4,000 members across the U.S. and Canada interacting with the group on a nearly daily basis … I’ve been in a dozen or so different groups focused on buying large quantities of each release to resell over the years and many of them are, at best, rowdy and at worst toxic. That’s an environment that SoleSavy wanted to stay away from, says Pralica. Instead, SoleSavy tries to court those who want to buy and wear the shoes, trade them and yes, maybe even resell personal pairs eventually to obtain and wear another grail.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company&#8217;s sizable Series A raise just months after a seed showcases that plenty of investors are intrigued by the idea of verticalized marketplaces built up around social communities, Pralica sees the funding as a chance to ignore fundraising for a while and focus on &#8220;building for the future&#8221; while identifying new opportunities in the sneakersphere.</p>
<p>SoleSavy has been pretty focused on North American sneaker heads so far, but Pralica see that hefty Series A check taking the platform into new markets, including Australia and New Zealand, United Kingdom, Singapore, Japan and broader Europe. The company also plans to use the new funding to build out its editorial network with podcasts, editorial features, original video and member events.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Search is changing. Most search engines now don&#8217;t just bring up a page of 10 search results and two ads at the top when you type in a query. Instead, Google search queries can bring up a whole range of results, and sometimes answer your questions without you ever having to click through to a page.</p>
<p>Take, for example, a search like this: &#8220;how many days until halloween.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167439" style="width: 2009px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167439" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2167439 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png" alt="Example of a featured snippet" width="1999" height="1321" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png 1999w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=768,508 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=680,449 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=1536,1015 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167439" class="wp-caption-text">A featured snippet counting down the days to Halloween.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Ryan Sammy</p></div></p>
<p>You can see that instead of displaying the top result right away, Google answers the question for you in a rich snippet. It also gives you related search queries featuring countdowns for other holidays. On the right is a knowledge panel from Wikipedia about Halloween, and below that, you’ll see the featured snippets section. These snippets will expand when clicked with answers for related questions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Featured snippets are collections of sentences or words that Google pulls directly from a webpage relevant to the search query.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Finally, after these answers to your queries and any related questions, you get to the first result. At this point, do you even need to visit the website?</p>
<p>Google search is not what it used to be. We all want to be No. 1 on the search results page, but these days, getting to that position isn’t enough. It might be worth your while to instead go after the top featured snippet position.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s a featured snippet?</h2>
<p>Featured snippets are collections of sentences or words that Google pulls directly from a webpage relevant to the search query. These snippets are displayed right below the search box and are meant to answer search queries quickly. The snippets can appear in the form of lists, how-to steps, tables, short paragraph boxes and other formats.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok announced today the launch of its <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-jump-enriching-the-tiktok-experience-with-new-integrations">Jump</a> program, which expands the app&#8217;s potential for third-party integrations. TikTok began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/tiktok-partners-with-whisk-to-pilot-a-recipe-saving-feature-on-food-videos/">beta-testing this feature</a> in February with Whisk, a recipe-sharing app, though only select creators could use the feature. Now, Jump will start rolling out to all users with an expanded slate of partners.</p>
<p>Jumps can only be built by third-party providers after being approved through <a href="http://www.tiktok.com/jump">an application process</a>. Platforms like <a href="https://www.breathwrk.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Breathwrk</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Quizlet</a>, <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">StatMuse</a> and <a href="https://tabelog.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Tabelog</a> participated in the beta test, and now, TikTok says providers like <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BuzzFeed</a>, <a href="https://www.jumprope.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jumprope</a>, <a href="https://www.irl.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IRL</a> and <a href="https://watcha.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">WATCHA</a> will begin implementing their own Jumps in the coming weeks. So, an educational creator could link to Quizlet flashcards to review a concept they explained in a TikTok, or a yoga instructor could share breathing exercises on Breathwrk. For a platform that doesn&#8217;t even let all users include a link in their bio yet, this expands the existing tools creators have to engage their audience.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168171" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168171" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2168171" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tiktokjumpgif.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="568" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168171" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TikTok is positioning Jump as a feature that propels discovery. Sean Kim, Head of Product, TikTok U.S. <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-jump-enriching-the-tiktok-experience-with-new-integrations">writes</a>, &#8220;TikTok has become a destination both to be entertained and to learn; through TikTok Jump, we&#8217;re creating that &#8216;last mile&#8217; of our community&#8217;s discovery journey and helping to spark action and deeper interaction both on and off the platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>But on other apps like Snapchat and WeChat, these lightweight third-party integrations drive e-commerce. Jump is similar to competitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/snap-turns-on-minis-bite-sized-third-party-apps-in-snapchat/">Snapchat&#8217;s Minis feature</a>, which lets you buy movie tickets via Atom, for example. Both Minis and Jump integrations can be built using HTML5. Meanwhile, WeChat facilitates <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/wechat-2020/">over $250 billion dollars</a> in annual transactions through its own mini apps — there were over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/wechat-mini-apps-200-million-users/">a million mini apps</a> on WeChat as of 2018.</p>
<p>While Instagram has been ramping up its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/instagram-launches-a-new-section-for-shopping-product-drops/">e-commerce features</a> on Reels, its TikTok competitor, it&#8217;s possible that Jump could later be used to sell items featured in a video. In December, Walmart piloted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">video shopping</a> on TikTok, which performed well enough that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">they did it again</a> in March. But for now, it seems like Jump is being used to improve user experience and deepen the platform&#8217;s relationships with third-party partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India proposed on Monday banning flash sales on e-commerce platforms and preventing their affiliate entities from being listed as sellers as the South Asian market looks to further tighten rules that could hurt the future prospects of Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart in the world’s second-largest market.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://consumeraffairs.nic.in/sites/default/files/file-uploads/latestnews/Comments_eCommerce_Rules2020.pdf">proposal</a> (PDF), unveiled by India’s Ministry of Consumer Affairs on Monday evening, comes at a time when brick-and-mortar retailers in India have ramped up their complaints to raise concerns about what they allege as unfair practices employed by Amazon and Flipkart as they expand their operations in the country.</p>
<p>In its proposal, India’s Ministry of Consumer Affairs <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1729201">said</a> that e-commerce firms should not be allowed to hold flash sales in India. These flash sales, akin to Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in the U.S., are very popular during festive season in the country. During flash sales e-commerce firms have traditionally observed the biggest spikes in customer orders as brands offer heavy discounts on their products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Certain e-commerce entities are engaging in limiting consumer choice by indulging in ‘back to back’ or ‘flash’ sales wherein one seller selling on platform does not carry any inventory or order fulfilment capability but merely places a ‘flash or back to back’ order with another seller controlled by platform. This prevents a level playing field and ultimately limits customer choice and increases prices,” the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>As it has done with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">recent IT rules</a>, India is also proposing that e-commerce firms appoint a chief compliance officer, a nodal contact person for 24&#215;7 coordination with law enforcement agencies, and officers to ensure compliance to their orders as well as a resident grievance officer for redressing of the grievances of the consumers on the e-commerce platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would ensure effective compliance with the provisions of the Act and Rules and also strengthen the grievance redressal mechanism on e-commerce entities,&#8221; the ministry said, adding that the new proposal also asks every e-commerce entity to provide government agencies with information within 72 hours &#8220;for the purposes of verification of identity, or for the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution, of offences under any law for the time being in force, or for cyber security incidents.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new proposal may also prohibit Amazon, Flipkart and other e-commerce players from running their in-house / private labels. The new proposal asks e-commerce firms to ensure that none of their related and associated parties are listed on their platforms as sellers for selling to customers directly. &#8220;Ensure that nothing is done by related parties or associated enterprises which the e-commerce entity cannot do itself,&#8221; the proposal said.</p>
<p>India does not allow e-commerce firms to hold inventory or sell items directly to consumers. To bypass this, firms have operated through a maze of joint ventures with local companies that operate as inventory-holding firms.</p>
<p>Amazon, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">invested over $6.5 billion in its India business</a>, said it was reviewing the proposed policies while Flipkart, whose <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/20/walmart-flipkart-deal-done/">majority stake Walmart bought for $16 billion</a> in 2018, had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>In a court hearing on Monday, a Flipkart lawyer said the company sees nothing wrong in offering to cut charges for sellers on its platform if they lower product prices.</p>
<p>The ministry said it is making the proposal, for which it plans to seek industry feedback over the next 15 days, after receiving &#8220;several complaints against widespread cheating and unfair trade practices being observed in e-commerce ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, the new proposal asks e-commerce firms to introduce a mechanism to identify goods on their platforms based on their country of origin and suggest alternatives to &#8220;ensure fair opportunity to domestic goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement comes at a time when Flipkart is in talks to raise as much as $3 billion and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/flipkart-in-early-talks-to-raise-1-billion-ahead-of-ipo/">explore the public markets</a>. Both Amazon and Flipkart are also the subject of an ongoing antitrust probe in India.</p>
<p>This is the second major amendment the Indian government has proposed in recent years. In 2018, too, New Delhi had proposed tougher rules for e-commerce firms that, when enforced in early 2019, left Amazon and Flipkart scrambling to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/01/amazon-flipkart-india-law/">delist hundreds of thousands of items</a> from their stores and made their investments in affiliated firms way more indirect.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s proposal comes months after Reuters, citing company documents, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-operation/">reported</a> that Amazon had given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers in India, publicly misrepresented its ties with those sellers and used them to circumvent foreign investment rules in the country.</p>
<p>At the time, the Confederation of All India Traders, an influential India trader group that represents tens of millions of brick-and-mortar retailers, had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/indian-trader-group-calls-for-ban-on-amazon-following-dodging-regulations-claims/">called on New Delhi to ban Amazon in the country</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following this morning’s announcement that Hyundai has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/hyundai-completes-deal-for-controlling-interest-in-boston-dynamics/">closed its acquisition of Boston Dynamics</a>, another automotive company has posted some robotics news. The Toyota Research Institute announcement is decidedly less earthshaking than that big deal &#8212; if anything, it’s more of a progress check on what the division has been working on.</p>
<p>Of course, incremental updates tend to be the name of the game when it comes to robotics of all sorts. This does, however, shed some interesting light on the work TRI has been doing in the home. Today the company announced some key advances to robotics it has designed to perform domestic tasks.</p>
<p>“TRI roboticists were able to train robots to understand and operate in complicated situations that confuse most other robots, including recognizing and responding to transparent and reflective surfaces in a variety of circumstances,” the Institute writes in a blog post.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>With settings like kitchens, the robots come in contact with a variety of transparent and reflective surfaces &#8212; a hurdle for traditional vision systems. Specifically in the kitchen, things like a transparent glass or reflective appliance can create an issue.</p>
<p>“To overcome this, TRI roboticists developed a novel training method to perceive the 3D geometry of the scene while also detecting objects and surfaces,” TRI Robotics VP Max Bajracharya said in <a href="https://www.tri.global/news/toyota-research-institute-reaches-new-technical-milestones-in-robotics/">a post describing the research</a>. “This combination enables researchers to use large amounts of synthetic data to train the system.” Using synthetic data also alleviates the need for time-consuming, expensive or impractical data collection and labeling.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGCwhjw-NTo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>With an aging population in its native Japan, Toyota has made eldercare a key focus in its ongoing robotics research. So it makes a lot of sense that sort of robotics tasks form a core of much of its research in the category, as well as those elements that bleed into the work it&#8217;s doing on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/toyota-partners-with-eneos-to-explore-a-hydrogen-powered-woven-city/">Woven City</a>. And certainly the company gets credit for putting in some work here, before the orchestrated appearances we’ve seen of robotics offerings from companies like Samsung.</p>

<p>“It’s not only about keeping people in their homes longer and living independently,” Bajracharya  recently told me in an interview. “That’s one aspect of it — but in Japan, in 20-30 years, the number of people who are over 65 will roughly be the same as the number of people who are under 65. That’s going to have a really interesting socioeconomic impact, in terms of the workforce. It’s probably going to be much older and we at Toyota are looking at how these people can keep doing their jobs, so they can get the fulfillment from doing their jobs or staying at home longer. We don’t want to just replace the people. We really think about how we stay human-centered and amplify people.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber has reached a deal to become the sole owner of Latin American delivery startup Cornershop, just one year after acquiring a majority stake in the company. The ride-hailing giant said <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001543151/000155278121000531/e21442_uber-8k.htm">in a regulatory filing</a> Monday that it will purchase the remaining 47% interest in Cornershop in exchange for 29 million shares. The transaction is expected to close in July.</p>
<p>Uber announced in 2019 plans to take a majority ownership in Cornershop. That transaction wasn&#8217;t completed until the third quarter of 2020 other than in Mexico, which closed in January 2021. This latest agreement, which was reached June 18 and reported Monday, will make Cornershop a wholly owned subsidiary of Uber. The deal is a logical next-step in the Uber-Cornershop relationship, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The deal suggests Uber&#8217;s bullishness in delivery hasn&#8217;t waned. With Cornershop as wholly owned subsidiary, Uber can beef up its grocery delivery options, a service made popular during the pandemic. The company started offering grocery delivery <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/uber-grocery-delivery-launches-in-latin-america-and-canada-us-to-follow-later-this-month/">in select cities</a> across Latin America, Canada and the U.S. last summer after it acquired Postmates in a deal valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/uber-takes-out-postmates/">$2.65 billion</a>. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement that the company&#8217;s grocery and new verticals business has exceeded a $3 billion annual bookings run rate for this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;That’s why we’re excited to deepen our commitment to the team at Cornershop and to support their vision as they scale globally,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Together, we will double down on the strategy of bringing same-day grocery delivery to the Uber platform worldwide.”</p>
<p>Cornershop, which is headquartered in Chile, was founded in 2015 by Oskar Hjertonsson, Daniel Undurraga and Juan Pablo Cuevas. The company expanded its operations to eight countries up and down the Americas, including Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, the U.S. and Canada. The company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/11/uber-to-acquire-grocery-delivery-startup-cornershop/">$31.7 million over four rounds of funding</a> from investors that include Accel and Jackson Square Ventures.</p>
<p>Uber wasn’t the only grocery service with its eyes on Cornershop; the startup was supposed to be acquired by Walmart in a $225 million deal, but it ultimately fell through after Mexican antitrust regulators blocked the deal from moving forward. It is unclear whether this deal will be subject to the same risks.</p>
<p>Uber faces stiff competition from grocery retailers themselves, many of whom offer delivery through partnering with startups like DoorDash or Favor Fleet.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Cornershop for comment. We will update the story if they respond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Soldier-entrepreneurs are unfortunately still a rare breed in Silicon Valley, despite the region’s origins in Cold War defense spending. While the courage and perseverance required to fight in an overseas battlefield (or the office bureaucracy on base) would seem a perfect fit for the travails of the founder, the reality is that the journey from solider to CEO is a long and arduous transition.</p>
<p>A couple of organizations have popped up over the years to make the leap easier. For instance, <a href="https://patriotbootcamp.org">Patriot Boot Camp</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/19/patriot-boot-camp-wants-to-turn-soldiers-into-entrepreneurs/">I profiled back in 2018</a>, works in the earliest days of the startup journey to help veteran founders learn the key skills of building a company and fundraising. Yet, there still remains a lack of networking and funding that particularly targeted this group of entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>That’s the opportunity that Emily McMahan and Sherman Williams, the two managing partners of <a href="https://academyinvestor.com">Academy Investor Network</a>, saw when looking at their peers at the five U.S. service academies. The firm is targeting a final first fund of $50 million, and today announced the close of its anchor investor, insurance and financial services provider USAA, which will invest $2.5 million. Prior to USAA, the fund’s first investor was <a href="https://www.scoutventures.com/">Scout Ventures</a>, which focuses on frontier tech and <a href="https://www.scoutventures.com/people">where McMahan is a venture partner</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>McMahan graduated from West Point in 2001 right as the War on Terror began. I “went really straight into the action post 9/11,” she said. From there, she pivoted into a startup targeting the federal market, before founding Capitol Post, which taught entrepreneurial skills to veterans and their spouses and also had a co-working space in northern Virginia <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2019/05/01/why-a-local-veteran-entrepreneur-nonprofit-is.html">before folding into Bunker Labs in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>“My career has always been focused around community, working with entrepreneurs, and really kind of harnessing the energy of the veteran entrepreneur community,” she said. She is based in DC, and also sits on the board of Patriot Boot Camp.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168069" style="width: 5586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168069" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2168069 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1066692060.jpg" alt="" width="5576" height="4000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1066692060.jpg 5576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1066692060.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1066692060.jpg?resize=300,215 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1066692060.jpg?resize=768,551 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1066692060.jpg?resize=680,488 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1066692060.jpg?resize=1536,1102 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1066692060.jpg?resize=2048,1469 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1066692060.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5576px) 100vw, 5576px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168069" class="wp-caption-text">The Pentagon, headquarters of the Department of Defense. I<strong>mage Credits:</strong> Jeremy Christensen/Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Williams hails from the Naval Academy, graduating in 2003 before going on four deployments in the midst of the war in Iraq, which started just weeks before his graduation. He ultimately ended up at Chicago’s Booth School, where he studied finance and pivoted his career into investment banking focused on M&amp;A. “I knew I needed to learn a lot,” he said. I “started investing and advising startups while as a banker, and then made made the flip to work with Emily to start AIN Ventures.” He’s based in New York City.</p>
<p>The firm’s first foray into venture was building an investment syndicate composed of alums of the five service academies, which was launched in June 2020. “We&#8217;ve got astronauts, we&#8217;ve got Navy SEALs,” McMahan said. “We really think that we&#8217;re very well positioned as a group, because we&#8217;ve all lived it on active duty, and now we continue to see it and continue to serve.” The syndicate has invested in a handful of deals since launching, including into <a href="https://info.polco.us">Polco</a>, an online community engagement platform for local governments, and online identity service <a href="https://www.id.me">ID.Me</a>.</p>
<p>“This is also where a lot of our service academy grads are excited to have a seat at that table and help these companies scale, connect, hire, all of those things,” McMahan said. “So we&#8217;re really excited to be on par with some of these other institutions — the Harvards, the Stanfords — who also have these types of syndicates.“</p>
<p>Williams said the goal with the syndicate was to work out the investment processes for the firm before turning toward a more traditional VC fund model. They kicked off fundraising in January.</p>
<p>The new fund has a two-track thesis of investing in veterans across industries while also selecting startups building “dual-use” technologies that are useful to the private sector and governments. “Civic technology, disaster tech — think FEMA — defense tech, obviously the military, intelligence agencies, and space tech. Things in and around climate that will affect constituents and governments,” Williams said as examples where he sees the firm investing. “We want the company, when it achieves maturity, to achieve the majority of the revenue outside the government.”</p>
<p>The firm centers its investing around the stage right after product-market fit, although since the veterans pipeline can be a real gauntlet, Williams said the firm will selectively invest at the pre-seed stage there.</p>
<p>The firm is also seeking to diversify the ranks of both venture capitalists and founders. McMahan said, “I’m a female, Sherman&#8217;s an African American, you know, even in the military, we&#8217;re sort of a unique team, and so we think we are also able to reach out to a much broader audience of underrepresented minorities, women, and groups, and we feel like we&#8217;re pretty attractive in terms of that as a team.“</p>
<p>USAA’s anchor investment is perhaps not surprising given the financial services company’s focus on active service members and veterans. It has made other investments and sponsorships around veteran entrepreneurship, including into Patriot Boot Camp. The company has also invested directly in startups such as PrecisionHawk and Coinbase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Exchange is back after its brief hiatus. <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna</a> and I have some really neat stuff planned, so stick with us every morning this week. &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></em></p>
<p>Building a consumer-facing fintech company is expensive. And if you want to build one in a sector crowded by both incumbent companies and richly funded startups, it can be <em>super</em> expensive.</p>
<p>That was the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/building-a-fintech-giant-is-very-expensive/">lesson we learned in late 2020</a> by examining operating results from a number of neobanks.</p>
<p>Neobanks are essentially software layers atop banking infrastructure, offering consumers digital-first, mobile-friendly and often lower-fee banking services. The push to rethink consumer banking is a global effort, with neobanks cropping up in essentially every market you can think of. Private investors have shown up in droves to fund competing neobanks because they have the potential to secure users &#8212; customers &#8212; that generate revenues for long periods of time.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Investors have proven more than willing to fund huge investments in growth and product at many neobanks, leading to steeply negative operating results at the unicorns. In short, while American consumer fintech Chime has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/chime-adds-485m-at-a-14-5b-valuation-claims-ebitda-profitability/">disclosed positive EBITDA</a> &#8212; an adjusted profitability metric &#8212; many neobanks that we&#8217;ve seen numbers from have demonstrated a stark inability to paint a path to profitability.</p>

<p>Recent results from Revolut that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/revolut-revenue-grew-by-57-in-2020/">TechCrunch covered earlier this morning</a> show that the company had a deeply unprofitable 2020. But if we dig into its quarterly results, there&#8217;s good news to be found. Neobanks could be maturing into their cost structure at last.</p>
<p>So today we&#8217;ll parse the key Revolut financial results and look at what we can dig up from Starling and Monzo. Perhaps the somewhat good financial news from Revolut is not merely to be found at just one neobank?</p>
<h2>Revolut&#8217;s 2020</h2>
<p>Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/romaindillet">Romain Dillet</a> has a broad look at Revolut&#8217;s business <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/revolut-revenue-grew-by-57-in-2020/">here</a>, if you would like a wider lens. We only care about its raw financial results at the moment.</p>
<p>Here are the big numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>57% <strong>revenue </strong>growth from £166 million in 2019 to £261 million in 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Gross profit </strong>growth of £123 million in 2020, up 215% from 2019.</li>
<li><strong>Gross margin</strong> of 49% in 2020, what Revolut described as nearly a doubling.</li>
<li>2020 <strong>operating loss</strong> of £122 million from £98 million in 2019.</li>
<li><strong>Total loss</strong> of £168 million in 2020, up from £107 million in 2019.</li>
</ul>
<p>The gist of these figures is that the company&#8217;s revenue growth was solid, but improving gross margins allowed its gross profit to spike in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Luxury sports car manufacturer Porsche AG is going into the battery business. The automaker said Monday it plans to open a new factory that will produce high-performance cells through a joint venture with lithium-ion battery developer Customcells.</p>
<p>Porsche invested in “the high double-digit millions” in the new joint venture, dubbed Cellforce Group GmbH, executive board member Michael Steiner told reporters in a media briefing ahead of the announcement. The factory also benefited from a €60 million ($71.4 million) investment from the German government and the state of Baden-Württemberg, where it will be located. Chemical company BASF SE was selected to supply the cathode materials.</p>
<p>The batteries will use silicon as the anode material, which Porsche says will significantly boost the energy density and their capacity to withstand high temperatures &#8212; both important variables for racing cars, which must be recharged quickly, but challenging in battery production (batteries don’t tend to like getting very hot).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For that reason, the factory will be small-scale, at least compared to other automakers such as the 35 gigawatt-hour “gigafactory” capacity at the Tesla and Panasonic joint facility in Sparks, Nevada or even its parent company VW&#8217;s plan to bring<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/volkswagen-will-bring-240-gigawatt-hours-of-battery-production-capacity-to-europe-by-2030/"> 240 GwH of production to Europe by 2030</a>. Porsche and Customcells&#8217; aim is an annual capacity of 100 megawatt-hours, or around enough batteries for 1,000 vehicles, starting in 2024. The initial workforce is expected to grow from around 13 people to up to 80 by 2025.</p>

<p>The automaker has no plans to scale the technology for use in Porsche’s more mainstream lineup of vehicles, Steiner said, though he noted that there may be a chance for higher volume in the future if the company sees a potential to bring down production costs. “In this market, we are looking for special purpose cells for high-end cars and motorsports, and this is not available in the market today,” he said.</p>
<p>It may be a challenge to scale this technology to passenger vehicles. The silicon anode-based cell chemistry has not shown the capacity to function in very cold conditions or to remain stable over many charging cycles, Porsche said in a statement. But it wouldn’t be the first time that a Porsche vehicle benefited from technology developed for the race track: its leading electric model <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/porsche-taycan/">Taycan</a> borrowed many of its technical features from the Porsche 919 Hybrid racing car.</p>
<p>Although the first vehicles to use these batteries will be Porsche-made, Steiner said the technology will be made available to other brands in the Volkswagen Group, like Lamborghini or Bugatti.</p>
<p>“The battery cell is the combustion chamber of the future,” Porsche CEO Oliver Blume said in a statement Monday. “This joint venture allows us to position ourselves at the forefront of global competition in developing the most powerful battery cell and make it the link between the unmistakable Porsche driving experience and sustainability. This is how we shape the future of the sports car.”</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminhiggins/">Ben Higgins </a>is a distinguished software engineer at cybersecurity company <a href="https://www.extrahop.com/">ExtraHop</a> and has extensive experience in protocols, parsing, encryption, security, systems and performance engineering. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration this spring announced <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">an executive order</a> designed to strengthen government cybersecurity defenses in the wake of several major recent hacks, including the SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange Server and Pulse Secure incidents, which impacted numerous federal agencies and private companies. The order’s importance was underscored by the DarkSide ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline just a few weeks later.</p>
<p>One key element of the cyber executive order is a “software bill of materials” (SBOM) that vendors would be required to provide as part of the federal procurement process. The SBOM would detail the exact software components utilized in a given product, including any open-source components, making it much easier and faster for federal agencies to determine whether they are subject to a vulnerability uncovered in one of these components.</p>
<p>The SBOM is an important step in shoring up federal cybersecurity, but it’s not enough. Understanding the software components included in various products will help agency security teams react more quickly when vulnerabilities come to light, but in other scenarios, like SolarWinds-style supply-chain attacks that surreptitiously insert software components, its impact is limited.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Establishing standards at the federal level for disclosures about software products will benefit cybersecurity in the private sector, as well as improve the overall security of the software supply chain.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That’s why the Biden administration should extend the cyber executive order to include not only an SBOM, but also “behavior transparency.”</p>
<p>Transparency requirements are not a new concept in technology. Certificate transparency (CT) is a public ledger of all certificates issued by any public certificate authority (CA) that provides a framework for monitoring and auditing CA activity, while Apple’s recently announced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency">App Tracking Transparency</a> allows users to see what activity apps are tracking and opt out. Behavior transparency is a proposed application of this concept to known software behaviors.</p>
<p>The purpose of a behavior transparency framework is to enumerate the expected actions of interest that a given piece of software will take on a device or on the network. This helps security analysts distinguish between expected noise and indications of compromise. This, in turn, can give security teams an advantage in identifying the exploitation of unknown vulnerabilities in any proprietary or open-source software.</p>
<p>The good news is that the enumeration of common software behaviors is already a standard industry practice for external network activity. Most major software vendors, including <a href="https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Other_Topics/Upstream_Firewall_Rules_for_Cloud_Connectivity">Meraki</a>, <a href="https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&amp;id=KB93324">McAfee</a>, <a href="https://community.tenable.com/s/article/Why-do-I-see-connections-to-chk-l2">Tenable</a>, <a href="https://support.goto.com/webinar/help/optimal-firewall-configuration-g2w060025">LogMeIn/GoToMeeting</a>, and my own company, <a href="https://docs.extrahop.com/current/eh-cloud-services/#open-access-to-cloud-services">ExtraHop</a>, already publish lists of common product behaviors. Even <a href="https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/orionplatform/content/core-solarwinds-port-requirements.htm">SolarWinds has documentation</a> describing its network behaviors.</p>
<p>But the Biden administration can help effect critical changes that improve upon this industry practice and improve the overall security posture for public and private organizations alike.</p>
<h2>Establish standards for behavior transparency</h2>
<p>First, the cyber executive order should form a working group in partnership with representative software and security software vendors, as well as organizations such as <a href="https://www.mitre.org/">MITRE</a>, to create standards for the types of network activity that must be included for full behavior transparency.</p>
<p>At a minimum, this should include things like external network destinations, internal network connection behavior with other software components, and, where applicable, a list of associated network ports and the purposes for which those ports are used. The behavior transparency framework should also include other network behavior, especially (but not limited to) anything that looks like scanning or reconnaissance behavior.</p>
<h2>Make behavioral data available to common security tools</h2>
<p>Second, the cyber executive order should mandate that known software behaviors be published in a machine-readable format such as JSON or CSV that could be ingested into common security products like security information and event management (SIEM), firewalls, endpoint protection platforms, network detection and response, and change management tools.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RRizKLr0g9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/enterprise-security-attackers-are-one-password-away-from-your-worst-day/">Enterprise security attackers are one password away from your worst day</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Enterprise security attackers are one password away from your worst day&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/enterprise-security-attackers-are-one-password-away-from-your-worst-day/embed/#?secret=RRizKLr0g9" data-secret="RRizKLr0g9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This is a crucial distinction from the current model, in which most behaviors are listed on a webpage or in a PDF that isn’t machine-readable. With this change, common security tools could use that machine-readable behavioral data to help build baselines for activity within an organization to more quickly and accurately detect deviations that indicate compromise. Meraki is already doing this by providing its list in CSV format.</p>
<h2>Centralize access to behavioral information</h2>
<p>Third, the cyber executive order should establish a clearinghouse for behavior transparency data, administered by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency or another appropriate federal agency. The status quo is to hunt around on a vendor’s website, consult their in-product documentation or open a support case to find out about network behavior. If the information provided is incorrect, that’s also a support case.</p>
<p>The current decentralized approach is deeply problematic. Unfettered network access for enterprise software products introduces substantial security risk &#8212; Zero Trust frameworks have been established to prevent precisely this &#8212; but typical practitioners do not have the time or expertise to individually track down the expected behaviors of each piece of enterprise software they have in the environment. Without centralized access to behavior transparency data, even the best Zero Trust implementations will have major gaps surrounding enterprise software.</p>
<p>A clearinghouse would provide a centralized repository for behavior transparency data, organized by company, product and product version. A forum like GitHub is an ideal mechanism for such a clearinghouse, providing a widely used, centralized repository for this information.</p>
<h2>Streamline feedback between users and vendors</h2>
<p>Fourth, the clearinghouse should include a mechanism by which product users can easily provide feedback to software vendors. Feedback can be in the form of issues or even pull requests, though the companies should be involved in approving changes. This way, deficiencies in the behaviors can be pointed out in a public forum. Most deficiencies will be for reasons like a product update that wasn’t reflected in the behavior transparency data, though as time goes on, companies will ideally make it a practice to make sure these are kept up to date. But there will also be true positives found.</p>
<h2>Protecting the software supply chain with behavior transparency</h2>
<p>The SolarWinds software supply chain attack, first disclosed in December 2020, illustrates and underscores the importance of behavior transparency. Prior to December 11, when FireEye first identified the vulnerability in the SolarWinds Orion software, at least two other cybersecurity companies, <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/solarstorm-supply-chain-attack-timeline/">Palo Alto</a> and <a href="https://fidelissecurity.com/threatgeek/data-protection/ongoing-analysis-solarwinds-impact/">Fidelis</a>, identified that their SolarWinds installations communicating with the attacker-controlled “stage 1” avsvmcloud[.]com domain. Palo Alto observed and blocked additional malicious behavior, but at the time neither company determined that the communication with avsvmcloud[.]com itself was suspect. That’s due in large part to the notorious amount of “noise” involved in looking at network data.</p>
<p>But if more organizations had ready access to SolarWinds’ behavior transparency data, as well as a forum in which to compare deviations from the baseline, things might have played out differently.</p>
<p>SolarWinds Orion doesn’t reach out to a lot of external destinations, so when the first stage of the supply chain attack started hitting subdomains off of “appsync-api.eu-west-1.avsvmcloud[.]com,” an analyst on a threat hunt running a SIEM query, or a machine-learning-based EDR or NDR product armed with that information, might have more quickly determined that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Likewise, a low-friction public feedback mechanism could have tipped off SolarWinds and the industry that what seemed like noise in isolation (“appsync-api, seems legit?”) was actually something far more nefarious.</p>
<p>The cyber executive order, alongside the sanctions on Russia, are strong early indications that the Biden administration intends to take a far more proactive approach to cybersecurity. Critical to the success of these efforts will be the partnership the administration forges with private-sector technology providers. Establishing standards at the federal level for disclosures about software products will benefit cybersecurity in the private sector, as well as improve the overall security of the software supply chain.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The incredible success of the cloud business applications space in recent years has driven up valuations and fundraising across all stages of venture investment. That has in turn increased VC fund sizes, led to massive cloud IPOs and brought a new cadre of investors to further fuel the fire.</p>
<p>The median Series A raised by cloud companies these days is about $8 million and can often go well above $10 million, according to PitchBook data from the first quarter of 2021. Series Cs now routinely include secondary capital for founders, and many Series Ds are above $100 million with valuations in the billions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			There is a widening gap in the funding continuum between angel/seed funding at inception and the new-age $10 million Series A at $2 million in ARR.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Such an influx of capital and interest has upended many structures and long-held norms about how startups are funded. Venture funds continue to grow and must write larger checks, but ever-higher valuations force many firms to hunt for opportunities earlier. The VC alphabet soup has been spilled, making A rounds look like Bs used to, and the Bs seem like the Cs of old.</p>
<p>Which begs an interesting question: Is the seed round the new Series A?</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Seed rounds have certainly grown — averaging about $3 million nowadays from around $1 million to $2 million previously — but otherwise, seed investments are the same as before and remain very different from Series As.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our live show is this week! And we&#8217;re very excited about it! Details <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/register-to-watch-a-livestream-recording-of-equity/">here</a>, and you can register <a href="https://hopin.com/events/tc-equity-live">here</a>. It&#8217;s free, of course, so swing by and hang with us.</p>
<p>Back on theme, we had a lot to get through this morning, so inside the show you can find the following and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Chinese cryptocurrency clampdown is a big damn deal: With lots of the nation&#8217;s mining capacity heading offline, there&#8217;s a scramble to relocate rigs and generally figure out what a crypto market sans China might look like.</li>
<li>In the wake of the news, the value of cryptocurrencies fell. As did shares of Coinbase this morning in pre-market trading.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">Facebook&#8217;s Clubhouse rival is out</a>. The American social giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">follows Spotify</a> into the live-audio market. You have to give it to modern software companies, who thought that they could be both leading tech shops and Kinko&#8217;s clones at the same time?</li>
<li>Revolut is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/revolut-revenue-grew-by-57-in-2020/">unprofitable as hell</a> but increasingly less so. That could be good news for fintech as a whole.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/20/crypto-finance-startup-amber-group-raises-100m-at-1b-valuation/">Amber Group raised $100 million</a>; <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/forto-raises-240-million-in-funding-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2-at-1-2-billion-valuation-301316198.html">Forto raised $240 million</a>.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hyundai this morning announced that it has completed its acquisition of Boston Dynamics. The deal, which values the innovative robotics company at $1.1 billion, was announced in late-2020. The companies have not disclosed any future financial details.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The South Korean automotive giant now owns a controlling interest in Boston Dynamics, previously belonging to SoftBank. The Japanese investment company was effectively a transitional owner, purchasing Boston Dynamics from Google, which owned the company for just over three years.</span></p>
<p>While its time with Softbank wasn’t much longer than its stint under Google/Alphabet X, Boston Dynamics saw the commercialization of its first two products since launching nearly 30 years ago. The company brought its quadrupedal robot Spot to market and this year announced the (still upcoming) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/this-is-boston-dynamics-next-commercial-robot/">launch of Stretch</a>, an updated version of its warehouse robot, Handle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a recent appearance at TechCrunch’s Mobility event, Hyundai’s Ernestine Fu discussed the planned acquisition of an 80% controlling interest in the company. Fu noted that Hyundai&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/hyundai-shrinks-its-walking-car-robot-to-carry-cargo-get-rides-from-drones/">New Horizon Studios</a> has previewed multiple “walking” car concepts that look poised to build on decades of Boston Dynamics research.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hyundai shrinks its &#8216;walking car&#8217; robot to carry cargo, get rides from drones&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/hyundai-shrinks-its-walking-car-robot-to-carry-cargo-get-rides-from-drones/embed/#?secret=qsjxNoJ3iF" data-secret="qsjxNoJ3iF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“With New Horizon Studios, the mandate is reimagining what you can do when you combine robotics with traditional wheeled locomotion, like walking robots and walking vehicles,” Fu told TechCrunch. “Obviously the technology that [Boston Dynamics] has put together plays a key role in enabling those sorts of concepts to come to life.”</p>
<p>As it has changed hands over the years, Boston Dynamics has long insisted on maintaining its own research wing, which has given us less commercial technology, like the humanoid robot, Atlas. How this will function under the umbrella of Hyundai remains to be seen, though the company does seem to have a vested interest in maintaining a forward-looking approach.</p>
<p>“We and Hyundai share a view of the transformational power of mobility and look forward to working together to accelerate our plans to enable the world with cutting-edge automation, and to continue to solve the world’s hardest robotics challenges for our customers,&#8221; Boston Dynamics CEO Rob Playter said when the deal was announced.</p>

<p>The platform licenses music to high-profile names for advertising, films, TV, gaming and the like, including Disney, Netflix, Apple, Coca-Cola, Amazon and Google. It hosts songs from some 600,000 musicians/songwriters/rights holders.</p>
<p>The service hasn’t had any issue spending its funding to date. Earlier this month, it announced the<a href="https://www.adweek.com/agencies/b2b-licensing-platform-songtradr-acquires-creative-music-agency-massivemusic/"> acquisition of creative agency MassiveMusic</a>. Other acquisitions made in the past year include Cuesongs, Song Zu, Pretzel and Tunefind.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company says the new funding will go toward even more M&amp;As, new products and an increase in global headcount. The company is headquartered in LA, but also has offices in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<p>“Songtradr is rapidly accelerating as we continue to develop our tech-enabled B2B music ecosystem and integrate our new acquisitions,” CEO Paul Wiltshire said in a press release. “Attracting such a blue-chip investor base into this round further endorses our vision of the future music industry in this rapidly evolving digital world, providing a strong foundation for the future.”</p>
<p>Wiltshire adds that the company saw a 100% y-o-y revenue growth for 2020.</p>
