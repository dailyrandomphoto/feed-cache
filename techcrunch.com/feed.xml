										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Squad used to be an app that connected people with similar interests for in-person meetups. Then the coronavirus pandemic hit. While most social apps thrived under these conditions &#8212; people craved digital connection more than ever &#8212; Squad couldn’t operate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder <a href="https://www.isawatson.com/">Isa Watson</a> didn’t know how long the world would be in shutdown. Instead of waiting for a return to normalcy, she shifted the scope of the app entirely.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="https://www.withyoursquad.com/">Squad</a> relaunches as an audio-based social app that aims to help users deepen their relationship with their existing circle of close friends. Squad is an audio-only app, but don’t worry &#8212; it’s not another Clubhouse wannabe. Instead, it functions as a news feed of voice message updates from your closest friends, which expire after 24 hours.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can add up to twelve friends to your “squad,” and once you post an update, your squad members can emoji react or send a private voice message in response &#8212; these also expire after a day, encouraging users to be more open about what they share. Soon, Squad will support phone calls, but there currently isn’t functionality for group calls or group audio messaging. But, users might be incentivized to talk on the phone via Squad rather than a typical call, since you can add a title to your call. That way, your squad member knows why you’re calling before they pick up. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168416" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168416" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2168416" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-3.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168416" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Squad</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a big gap in the social landscape, because most of the tools are discovery platforms, broadcast platforms, and personal branding platforms,” Watson said. “There’s a huge opportunity for us to come in and help people maintain stronger connections with the people that they enjoy the most.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posting a voice update feels more genuine than a curated Instagram shot or a crafted Facebook status update (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/is-facebook-dead-to-gen-z/">Facebook is decidedly uncool</a> among Gen Z and millennials). As the popularity of apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/amid-controversy-dispo-confirms-series-a-funding-high-profile-advisors-and-investors/">Dispo</a> show, young people are responding well to ephemeral, authentic social media experiences. But the audio-only medium could be a hard sell for people who aren’t already sending voice messages on WhatsApp or iMessage. However, while Squad’s initial rollout will be domestic, there’s great potential for an app like this outside of the US, where <a href="https://in.mashable.com/culture/11736/if-youre-not-voice-messaging-youre-missing-out-heres-how-to-do-it-right">voice messaging is more popular</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of the conversations that would happen on text message are now happening in an asynchronous audio type of way,” Watson added. “So we expect that to continue to penetrate further into our habits.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watson raised a $3.5 million seed round in 2019, and she was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/06/raising-vc-in-silicon-valley-as-a-female-poc/">featured on TechCrunch</a> with advice on raising venture capital as a woman of color in Silicon Valley. Despite changing the direction of her app, her investors &#8212; which include Michael Dearing (Harrison Metal), Aaron Levie (Box), Katrina Lake (StichFix), Jen Rubio (Away), and Christian Butterfield (Flickr) &#8212; remain supportive. Watson secured another million dollars of funding after the seed round, bringing Squad’s funding to a total of $4.5 million to date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One thing [the investors] said to me was, ‘Isa, you’ve been talking about this shift in social for years now, and people told you you were crazy, that social was all figured out and there was nothing that was going to happen,’” Watson said. “Now, people are buying into that change.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168418" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168418" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2168418" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Squad-App-Screenshot-2.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168418" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Squad</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Squad isn’t a Clubhouse competitor, the rise of audio-only media is a good sign for the app’s ability to crack a saturated social market (so many social apps are trying to compete with Clubhouse, it’s a miracle we don’t yet have audio-only Tinder speed dating). In Squad’s beta test, 87.5% of users completed the onboarding process. Still, Squad falls victim to the same accessibility issues that plague Clubhouse and many of its clones. As of yet, Squad doesn’t support captioning, though Watson says this is something the company has discussed and hopes to implement down the road. Not only could captioning broaden Squad’s audience, but it could also further differentiate the app from messaging giants like iMessage and WhatsApp. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, if you’re someone who loves to send voice messages in your group chats, you might want to get your friends on Squad. Currently, the app is invite-only with a waitlist. Once you’re off the waitlist, you get three invites. If you post for five days straight, you get three more invites, and if someone you invited signs up, you get two more invites as well. This continues until you round out your twelve-member squad. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might well have a sleep app that tracks your sleep. I use <a href="https://www.sleepcycle.com/">Sleep Cycle</a>, and have found it has started to even tell me when I cough during the night. It turns out you can run machine learning over how you might cough in the night, to detect changes in the way you cough. That data could inform people with ongoing respiratory illnesses and help them manage their health.</p>
<p>This is part of the idea behind NuvoAir, which uses both an app to listen to your night-time coughing and other health data to do just that.</p>
<p>The Boston-based startup has now raised $12 million in a Series A funding led by London-based AlbionVC, </p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Perhaps because the COVID-19 pandemic made people more aware of respiratory complaints, NuvoAir claims it experienced 500% growth in the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>The round was also participated in by KAYA (formerly Enern), Amino Collective and existing shareholders Spiltan, Industrifonden and Novartis Pharma AG (dRx Capital).</p>
<p>How NuvoAir ai works is by combining the data from a Bluetooth-enabled spirometer that remotely monitors lung function; a sensor that attaches to asthma and COPD inhalers; and an integration with Fitbit devices. It also includes data from <a href="https://www.nuvoair.com/blog/nuvoair-home-platform-expands-to-include-cough-data">NuvoAir Cough</a>, which assesses changes in nighttime coughing.</p>
<p>Its business model is enabling health plans, insurance companies, and healthcare systems to reduce the cost of managing their most severe respiratory patients, and also managing the care they provide.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it’s able to be used in the clinical trial business, where it licenses the technology to pharma companies or contract research organizations on a per user basis.</p>
<p>NuvoAir says over 500 million people globally suffer from chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). And it costs around $300 billion a year to manage these conditions.  The company claims its solution reduces urgent consultations by more than 39%.</p>
<p>In some way, NuvoAir is comparable to companies like Livongo (tracks Diabetes, raised $235M) and Omada Health (tracks chronic illness, raised $256.5M). All these companies are using increasing amounts of data about our health to manage ongoing illnesses.</p>
<p>The funding will be used to accelerate the expansion of the NuvoAir digital care platform in the US and Europe; advance the development of new products and services; and support NuvoAir’s partner and customer base for decentralized clinical trials around the world.</p>
<p>Lorenzo Consoli, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of NuvoAir told me: “As a child, I suffered from severe asthma. I was hospitalized a few times and my parents were really scared when that happened. My grandmother died because of COPD and other family members, unfortunately, had severe respiratory conditions as well. On top of that, my young son has asthma. So I have naturally been drawn to respiratory health and have always felt the current health systems are not designed to help patients on a day-to-day basis, but only when patients end up in the hospital, which is always too late. But honestly, it was only when, by chance, in 2012 I joined the digital health team of Novartis Respiratory Franchise that I realized how much technology and healthcare were meant to be together. It was an eye-opener for me to realize that certain digital biomarkers could tell whether patients were responding to treatment or predict whether they might be hospitalized&#8230; Equipped with those insights and with my prior experience as a patient, I decided in 2016 to take on the challenge of improving respiratory health, and NuvoAir was born.”</p>
<p>Dr. Christoph Ruedig, Partner at AlbionVC said: “We&#8217;re proud to be able to support NuvoAir, one of the few digital health companies active in both Europe and the US. The company has built an impressive respiratory disease management ecosystem with strong clinical evidence and a scalable care model that benefits patients, payers and providers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.g2.com/">G2</a>, a company that provides an online software review and information database, announced that it has raised a $157 million Series D. Per a release the company shared with TechCrunch in advance of its news, G2 is now worth more than $1 billion, making it a unicorn in modern parlance.</p>
<p>Permira led the round via its growth fund, while prior venture capital firms IVP, Emergence, and Accel also contributed. The investment also included capital from LinkedIn, which previously invested, and corporate venture dollars from both HubSpot and Salesforce.</p>
<p>The round caught our eye not due to its scale &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/there-have-never-been-more-100m-fintech-rounds-than-right-now/">nine-figure rounds are a daily occurrence in today&#8217;s super-heated venture capital market</a> &#8212; but due to the interesting position that G2 and its rivals occupy in the technology space. They provide a guide of sorts to various software niches, not only exposing a number of competing services in a single space, but also some signal about what service might be a good pick.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/">immensely deep</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/atlantas-singleops-raises-6m-for-its-outdoor-care-focused-software-business/">immensely wide</a> software market, offering potential buying entities &#8212; all companies, in other words &#8212; directions when it comes to software buying decisions is a position of power. And one that comes with a unique set of challenges.</p>
<p>G2 cannot simply provide lists of competing software products and user reviews. It needs to command a position of trust; if its users are worried that commercial interests are clouding its ratings and lists, the company&#8217;s core product could be compromised.</p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s what TechCrunch asked G2 CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/godardabel?lang=en">Godard Abel</a> to discuss.</p>
<p>In response to our question regarding balancing G2&#8217;s commercial interests and review purity, Abel said that &#8220;whether a software vendor pays G2 or not has no impact on their rating on G2 and their placement in our category rankings which are 100% algorithmic and data-driven.&#8221; That&#8217;s a good start.</p>
<p>Abel went on to say that G2 verifies all reviews, checks the &#8220;business identity&#8221; of reviewers via their online profiles, and uses &#8220;NLP and AI to score and validate all reviews including preventing any reviews by competitors or employees of a vendor.&#8221; And, the CEO added, G2 has humans in the loop for verification as well.</p>
<p>The process seems reasonable, but the company and its rivals like <a href="https://www.capterra.com/">Capterra</a> will need to manage market trust as they continue to scale.</p>
<p>On that front, the CEO expanded a bit on the growth metrics that it disclosed as part of its release. In that document the company said that it added &#8220;700 paying customers for its Marketing Solutions in the past 12 months.&#8221; TechCrunch wanted to know what percent growth that number represented, and what portion of G2&#8217;s revenues come from that particular business line.</p>
<p>Per Abel, the customer number represented a 45% growth rate, and that that &#8220;piece of [its] business represents the bulk of [its] current revenue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parsing that a little, seeing 45% customer growth in a majority revenue line implies healthy growth. We lack several data points that we&#8217;d need to convert that customer growth figure into revenue expansion itself, sadly.</p>
<p>With lots of new cash in the bank, G2 has plenty of space to keep growing. Its CEO highlighted international investment as a place where he intends to invest, citing &#8220;exceptionally strong growth across Europe and Asia as our international software buyer traffic and revenue have been nearly doubling.&#8221; And Abel said that his company will also &#8220;accelerate&#8221; its coverage of the software market with its new capital, along with investments into data work to improve G2&#8217;s recommendation engine.</p>
<p>G2 itself is now valued like a company that&#8217;s on an IPO path, which means that the standards we&#8217;ll hold it to have reached their zenith.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Time is your most valuable asset &#8212; as the saying goes &#8212; and today a startup called <a href="https://memory.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memory.ai</a>, which is building AI-based productivity tools to help you with your own time management, is announcing some funding to double down on its ambitions: it wants not only to help manage your time, but to, essentially, provide ways to use it better in the future.</p>
<p>The startup, based out of Oslo, Norway, initially made its name with an app called <a href="https://memory.ai/timely" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timely</a>, a tool for people to track time spent doing different tasks. aimed not just at people who are quantified self geeks, but those who need to track time for practical reasons, such as consultants or others who work on the concept of billable hours. Timely has racked up 500,000 users since 2014, including more than 5,000 paying businesses in 160 countries.</p>
<p>Now, Memory.ai has raised $14 million as it gears up to launch its next apps, <a href="https://memory.ai/dewo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dewo</a> (pronounced &#8220;De-Voh&#8221;), an app that is meant to help people do more &#8220;deep work&#8221; by learning about what they are working on and filtering out distractions to focus better; and <a href="https://memory.ai/glue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glue</a>, described as a knowledge hub to help in the creative process. Both are due to be released later in the year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is being led by local investors Melesio and Sanden, with participation from Investinor, Concentric and SNÖ Ventures, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/17/memory-timely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed Memory.ai previously</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Productivity apps&#8221; has always been something of a nebulous category in the world of connected work. They can variously cover any kind of collaboration management software ranging from Asana and Jira through to Slack and Notion; or software that makes doing an existing work task more efficiently than you did it before (eg Microsoft has described all of what goes into Microsoft 365 &#8212; Excel, Word, Powerpoint, etc. &#8212; as &#8220;productivity apps&#8221;); or, yes, apps like those from Memory.ai that aim to improve your concentration or time management.</p>
<p>These days, however, it feels like the worlds of AI and advances in mobile computing are increasingly coming together to evolve that concept once again.</p>
<p>If the first wave of smartphone communications and the apps that are run on smartphone devices &#8212; social, gaming, productivity, media, information, etc. &#8212; have led to us getting pinged by a huge amount of data from lots of different places, all of the time, then could it be that the second wave is quite possibly going to usher in a newer wave of tools to handle all that better, built on the premise that not everything is of equal importance? No-mo FOMO? We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>In any case, some bigger platform players also helping to push the agenda of what productivity means in this day and age.</p>
<p>For example, in Apple&#8217;s recent preview of iOS 15 (due to come out later this year) the company gave a supercharge to its existing &#8220;do not disturb&#8221; feature on its phones, where it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-refines-ios-15-notifications-with-focus-summary-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed off a new Focus mode</a>, letting users customize how and when they want to receive notifications from which apps, and even which apps they want to have displayed, all organized by different times of day (eg work time), place, calendar items, and so on.</p>

It feels, in any case, like it could be the start of something.</p>
<p>And, serendipitously &#8212; or maybe because this is some kind of zeitgeist &#8212; this is also playing<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> into what Memory.ai has built and is building. </span></p>
<p>Mathias Mikkelsen, the Oslo-based founder of Memory.ai, first came up for his idea for Timely (which had also been the original name of the whole startup) when he was working as a designer in the ad industry, one of those jobs that needed to track what he was working on, and for how long, in order to get paid.</p>
<p>He said he knew the whole system as it existed was inefficient: &#8220;I just thought it was insane how cumbersome and old it was. But at the same time how important it was for the task,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The guy had an entrepreneurial itch that he was keen to scratch, and this idea would become the salve to help him. Mikkelsen was so taken with building a startup around time management, that he sold his apartment in Oslo and moved himself to San Francisco to be where he believed was the epicenter of startup innovation. He tells me he lived off the proceeds of his flat for two years &#8220;in a closet&#8221; in a hacker house, bootstrapping Timely, until eventually getting into an accelerator (500 Startups) and subsequently starting to raise money. He eventually moved back to Oslo after two years to continue growing the business, as well as to live somewhere a little more spacious.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s big technical breakthrough with Timely was to figure out an efficient way of tracking time for different tasks, not just time worked on anything, without people having to go through a lot of data entry.</p>
<p>The solution: to integrate with a person&#8217;s computer, plus a basic to-do schedule for a day or week, and then match up which files are open when to determine how long one works for one client or another. Phone or messaging conversations, for the moment, are not included, and neither are the contents of documents &#8212; just the titles of them. Nor is data coming from wearable devices, although you could see how that, too, might prove useful.</p>
<p>The basic premise is to be personalised, so managers and others cannot use Timely to track exactly what people are doing, although they can track and bill for those billable hours. All this is important, as it also will feed into how DeWo and Glue will work.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s big conceptual breakthrough came around the same time: Getting time tracking or any productivity right &#8220;has never been a UI problem,&#8221; Mikkelsen said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a human nature problem.&#8221; This is where the AI comes in, to nudge people towards something they identify as important, and nudge them away from work that might not contribute to that. Tackling bigger issues beyond time are essential to improving productivity overall, which is why Memory.ai now wants to extend to apps for carving out time for deep thinking and creative thinking.</p>
<p>While it might seem to be a threat that a company like Apple has identified the same time management predicament that Memory.ai has, and is looking to solve that itself, Mikkelsen is not fazed. He said he thinks of Focus as not unlike Apple&#8217;s work on Health: there will be ways of feeding information into Apple&#8217;s tool to make it work better for the user, and so that will be Memory.ai&#8217;s opportunity to hopefully grow, not cannibalize, its own audience with Timely and its two new apps. It is, in a sense, a timely disruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;Memory’s proven software is already redefining how businesses around the world track, plan and manage their time. We look forward to working with the team to help new markets profit from the efficiencies, insights and transparency of a Memory-enabled workforce,&#8221; said Arild Engh, a partner at Melesio, in a statement.</p>
<p>Kjartan Rist,  a partner at Concentric, added: “We continue to be impressed with Memory’s vision to build and launch best-in-class products for the global marketplace. The company is well on its way to becoming a world leader in workplace productivity and collaboration, particularly in light of the remote and hybrid working revolution of the last 12 months. We look forward to supporting Mathias and the team in this exciting new chapter.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Entrepreneur<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuljeev-singh-1299a657/"> Kuljeev Singh</a> has had a three-course meal in the restaurant business. He was an angel investor in ChefHero, a part-time owner in an Australian-style meat pie shop, and now, is the founder of <a href="https://www.getresq.com/">ResQ</a>, a startup that helps restaurants repair and service their equipment through contractor work.</p>
<p>Sitting at multiple seats at the table showed Singh the “unfortunate reality of what it takes to run a restaurant. Weeks into buying that meat pie shop, Singh watched tens of thousands of dollars burn due to failing equipment and contractor issues.</p>
<p>“I realized [that] I have so much support at the front of the house to drive revenue to the door, but I have no technology to support the back of the house,” he said. Singh soon realized that his pain point was shared by many other restaurant owners, which seeded the idea for ResQ, a startup all about optimizing the back of the house, or non-customer facing, operation for restaurants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ResQ announced today that it has raised $7.5 million in seed funding led by Homebrew, Golden Ventures, and Inovia Capital. Participating angel investors include Nilam Ganenthiran, president at Instacart; Gokul Rajaram, Doordash executive and board member of Pinterest and Coinbase, as well as customers, including Soul Foods, a global franchisee of Yum! Brands. ResQ has now raised $9 million in known venture capital to date.</p>
<p>The capital will primarily help ResQ double or triple its 60-person team across engineering, sales, and operation roles. The company will also earmark money toward launching in new markets, building atop its current presence in San Francisco, LA, Dallas, Chicago, and Phoenix.</p>
<h2>SaaS-enabled marketplace</h2>
<p>ResQ’s business is split into two parts: a software platform and contractor marketplace.</p>
<p>The platform allows restaurants to request, manage, and pay for a service that they need done, from plumbing issues to electrical mishaps. ResQ claims it can save restaurants between 10-30% in annual repairs by offering competitive rates, and faster communication and hiring loops. It charges a monthly SaaS fee per rooftop to a restaurant group.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168513" style="width: 638px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168513" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2168513" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png" alt="" width="628" height="629" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png 1315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=768,769 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Square_MockUp4.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168513" class="wp-caption-text">ResQ product mock-up.</p></div></p>
<p>The software layer sits on top of ResQ’s contractor marketplace, which is essentially a supply of geographic-specific workers with a variety of specialties that can come to do repairs or management. In exchange for providing contractors with work, ResQ takes a portion of revenue they make from each service. Singh sees the marketplace business of ResQ as a differentiator from incumbents or startup competitors such as ServiceChannel.</p>
<p>“You don’t just need a fancy-looking piece of software,” Singh said. “You need a product that can manage vendors, that can make sure they show up on time, that can make sure that they&#8217;re not overcharging, so that’s why we&#8217;re a SaaS enabled marketplace in the background.” By owning the supply side of the repair market, ResQ can have more precision when meeting demand and understanding its end customer.</p>
<p>Of course, a challenge with any marketplace is balancing and sourcing a high-quality supply. ResQ has over 700 contractors on its platform right now, but it needs to continue building them up in order to meet needs and get restaurant services on time. Singh said that a majority of its contractor supply comes from its restaurant customers bringing on preferred partners to their platform. ResQ then backfills, he said, any gaps in supply or if there are any specialties that are missing. While that process may be convenient for now, the startup could eventually scale &#8211; and sweeten the deal &#8211; by generating its own supply of contractors.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hunterwalk">Hunter Walk</a>, partner at <a href="https://homebrew.co/">Homebrew</a>, thinks that ResQ could eventually use its positioning as a marketplace to bring on edtech and fintech services to contractors. For example, it has plans to eventually turn into a skills provider to train and place local talent. ResQ also wants to turn into a &#8220;business in a box&#8221; for these contractors, helping them grow their business through payment and billing support.</p>
<p>“For me that&#8217;s the difference between ‘you&#8217;re just making things more efficient’ versus ‘you’re also giving some percentage of your worker base the chance to think in new ways about the services they provide,” Walk said. &#8220;If you&#8217;re just thinking about it as an as a optimization algorithm, then you&#8217;re never really going to get into the &#8216;what can I do to help make these people&#8217;s lives better&#8217; and those are where some of the upside of the economics live as well.&#8221; He noted that Singh’s experience, and ethos as a founder, will lead to ResQ solving problems more holistically and humanly.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168512" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168512" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2168512" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg" alt="Resq-kuljeev-singh" width="580" height="870" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESQHelps_Paramount_FrontLine_1.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168512" class="wp-caption-text">ResQ founder Kuljeev Singh</p></div></p>
<h2>The market</h2>
<p>Even with successful operations, margins can be razor-thin in the restaurant industry. This reality puts any startup in the restaurant tech industry at risk: when costs need to be cut, SaaS tools could be the first to go. Toast, for example, initially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/restaurant-management-platform-toast-cuts-50-of-staff/">cut 50% of its staff</a> due to the economic impact of the pandemic.</p>
<p>For ResQ, the pandemic created new urgency around rebuilding tech-forward restaurants, Singh said.</p>
<p>“We started building a new paradigm to our product and transitioned from a transactional marketplace mobile only focused on smaller restaurants, to a fully SaaS product focused on multi-unit operators powered by a local marketplace,” Singh said. Surely enough, the company’s revenue grew 750% over the past year.</p>
<p>To date, ResQ has worked with over 3,000 restaurant groups including KFC, Taco Bell, and Tim Hortons. With millions in the bank, let&#8217;s hope that number grows and it continues to find ways to grow its back of the house footprint.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EU antitrust authorities are finally taking a broad and deep look into Google&#8217;s adtech stack and role in the online ad market &#8212; <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3143">confirming today</a> that they&#8217;ve opened a formal investigation.</p>
<p>Google has already been subject to three major EU antitrust enforcements over the past five years &#8212; against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/">Google Shopping</a> (2017), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">Android</a> (2018) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/google-fined-1-49bn-in-europe-for-antitrust-violations-in-search-ad-brokering/">AdSense</a> (2019). But the European Commission has, until now, avoided officially wading into the broader issue of its role in the adtech supply chain. (The AdSense investigation focused on Google&#8217;s search ad brokering business, though Google claims the latest probe represents that next stage of that 2019 enquiry, rather than stemming from a new complaint).</p>
<p>The Commission said that the new Google antitrust investigation will assess whether it has violated EU competition rules by &#8220;favouring its own online display advertising technology services in the so called &#8216;ad tech&#8217; supply chain, to the detriment of competing providers of advertising technology services, advertisers and online publishers&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Display advertising spending in the EU in 2019 was estimated to be approximately €20BN, per the Commission.</p>
<p>&#8220;The formal investigation will notably examine whether Google is distorting competition by restricting access by third parties to user data for advertising purposes on websites and apps, while reserving such data for its own use,&#8221; it added in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3143">press release</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">Earlier this month</a>, France&#8217;s competition watchdog fined Google $268M in a case related to self-preferencing within the adtech market &#8212; which the watchdog found constituted an abuse by Google of a dominant position for ad servers for website publishers and mobile apps.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;France fines Google $268M for adtech abuses and gets interoperability commitments&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/embed/#?secret=6aQMgYSH7V" data-secret="6aQMgYSH7V" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In that instance Google sought a settlement &#8212; proposing a number of binding interoperability agreements which the watchdog accepted. So it remains to be seen whether the tech giant may seek to push for a similar outcome at the EU level.</p>
<p>There is one cautionary signal in that respect in the Commission&#8217;s press release which makes a point of flagging up EU data protection rules &#8212; and highlighting the need to take into account the protection of &#8220;user privacy&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an interesting side-note for the EU&#8217;s antitrust division to include, given some of the <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1402314799015370755">criticism</a> that France&#8217;s Google adtech settlement has attracted &#8212; for risking cementing abusive user exploitation (in the form of adtech privacy violations) into the sought for online advertising market rebalancing.</p>
<p>Or as <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1402314799015370755">Cory Doctorow neatly explains it in this Twitter thread</a>: &#8220;The last thing we want is competition in practices that harm the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aka, unless competition authorities wise up to the data abuses being perpetuated by dominant tech platforms &#8212; such as through enlightened competition authorities engaging in close joint-working with privacy regulators (in the EU this is, at least, possible since there&#8217;s regulation in both areas) &#8212; there&#8217;s a very real risk that antitrust enforcement against Big (ad)Tech could simply supercharge the user-hostile privacy abuses that surveillance giants have only been able to get away with because of their market muscle.</p>
<p>So, tl;dr, ill-thought through antitrust enforcement actually risks <em>further eroding web users&#8217; rights</em>&#8230; and that would indeed be a terrible outcome. (Unless you&#8217;re Google; then it would represent successfully playing one regulator off against another at the expense of users.)</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The need for competition and privacy regulators to work together to purge Big Tech market abuses has become an active debate in Europe &#8212; where a few pioneering regulators (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/competition-challenge-to-facebooks-superprofiling-of-users-sparks-referral-to-europes-top-court/">like German&#8217;s FCO</a>) are ahead of the pack.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO) also recently put out a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2619797/cma-ico-public-statement-20210518.pdf">joint statement</a> &#8212; laying out their conviction that antitrust and data protection regulators must work together to foster a thriving digital economy that&#8217;s healthy across all dimensions &#8212; i.e. for competitors, yes, but also for consumers.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">CMA proposed settlement related to Google&#8217;s planned replacement for tracking cookies</a> &#8212; aka &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217;, which has also been the target of antitrust complaints by publishers &#8212; was notable in baking in privacy commitments and data protection oversight by the ICO in addition to the CMA carrying out its competition enforcement role.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fair to say that the European Commission has lagged behind such pioneers in appreciating the need for synergistic regulatory joint-working, with the EU&#8217;s antitrust chief roundly ignoring &#8212; for example &#8212; calls to block Google&#8217;s acquisition of Fitbit over the data advantage it would entrench, in favor of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/"> accepting a few &#8216;concessions&#8217;</a> to waive the deal through.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>So it&#8217;s interesting to see the EU&#8217;s antitrust division here and now &#8212; at the very least &#8212; <em>virtue signalling</em> an awareness of the problem of regional regulators approaching competition and privacy as if they exist in firewalled silos.</p>
<p>Whether this augurs the kind of enlightened regulatory joint working &#8212; to achieve holistically healthy and dynamic digital markets &#8212; which will certainly be essential if the EU is to effectively grapple with surveillance capitalism very much remains to be seen. But we can at least say that the inclusion of the below statement in an EU antitrust division press release represents a change of tone (and that, in itself, looks like a step forward&#8230;):</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Competition law and data protection laws must work hand in hand to ensure that display advertising markets operate on a level playing field in which all market participants protect user privacy in the same manner.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Returning to the specifics of the EU&#8217;s Google adtech probe, the Commission says it will be particularly examining:</p>
<ul>
<li>The obligation to use Google&#8217;s services Display &amp; Video 360 (‘DV360&#8242;) and/or Google Ads to purchase online display advertisements on YouTube.</li>
<li>The obligation to use Google Ad Manager to serve online display advertisements on YouTube, and potential restrictions placed by Google on the way in which services competing with Google Ad Manager are able to serve online display advertisements on YouTube.</li>
<li>The apparent favouring of Google&#8217;s ad exchange “AdX” by DV360 and/or Google Ads and the potential favouring of DV360 and/or Google Ads by AdX.</li>
<li>The restrictions placed by Google on the ability of third parties, such as advertisers, publishers or competing online display advertising intermediaries, to access data about user identity or user behaviour which is available to Google&#8217;s own advertising intermediation services, including the Doubleclick ID.</li>
<li>Google&#8217;s announced plans to prohibit the placement of third party ‘cookies&#8217; on Chrome and replace them with the “Privacy Sandbox” set of tools, including the effects on online display advertising and online display advertising intermediation markets.</li>
<li>Google&#8217;s announced plans to stop making the advertising identifier available to third parties on Android smart mobile devices when a user opts out of personalised advertising, and the effects on online display advertising and online display advertising intermediation markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Commenting on the investigation in a statement, Commission EVP and competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Online advertising services are at the heart of how Google and publishers monetise their online services. Google collects data to be used for targeted advertising purposes, it sells advertising space and also acts as an online advertising intermediary. So Google is present at almost all levels of the supply chain for online display advertising. We are concerned that Google has made it harder for rival online advertising services to compete in the so-called ad tech stack. A level playing field is of the essence for everyone in the supply chain. Fair competition is important &#8212; both for advertisers to reach consumers on publishers&#8217; sites and for publishers to sell their space to advertisers, to generate revenues and funding for content. We will also be looking at Google&#8217;s policies on user tracking to make sure they are in line with fair competition.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Contacted for comment on the Commission investigation, a Google spokesperson sent us this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Thousands of European businesses use our advertising products to reach new customers and fund their websites every single day. They choose them because they’re competitive and effective. We will continue to engage constructively with the European Commission to answer their questions and demonstrate the benefits of our products to European businesses and consumers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Google also claimed that publishers keep around 70% of the revenue when using its products &#8212; saying in some instances it can be more.</p>
<p>It also suggested that publishers and advertisers often use multiple technologies simultaneously, further claiming that it builds its own technologies to be interoperable with more than 700 rival platforms for advertisers and 80 rival platforms for publishers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insilico Medicine, an A.I-based platform for drug development and discovery announced $255 million in Series C financing on Tuesday. The massive round is reflective of a recent breakthrough for the company: proof that it’s A.I based platform can create a new target for a disease, develop a bespoke molecule to address it, and begin the clinical trial process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also yet another indicator that A.I and drug discovery continues to be especially attractive for investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insilico Medicine is a Hong Kong-based company founded in 2014 around one central premise: that A.I assisted systems can identify novel drug targets for untreated diseases, assist in the development of new treatments, and eventually predict how well those treatments may perform in clinical trials. Previously, the company had raised $51.3 million in funding, </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/insilico-medicine"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insilico Medicine’s aim to use A.I to drive drug development isn’t particularly new, but there is some data to suggest that the company might actually accomplish that gauntlet of discovery all the way through trial prediction. In 2020, the company identified a novel drug target for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a disease in which tiny air sacs in the lungs become scarred, which makes breathing laborious. </span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2vDXjnP3hF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/ai-is-ready-to-take-on-a-massive-healthcare-challenge/">AI is ready to take on a massive healthcare challenge</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AI is ready to take on a massive healthcare challenge&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/ai-is-ready-to-take-on-a-massive-healthcare-challenge/embed/#?secret=2vDXjnP3hF" data-secret="2vDXjnP3hF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://insilico.com/blog/pcc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two A.I-based platforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first identified 20 potential targets, narrowed it down to one, and then designed a small molecule treatment that showed promise in animal studies. The company is currently filing an investigational new drug application with the FDA and will begin human dosing this year, with aims to begin a clinical trial late this year or early next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The focus here isn’t on the drug, though, it’s on the process. This project condensed the process of preclinical drug development that typically takes multiple years and hundreds of millions of dollars into just 18 months, for a total cost of about $2.6 million. Still, founder Alex Zhavoronkov doesn’t think that Insilico Medicine’s strengths lie primarily in accelerating preclinical drug development or reducing costs: its main appeal is in eliminating an element of guesswork in drug discovery, he suggests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Currently we have 16 therapeutic assets, not just IPF,” he says. “It definitely raised some eyebrows.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s about the probability of success,” he continues. “So the probability of success of connecting the right target to the right disease with a great molecule is very, very low. The fact that we managed to do it in IPF and other diseases I can’t talk about yet – it increases confidence in A.I in general.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolstered partially by the proof-of-concept developed by the IPF project and enthusiasm around A.I based drug development, Insilico Medicine attracted a long list of investors in this most recent round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round is led by Warburg Pincus, but also includes investment from Qiming Venture Partners, Pavilion Capital, Eight Roads Ventures, Lilly Asia Ventures, Sinovation Ventures, BOLD Capital Partners, Formic Ventures, Baidu Ventures, and new investors. Those include CPE, OrbiMed, Mirae Asset Capital, B Capital Group, Deerfield Management, Maison Capital, Lake Bleu Capital, President International Development Corporation, Sequoia Capital China and Sage Partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This current round was oversubscribed four-fold, according to Zhavoronkov. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2762311"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2018 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 63 drugs approved by the FDA between 2009 and 2018 found that the median capitalized research and development investment needed to bring a drug to market was $985 million, which also includes the cost of failed clinical trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those costs and the low likelihood of getting a drug approved has initially slowed the process of drug development. R&amp;D returns for biopharmaceuticals hit a low of 1.6 percent in 2019, and bounced back to a measly 2.5 percent in 2020 according to a 2021 </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/deloitte-uk-measuring-the-return-from-pharmaceutical-innovation-2021.pdf#page=8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deloitte report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, Zhavoronkov imagines an A.I-based platform trained on rich data that can cut down on the amount of failed trials. There are two major pieces of that puzzle: PandaOmics, an A.I platform that can identify those targets; and Chemistry 42, a platform that can manufacture a molecule to bind to that target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a tool, which incorporates more than 60 philosophies for target discovery,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are betting something that is novel, but at the same time you have some pockets of evidence that strengthen your hypothesis. That’s what our A.I does very well.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the IPF project has not been fully published in a peer-reviewed journal, a similar project </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0224-x"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Biotechnology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was. In that paper, Insilco’s deep learning model was able to identify potential compounds in just </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0224-x"><span style="font-weight: 400;">21 days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IPF project is a scale-up of this idea. Zhavoronkov doesn’t just want to identify molecules for known targets, he wants to find new ones and shepherd them all the way through clinical trials. And, indeed, also to continue to collect data during those clinical trials that might improve future drug discovery projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So far nobody has challenged us to solve a disease in partnership” he says. “If that happens, I&#8217;ll be a very happy man.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Insilico Medicine’s approach to novel target discovery has been used piecemeal, too. For instance, Insilico Medicine has collaborated with Pfizer on novel target discovery, and Johnson and Johnson on small molecule design and </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/insilico-partners-with-taisho-on-end-to-end-ai-powered-senolytic-drug-discovery-847530402.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">done both</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Taisho Pharmaceuticals. Today, the company also announced a new partnership with Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&amp;D, Inc. Teva will aim to use PandaOmics to identify new drug targets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, it’s not just Insilico Medicine raking in money and partnerships. The whole field of A.I-based novel targets has been experiencing significant hype.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03846-0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019</span></a> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted that at least 20 partnerships between major drug companies and A.I drug discovery tech companies had been reported. In 2020, investment in A.I companies pursuing drug development increased to $13.9 billion, a four-fold increase from 2019, per Stanford University’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Intelligence Index </span></i><a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-AI-Index-Report_Master.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual report.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> R&amp;D cost </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug discovery projects received the greatest amount of private A.I investment in 2020, a trend that can partially be attributed to the pandemic’s need for rapid drug development. However, the roots of the hype predate Covid-19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhavorokov is aware that A.I based drug development is riding a bit of a hype wave right now. “Companies without substantial evidence supporting their A.I powered drug discovery claims manage to raise very quickly,” he notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insilico Medicine, he says, can distinguish itself based on the quality of its investors. “Our investors don&#8217;t gamble,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But like so many other A.I-based drug discovery platforms, we’ll have to see whether they make it through the clinical trial churn. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) published its <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-06/edpb_recommendations_202001vo.2.0_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf">final recommendations</a> yesterday setting on guidance for making transfers of personal data to third countries to comply with EU data protection rules in light of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">last summer&#8217;s landmark CJEU ruling</a> (aka Schrems II).</p>
<p>The long and short of these recommendations &#8212; which are fairly long; running to 48 pages &#8212; is that some data transfers to third countries will simply not be possible to (legally) carry out. Despite the continued existence of legal mechanisms that can, in theory, be used to make such transfers (like Standard Contractual Clauses; a transfer tool that was <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2847">recently updated</a> by the Commission).</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s up to the data controller to assess the viability of each transfer, on a case by case basis, to determine whether data can legally flow in that particular case. (Which may mean, for example, a business making complex assessments about foreign government surveillance regimes and how they impinge upon its specific operations.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Companies that routinely take EU users&#8217; data outside the bloc for processing in third countries (like the US), which do not have data adequacy arrangements with the EU, face substantial cost and challenge in attaining compliance &#8212; in a best case scenario.</p>
<p>Those that can&#8217;t apply viable &#8216;special measures&#8217; to ensure transferred data is safe are duty bound to suspend data flows &#8212; with the risk, should they fail to do that, of being ordered to by a data protection authority (which could also apply additional sanctions).</p>
<p>One alternative option could be for such a firm to store and process EU users&#8217; data locally &#8212; within the EU. But clearly that won&#8217;t be viable for every company.</p>
<p>Law firms are likely to be very happy with this outcome since there will be increased demand for legal advice as companies grapple with how to structure their data flows and adapt to a post-Schrems II world.</p>
<p>In some EU jurisdictions (such as Germany) data protection agencies are now actively carrying out compliance checks &#8212; so orders to suspend transfers are bound to follow.</p>
<p>While the European Data Protection Supervisor is busy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/eu-bodies-use-of-us-cloud-services-from-aws-microsoft-being-probed-by-blocs-privacy-chief/">scrutinizing EU institutions&#8217; own use of US cloud services giants</a> to see whether high level arrangements with tech giants like AWS and Microsoft pass muster or not.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU bodies&#8217; use of US cloud services from AWS, Microsoft being probed by bloc&#8217;s privacy chief&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/eu-bodies-use-of-us-cloud-services-from-aws-microsoft-being-probed-by-blocs-privacy-chief/embed/#?secret=tXdBmELC5q" data-secret="tXdBmELC5q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Last summer the CJEU struck down the EU-US Privacy Shield &#8212; only a few years after the flagship adequacy arrangement was inked. The same core legal issues did for its predecessor, &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/">Safe Harbor</a>&#8216;, though that had stood for some fifteen years. And since the demise of Privacy Shield the Commission has repeatedly warned there will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/no-quick-fix-for-transatlantic-data-transfers-says-ec/">no quick fix replacement this time</a>; nothing short of major reform of US surveillance law is likely to be required.</p>
<p>US and EU lawmakers remain in negotiations over a replacement EU-US data flows deal but a viable outcome that can stand up to legal challenge as the prior two agreements could not, may well require <em>years</em> of work, not months.</p>
<p>And that means EU-US data flows are facing legal uncertainty for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The UK, meanwhile, has just squeezed a data adequacy agreement out of the Commission &#8212; despite some loudly enunciated post-Brexit plans for regulatory divergence in the area of data protection.</p>
<p>If the UK follows through in ripping up key tenets of its inherited EU legal framework there&#8217;s a high chance it will also lose adequacy status in the coming years &#8212; meaning it too could face crippling barriers to EU data flows. (But for now it seems to have dodged that bullet.)</p>
<p>Data flows to other third countries that also lack an EU adequacy agreement &#8212; such as China and India &#8212; face the same ongoing legal uncertainty.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Legal clouds gather over US cloud services, after CJEU ruling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/clouds-gather-over-us-cloud-services-after-cjeu-ruling/embed/#?secret=6ofpNPqC1p" data-secret="6ofpNPqC1p" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The backstory to the EU international data flows issues originates with a complaint &#8212; in the wake of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden&#8217;s revelations about government mass surveillance programs, so more than seven years ago &#8212; made by the eponymous Max Schrems over what he argued were unsafe EU-US data flows.</p>
<p>Although his complaint was specifically targeted at Facebook&#8217;s business and called on the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) to use its enforcement powers and suspend Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data flows.</p>
<p>A regulatory dance of indecision followed which finally saw legal questions referred to Europe&#8217;s top court and &#8212; ultimately &#8212; the demise of the EU-US Privacy Shield. The CJEU ruling also put it beyond legal doubt that Member States&#8217; DPAs must step in and act when they suspect data is flowing to a location where the information is at risk.</p>
<p>Following the Schrems II ruling, the DPC (finally) sent Facebook a preliminary order to suspend its EU-US data flows last fall. Facebook immediately challenged the order in the Irish courts &#8212; seeking to block the move. But that challenge failed. And Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data flows are now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">very much operating on borrowed time</a>.</p>
<p>As one of the platform&#8217;s subject to Section 702 of the US&#8217; FISA law, its options for applying &#8216;special measures&#8217; to supplement its EU data transfers look, well, limited to say the least.</p>
<p>It can&#8217;t &#8212; for example &#8212; encrypt the data in a way that ensures it has no access to it (zero access encryption) since that&#8217;s not how Facebook&#8217;s advertising empire functions. And Schrems has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/max-schrems-on-the-eu-court-ruling-that-could-cut-facebook-in-two/">previously suggested</a> Facebook will have to federate its service &#8212; and store EU users&#8217; information inside the EU &#8212; to fix its data transfer problem.</p>
<p>Safe to say, the costs and complexity of compliance for certain businesses like Facebook look massive.</p>
<p>But there will be compliance costs and complexity for thousands of businesses in the wake of the CJEU ruling. And in a recent <a href="https://alliedforstartups.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EU-US-Summit-II-LETTER-.pdf">open letter</a> to lawmakers ahead of an EU-US summit earlier this month, startup associations on both sides of the Atlantic urged policymakers to find ways to partner on regulatory standards alignment &#8212; writing that recent developments in the digital sphere, such as the invalidation of Privacy Shield, &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">threaten to leave our ecosystems at a disadvantage in tough globally competitive markets&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>Discussing the concerns with TechCrunch, Benedikt Blomeyer, director of EU policy for Allied for Startups, added: &#8220;Startups are global from day one and as such, a US startup has much to offer for EU consumers. Why is that despite increasingly interconnected markets, and more and more data protection laws coming into force, increasingly trade barriers are arising in the digital economy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Though asked if the startups backing the call for the EU and US to work towards reducing regulatory divergence are lobbying for anything as specific as US surveillance law reform at this stage of their campaign Blomeyer declined to comment for now.</p>

<p><span class="il">Commenting on the EDPB&#8217;s adoption of final recommendations,</span> chair Andrea Jelinek said: “The impact of Schrems II cannot be underestimated: Already international data flows are subject to much closer scrutiny from the supervisory authorities who are conducting investigations at their respective levels. The goal of the <span class="il">EDPB</span> Recommendations is to guide exporters in lawfully transferring personal data to third countries while guaranteeing that the data transferred is afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the European Economic Area.</p>
<p>&#8220;By clarifying some doubts expressed by stakeholders, and in particular the importance of examining the practices of public authorities in third countries, we want to make it easier for data exporters to know how to assess their transfers to third countries and to identify and implement effective supplementary measures where they are needed. The <span class="il">EDPB</span> will continue considering the effects of the <i>Schrems II</i> ruling and the comments received from stakeholders in its future guidance.”</p>
<p>The EDPB put out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">earlier guidance on Schrems II compliance</a> last year.</p>
<p>It said the main modifications between that earlier advice and its final recommendations include: &#8220;The emphasis on the importance of examining the practices of third country public authorities in the exporters’ legal assessment to determine whether the legislation and/or practices of the third country impinge &#8212; in practice &#8212; on the effectiveness of the Art. 46 GDPR transfer tool; the possibility that the exporter considers in its assessment the practical experience of the importer, among other elements and with certain caveats; and the clarification that the legislation of the third country of destination allowing its authorities to access the data transferred, even without the importer’s intervention, may also impinge on the effectiveness of the transfer tool&#8221;.</p>
<p>Commenting on the EDPB&#8217;s recommendations in a statement, law firm Linklaters dubbed the guidance &#8220;strict&#8221; &#8212; warning over the looming impact on businesses.</p>
<p>“There is little evidence of a pragmatic approach to these transfers and the EDPB seems entirely content if the conclusion is that the data must remain in the EU,&#8221; said Peter Church, a Counsel at the global law firm. &#8220;For example, before transferring personal data to third country (without adequate data protection laws) businesses must consider not only its law but how its law enforcement and national security agencies operate in practice. Given these activities are typically secretive and opaque, this type of analysis is likely to cost tens of thousands of euros and take time. It appears this analysis is needed even for relatively innocuous transfers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not clear how SMEs can be expected to comply with these requirements,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Given we now operate in a globalised society the EDPB, like King Canute, should consider the practical limitations on its power. The guidance will not turn back the tides of data washing back and forth across the world, but many businesses will really struggle to comply with these new requirements.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Transmit Security, a Boston-based startup that&#8217;s on a mission to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/how-startups-can-go-passwordless-thanks-to-zero-trust/">rid the world of passwords</a>, has raised a massive $543 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/seed-is-not-the-new-series-a/">Series A</a> funding.</p>
<p>The funding round, said to be the largest Series A investment in cybersecurity history and one of the highest valuations for a bootstrapped company, was led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/insight-partners/">Insight Partners</a> and General Atlantic, with additional investment from Cyberstarts, Geodesic, SYN Ventures, Vintage, and Artisanal Ventures.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Transmit Security said it has a pre-money valuation of $2.2 billion, and will use the new funds to expand its reach and investing in key global areas to grow the organization.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, the funding round will help the company to accelerate its mission to help the world go passwordless. Organizations lose millions of dollars every year due to “inherently unsafe” password-based authentication, according to the startup; not only do weak passwords account for more than 80% of all <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/data-breach/">data breaches</a>, but the average help desk labor cost to reset a single password stands at more than $70.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Transmit says its biometric-based authenticator is the first natively passwordless identity and risk management solution, and it has already been adopted by a number of big-name brands including Lowes, Santander, and UBS. The solution, which currently handles more than 9,000 authentication requests per second, can reduce account resets by 96%, the company says, and reduces customer authentication from 1 minute to 2 seconds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“By eliminating passwords, businesses can immediately reduce churn and cart abandonment and provide superior security for personal data,” said Transmit Security CEO Mickey Boodaei, who co-founded the company in 2014. “Our customers, whether they are in the retail, banking, financial, telecommunications, or automotive sectors, understand that providing an optimized identity experience is a multimillion-dollar challenge. With this latest round of funding from premier partners, we can significantly expand our reach to help rid the world of passwords.”</p>
<p>Transmit Security isn’t the only company that’s on a mission to kill off the password.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How do you follow up a burger-flipping robot? If you’re Miso Robotics (which you likely are, if you’ve created a burger-flipping robot), the answer is simple: beverages. The robotics startup continues to focus on the fast food service industry with the planned launch of an automated beverage-dispensing robot.</p>
<p>The system, which is being created as part of a partnership with beverage dispenser manufacturer Lancer, brings an added level of automation to your standard fast food fountain. It has a point of sale system directly integrated, which kicks off the process of pouring, sealing and advancing the drink. Beyond that, it’s integrated with a larger sales system to ensure that it’s getting orders right, between in-person customers and delivery drivers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168197" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168197" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2168197 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02-Automated-Beverage-Dispenser-Demo-Miso-Robotics-and-Lancer-Worldwide.2021-06-21-13_28_45.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168197" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Miso Robotics</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Basically it’s a much smarter version of the fountain you encounter in every fast food restaurant and movie theater. Naturally, the company says that interest in the category has only increased amid labor shortages and a pandemic that froze much of the available workforce over the past year and a half.</p>
<p>“Lancer has a legacy of stand-out industry quality and shares in our vision for beverage innovation and futuristic design,” Miso Chief Strategy Officer Jake Brewer said in a press release tied to this morning’s news. “Order fulfillment is a major factor for customer satisfaction and operators can’t afford to have a beverage left behind when a delivery driver or customer visits. We are extremely excited to create a product that will not only make the lives of those working in commercial kitchens better, but will be a game changer for the industry as a whole to deliver a world-class customer experience.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese merchants selling on Amazon are having a moment. The scruffy exporters are used to roaming about suburban factory areas and dealing with constant cash flow strain, but suddenly they find themselves having coffee with top Chinese venture capital firms and investment representatives from internet giants, who come with big checks to hunt down the next <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/shein-overtakes-amazon/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Shein</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/anker/">Anker</a>. While VCs can provide the money for them to scale quickly, many lack the expertise to help on the strategic side.</p>
<p>This is where brand aggregators can put their retail know-how to work. Also called roll-ups, these companies go around acquiring promising e-commmerce brands for operational synergies. After taking off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/e-commerce-roll-ups-present-the-next-wave-of-disruption-in-consumer-packaged-goods/">in the United States, Europe</a>, and <a href="https://the-ken.com/sea/story/e-commerce-aggregators-follow-the-money-and-arrive-in-southeast-asia/">lately Southeast Asia</a>, it has also quietly landed in China, where traditional white-label manufacturers are trying to move up the value chain and establish their own brand presence.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.berlin-brands-group.com/cmn">The latest roll-up to enter China</a> is Berlin Brands Group (BBG), which aims to buy &#8220;dozens of&#8221; brands in the country over the next few years, its founder and CEO Peter Chaljawski told TechCrunch. This will significantly boost the German company&#8217;s existing portfolio, 14 of which are its own brands and over 20 acquired.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The move came on the back of BBG&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/">$240 million funding raised from debt</a> and its announcement to commit $300 million on its balance sheet to buying up companies. The firm opted for debt in part because it has been profitable since its inception. The recent funding won&#8217;t be its last round and it may use other financial instruments in the future, said the founder.</p>
<p>Chaljawski doesn&#8217;t see VC and corporate investors as direct competitors in the hunt for brands. &#8220;There are tens of thousands of sellers in China that generate significant revenue on Amazon. I think the VC money applies to some of them, and the roll-up model applies also to only some of them. But &#8216;some&#8217; is a very, very big number.&#8221;</p>
<p>BBG is no stranger to China. The 15-year-old company has been relying on Chinese manufacturers to make its kitchenware, gardening tools, sports gear and other home appliances, with 90% of its products still made in the country today. For the new brand buy-out initiative, it&#8217;s hiring dozens of staff in Shenzhen, which Chalijawski dubbed the &#8220;Silicon Valley of Amazon,&#8221; referring to the southern city&#8217;s key role in global export, manufacturing, and increasingly, design.</p>
<h2>Amazon alternative</h2>
<p>BBG hopes to offer a new way for Chinese consumer products to scale in Europe and the U.S. beyond being an anonymous brand on Amazon. Sellers may want to break free of the American behemoth to seize more control over consumer data, but building a direct-to-consumer (D2C) brand is no small feat.</p>
<p>Many merchants that are good at operating Amazon third-party businesses lack the infrastructure to go beyond Amazon, like an in-house logistics system, said the founder. In Europe, BBG manages 120,000 square meters of fulfillment centers, allowing it to shed dependence on Amazon.</p>
<p>Chinese brands may also want to find Amazon alternatives in Europe, where the e-commerce landscape is a lot more fragmented than that in the U.S, noted Chaljawski.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at the U.S., Amazon is dominant. If you look at Europe, Amazon only has 10% of the market share of online retail. So 90% is beyond Amazon. In the Netherlands, you have platforms like Bol. In Poland, you have Allegro, and in France, you have other dominant players.&#8221;</p>
<p>To bridge the gap for international brands targeting Europe, BBG operates close to 20 D2C web stores in major European countries, aside from selling on Amazon. Its sales growth in the U.S. has also been in full steam. Currently, over 60% of the firm&#8217;s revenues come from non-Amazon channels.</p>
<p>BBG is already in advanced negotiations with &#8220;some brands&#8221; in China but cannot disclose their names at this stage.</p>
<p><em>Updated the story to clarify the number of brands in BBG&#8217;s portfolio.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A payments startup whose backend was originally built by the founder while still living with his parents and bootstrapping the company is today announcing a massive round of funding that catapults it into being one of the most valuable startups in Europe. <a href="https://www.mollie.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mollie</a>, an Amsterdam-based startup that provides a way for businesses to integrate payments into sites, documents and other services by way of an API, is today announcing that it has raised €665 million ($800 million) in an all-equity round that values the company at €5.4 billion ($6.5 billion).</p>
<p>Blackstone Growth (BXG), Blackstone’s growth equity investing business, led the investment, with participation also from EQT Growth, General Atlantic, HMI Capital, Alkeon Capital, and TCV. TCV led Mollie&#8217;s breakout <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/07/dutch-payments-startup-mollie-raises-106m-at-1b-valuation/">Series B</a> in September last year.</p>
<p>Mollie has been on a major growth tear in recent years. The company is currently on track to process some €20 billion (nearly $24 billion) in payments in 2021, up 100% on the year before when it processed around €10 billion. It currently has 120,000 monthly active merchants (versus 100,000 in 2020), and customers include the likes of Deliveroo, Unicef, Acer and Guess. It&#8217;s adding between 400 and 500 new customers each day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To be sure, the pandemic saw a massive shift in commerce with all kinds of transactions &#8212; buying goods, paying for services, handling your banking and other finances &#8212; all moving into the digital world, and that also played out for Mollie.</p>
<p>But that is also not the full story: growing at the same pace this year as last appears to indicate that even as we start to see more signs of the pandemic moving on (well, at least for some&#8230;), the shift to paying and buying online (and using Mollie&#8217;s rails to do so) will stay.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing you can reliably measure in payments is consumer spend. That was at 10% and now it&#8217;s at 15-20%,&#8221; said Shane Happach, who took over as CEO of Mollie in April of this year from founder Adriaan Mol (who, incidentally, was also the founder of MessageBird; Mol&#8217;s nickname is Mollie, hence the name of this company).</p>
<p>In an interview, Happach explained that consumer spend, and the subsequent addressable consumer market, is the metric that best indicates how a company like Mollie will grow. So while Mollie has largely been profitable since being founded back in 2004, the plan now will be to put the gas on growth, building related services around payments to continue expanding its product offering while also continuing to move move into more geographies beyond its core, and biggest, market of Europe, helped in no small part by its new, big investors.</p>
<p>That will bring it into deeper competition with a whole raft of players. That is to say, Mollie is far from the only payments company on the market, nor is it the only one that has seen business boom in recent times. But it is bigger and much more fragmented than you might think. Happach &#8212; who spent a decade at WorldPay before joining Mollie &#8212; points out that the top ten players in payments have 50% of the market, but the other 50% is held by about 5,000 players.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be really surprised, companies like Stripe are in the 5,000. They&#8217;re not in the top ten,&#8221; he said. (JP Morgan, WorldPay, Fiserv (First Data), PayPal are among those that make up the first ten.). That essentially gives the company a lot of opportunity to grow and consolidate, while also underscoring just how big the market is for everyone.</p>
<p>Stripe came up a few times in our conversation, in particular when talking about competitive threats &#8212; its basic premise, like Mollie&#8217;s, has been the building of a payments platform (complex for any non-payment company to do) that can be integrated by customers anywhere by way of a simple API; when talking about valuations (Stripe is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now valued at $95 billion</a>); and when talking about product playbooks.</p>
<p>In all cases, the main takeaway seems to be that Stripe&#8217;s success speaks to the market Mollie has ahead of it. &#8220;We see a huge opportunity in the super underserved population of SMBs,&#8221; Happach said. &#8220;Especially if you look at our core markets, where most of our customers come from today, the financial services that they can get access to are very clunky.&#8221; The company, he added, will be focusing on a few areas that it believes it can do better than what&#8217;s out there now, which also complements its payments business: working capital for small businesses, card issuing and corporate card programs, expense management, and business banking. (All areas, I should note, where Stripe also has launched products.)</p>
<p>It will also be interesting to watch how and if Mollie, as it grows, gets more confident to potentially change its cut. It&#8217;s taken PayPal years, but it has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/paypal-overhauls-us-rates-payments-competition-heats-up-2021-06-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently rebalanced</a> its rates. Happach notes Mollie never has and <a href="https://www.mollie.com/en/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has no plans to follow it</a>.</p>
<p>One area where Mollie is less likely to invest the new capital is in acquisitions, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came from a company that had acquired a load of other companies, and I think there&#8217;s pluses and minuses,&#8221; Happach said. &#8220;For Mollie, we are building an organic plan&#8230;. [Acquisitions are] always an opportunity, [but] I would say it&#8217;s not the thesis of what we have agreed with investors is the most likely things that we&#8217;d like to do&#8230;. I think, right now, we&#8217;re mainly focused on hiring as much great talent as we can, really beefing up our commercial product and engineering teams. There&#8217;s still quite a lot to do by just investing in our own business building and training our own people and serving the customers that we&#8217;ve already got in the best possible way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company, indeed, hasn&#8217;t really grown through a sales force or big marketing investments but largely through word of mouth up to now, one reason Blackstone came knocking.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that really impressed us at Blackstone is that of the hundreds that sign up to Mollie on a daily basis, 90-95% of them have almost no interaction with Mollie directly,&#8221; said Paul Morrissey, who heads up Blackstone&#8217;s investing activities in Europe. &#8220;They&#8217;re just finding Mollie, loving the product and just getting going and that goes back to kind of the unit economics of the business&#8230; It talks to their competitive position in the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is somewhat due to change with the company embarking on a big hiring push, taking its team of 480 to just under 800 in the next nine months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Online teaching came into the spotlight for many students and parents in the last year, and today one of the companies that saw a big lift during that rush of activity is announcing a big round of funding to carry it into what has emerged as a more permanent change of habits for many learners.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.gostudent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoStudent</a>, a marketplace where K-12 students (and their parents) can find and engage with one-to-one video-based tutors in a variety of subjects, has raised €205 million ($244 million), in a Series C round that values the company at €1.4 billion ($1.7 billion).</p>
<p class="p1">The funding is coming at a time of strong growth. The Vienna, Austria-based startup is now live in 18 countries and sees some 400,000 sessions booked monthly on its platform, up 700% year-on-year (and up 15% month-on-month). It says it is on track to double employees to 1,000 and reach 10,000 tutors by the end of this year. The plan is to expand to more countries &#8212; Mexico and Canada are next on the list &#8212; and to continue growing its lists of tutors and subjects covered.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p id="speakable-summary">(As a point of comparison, when it last fundraised in March, GoStudent was booking a mere 250,000 tutoring sessions over its platform.)</p>
<p>DST Global is leading the round, with SoftBank (via its Vision Fund 2), Tencent, Dragoneer and previous backers Coatue, Left Lane Capital and DN Capital also participating. Vienna, Austria-based GoStudent has raised €291 million to date, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tutor-marketplace-gostudent-raises-e70m-series-b-round-led-by-new-us-investor-coatue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">€70 million round only this past March</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/tutor-marketplace-gostudent-takes-its-series-a-to-e13-3m-with-left-lane-capital-and-dn-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">€13.3 million in a Series A</a> this past November.</p>
<p>The rapid pace of funding and GoStudent&#8217;s rising valuation &#8212; this investment makes it the highest-valued edtech startup in Europe, the company said &#8212; comes amid a streak of funding rounds for edtech companies.</p>
<p>And that may be no surprise: online and other digital tools in the last year especially felt more relevant (and in many cases were used more) than ever before due to social distancing during the pandemic. (Other recent deals have included funding for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Byju&#8217;s</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/kahoot-picks-up-215m-from-softbank-for-its-user-generated-gamified-e-learning-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kahoot</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/formative-a-student-learning-and-analytics-platform-raises-70m-to-challenge-the-summative-test-based-approach-to-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formative</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/engageli-nabs-33m-more-for-its-collaborative-video-based-teaching-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engageli</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/lingoda-an-on-demand-online-language-school-with-live-instructors-and-zoom-classrooms-raises-67m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lingoda</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/brainly-raises-80m-as-its-platform-for-crowdsourced-homework-help-balloons-to-350m-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brainly</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/classdojos-second-act-comes-with-first-profits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClassDojo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/newsela-the-replacement-for-textbooks-raises-100m-and-becomes-a-unicorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsela</a>, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-24/tencent-backed-edtech-startup-seeks-funding-at-20-billion-value" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yuanfudao</a>, among many others.)</p>
<p>But in the case of GoStudent, it&#8217;s also because the startup itself is also doing an A+ job in scaling its concept.</p>
<p>The company has been around since 2016 &#8212; when it started out initially providing a network for people to help each other answer questions (similar to Brainly), as well as connect with tutors, and for tutors to organize classes &#8212; but it was only about 2.5 years ago that GoStudent started to focus more squarely on one-to-one tutoring.</p>
<p>GoStudent provides a fully-integrated service, which lets students and their parents select from a range of topics that are typically taught in schools &#8212; currently some 30 subjects, including sciences, math, computing, languages, history, business and more &#8212; that they can be tutored on generally or specifically with the aim of taking an exam.</p>
<p>Tutoring comes from people who are tested, vetted and interviewed by GoStudent before they can join the platform; and before engaging tutors, parents and students interview an individual tutor and go through a practice lesson as part of that.</p>
<p>Learning plans are then organized according to students&#8217; schedules and what they are setting out to do (they can send over their homework, or chapters they&#8217;re studying in school or even a curriculum outline); and the classes, assessments and <a href="https://www.gostudent.org/en/prices-and-packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">payments</a> (based on packages booked), are all handled over the platform, too.</p>
<p>Although there are a number of ways of learning a subject over the internet today &#8212; and specifically a number of online-only direct tutoring platforms in the market now (including Brainly, Yuanfudao, and others) &#8212; Ohswald said that by and large GoStudent&#8217;s biggest competition is the bigger in-person business of teaching, and of students and tutors connecting with each other through word of mouth &#8212; the “offline shadow market of tutors,&#8221; as he calls it.</p>
<p>All the same, while there are tech tools involved in provisioning and running lessons, at its heart GoStudent is also still about humans connecting to help each other, rather than humans connecting with computer programs.</p>
<p>Interestingly, its founders believe that the Covid-19 pandemic effect was not uniformly positive for its business.</p>
<p>“The pandemic had mixed effects,&#8221; Ohswald said. &#8220;On the one hand there was a natural demand from kids and parents. But with the schools closed, there was less pressure, less exams, less demand for after-school study. That aspect had a negative effect. But more broadly, there was a BIG boost for digital education. So the mindset of the parent and family drastically shifted.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that many families turned to tutoring to help &#8220;support the kids at home, to help them to stop being overwhelmed.&#8221; (And I would add, especially in the first part of the lockdown last year when schools were scrambling a little to regroup and teach online, that as a parent, we found it a relief to have at least some consistency with private tutors online at that time.)</p>
<p>What that means, essentially, is that while GoStudent did well in the last year, the company does not want to tie its growth to a specific set of pandemic circumstances that may well become less of an issue in the year ahead.</p>
<p>Indeed, for better or worse, there <em>are</em> bigger factors at play that predate the pandemic. Increasing pressure on students to perform their best competing against others, a continuing focus on testing, and a general level of academic ambition; but also a much easier and cheaper way of finding and connecting with people who can help students feel more supported in their efforts: all of these are also playing a role.</p>
<div dir="ltr">
<div>
<p>&#8220;GoStudent is one of the fastest growing companies that we have ever backed. The company has grown 800% in terms of revenue and 70x in terms of value since 2020 and we are convinced that this is just the beginning,&#8221; Nenad Marovac, founder and managing partner, DN Capital, told TechCrunch. “We believe that GoStudent can become one of the top digital schools in the world. By leveraging technology GoStudent democratizes quality education to all at affordable prices.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Gillmor Gang recording session is nestled on Friday midday on the East Coast and midmorning out West. Streamed live on Twitter, Facebook Live, and Youtube embed, the show is then edited, sweetened with titles and music, and released on Techcrunch. It&#8217;s a kind of hybrid between podcast, Zoom collaboration meeting, and work-from-anywhere encounter group. The Gang grew out of the early days of podcasting, now undergoing rescaffolding from social, drop-in, or just plain fast following from a variety of social networks. The latest entry, Live Audio Rooms from Facebook, is &#8220;soft-launching&#8221; with verified famous people and creators in good standing up first.</p>
<p>Facebook typically waits just long enough to decide what features to copy, and appears ready to aggregate the strategies of the rest of the market behind a Facebook infrastructure if not firewall. This may incorporate not just social audio features like tipping and raising hands to speak but also live video streaming and perhaps screen-sharing tools like ones announced at Apple&#8217;s WWDC for Facetime. Inevitably, the context returns to Clubhouse and its parallel tech media strategy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z) debuted their publishing site, and the media tried its best to push back without burning any bridges to the high-flying venture firm. Even more interesting than the future.com website was a Clubhouse Launch Party where we met authors and their editors for about two hours of chat. Marc Andreessen sat in at the beginning, and A16Z partner Margit Wennmachers provided context for the launch. The strategy: project trust and insight from a venture firm and go direct from technologists to the tech and investment audience. It&#8217;s an interesting time in the wake of the Trumpian alternative facts blight, where the cable media seems tied in knots by trying to salvage ratings gold with yet another crisis-to-crisis breaking news schtick.</p>
<p>After that gambit begins to tire, the pitch shifts to the undermining of Democracy by the Autocrats, which although real, is not exactly compelling ratings magic. With vaccinations reaching movie popcorn immunity levels, streaming television is shifting from all out binge releases to the much more familiar weekly cliffhanger model. Working from anywhere is being negotiated based on a hybrid of the best of watching your kids grow up while getting back to a collaborative office when you&#8217;ve seen enough of them or them of you.</p>
<p>On the Gang this time, Keith Teare suggests Netflix may be in a bit of a tough spot, as the easing pandemic puts pressure on new shows slowed down by production lockouts. It&#8217;s true: the quality seems to be slipping almost imperceptibly, but nothing is accelerating to put pressure on the Big 4 or 5 Flixes including Disney, Amazon Prime, and maybe Hulu. DiscoBros (Frank Radice&#8217;s catchy rebrand for Discovery/WarnerMedia) can be fun, Apple TV+ should buy in to boost production, and then we need to look to the Creator Economy to hurry up and save us.</p>
<p>Every few days there&#8217;s another social audio pivot/acquisition/update, the most interesting besides Facebook&#8217;s if you can call it that being Spotify Greenroom with its auto record and captioning features and inevitable integration with its Anchor podcasting tools. Tip jar resistance is almost a thing, in case you&#8217;re wondering. The only thing more enervating is speculation on whether Clubhouse is jumping the shark — I don&#8217;t think so. If the Future.com suggests more copying of The Information&#8217;s events model, there&#8217;s plenty of runway ahead. And social audio gold is anything about Clubhouse on Clubhouse.</p>
<p>For those of us who still remember tech news, the Apple announcements almost reach orbit with the mixture of M1 magic and iOS/MacOS/WatchOS/TVOS blurring. My favorite list is of features that don&#8217;t show up on Intel machines, all the cool ones. For the first time in years, we traded up to M1&#8217;s on both our Macbooks including a Pro and Air, and in the process enabled Blur mode on Zoom on both essentially for free. The hardware is starting to feel like a subscription service (HaaS) which as Salesforce&#8217;s trajectory suggests is likely a very big deal. (Disclosure: I work for Salesforce.) For creators, moving from hardware like Newtek&#8217;s Tricaster and BlackMagic&#8217;s ATEM Mini to software-based OBS and then NDI5 over the public network is not prime time, but getting there real soon now. Keith thinks so, Brent Leary says maybe. I say, if Apple bundles Apple TV and Apple TV+ with newsletter plugins from Twitter Revue and Substack subscriptions&#8230;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been teasing a neural network training computer called &#8216;Dojo&#8217; since at least 2019. Musk says Dojo will be able to process vast amounts of video data to achieve vision-only autonomous driving. While Dojo itself is still in development, Tesla today revealed a new supercomputer that will serve as a development prototype version of what Dojo will ultimately offer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the 2021 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition on Monday, Tesla’s head of AI, Andrej Karpathy, revealed the company’s new supercomputer that allows the automaker to ditch radar and lidar sensors on self-driving cars in favor of high-quality optical cameras. During his workshop on autonomous driving, Karpathy explained that to get a computer to respond to new environment in a way that a human can requires an immense dataset, and a massively powerful supercomputer to train the company&#8217;s neural net-based autonomous driving technology using that data set. Hence the development of these predecessors to Dojo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla&#8217;s newest-generation supercomputer has 10 petabytes of “hot tier” NVME storage and runs at 1.6 terrabytes per second, according to Karpathy. With 1.8 EFLOPS, he said it might be the fifth most powerful supercomputer in the world, but he conceded later that his team has not yet run the specific benchmark necessary to enter the TOP500 Supercomputing rankings.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That said, if you take the total number of FLOPS it would indeed place somewhere around the fifth spot,” Karpathy told TechCrunch. “The fifth spot is currently occupied by NVIDIA with their Selene cluster, which has a very comparable architecture and similar number of GPUs (4480 vs ours 5760, so a bit less).”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk has been advocating for a vision-only approach to autonomy for some time, in large part because </span><a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1380798469862957057"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cameras are faster than radar or lidar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As of May, Tesla Model Y and Model 3 vehicles in North America are being built without radar, relying on cameras and machine learning to support its advanced driver assistance system and autopilot. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">When radar and vision disagree, which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision, so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1380796939151704071?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many autonomous driving companies use lidar and high definition maps, which means they require incredibly detailed maps of the places where they&#8217;re operating, including all road lanes and how they connect, traffic lights and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The approach we take is vision-based, primarily using neural networks that can in principle function anywhere on earth,” said Karpathy in his workshop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replacing a “meat computer,” or rather,  a human, with a silicon computer results in lower latencies (better reaction time), 360 degree situational awareness and a fully attentive driver that never checks their Instagram, said Karpathy.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tesla is no longer using radar sensors in Model 3 and Model Y vehicles built in North America&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/tesla-is-no-longer-using-radar-sensors-in-model-3-and-model-y-vehicles-built-in-north-america/embed/#?secret=OdPm9pF3xr" data-secret="OdPm9pF3xr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karpathy shared some scenarios of how Tesla’s supercomputer employs computer vision to correct bad driver behavior, including an emergency braking scenario in which the computer’s object detection kicks in to save a pedestrian from being hit, and traffic control warning that can identify a yellow light in the distance and send an alert to a driver that hasn’t yet started to slow down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla vehicles have also already proven a feature called pedal misapplication mitigation, in which the car identifies pedestrians in its path, or even a lack of a driving path, and responds to the driver accidentally stepping on the gas instead of braking, potentially saving pedestrians in front of the vehicle or preventing the driver from accelerating into a river.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla’s supercomputer collects video from eight cameras that surround the vehicle at 36 frames per second, which provides insane amounts of information about the environment surrounding the car, Karpathy explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the vision-only approach is more scalable than collecting, building and maintaining high definition maps everywhere in the world, it’s also much more of a challenge, because the neural networks doing the object detection and handling the driving have to be able to collect and process vast quantities of data at speeds that match the depth and velocity recognition capabilities of a human.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karpathy says after years of research, he believes it can be done by treating the challenge as a supervised learning problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engineers testing the tech found they could drive around sparsely populated areas with zero interventions, said Karpathy, but “definitely struggle a lot more in very adversarial environments like San Francisco.” For the system to truly work well and mitigate the need for things like high-definition maps and additional sensors, it&#8217;ll have to get much better at dealing with densely populated areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the Tesla AI team game changers has been auto-labeling, through which it can automatically label things like roadway hazards and other objects from millions of videos capture by vehicles on Tesla camera. Large AI datasets have often required a lot of manual labelling, which is time-consuming, especially when trying to arrive at the kind of cleanly-labelled data set required to make a supervised learning system on a neural network work well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this latest supercomputer, Tesla has accumulated 1 million videos of around 10 seconds each and labeled 6 billion objects with depth, velocity and acceleration. All of this takes up a whopping 1.5 petabytes of storage. That seems like a massive amount, but it&#8217;ll take a lot more before the company can achieve the kind of reliability it requires out of an automated driving system that relies on vision systems alone, hence the need to continue developing ever more powerful supercomputers in Tesla&#8217;s pursuit of more advanced AI.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For most people in India, having to engage with banks doesn&#8217;t instill a sense of joy. Banks in the South Asian market are notorious for making unannounced spam calls to upsell customers loans and credit cards, even when they have been explicitly asked not to do so.</p>
<p>Moreover, when a customer does reach out to a bank with a query, it can take forever to get the job done. Take ICICI Bank, India’s third largest bank and until recently my only banking partner for over six years, for an example.</p>
<p>It is now in its third month in figuring out who exactly in its relationship with Amazon is supposed to re-issue me a credit card. I have moved on with my life, and it looks like they did, too, likely before they even looked at my query.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Small and medium-sized businesses aren’t a big fan of banks, either. If you operate an early-stage startup, it’s anyone’s guess if you will ever be able to convince a bank to issue you a corporate account. So of course, startups &#8212; Razorpay and Open &#8212; took it upon themselves to fix this experience.</p>
<p>For consumers, too, in recent years, scores of startups have arrived on the scene to improve this banking experience. Whether <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/slice-raises-6m-to-help-young-indians-pay-digitally-and-build-credit-score/">you are a teenager</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/fampay-a-fintech-aimed-at-teens-in-india-raises-38-million/">just out of college</a>, or a working professional, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/jai-kisan-a-fintech-startup-aimed-at-rural-india-raises-30-million/">don’t have a credit score</a>, there are firms that can get you a credit card and loan.</p>
<p>But even these services have a ceiling limit of some sort. And customers aren’t loyal to any startup.</p>
<p>“A customer’s relationship is always with the entity where they park their savings deposit,” said <a href="https://twitter.com/guptajiten">Jitendra Gupta</a>, a high-profile entrepreneur who has spent a decade in the fintech world. Since these customers are not parking their money with fintech, “the startups have been unable to disrupt the bank. That’s the hard reality.”</p>
<p>So what’s the alternative? Gupta, who co-founded CitrusPay (sold to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/14/naspers-payu-buys-citrus-pay-for-130m-in-cash-to-expand-in-india/">Naspers&#8217; PayU</a>) and served as managing director of PayU, has been thinking about these challenges for more than two years.</p>
<p>“If you really want to change the banking industry, you cannot operate from the side. You have to fight from the centre, where they deposit their money. It’s a very time-consuming process and requires a lot of initial capital and experience with banks,” he told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>After more than a year and a half of raising about $24 million &#8212; from Sequoia Capital India, 3one4 Capital, <a href="https://twitter.com/amrishrau">Amrish Rau</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kunalb11">Kunal Shah</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/1kunalbahl">Kunal Bahl</a>, Tanglin Venture Partners, Rainmatter and others &#8212; Gupta is ready to launch what he believes will address a lot of the issues individuals face with their banks.</p>
<p>His new startup, called <a href="https://jupiter.money">Jupiter</a>, wants to bring “delight” to the banking experience, and it will launch in India on Thursday.</p>
<p>“We believe that a bank account should be a smart account, where it gives you insight, shares personalized tips and guides you through attaining some financial discipline,” he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168385" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168385" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2168385 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/india-bank-fintech-snapshot.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="357" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/india-bank-fintech-snapshot.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/india-bank-fintech-snapshot.jpg?resize=150,52 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/india-bank-fintech-snapshot.jpg?resize=300,105 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/india-bank-fintech-snapshot.jpg?resize=768,268 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/india-bank-fintech-snapshot.jpg?resize=680,237 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/india-bank-fintech-snapshot.jpg?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168385" class="wp-caption-text">A snapshot of the reach of banks and fintech startups in India. Data: CIBIL, Statista, BofA Global Research. <strong>Image:</strong> BofA</p></div></p>
<p>To be sure, Jupiter, too, will offer loans and other financial services to customers. But instead of making irrelevant calls to customers, it will assess which of its customers are running short on money and give the option to take a credit line from its app itself, he said. “The upsell doesn’t need to happen by way of spam. It needs to happen by way of contextualization and personalization.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jupiter has been built in a deep integration with the underlying bank, allowing the consumer to have a frictionless experience for all their banking needs,&#8221; said Amrish Rau, chief executive of Pine Labs, co-founder of CitrusPay and longtime friend of Gupta.</p>
<p>The startup, which employs 115 people, has developed a number of products for customers joining on day one. The products include the ability to buy now and pay later on UPI, a feature first offered in the market by Jupiter, and a mutual fund portfolio analyzer. A debit card, in-app chat with a customer service agent, expense categorisation, finding the right card, determining the existing health insurance coverage, and more are ready to ship, the startup said.</p>
<p>Jupiter is currently working on providing zero mark-up on forex transactions, and frictionless two-factor authentication. The startup has <a href="https://trello.com/b/gehmc4Ig/building-jupiter">published a public Trello page</a> where it has outlined the features it is working on and when it expects to ship them, as well as features suggested by its beta-testing customers. &#8220;I want to establish full transparency in what we are working on to build trust with customers,&#8221; said Gupta.</p>
<p>Jupiter will have its own customer relationship team that will engage with the startup’s users. The startup, which late last month opened a waiting list for customers to sign up, had amassed more than 25,000 applications as of two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Even Jupiter, which one day wishes to disrupt the banking sector, currently has to partner with banks. Its partners are Federal Bank and Axis Bank.</p>
<p>I asked Gupta about the excitement his investors see in Jupiter. “Everyone believes, as you see with fintech giants such as Nubank globally, that we will become a full bank,” he said.</p>
<p>But for the time being, Gupta said he is not looking to partner with more banks. “I don’t want Jupiter to attract customers because they want to bank with Federal or Axis. I want them to come to Jupiter because they want to bank with Jupiter,” he said.</p>
<p>In the next 12 months, the startup hopes to serve more than 1 million customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some Clubhouse users were treated to a surprise feature in their favorite app, but it wasn&#8217;t long for this world. A new UI element called &#8220;backchannel&#8221; popped up briefly before disappearing late last week, pointing the Clubhouse faithful to a new area of the app and generating plenty of chatter among users ready for more ways to connect.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>While the backchannel screen was totally blank without so much as a text entry box, it looks like the company is working on building out the text chat feature that Clubhouse CEO Paul Davison<a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/1407093899147939846"> previously discussed in a company town hall</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;. I think that there are so many people who do DM backchannels all the time, so many people who want to deepen friendships and relationships with people and do all sorts of other stuff — I think this is something that we should have,&#8221; Davison said.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The Clubhouse co-founder went on to say that building the feature to suit the app&#8217;s use cases won&#8217;t be trivial and wouldn&#8217;t be happening right away. He also declined to elaborate on if the app would add traditional one-on-one DMs or a more open group text chat feature.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, Clubhouse didn&#8217;t dissuade TechCrunch from the assumption that a messaging feature is around the corner, but issued a coy statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;As part of our product building process, Clubhouse regularly explores and tests potential features,&#8221; a Clubhouse spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;These functions sometimes become part of the app, sometimes they don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">new Clubhouse copycat app Greenroom</a> offers its own live text chatroom that users can access by swiping right in the app, giving it a bit of flexibility that Clubhouse has yet to offer. From the looks of the Clubhouse backchannel feature, it also lives in a window accessed through swiping, though that&#8217;s obviously subject to change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile commerce is where it&#8217;s at, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/charles/">rising</a> investment in so-called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/yalo-raises-50m-to-build-c-commerce-services-for-chat-apps-like-whatsapp/">conversational commerce</a> startups underscores the opportunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.viacustomers.com/">Via</a>, a two-year-old, Bay Area-based startup, is among those riding the wave, having identified some trends that are becoming clearer by the month. First, more e-commerce sales will be on mobile phones this year than desktops (as much as 70% by some estimates), people tend to read text messages almost immediately, and consumers spend upwards of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266925/adult-daily-mobile-messaging-app-engagement-usa/">30 minutes a day</a> engaging with mobile messaging apps.</p>
<p>Via also insists that unlike an expanding pool of startups that are focused on helping retailers and others broadcast their marketing messages in SMS, there&#8217;s room for a player to better address the many other pieces that add up to a happy consumer experience, from delivering coupon codes to starting the returns process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, according to co-founder and CEO Tejas Konduru &#8212; a Brigham Young grad whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from India and who have themselves worked at tech startups &#8212; one insight his now 50-person company had early on was that despite that so many of their customers now use the mobile browser to visit and shop from their stores, many retailers use website builders like Shopify or BigCommerce to &#8220;cram everything everything into mobile, leaving only enough space for, like, one picture and a Buy button.&#8221; Konduru figured there must be a way to take the<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> shopping experience that all these customers have with brands on their website and make them happen in a quick, mobile-native way.</span></p>
<p>Via&#8217;s solution, he says, is to help those businesses interact with customers on the devices and apps they use most often. &#8220;When someone uses Shopify or BigCommerce or any of those platforms,&#8221; says Konduru, &#8220;we also connect it to Via, and it basically takes the entire shopping experience and allows [customers] to quickly swipe right through a menu or like through a catalog on, for example, Facebook Messenger. Via will also create like a native iOS Android app by taking a website, cloning it into a native iOS Android app, then sell the push notification in-app chat layer. Essentially,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;anytime someone shops on the phone and they&#8217;re not using the browser is what Via is handling.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;message&#8221; seems to be getting through to the right people. Via, which launched last year, says it now employs 54 people on a full-time basis, has 190 brands as customers and just secured $15 million in Series A funding led by Footwork, the new venture firm co-founded by former Stitch Fix COO Mike Smith and former Shasta Ventures investor Nikhil Basu Trivedi.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hJh05vkpFr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/charles/">Charles raises €6.4M seed to bring &#8216;conversational commerce&#8217; to WhatsApp</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Charles raises €6.4M seed to bring &#8216;conversational commerce&#8217; to WhatsApp&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/charles/embed/#?secret=hJh05vkpFr" data-secret="hJh05vkpFr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Other participants in the round include Peterson Ventures, where Konduru once interned; famed founder Josh James of Domo, where Konduru also once interned; and a long list of other notable individual investors, including Ryan Smith of Qualtrics and Lattice co-founder and CEO Jack Altman.</p>
<p>As for how the company charges, it doesn&#8217;t ask for a monthly or yearly fee, as per traditional SaaS companies, but instead charges per interaction, whether that&#8217;s an SMS or a voice minute or video or a GIF.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s starting to add up, according to Konduru, who says that Via&#8217;s average customer is seeing 15 times return on its investment and that from May of 2020 &#8212; when the company&#8217;s service went live &#8212; through December, the company generated $51 million in sales. Konduru declined to say exactly how much Via saw from those transactions, but says the company is on track to reach $10 million in annual recurring revenue this year.</p>
<p>As for how brands get started with Via, it&#8217;s pretty simple, by the company&#8217;s telling. As long as a company is using a commerce platform &#8212; from Shopfiy to WooCommerce to Salesforce &#8212; it takes just five minutes or so to produce a mobile app with a menu featuring the types of interactions the brand can enable via Via&#8217;s platform, says Konduru.</p>

<p>Konduru, who dabbled in investment banking before deciding to launch Via, says he isn&#8217;t surprised by the startup&#8217;s fast traction, though he says he has been taken aback by the breadth of conversations the company sees. While he imagined Via would be a strong marketing channel for brands that use the platform to push out notifications about abandoned shopping carts and upcoming deliveries, it&#8217;s more of a two-way street than he&#8217;d imagined.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every month, there are maybe 15,000 people who start the returns process through Via and will get a notification from a channel that Via supports. But suddenly &#8212; let&#8217;s say the customer gets the wrong T-shirt size &#8212; people start communicating with the brand. You see everything from fan appreciation to address changes to messaging about bad discount codes to where&#8217;s-my-order type exchanges. That&#8217;s something I didn&#8217;t expect,&#8221; says Konduru, who says that before raising its Series A round, Via raised $4.2 million in seed funding led by Peterson Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that people would just look at the notification and, like, move it into the abyss somewhere. Instead, people start interacting with the brand.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s efforts to bring advertising to the Oculus virtual reality platform it has spent billions of dollars building out doesn&#8217;t seem to be off to a great start.</p>
<p>The company announced last week that they were planning to roll out their first in-game ads inside the title &#8220;Blaston&#8221; from the prolific VR game developer Resolution Games, and just days later the game studio has shared that after hearing an earful from users they&#8217;ve decided to abandon the ad rollout.</p>
<p>&#8220;After listening to player feedback, we realize that Blaston isn’t the best fit for this type of advertising test,&#8221; a tweet from the <a href="https://twitter.com/BlastonGame/status/1407059903617896450">Blaston</a> account read. &#8220;Therefore, we no longer plan to implement the test. We look forward to seeing you in the arena and hope you try the Crackdown Update that went live today!&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This potential ad rollout had been particularly noteworthy because the ads were being tested inside a title from a third-party developer. Facebook has purchased a handful of VR studios in recent months and owns a number of the most popular Quest titles inside its marketplace, so the opportunity to roll out advertising with a third-party partner gave Facebook a chance to frame the advertising rollout as a way for other developers to open up their monetization channels, rather than for Facebook to do so.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The announcement last week still brought out plenty of critics in the VR community who weren&#8217;t thrilled about Facebook&#8217;s broader struggles with balancing advertising efforts with user privacy, but other users seemed to be more annoyed by the prospect of ads being rolled out inside a paid title they had already purchased. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Blaston retails for $9.99 in the Oculus store.</span></p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong><em>Resolution Games reached out to TechCrunch with a statement, floating the possibility of further ad tests down the road inside one of the developer&#8217;s free apps. &#8220;To make it clear, we realize that Blaston isn’t the best fit for this type of advertising test. As an alternative, we are looking to see if it is feasible to move this small, temporary test to our free game, Bait! sometime in the future.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Resolution Games abandoning the test before it even started is an early setback for Facebook&#8217;s VR advertising efforts that showcases just how skeptical the Oculus platform&#8217;s most vocal users still are of Facebook. In a blog post last week, Facebook sought to address early concerns with what user data would be used to serve up advertising in VR, specifically noting that conversations recorded by the headset&#8217;s microphone and images analyzed by the onboard tracking cameras would not be used.</p>
<p>Facebook saw considerable backlash last year from virtual reality fans when they shared that new headset owners would need a Facebook account in order to activate their devices. While criticism poured in following the announcement, the recently released $299 Quest 2 headset has already outsold all of Facebook&#8217;s previous VR devices combined, the company has said.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Facebook for comment.</p>
