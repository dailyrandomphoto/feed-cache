										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/federal-trade-commission" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="federal-trade-commission">FTC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is ordering the companies behind many of the largest social and video platforms to explain how they use the treasure troves of data they harvest from users. Amazon, TikTok owner ByteDance, Facebook, WhatsApp, Discord, Reddit, Snap, Twitter and YouTube <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-issues-orders-nine-social-media-video-streaming-services">were all sent the order</a>, with a deadline set 45 days from now.</p>
<p>The FTC&#8217;s focus is on how these companies &#8220;collect, use, and present personal information, their advertising and user engagement practices, and how their practices affect children and teens.&#8221; Four of the FTC&#8217;s commissioners voted in favor of the order, with Commissioner Noah Joshua Phillips dissenting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite their central role in our daily lives, the decisions that prominent online platforms make regarding consumers and consumer data remain shrouded in secrecy,&#8221; Commissioners Rohit Chopra, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Christine S. Wilson said in a joint statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Policymakers and the public are in the dark about what social media and video streaming services do to capture and sell users’ data and attention. It is alarming that we still know so little about companies that know so much about us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The FTC&#8217;s new fact-finding mission is the latest federal action to put tech in its crosshairs, following last week&#8217;s news that the agency would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">sue Facebook over antitrust violations</a>. The new order was issued under Section 6(b) of the FTC Act as a study of tech industry practices. It isn&#8217;t coupled with any law enforcement action, but that doesn&#8217;t preclude the agency from pursuing enforcement options with what it finds.</p>
<p>Last year the FTC signaled a deeper interest in tech, particularly on antitrust issues. The agency launched a purpose-built tech task force to monitor acquisitions and other potential competition-crushing behavior that raises red flags. In early 2020, the FTC launched an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/ftc-to-examine-every-acquisition-by-alphabet-amazon-apple-facebook-and-microsoft-in-2010-2019-over-antitrust-issues/">extensive separate study</a> examining nearly a decade&#8217;s worth of acquisitions made by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft.</p>

<p>As part of the settlement, Pinterest will pay $20 million to Brougher and her attorneys, and both Pinterest and Brougher will commit $2.5 million toward &#8220;Advancing women and underrepresented communities&#8221; in the tech industry, <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001506293/3fef4e2e-328e-449a-8971-469b1f68011a.pdf">the company wrote in a filing</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pinterest recognizes the importance of fostering a workplace environment that is diverse, equitable and inclusive and will continue its actions to improve its culture,&#8221; Pinterest and Brougher said in a joint statement detailing the settlement. &#8220;Francoise welcomes the meaningful steps Pinterest has taken to improve its workplace environment and is encouraged that Pinterest is committed to building a culture that allows all employees to feel included and supported.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shortly after Brougher went public with her claims, Pinterest employees staged a walkout in response to her accusations as well as in response to the claims of two former Black Pinterest employees. Prior to Brougher&#8217;s claims, <a href="https://twitter.com/erikashimizu/status/1272547227177713664">Aerica Shimizu Banks</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ifeomaozoma/status/1272546213322080258">Ifeoma Ozoma</a> accused Pinterest of racial discrimination.</p>
<p>In addition to the walkout, <a href="https://www.coworker.org/petitions/put-an-end-to-all-forms-of-discrimination-and-retaliation-at-pinterest-1">a petition circulated throughout the company demanding systemic change</a>. The change they sought entailed full transparency about promotion levels and retention, total compensation package transparency and for the people within two layers of reporting to the CEO to be at least 25% women and 8% underrepresented employees.</p>
<p>Since then, Pinterest has notably made some changes at the board level. A couple of days after the walkout, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/pinterest-announces-first-black-board-member/">Pinterest announced Andrea Wishom as the company&#8217;s first-ever Black board member</a>. In October, Pinterest added its second Black board member, Salaam Coleman Smith.</p>
<p>Pinterest says it has also enhanced its hiring and interview processes to try to improve diversity at senior levels, updated its inclusion training and launched an internal wiki detailing how Pinterest makes compensation decisions.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a difficult time to be a photographer. Getting creative feels impossible when every day is the same and the most exotic locale you visit is the living room. Travel is out this year, vacations are pushed back and everybody is cooped up inside trying not to lose it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything is hard in like 12 different ways right now, but encouraging your friends and fam to immerse themselves in new hobbies and plan future adventures is a great distraction. For photographers at a loss for what to shoot this year, it&#8217;s the perfect time to mix things up, switch up your gear entirely and try to see the world with fresh eyes.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might not seem like it, but it’s actually the perfect time to get into instant photography. As a photographer myself, I haven’t picked up my main camera in months. Nothing feels inspiring. But I started carrying a cheap instant camera on walks around my neighborhood, rain permitting, and it’s been a meditative way to appreciate the beauty of small things that otherwise just blend into my routine. This Fujifilm Instax shoots larger, square photos and they look great popping up in an Instagram feed too if you&#8217;re in it for the &#8216;gram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another good option: The Fujifilm Instax Mini 11 Camera </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">creates smaller, rectangular photos and it’s playful design makes it perfect for anyone.</span></p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Fujifilm Instax, <a href="https://www.adorama.com/fjim16581458.html?CategoryID=240274">$80 from Adorama</a> | Fujifilm Instax Mini, <a href="https://www.target.com/p/fujifilm-mini-11-cloud-green-camera/-/A-79785394">$70 from Target</a></p>
<h2><strong>GoPro Hero8 Black</strong></h2>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mh-x8kbJT5k?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<h3></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a year when we can’t do a lot of the things we’d normally enjoy, many of the safest, most enjoyable things are outdoors. If your giftee is an adrenaline junkie (climbing, snowboarding, surfing, etc.) the latest GoPro is a no-brainer for in-the-moment action stills or video that you could never capture otherwise. But like an instant camera, a GoPro can also be a really fun way to switch things up for nonadventure photography. I brought one along on my honeymoon and ended up shooting stills with it half the time even when I wasn’t in the water — having a teeny indestructible pocket camera just feels really fun and different.</span></p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>$280<a href="https://www.rei.com/product/170238/gopro-hero8-black-camera?"> from REI</a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve met a photographer who has enough memory cards, I’d like to know their secret. These SD cards are fast, reliable and widely compatible. Much like socks, SD cards have a way of vanishing and you never have enough of them even though it feels like you buy them all the time. Good stocking material! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know someone who (a) wants a super compact travel camera, (b) wants to get into photography but doesn’t care about interchangeable lenses or (c) needs a small camera for anything, really? Sony’s been killing it in compact photography for years now and the RX100 series is a testament to everything it does right. The RX100 VII is an incredible camera in a really small package, capable of taking everything from beginner night sky photos and professional-looking portraits to casual photos and everything in between. Since it’s got full manual settings, new photographers can go as deep as they’d like and anyone who wants to keep it simple can stay in full auto and snap away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Since Sony is in the 6th generation of the RX100, you can find old versions for screaming good deals and you won’t even know what you’re missing. Just stick with the RX100 III on up for the included viewfinder.</span></p>

Or someone who wants to start shooting but likes the process of researching and picking things out themselves? A gift card to New York-based photography supercenter B&amp;H is a solid choice. They’ve got a robust online shop where you can buy anything and everything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a weird year and we’ve all learned weird new stuff about ourselves. In my case, I have learned the weird new fact that coyotes are frequently roaming around my fairly urban backyard eating people’s pets. (Sad but also interesting!) With entertainment options slim and monotony all but guaranteed, a lot of people are paying more attention to backyard and neighborhood wildlife lately.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of photographers, myself included, have switched over from DSLRs to full-frame mirrorless cameras in recent years, and for good reason. Mirrorless cameras are smaller and lighter, but that used to mean compromising on image quality in the name of portability. Those days are long over. New mirrorless cameras have image quality on par with their larger, more traditional counterparts and their light weight and smaller size makes them easier to cart around for stuff like travel, street or outdoor photography. You really can’t go very wrong with most of the full-frame mirrorless options out there, but Sony’s a7 III is perfect for anyone getting serious about photography. The brand new Sony a7C is another mirrorless full-frame also worth a look if you want an even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compact option on the cutting edge of what small cameras can do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your loved one one of those pretentious film photography people who talks about how digital ruined the art and nothing feels as good as a film camera? Well for one they’re kind of right. But you might be able to delight them nonetheless with the latest from Fujifilm&#8217;s’s extremely well-loved X100 series. It’s about as close as you can get to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">je ne sais quoi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of shooting with film, offering lots of little touches (classic design! an ISO dial!) that capture some of the magic of film photography. This is another option where you can save significant $$$ by finding a new last-generation version on the cheap. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compact mirrorless cameras are having an extended moment right now, but sometimes a regular DSLR is a better choice. For anyone learning the basics of photography for the first time, a “cropped sensor” DSLR (versus a pro-level full-frame DSLR) is really a better starting place in some ways. These camera bodies and their lenses are larger, but they’re generally more tactile in a way that will help new photographers build up a good foundation of knowledge. These bodies usually come with a “kit lens” (18-55mm) that’s not terribly impressive, but if you also pick up a cheap 50mm f/1.8 your budding photog will have plenty to play around with. Whether you go Nikon or Canon, it really doesn’t matter — just pick a horse and ride it. Did we mention these are great, affordable choices for a teen who’s just getting into photography? They are!</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Now more than ever, IT teams play a vital role in keeping their businesses running smoothly and securely. With all of the assets and data that are now broadly distributed, a CEO depends on their IT team to ensure employees remain connected and productive and that sensitive data remains protected.</p>
<p>CEOs often visualize and measure things in terms of dollars and cents, and in the face of continuing uncertainty, IT &#8212; along with most other parts of the business &#8212; is facing intense scrutiny and tightening of budgets. So, it is more important than ever to be able to demonstrate that they’ve made sound technology investments and have the agility needed to operate successfully in the face of continued uncertainty.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			For a CEO to properly understand risk exposure and make the right investments, IT departments have to be able to confidently communicate what types of data are on any given device at any given time.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Here are five questions that IT teams should be ready to answer when their CEO comes calling:</p>
<h2>What have we spent our money on?</h2>
<p>Or, more specifically, exactly how many assets do we have? And, do we know where they are? While these seem like basic questions, they can be shockingly difficult to answer … much more difficult than people realize. The last several months in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak have been the proof point.</p>
<p>With the mass exodus of machines leaving the building and disconnecting from the corporate network, many IT leaders found themselves guessing just how many devices had been released into the wild and gone home with employees.</p>
<p>One CIO we spoke to estimated they had “somewhere between 30,000 and 50,000 devices” that went home with employees, meaning there could have been up to 20,000 that were completely unaccounted for. The complexity was further compounded as old devices were pulled out of desk drawers and storage closets to get something into the hands of employees who were not equipped to work remotely. Companies had endpoints connecting to corporate network and systems that they hadn’t seen for years — meaning they were out-of-date from a security perspective as well.</p>
<p>This level of uncertainty is obviously unsustainable and introduces a tremendous amount of security risk. Every endpoint that goes unaccounted for not only means wasted spend but also increased vulnerability, greater potential for breach or compliance violation, and more. In order to mitigate these risks, there needs to be a permanent connection to every device that can tell you exactly how many assets you have deployed at any given time — whether they are in the building or out in the wild.</p>
<h2>Are our devices and data protected?</h2>
<p>Device and data security go hand in hand; without the ability to see every device that is deployed across an organization, it becomes next to impossible to know what data is living on those devices. When employees know they are leaving the building and going to be off network, they tend to engage in “data hoarding.”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roblox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roblox">Roblox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced today that it&#8217;s buying a digital avatar startup called <a href="https://loomai.com/product">Loom.ai</a>. Purchasing a company that has focused singularly on creating more realistic human avatars is an interesting play for a gaming platform that has made such an impact by building experiences that tend to cast realism to the wayside.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/13/loom-ai-is-building-an-avatar-that-can-capture-your-personality/">covered the company&#8217;s $1.35 million seed round</a> back in 2016. Since then, it has brought in additional seed funding, scoring $5.9 million in total capital raised. The startup&#8217;s investors include Y Combinator, Samsung Ventures, Anorak Ventures and Zach Coelius.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Loom.ai was one in a long list of avatar companies to launch during the mid 2010&#8217;s that capitalized on computer vision advancements and aimed to build out a cross-game/cross-platform network of users that relied on their tech to create in-app avatars. This field of companies aimed to capitalize on opportunities in 3D that expanded beyond what companies like Snapchat had identified following its Bitmoji acquisition.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086876" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086876" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2086876 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-12.52.56-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="487" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-12.52.56-PM.jpg 1702w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-12.52.56-PM.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-12.52.56-PM.jpg?resize=300,215 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-12.52.56-PM.jpg?resize=768,551 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-12.52.56-PM.jpg?resize=680,487 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-12.52.56-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1101 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-12.52.56-PM.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086876" class="wp-caption-text">Image via Loom.ai</p></div></p>
<p>Over the years, Loom.ai shifted its effort from photorealism to creating more Memoji-like representations that allowed users to upload a 2D photo and automatically create a realistic 3D avatar. In recent years, Loom.ai focused heavily on enterprise opportunities. The company&#8217;s products also included a suite of integrations to build out personalized avatar stickers that could be used on messaging platforms like Slack or WhatsApp as well as live avatars that could be used during video calls.</p>
<p>Though Roblox has some of the more simplistic avatars on the market, this acquisition may suggest that the company is open to building out a system that places more of a premium on realism and more life-like facial animations. In a press release announcing the deal, Roblox shared that this acquisition &#8220;will accelerate the development of next-generation avatars.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After nearly a decade selling gaming and console peripherals to gamers looking to spice up their systems, Atlanta-based <a href="https://www.kontrolfreek.com/">KontrolFreek</a> has been acquired by the international peripherals retailer, <a href="https://steelseries.com/">SteelSeries.</a></p>
<p>Terms of the acquisition were undisclosed, but <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kontrolfreek" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kontrolfreek">KontrolFreek <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has shipped over 2 million units of its flagship product, which is available in over 9,000 retailers in 60 countries and can be found in over 16 online marketplaces.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not bad for a company that was founded 11 years ago with a $50,000 check from <a href="https://www.blhventures.com/team/">BLH Venture Partners</a>, the Atlanta-based investment firm co-founded by Billy L. Harbert and Ashish Mistry. Mistry, a co-founder of Virtex Networks and later an early team member at Air Defense.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Neither Harbert nor Mistry were much for gaming, but they did see the opportunity in selling peripherals to the folks who were, Mistry said in a direct message.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huge markets have large niches,&#8221; Mistry wrote.</p>
<p>By acquiring KontrolFreek, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/steelseries" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="steelseries">SteelSeries <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is further consolidating its position in the console gaming market by folding one of the leading sellers of high-performance controller accessories into its portfolio of products. Earlier this year, SteelSeries nabbed A-volute, which provides three dimensional sound systems for games.</p>
<p>SteelSeries also gets a vibrant user generated media property in KontrolFreek&#8217;s <a href="https://www.kontrolfreek.com/pages/freeknation">FreekNation</a> community, which boasts 4 million community members.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the next-generation consoles at the forefront of the gaming industry’s mind, there’s never been a better time to maximize our ability to provide the best gaming experiences and products to console gamers,” said Ehtisham Rabbani, CEO of SteelSeries. “With KontrolFreek’s expertise and global popularity, we know they’ll open new opportunities to entertain, delight, and assist new gamers across the world.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA["I think that having objective sources of fact checking are important. We know that fact-checking does reduce the belief in and sharing of fake information."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More than 3.6 billion people use social media, and its runaway success has left the industry at a crossroads. There are now heated debates in Washington and Brussels over the future of antitrust regulation for this market, whether platform operators should filter certain content (and if so, which types), and how to open the market to new innovators.</p>
<p>To find my way through this thicket of interesting questions, I spoke with <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/sinan-kayhan-aral">Sinan Aral</a>, a professor of management at the MIT Sloan School of Management who also co-leads MIT’s Initiative on the Digital Economy. He has spent years analyzing the social media market, directly participating in its development as chief scientist of SocialAmp and Humin and as a founding partner of Manifest Capital.</p>
<p>This fall, he published his latest book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/570128/the-hype-machine-by-sinan-aral/">&#8220;The Hype Machine,&#8221;</a> which explores what’s next for social media giants. In our discussion, we talked about the landscape of the market today, what responsibilities companies and users have to each other and what come next as the industry evolves.</p>
<p><i>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</i></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: Why don’t we start with how the book came together and how you got interested in this topic of digital media and how it affects our decision-making?</strong></p>
<p><b>Sinan Aral</b>: I started researching social media four years before Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook. I have worked with all of the major social media platforms for the last 20 years: Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, WeChat, Yahoo and the rest. I’ve published a number of very large-scale studies, and I’m also an entrepreneur. So, I’ve got a vantage point as a practitioner, but also as a long-time academic leader in this area.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			We really have a full-blown social media crisis on our hands, as is obvious if you turn on the TV on any given day.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The reason why I wrote &#8220;The Hype Machine&#8221; is because essentially, we’ve seen this coming to a head for many years now. We really have a full-blown social media crisis on our hands, as is obvious if you turn on the TV on any given day.</p>
<p>My book takes off from where &#8220;The Social Dilemma&#8221; documentary and Shoshana Zuboff’s &#8220;The Age of Surveillance Capitalism&#8221; leave off, which is to ask, what can we concretely do to solve the social media crisis that we find ourselves in? The book argues that in order to do that, we have to stop armchair theorizing about how social media works, and we have to stop debating whether or not social media is good or evil. The answer is yes.</p>
<p>The book goes through the fundamentals of how social media works. So, there’s a chapter on neuroscience and social media, and economics and social media, and that eventually informs the solutions in the book, which cover everything from antitrust and competition to federal privacy legislation. How do we secure our elections and our democracy? What do we do about Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act? How do we balance free speech and hate speech? How do we deal with misinformation and fake news?</p>
<p><strong>I think for a lot of us in tech, we’re a bit stuck. On one hand, these technologies have produced jarring amounts of wealth in the tech industry, but they have also caused a large number of harms. What do we do next?</strong></p>
<p>Let me start by saying that the general framework of the solution is about what I call the four levers: money, code, norms and laws.</p>
<p>Money is the business models, which create the incentives for how the advertisers on the platforms and the users behave. Code is how we design the platforms and the algorithms underlying the platforms, which I go into in great detail. Norms are how we adopt, appropriate and use the technology. And obviously, laws are regulation.</p>
<p>In terms of solutions, I think the entry ticket for solving the social media crisis is creating competition in the social media economy. Platforms that lack competition don’t have any incentive to change away from the attention economy and their engagement-driven business models, nor do they have any real incentive to clean up their negative externalities in our information ecosystem, whether it’s hate speech or misinformation or manipulation.</p>
<p>Now, when I say competition, the first thing on everyone’s mind is always, “Oh, you mean break up Facebook.” But the point I make in the book — and I take a very clear stance on this — is that breaking up Facebook in this economy doesn’t solve the problem. This economy runs on network effects. The value of these platforms is a function of the number of users on the platform. Economies that run on network effects tend toward concentration and monopoly.</p>
<p>So, if you break up Facebook, it’s just going to tip the next Facebook-like company into market dominance. What we really need is structural reform of the social media economy, and that involves social network portability, data portability and interoperability legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Let me push back on this a bit though. Terms like “data portability” always sound nice as a solution, but have we ever effectively used this tool to open a market?</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that we’ve done this. During the AOL-Time Warner merger, we forced AOL’s AIM product to become interoperable with Yahoo Messenger and MSN Messenger. And it went from a 65% market share to a 59% market share one year later, down to like 50%, then it ceded the entire market to new entrants three years later.</p>
<p>Another good analogy is number portability in the cell phone market. It used to be that you couldn’t take your cell phone number with you when you switched from one cell phone provider to another, and then we legislated that they had to let you take your number with you. That was akin to a social network at the time, because all of your friends knew to call you at that number.</p>
<p>Research has shown that number portability created about $880 million of consumer surplus every quarter for years and years after it was instituted in Europe, and it created a lot of competition. We should have something very similar in social networks, around social network portability and data portability, so that we could create competition.</p>
<p>Now, if you break up Facebook after these kinds of structural reforms to the market, that’s a different question, but breaking up Facebook without structural reforms to the market economy is like putting a Band-Aid on a tumor. It’s not going to solve the underlying lack of competition that the social media economy has.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hype Machine&#8221; details how we might do that and suggests that there could be a stack of commodity messaging formats that would be required to be interoperable. Then, you could have unique messaging formats for every platform on top of that. But things like texts, short-form videos, stories that either persist or disappear, that kind of stuff should have a level of interoperability that’s legislated. The entry ticket to solving the social media crisis is creating competition.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/indie-gogo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="indie-gogo">Indiegogo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> plans to help more Japanese entrepreneurs run successful crowdfunding campaigns through <a href="https://go.indiegogo.com/blog/2020/12/now-in-japan-the-indiegogo-global-fast-track-program.html">a new expansion of its Global Fast Track Program</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/05/indiegogo-china-global-fast-track/"> Indiegogo first launched the program several years ago in China</a>. The idea behind Global Fast Track is to provide an extra level of support to entrepreneurs in specific markets, guiding them through the process of creating campaigns for global consumers, particularly those in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>In fact, Lu Li, the general manager for Indiegogo&#8217;s global strategy, told me that the program has already supported more than 670 entrepreneurs launching campaigns, with 40 of those campaigns raising $1 million or more. To support this, Indiegogo has a team in China &#8220;doing sales and marketing and really focusing on bringing on the most high-quality campaigns,&#8221; Li said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And although there have already been <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/atmoph-window-2-smart-display-with-1-000-views#/">successful campaigns launched from Japan</a>, it sounds like Indiegogo will be expanding its presence in a similar way in Japan. In this case, it&#8217;s also partnering with the <a href="https://www.jetro.go.jp">Japanese External Trade Organization</a> (JETRO).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PkweizkRqN"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/05/indiegogo-china-global-fast-track/">Indiegogo expands its efforts to help Chinese startups reach global consumers</a></p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;We are very excited to announce JETRO’s partnership with Indiegogo,&#8221; said Noriya Tarutani, executive director of JETRO San Francisco, in a statement. &#8220;Thanks to more than 40% annual growth of crowdfunding in Japan in recent years, we have been receiving a lot of inquiries from Japanese startups about how they can leverage crowdfunding as a way to bring their amazing products to the global market. We are confident that our collaboration will be mutually beneficial to Indiegogo as they enter Japan, as well as Japanese startups expanding overseas.”</p>
<p>In addition, Indiegogo says it will start supporting campaigns using Japanese yen, and it will also showcase campaigns from the country through a &#8220;Made in Japan&#8221; collection.</p>
<p>Indiegogo CEO Andy Yang said that this is the right time to expand into Japan because of a &#8220;vibrant startup ecosystem&#8221; that has emerged in recent years to challenge the dominance of traditional giants.</p>
<p>Yang added that the company has become cashflow positive, and that it has continued to see growth during the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a crowdfunding peak or heyday in 2016, and then the industry overall went through an awkward period where entrepreneurs were still learning and backers are still trying to understand what to expect,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That’s a continually evolving process &#8230; but we&#8217;re seeing lot of great tailwinds, specifically from entrepreneurs with a lot of appetite to find new sales channels.&#8221;</p>

<p>The much-requested feature is arriving as an “early preview,” essentially meaning that users will have to opt-in to receive the firmware prior to wide release &#8212; though the company insists that it’s not a software beta, offering essentially the same experience as the wide release version.</p>

<p>To use it, Nest Hub Max owners need a free or paid Zoom account. Users need to link their account to the device and add the invite to Google Calendar to host a meeting. The feature will also take advantage (where applicable) of a new feature for Google and Nest Wifi that prioritizes teleconferencing for wireless bandwidth.</p>
<p>Zoom is one of many video conferencing services already available on Facebook’s Portal line. Amazon announced in August that the software would be arriving on its Echo Show devices before the end of the year, but has yet to give a firm date. As for the standard Nest Hub, that Google display doesn’t have a camera for privacy reasons.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At Apple&#8217;s Worldwide Developers Conference in June, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/heres-everything-apple-announced-in-the-wwdc-2020-keynote-today/">announced</a> it would soon require developers to disclose their app&#8217;s privacy practices to customers via new, glanceable summaries that appear on their apps&#8217; product pages on the App Store. Today, these new app privacy labels are going live across all of Apple&#8217;s App Stores, including iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS.</p>
<p>On the developers&#8217; side, Apple began requiring developers to submit their privacy practices with the submission of new apps and app updates. However, it hadn&#8217;t begun to publish this information on the App Stores until today.</p>
<p>The new labels aim to give Apple customers an easier way to understand what sort of information an app collects across three categories: data used to track you, data linked to you and data not linked to you. Tracking, Apple explains, refers to the act of linking either user or device data collected from an app with user or device data collected from other apps, websites or even offline properties (like data aggregated from retail receipts) that&#8217;s used for targeted advertising or advertisement measurement. It can also include sharing user or device data with data brokers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This aspect alone will expose the industry of third-party adtech and analytics SDKs (software development kits) &#8212; basically code from external vendors that developers add to their apps to boost their revenues.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, &#8220;data linked to you&#8221; is the personal information tied to your identity, through your user account on the app, your device or other details.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086717" style="width: 427px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086717" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2086717" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iPhone12Pro_AppStore_English.png?w=417" alt="" width="417" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iPhone12Pro_AppStore_English.png 6500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iPhone12Pro_AppStore_English.png?resize=92,150 92w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iPhone12Pro_AppStore_English.png?resize=184,300 184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iPhone12Pro_AppStore_English.png?resize=768,1252 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iPhone12Pro_AppStore_English.png?resize=417,680 417w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iPhone12Pro_AppStore_English.png?resize=942,1536 942w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iPhone12Pro_AppStore_English.png?resize=1256,2048 1256w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iPhone12Pro_AppStore_English.png?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086717" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Broken down, there are a number of data types apps may collect on their users, including things like personal contact information (e.g. address, email, phone, etc.); health and fitness information (eg. from the Clinical Health Records API, HealthKit API, MovementDisorderAPIs or health-related human subject research); financial information (e.g. payment and credit info); location (either precise or coarse); contacts; user content (e.g. emails, audio, texts, gameplay, customer support, etc.); browsing and search histories; purchases; identifiers like user or device IDs; usage and diagnostic info; and more.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Q8SAlRxCuV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/heres-everything-apple-announced-in-the-wwdc-2020-keynote-today/">Here&#8217;s everything Apple announced in the WWDC 2020 keynote today</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Here&#8217;s everything Apple announced in the WWDC 2020 keynote today&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/heres-everything-apple-announced-in-the-wwdc-2020-keynote-today/embed/#?secret=Q8SAlRxCuV" data-secret="Q8SAlRxCuV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Developers are expected to understand not only what data their app may collect, but also how it&#8217;s ultimately used.</p>
<p>For example, if an app shares user data with a third-party partner, the developer will need to know what data that partner uses and for what purposes &#8212; like displaying targeted ads in the app, sharing location data or email lists with a data broker, using data for retargeting users in other apps or measuring ad efficiencies. And while the developer will need to disclose when they&#8217;re collecting data from Apple frameworks or services, they aren&#8217;t responsible for disclosing data collected by Apple itself.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to the new disclosure requirements, including data collected in optional feedback forms or customer service requests. But, in general, almost any data an app collects has to be disclosed. Even Apple&#8217;s own apps that aren&#8217;t offered on the App Store <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/09/apple-apps-will-show-privacy-labels/">will have</a> their privacy labels published on the web.</p>
<p>Apps will also be required to include a link to their publicly accessible privacy policy and can optionally now include a link to a page explaining their privacy choices in more detail. For example, they could link to a page where users can manage their data for the app or request deletion.</p>
<p>The privacy information itself is presented on a screen in the app&#8217;s product listing page in easy-to-read tabs that explain what data is collected across the different categories, starting with &#8220;data used to track you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple says it will not remove apps from the App Store if they don&#8217;t include this privacy information, but it&#8217;s no longer allowing apps to update until their privacy information is listed. That means, eventually, all apps that haven&#8217;t been abandoned will include these details.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s decision to implement privacy labels is a big win for consumer privacy and could establish a new baseline for how app stores disclose data.</p>
<p>However, they also arrive at a time when Apple is pushing its own adtech agenda under the banner of being a privacy-forward company. The company is forcing the adtech industry to shift from the identifier IDFA to its own SKAdNetwork &#8212; a shakeup that&#8217;s been controversial enough for <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/09/08/ios-14-privacy-feature-delay-will-help-advertisers-cope-with-revenue-hit">Apple to delay</a> the transition from 2020 to 2021. The decision to delay may have been, as Apple stated, to give marketers panicked about the sizable revenue hit, time to adapt. But Apple is, of course, keenly aware that regulators were weighing whether the App Store was behaving in anticompetitive ways toward third-parties.</p>
<p>Facebook, for example, had warned businesses <a href="https://www.facebook.com/audiencenetwork/news-and-insights/preparing-audience-network-for-ios14">they would see a 50% drop</a> in Audience Network revenue on iOS as a result of the changes that would remove personalization from mobile app ad install campaigns.</p>
<p>Apple, in the meantime, took some of the regulatory heat off itself by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">reducing its App Store commissions</a> to 15% for developers making less than $1 million.</p>
<p>As all these consumer privacy changes are underway, Apple itself continues to use its customer data <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074">to personalize ads in its own apps</a>, including the App Store and Apple News. These settings, which are enabled by default, can be toggled off in the iPhone&#8217;s Settings. App publishers, on the other hand, will soon have to ask permission from users to track them. And Apple now runs plenty of other services it could expand ads to in the future, if it chose.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how consumers react to these new privacy labels as they go live. Apps that collect too much data may find their downloads are impacted, as wary users pass them over. Or, consumers may end up ignoring the labels &#8212; much as they do the other policies and terms they &#8220;agree&#8221; to when installing new software.</p>
<p>Details about Apple&#8217;s privacy practices were also published today on a new website, <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple.com/privacy</a>, which includes not only the changes to the App Store, but lists all other areas where Apple protects consumer privacy.</p>
<p>The updates to the App Stores rolled out today alongside the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22163752/ios-14-3-proraw-airpods-max-fitness-plus-available-now-download">releases of iOS 14.3</a> / iPadOS 14.3 <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/14/apple-releases-macos-big-sur-11-1-with-airpods-max-support-and-app-store-privacy-labels/">and macOS Big Sur 11.1,</a> which also deliver updates to support <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/fitness-wont-replace-the-gym-but-it-will-help-you-break-a-sweat/">Apple Fitness+</a>, AirPods Max, the new ProRAW format, and more, in addition to the privacy labels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon today announced a new Alexa feature, Live Translation, that will translate conversations between people who speak two different languages. The feature uses Amazon&#8217;s speech recognition technology and neural machine translation technology to work, and supports translating between English and French, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese (Brazilian), German or Italian.</p>
<p>To use Live Translation, an Echo device owner can issue a voice command like &#8220;Alexa, translate French&#8221; to get started with translating between English and French. When you hear the beep, you can speak in either language, even taking natural pauses between your sentences, Amazon claims. Alexa will then automatically detect the language being spoken and translate each side of the conversation. On Echo Show devices, you can also see the translation in addition to hearing it.</p>
<p>To end a translation session, you say &#8220;Alexa, stop.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company had been revealed to be working on a universal language translation feature according to<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-aims-turn-alexa-universal-real-time-language-translator-150024721.html"> a 2018 report from Yahoo Finance.</a></p>
<p>The new addition may now make Alexa more competitive with Google devices, which can leverage Google&#8217;s existing Translate service via Google Assistant. Google Home devices had introduced the ability to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/05/google-home-can-now-translate-conversations-on-the-fly/">translate conversations on the fly in early 2019</a> across a wide range of languages through a feature called Interpreter Mode. Today, Interpreter Mode works across <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9234753?hl=en">many Google devices,</a> including smart speakers, smart displays, smart clocks and even Google Assistant on phones and tablets. However, when Google added live translation to its Pixel Buds, the <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/live-translation-pixel-buds">feature initially flopped</a>.</p>
<p>How well Alexa&#8217;s translation feature will work requires further testing after today&#8217;s launch.</p>
<p>Live translation is the latest in a series of language-focused updates for Echo devices.</p>
<p>The feature follows on last year&#8217;s introduction of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/11/alexa-now-speaks-spanish-including-in-multi-lingual-mode/">multilingual mode</a> for U.S. speakers, which allows Alexa users to speak a combination of English and Spanish, French and English, and Hindi and English, for example. Alexa can also translate a single word or phrase into more than 50 supported languages.</p>
<p>In addition to helping users better communicate, Amazon says the feature can be used for language learning and for communication between hotel guests and staff through Alexa for Hospitality, its platform designed for the hotel industry.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/12/technology/roblox-ipo.html">NYT reported</a> that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/what-is-roblox-worth/">gaming development platform</a> Roblox would delay its IPO into the new year. Its CEO informed employees that the hiatus would allow Roblox to &#8220;improve [its] specific process&#8221; for shareholders of all types.</p>

<hr />
<p>What the hell does that mean?</p>
<p>That after watching <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">shares of DoorDash, Airbnb and C3.ai soar last week</a>, Roblox doesn&#8217;t want to allow current shareholders to sell in the IPO, only to see the value of their now-sold shares open sharply higher. (The Roblox IPO has a line in its offering explanation that reserves the ability for existing shareholders to sell, implying liquidity for employees and investors; this makes the pricing issue more personal than academic.)</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995211 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>One delayed IPO isn&#8217;t such a bad thing. Roblox will still go out, we will still watch, it will still be interesting. But now fintech startup Affirm will likely delay its IPO as well, <a href="https://www.axios.com/roblox-ipo-affirm-delay-032685fe-3816-46fb-a50d-85979edf317c.html">Axios</a> and the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirm-postpones-initial-public-offering-sources-say-11607801619">WSJ report</a>. That&#8217;s two.</p>
<p>And if Affirm and Roblox delay, others may too. This morning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/equity-monday-ipo-delays-and-mega-deals-kickstart-the-week/">we asked on the Equity podcast</a> if there could be too much of a good thing. The answer appears to be yes, at least as far as IPO pops go. Investor enthusiasm was so high for last week&#8217;s mostly brand-name debuts that the whole well could be poisoned for a while.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>This is particularly grating as the 2021 IPO cohort could be massive. If you thought 2020 had a lot of deals, next year could really impress you. But only if the prevailing climate is right, it appears. Because if there is one thing we&#8217;ve learned about unicorns, it&#8217;s that they are spotlight-shy. Say &#8220;GAAP&#8221; too loudly and they tend to scatter.</p>
<p>But at some point unicorns <em>have</em> to exit. This is especially true today, as the birth rate of unicorns in the United States &#8212; the pace at which net-new startups reached a $1 billion valuation &#8212; rebounded in the third quarter. From a local minima of just 11 new unicorns in Q2 2020, 17 made the cut in the third quarter. That brought the number of unexited unicorns in the United States to 216 in the U.S. alone, according to <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/">CB Insights</a>.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Startups/Unicorns-surge-to-500-in-number-as-US-and-China-account-for-70">more than 500 unicorns in the world</a>, all of which will want to exit while stocks are at or near all-time highs.</p>
<p>If the liquidity train is derailed because some IPO did <em>too</em> well, I will lose my gosh-darn mind.</p>
<h2>What more do you want?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s somewhat amazing that we&#8217;re in this situation. The IPOs in question that present a <em>problem</em> did, in fact, incredibly well.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The mobile magazine publishing toolkit they developed was sold to Mic in 2017, but it was only the most recent success in a string of collaborations dating back nearly a decade.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a fascination for technology and all the great things you could do to improve society,&#8221; said Gilles, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/klima" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="klima">Klima&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> chief executive, in an interview earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Klima, which launched this month, is in some way the culmination of those efforts.</p>
<p>Gilles and Pursian first met in university and later with Brandau they launched their first app, Pino, a mobile-based video op-ed page that had German Chancellor Angela Merkel as an early contributor on the platform.</p>
<p>The connection to politics and media continued with Hyper, their publishing platform that sold to Mic, and continues with Klima. With the app, the three co-founders have taken their media savvy and applied it to getting consumers to reduce and neutralize their carbon emissions through offsets and behavioral changes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offsets can remedy and buy us a lot of time while we’re rebuilding our society,&#8221; said Gilles. &#8220;We need to get to 50% emissions reductions in the next 10 years which is a herculean task. We can’t afford to leave any climate solution on the table right now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like other apps, Klima has identified diet as one of the major personal steps a person can take to reduce their emissions footprint. Substituting cars with biking, or electric vehicles, and buying less fast-fashion and more used clothing also has an impact.  </span></p>
<p>Klima&#8217;s app includes a carbon calculator, which measures a carbon footprint and allows users to offset that with a personalized monthly subscription. The company&#8217;s app also provides lifestyle tips to reduce emissions. Finally it offers a social sharing feature so that other would-be climate warriors can join the fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have a special situation right now,&#8221; said Gilles. &#8220;What we are doing as founders. We know that the climate crisis is not taking a pause because of the pandemic. We have raised enough funding right now to still be there when the pandemic is over.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The company is backed by Jens Begemann, the founder of Wooga; Niklas Jansen, co-founder of Blinkist; Christian Reber, the founder of Pitch; and institutional investors including e.ventures, HV Holtzbrinck Ventures and 468 Capital.</p>
<p>To date, Klima has raised $5.8 million in financing. The company offers three types of offsets for its users. The first is natural solutions, like tree-planting projects; the second is tech-based solutions like solar power installations; and the third is social solutions, like replacing wood-burning cookstoves with electric or gas stoves for homes. <b></b></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen great traction with the app so far,&#8221; said Gilles. The company&#8217;s app is now live in 18 countries including the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and has the largest user base of any climate offset app currently on the market, the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sanchali Pal first woke up to the world&#8217;s climate crisis after <a href="http://www.documentarymania.com/player.php?title=Food%20Inc">watching</a> the 2008 documentary <a href="https://www.amdoc.org/watch/foodinc/">Food Inc.</a></p>
<p>The Princeton undergraduate saw the film in 2011, and it started her on the journey that would lead her to launch <a href="https://www.joro.tech/">Joro</a>, the Sequoia-backed startup that monitors consumer spending to offer tips on how to offset and reduce a user&#8217;s carbon footprint.</p>
<p>After scoring a job at the development firm Dalberg, then working in India and Ethiopia, Pal returned to the U.S. to pursue an MBA at Harvard Business School. She initially thought she&#8217;d focus on transportation, but her mind kept returning to consumer consumption habits and the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by targeting consumer behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="">&#8220;I started thinking about it in the fall of my first year at business school, and I kind of put it on the back burner because I didn&#8217;t know how to do it from a practical stand. I wasn&#8217;t a technology person. I didn&#8217;t build software myself,&#8221; Pal told Jason Jacobs, the host of the <a href="https://www.myclimatejourney.co/">My Climate Journey</a> podcast. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know how we would capture the data to show someone their carbon footprint and help them reduce it until I met my co-founder [<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cressica/">J. Cressica Brazier</a>], and I met her at an MIT event in the spring of that year two years ago, and the wheels started turning, maybe there&#8217;s a tool here that we could build together.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/joro" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="joro">Joro <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> app uses consumer spending data culled from integrations with Plaid to identify changes in users&#8217; personal habits that can make an impact on their overall carbon footprint &#8212; based on their personal spending.</p>
<p>The app also has a community component, connecting users with sustainability challenges, classes and other educational tools, along with a social network to communicate with peers to track relative progress.</p>
<p>Consider it a version of keeping up with the Joneses, but for planetary health and eco-consciousness.</p>
<p>To date, the app&#8217;s community of users have reduced nearly 6 million kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions in 2020. Which sounds impressive, but given reductions in travel due to COVID-19 mitigation restrictions, the largest contribution that a consumer can make is reducing their meat consumption. While that only leads to roughly 4% reductions in global carbon emissions, it reduces about 1,200 pounds of carbon emissions. Over the 6 million kilograms that would mean a little bit over 10,000 people may be using the app.</p>
<p>Pal would not comment on the number of users her company&#8217;s app has managed to attract.</p>

<p>What the company does have now is $2.5 million in seed funding from investors including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sequoia-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sequoia-capital">Sequoia Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which doubled down on its $1 million pre-seed commitment made when Joro was part of the firm&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/sequoia-capital-has-internal-crash-courses-for-its-founders-heres-how-they-work/">early-stage founder program</a>.</p>

<p>Other investors and advisors include the venture firms<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://www.expa.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expa</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span> <a href="https://www.amasia.vc/thesis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amasia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and angel investors and advisors like James Park, the co-founder of Fitbit; Rich Pierson, the co-founder of Headspace; Sebastian Knutsson, the chief creative head and co-founder of King; the actress Maisie Williams; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philian, the private investment company of Karl-Johan Persson, chairman of H&amp;M; Tom Baruch; and Anjula Acharia, a partner at Trinity Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At Expa we are focused on backing remarkable founders that are passionate about the product they are building,&#8221; said Expa founder Garrett Camp in a statement. &#8220;We saw that in Sanchali &#8211; she had a big vision and conveyed it very strongly to us. We have conviction that Joro can build a great product and a great business. The world will be a better place because of what Joro will bring to market.”</span></p>
<p>Pal estimates that behavioral changes and better consumer choices can reduce an individual&#8217;s carbon footprint by up to 30%.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bet that other companies are making too. For instance, the Los Angeles challenger bank <a href="https://www.aspiration.com/">Aspiration</a>, founded by Andrei Cherny, has a tool that can measure the &#8220;social impact&#8221; of a consumer&#8217;s monthly spending &#8212; that includes the climate impact of daily consumption.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0wZ4cFIAoJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/aspiration-social-impact-of-spending/">Aspiration can now tell you the ‘social impact’ of your monthly spending</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Aspiration can now tell you the ‘social impact’ of your monthly spending&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/aspiration-social-impact-of-spending/embed/#?secret=0wZ4cFIAoJ" data-secret="0wZ4cFIAoJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Pal hopes that through the education and community components of the app, consumers can put pressure on the systems and industries that are the primary producers of greenhouse gas emissions to change their ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;Systems are made of people. Like us,&#8221; Pal wrote in a blog post. &#8220;Companies and governments change when enough people demand it through their actions and behaviors. No, we&#8217;re not a silver bullet &#8212; we need policymakers and businesses to take sweeping action. But we&#8217;re not powerless either. Together we can accelerate the pace of change by demonstrating our demand for a cleaner society.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adult video giant <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pornhub" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pornhub">Pornhub <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> this week announced that it has taken the unprecedented step of removing millions of user-uploaded videos. The move, which the Canadian-born site calls “the most comprehensive safeguards in user-generated platform history,” arrives in the wake of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html">a New York Times opinion piece</a> that stated the “site is infested with rape videos.”</p>
<p>Pornhub announced last week that it would be limiting uploads to only verified users. Now, as <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqjjy/pornhub-suspended-all-unverified-videos-content">noted by Motherboard</a>, the service has suspended all videos for the site not uploaded by existing partners or members of its Model program. Suspended content will be subject to review by Pornhub early next year.</p>
<p>The service noted in a statement that the new model is arguably the strictest instituted by a content platform. “This means every piece of Pornhub content is from verified uploaders,” it writes, “a requirement that platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter have yet to institute.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Times offered reports &#8212; some first-hand &#8212; of graphic exploitation. “I don’t see why search engines, banks or credit card companies should bolster a company that monetizes sexual assaults on children or unconscious women,” Nicholas Kristof wrote. “If PayPal can suspend cooperation with Pornhub, so can American Express, Mastercard and Visa.”</p>
<p>Major credit card companies ultimately followed suit. Last week <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/discover-joins-mastercard-visa-in-cutting-ties-with-pornhub">Discover announced</a> that it would cut ties with the service, following similar moves by Mastercard and Visa. That added incentive no doubt further pressured Pornhub to take even more aggressive action than already announced.</p>
<p>In a statement, the site noted that watchdog group Internet Watch Foundation discovered 118 instances of child sexual abuse on the platform. The service calls the number “118 too many.” The service was defensive in its report, believing it has been singled out due to its focus on adult content.</p>
<p>“It is clear that Pornhub is being targeted not because of our policies and how we compare to our peers, but because we are an adult content platform,” the service writes. “These are the same forces that have spent 50 years demonizing Playboy, the National Endowment for the Arts, sex education, LGBTQ rights, women’s rights, and even the American Library Association. Today, it happens to be Pornhub.”</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>In the nascent autonomous vehicle technology industry, this might be the biggest story of the year. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced that it reached an agreement to sell its self-driving unit Uber Advanced Technologies Group to Aurora Innovation.</p>
<p>The deal requires some unpacking. Here are the tl;dr highlights:</p>
<ol>
<li>Aurora didn&#8217;t pay cash for Uber ATG, which was last valued at $7.25 billion</li>
<li>Uber is over its equity in ATG and investing $400 million into Aurora</li>
<li>Uber gets a 26% stake in the newly combined company Aurora (Pre-deal: Uber held an 86.2% stake on a fully diluted basis in Uber ATG, according to filings with the SEC. Uber ATG&#8217;s investors held a combined stake of 13.8%.)</li>
<li>The combined company has a valuation of $10 billion</li>
<li>Uber together with existing ATG investors and the ATG employees who continue their employment with Aurora are expected to collectively hold about 40% interest in Aurora on a fully diluted basis</li>
<li>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi will take a board seat in the newly expanded Aurora</li>
<li>Uber ATG CEO Eric Meyhofer is out</li>
</ol>
<p>As you might recall, I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/uber-in-talks-to-sell-atg-self-driving-unit-to-aurora/">had the story three weeks</a> before the official announcement. Back then, I didn&#8217;t have all the details, nor had I spoken to some of the key players like Aurora CEO Chris Urmson, who once headed up the former Google self-driving project.</p>
<p>The big takeaway right now: The next 60 days will be critical for Aurora and its hope of integrating two companies. The company plans to spend this time &#8220;dispassionately&#8221; looking at everything, including talent, tech and operations, Urmson told me.</p>
<p>Aurora has 600 employees and Uber ATG has about 1,200. The companies also have different cultures. It&#8217;s a monumental task that if not executed correctly could lead to the demise of Aurora.</p>
<p><strong>A few other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Boston Dynamics</strong> confirmed that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/hyundai-buys-controlling-interest-in-boston-dynamics/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Hyundai has acquired a controlling interest</a> in the company. The deal, which values Boston Dynamics at $1.1 billion, gives Hyundai Motor Group an 80% stake, with SoftBank controlling the remaining 20%. The transaction marks the Spot-maker&#8217;s third change of hands in a mere seven years.</p>
<p><strong>In&amp;motion</strong>, a French startup that developed wearable airbag systems for motorbikes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/inmotion-raises-12-million-for-its-wearable-airbag-systems/">raised a $12 million (€10 million) funding round</a> led by Upfront Ventures, with 360 Capital also participating.</p>

<h2>Uber&#8217;s 2020 evolution</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2086415 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Uber has spent 2020 ridding itself of any business that could derail or even delay its mission to becoming a profitable company.</p>
<p>One year ago, Uber&#8217;s business model could be categorized as an &#8220;all of the above approach,&#8221; a strategy to generate revenue from all forms of transportation, including ride-hailing, micromobility, logistics and package and food delivery as well as futuristic long-term bets on autonomous vehicles and flying cars.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi&#8217;s focus on profitability prompted the company to dump its moonshots and double down on delivery with its acquisition of Postmates.</p>
<p>Uber Elevate, the company&#8217;s air taxi moonshot, was the last to fall. Uber announced this week that it will offload Elevate to Joby Aviation. This is yet another complex deal that includes Uber investing $75 million into Joby and an expanded partnership between the two companies. The $75 million investment comes in addition to a previously undisclosed $50 million investment made as part of Joby&#8217;s Series C financing round in January 2020, Uber said. To date, Joby Aviation has raised $820 million. Uber has invested a total of $125 million into the startup.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber sells air taxi business Elevate to Joby Aviation, shedding its last moonshot&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/uber-sells-air-taxi-business-elevate-to-joby-aviation-shedding-its-last-moonshot/embed/#?secret=yXVN9iTo6N" data-secret="yXVN9iTo6N" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Last year, Uber and Joby, which is developing an all-electric, vertical take-off and landing passenger aircraft, signed on as a vehicle partner for Uber&#8217;s Elevate initiative. Joby was the first partner to commit to deploying air taxi services by 2023.</p>
<p>The upshot: Uber is keeping its hand in all of the units it has sold off — Jump, Elevate, Uber ATG — through agreements that typically have involved investing in the acquiring company in exchange for an equity stake and partnerships.</p>
<h2>Inside Rivian&#8217;s adventure network</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896228 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png" alt="the station electric vehicles1" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>I recently had a wide-ranging interview with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rivian-automotive" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rivian-automotive">Rivian <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> founder and CEO RJ Scaringe that covered charging, batteries and automated driving. (Stay tuned for more on the batteries and automated driving bits). This week, I will focus a bit on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/rivian-is-building-its-own-ev-charging-network-but-with-an-adventurous-twist/">Rivian&#8217;s charging strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Most automakers rolling out new electric vehicle models have partnered with third-party EV charging companies. Then there is Tesla, which poured hundreds of millions of dollars into building a proprietary &#8220;Supercharger&#8221; network.</p>
<p>Rivian is going for a goldilocks &#8220;just right&#8221; strategy, albeit an expensive one, according to new details shared by Scaringe. The electric automaker has designed and is now starting to build out a network of electric vehicle charging stations throughout the United States as it prepares for the first deliveries of its R1T pickup truck and R1S sport utility vehicle.</p>
<p>The network will include fast-chargers located along interstates, which is a common approach that Tesla and others like Electrify America have implemented. Rivian is also planning to install dozens of EV chargers designed to power up its electric vehicles while parked at adventurous destinations, from mountain bike and hiking trails to kayaking spots and maybe even near popular climbing crags.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JxCkhQPNE7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/rivian-is-building-its-own-ev-charging-network-but-with-an-adventurous-twist/">Rivian is building its own EV charging network, but with an adventurous twist</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rivian is building its own EV charging network, but with an adventurous twist&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/rivian-is-building-its-own-ev-charging-network-but-with-an-adventurous-twist/embed/#?secret=JxCkhQPNE7" data-secret="JxCkhQPNE7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a direct appeal to Rivian&#8217;s customer base and one required to build confidence in the brand and electric vehicles, in general, Scaringe told me.</p>
<p><strong>Two important points</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Building the Rivian network has been more than a test of consumer brand awareness and real estate wits. The electric automaker, which has raised about $6 billion, developed the tech in-house, including the high-speed DC charger.</li>
<li>The platform and the hardware around it also will be used for a fleet-based product. (Yup, and not just for its partner Amazon.)</li>
</ol>
<p>“If you think of commercial vans, the charger and the dispenser may look a little different, but the guts of these power modules that are used to build up the charging capability are identically applied in these very different applications,” Scaringe said. “It’s one of the reasons we built all that core competency, so we can build both fleet-based B2B charging solutions and the consumer-facing adventure network for Rivian customers.</p>
<h2>QuantumScape&#8217;s big breakthrough</h2>
<p>Folks who follow hot stocks might have noticed the eye-popping jump in QuantumScape&#8217;s share price. That bump is the result of a decade of work.</p>
<p>QuantumScape is the solid-state battery company that spun out of Stanford, got backing from Volkswagen Group and then became a publicly traded company through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp.</p>
<p>This week, QuantumScape released performance data of its solid-state battery technology. The upshot: a solid-state battery that can charge from zero to 80% capacity in 15 minutes, has 80% longer range than today&#8217;s lithium-ion batteries, is capable of running over 800 cycles at 80% capacity and contains a solid-state separator that functions at -30 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Why does this even matter? If QuantumScape has cracked the case of commercially viable solid-state lithium-metal batteries as it suggests, this would mean a huge leap in energy density in conventional lithium-ion batteries, which would in turn give electric vehicles a driving range comparable to combustion engine-based vehicles.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that QuantumScape says it has been able to achieve 80% longer range WITHOUT giving up or compromising other parts of the cell such as cycle life, operating temperature, safety, cathode loading or excess lithium in the anode.</p>
<p>QuantumScape proved out the most difficult part. But there&#8217;s still a ways to go. The results are based on testing of single-layer battery cells. The next step is to test multi-layer battery cells and then get to work on building out manufacturing to be able to produce these at scale.</p>
<p>QuantumScape founder and CEO Jagdeep Singh described to me in a recent interview how they got to this breakthrough. Hint: it wasn&#8217;t one revelation:</p>
<blockquote><p>We knew we wanted to build a 1000-watt hour per year battery with solid state technologies, but we did not know the specific material system that would work, so there was a lot of pathfinding and exploration that was done in different materials systems that turned out to be dead ends.</p>
<p>Luckily, nature did provide one such system that meets all the requirements and our team was able to both discover it, in terms of its chemical composition, and also figure out how to manufacture it with high levels of quality and high rates speed to get to low cost. It took us about five years to find the material and then another five years to figure out to make it high volume with high quality.</p>
<p>It was not by any means, a straight shot. There were a lot of false starts.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

There are important caveats to this, including a small geofenced test area and that a safety operator be in the passenger seat. But it&#8217;s notable because this is the first milestone required to secure a permit to launch a shared, commercial service that can charge for rides.</p>

<p><strong>Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC</strong>, <strong>Argo AI</strong> and <strong>Ford Motor Company Fund</strong> partnered with Miami-based nonprofit <strong>The Education Fund</strong> to make contactless deliveries to students and families in need in Ford&#8217;s Fusion Hybrid self-driving test vehicles. Ford said it is building a self-driving service in Miami-Dade for ride-hailing and goods delivery and offered to help make deliveries to students’ homes through its pilot program.</p>
<p><strong>Sensible 4</strong>, Finland-based self-driving technology company, is sending a team to the Finnish arctic to perform a two-week-long autonomous winter driving test in dark and snowy conditions.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Big data is a sham. For years now, we have been told that every company should save every last morsel of digital exhaust in some sort of database, lest management lose some competitive intelligence against … a competitor, or something.</p>
<p>There is just one problem with big data though: It’s honking huge.</p>
<p>Processing petabytes of data to generate business insights is expensive and time-consuming. Worse, all that data hanging around paints a big, bright red target on the back of the company for every hacker group in the world. Big data is expensive to maintain, expensive to protect and expensive to keep private. And the upshot might not be all that much in the end after all — oftentimes, well-curated and chosen data sets can provide faster and better insight than endless quantities of raw data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What should a company do? Well, they need a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tonic-ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tonic-ai">Tonic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to ameliorate their big data sins.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tonic.ai">Tonic</a> is a “synthetic data” platform that transforms raw data into more manageable and private data sets usable by software engineers and business analysts. Along the way, Tonic’s algorithms de-identify the original data and create statistically identical but synthetic data sets, which means that personal information isn’t shared insecurely.</p>
<p>For instance, an online shopping platform will have transaction history on its customers and what they purchased. Sharing that data with every engineer and analyst in the company is dangerous, since that purchase history could have personally identifying details to which no one without a need-to-know should have access. Tonic could take that original payments data and transform it into a new, smaller data set with exactly the same statistical properties, but not tied to original customers. That way, an engineer could test their app or an analyst could test their marketing campaign, all without triggering concerns about privacy.</p>
<p>Synthetic data and other ways to handle the privacy of large data sets has garnered massive attention from investors in recent months. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">We reported last week on Skyflow</a>, which raised a round to use polymorphic encryption to ensure that employees only have access to the data they need and are blocked from accessing the rest. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/bigid-bags-another-50m-round-as-data-privacy-laws-proliferate/">BigID takes a more overarching view of just tracking what data is where</a> and who should have access to it (i.e. data governance) based on local privacy laws.</p>
<p>Tonic’s approach has the benefit of helping solve not just privacy issues, but also scalability challenges as data sets get larger and larger in size. That combination has attracted the attention of investors: This morning, the company announced that it has raised $8 million in a Series A led by Glenn Solomon and Oren Yunger of GGV, the latter of whom will join the company’s board.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2018 by a quad of founders: CEO Ian Coe worked with COO Karl Hanson (they first met in middle school as well) and CTO Andrew Colombi while they were all working at Palantir, and Coe also formerly worked with the company’s head of engineering Adam Kamor while at Tableau. That training at some of the largest and most successful data infrastructure companies from the Valley forms part of the product DNA for Tonic.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086287" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086287" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2086287" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tonic-company-pic-20201210.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tonic-company-pic-20201210.png 1846w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tonic-company-pic-20201210.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tonic-company-pic-20201210.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tonic-company-pic-20201210.png?resize=768,453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tonic-company-pic-20201210.png?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tonic-company-pic-20201210.png?resize=1536,905 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tonic-company-pic-20201210.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086287" class="wp-caption-text">Tonic&#8217;s team. Photo via Tonic.</p></div></p>
<p>Coe explained that Tonic is designed to prevent some of the most obvious security flaws that arise in modern software engineering. In addition to saving data pipelining time for engineering teams, Tonic “also means that they&#8217;re not worried about sensitive data going from production environments to lower environments that are always less secure than your production systems.”</p>
<p>He said that the idea for what would become Tonic originated while troubleshooting problems at a Palantir banking client. They needed data to solve a problem, but that data was super sensitive, and so the team ended up using synthetic data to bridge the difference. Coe wants to expand the utility of synthetic data to more people in a more rigorous way, particularly given the legal changes these days. “I think regulatory pressure is really pushing teams to change their practices” around data, he noted.</p>
<p>The key to Tonic’s technology is its subsetter, which evaluates raw data and starts to statistically define the relationships between all the records. Some of that analysis is automated depending on the data sources, and when it can’t be automated, Tonic’s UI can help a data scientist onboard data sets and define those relationships manually. In the end, Tonic generates these synthetic data sets usable by all the customers of that data inside a company.</p>
<p>With the new round of funding, Coe wants to continue doubling down on ease-of-use and onboarding and proselytizing the benefit of this model for his clients. “In a lot of ways, we&#8217;re creating a category, and that means that people have to understand and also get the value [and have] the early-adopter mindset,” he said.</p>
<p>In addition to lead investor GGV, Bloomberg Beta, Xfund, Heavybit and Silicon Valley CISO Investments participated in the round, as well as angels Assaf Wand and Anthony Goldbloom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Council of the European Union, the body which represents individual EU Member States&#8217; governments, has adopted a <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/12/14/encryption-council-adopts-resolution-on-security-through-encryption-and-security-despite-encryption/?utm_source=dsms-auto&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Encryption%3a+Council+adopts+resolution+on+security+through+encryption+and+security+despite+encryption#">resolution</a> on encryption &#8212; calling for what they dub &#8220;security through encryption and security despite encryption&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Competent authorities must be able to access data in a lawful and targeted manner, in full respect of fundamental rights and the relevant data protection laws, while upholding cybersecurity,&#8221; the Council writes.</p>
<p>Last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/whats-all-this-about-europe-wanting-crypto-backdoors/">month</a> a draft Council resolution was reported by some European media outlets as signifying EU political leaders were pushing for a ban on end-to-end encryption, although neither the draft text nor the final document (published today) calls explicitly for that. On the contrary, both express support for &#8220;the development, implementation and use of strong encryption&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What&#8217;s all this about Europe wanting crypto backdoors?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/whats-all-this-about-europe-wanting-crypto-backdoors/embed/#?secret=Oa4ESzFgBL" data-secret="Oa4ESzFgBL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the (non-legally binding)<a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-13084-2020-REV-1/en/pdf"> resolution</a> which has just been <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/12/14/encryption-council-adopts-resolution-on-security-through-encryption-and-security-despite-encryption/?utm_source=dsms-auto&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Encryption%3a+Council+adopts+resolution+on+security+through+encryption+and+security+despite+encryption#">adopted</a>, the EU body with responsibility for setting the bloc&#8217;s policy agenda expresses support for robust encryption whilst arguing that targeted, lawful access to encrypted data is essential in order that electronic evidence can be gathered (to &#8220;effectively&#8221; fight criminal activity such as terrorism, organised crime, child sexual abuse and other cybercrime and cyber-enabled crimes).</p>
<p>It writes that the &#8220;right balance&#8221; must be struck between these two facets, while also ensuing that core EU legal principles (such as necessity and proportionality) are taken into consideration &#8212; in order that &#8220;the principle of security through encryption and security despite encryption [can be] upheld in its entirely&#8221;, as the resolution says it must.</p>
<p>The Council also characterizes it as &#8220;extremely important&#8221; that the privacy and security of comms <em>through</em> encryption is protected &#8212; whilst simultaneously &#8220;upholding the possibility for competent authorities in the area of security and criminal justice to lawfully access relevant data for legitimate, clearly defined purposes in fighting serious and/or organized crimes and terrorism, including in the digital world, and upholding the rule of law&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any actions taken have to balance these interests carefully against the principles of necessity, proportionality and subsidiarity,&#8221; the Council also intones, as<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> political priorities </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/13/clearly-an-idiot/">once again collide</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> with the hard binaries of secure encryption. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear exactly what action the Council wants EU lawmakers to take to achieve the impossible (i.e. of breaking encryption (for cybercriminals) without breaking encryption for everyone).</p>
<p>But they definitely want to involve the technology industry in this latest futile effort to make encryption a malleable oxymoron, as the resolution talks explicitly about &#8220;joining forces with the tech industry&#8221;. Albeit, there&#8217;s no clarity on what exactly the &#8216;joined forces&#8217; will be doing &#8212; beyond seeking the (un)holy &#8216;balance&#8217; of insecure security (or secure insecurity, if you prefer).</p>
<p>&#8220;Technical solutions for gaining access to encrypted data must comply with the principles of legality, transparency, necessity and proportionality including protection of personal data by design and by default,&#8221; the Council goes on, defining what &#8216;lawful&#8217; access means in this context (and in so doing making it abundantly clear that mandatory backdoors can&#8217;t apply; since they would be disproportionate, unnecessary, underhand and unlawful&#8230; ).</p>
<p>Later in the resolution, the Council also spells out explicitly that there can be no mandated, single, pan-EU universal tech solution for breaking encryption under its watch, literally stating: &#8220;There should be no single prescribed technical solution to provide access to encrypted data&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since there is no single way of achieving the set goals, governments, industry, research and academia need to work transparently together to strategically create this balance,&#8221; it also writes, seemingly leaving no safe space for secret meetings between policymakers and industry (where discussions of a &#8216;oh-but-go-on-you-can-make-a-targeted-backdoor-just-for-lawful-suspects-can&#8217;t-you-?&#8217; type-nature might otherwise take place).</p>
<p>&#8220;Possible solutions should be developed in a transparent manner in cooperation with national and international communication service providers and other relevant stakeholders,&#8221; the Council writes, again apparently rejecting secret agreements between policymakers and tech providers to serve up the hoped for &#8216;targeted and lawful&#8217; access &#8212; unless they somehow want cooperation to be transparent to policymaker and industry stakeholders (and potentially also relevant academic researchers) but just not to the public/comms service users themselves. Which would go against the &#8216;transparent working&#8217; spirit of the resolution, if not literally the letter of the text.</p>
<p>This latest salvo in the crypto wars probably won&#8217;t reassure all those concerned that EU lawmakers aren&#8217;t moving inexorably towards co-opting the tech industry into breaking encryption via mandatory backdoors.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s noteworthy that the otherwise frustratingly &#8216;cakeist&#8217; Council resolution does reject a single technical solution to achieve its (impossible) aims &#8212; merely serving up multiple references to seeking &#8220;potential&#8221; technical (and operational) solutions, plural.</p>
<p>The resolution thus smacks of a (political) effort to be seen to be doing something; and, at best, a call to bring relevant heads together around tables to get stakeholders up to speed and ensure everyone&#8217;s on the same page &#8212; thereby <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">avoiding redundant/duplicate effort, with the Council urging coordination and joint working (and the provision of &#8220;tailored high quality training&#8221;) across the EU&#8217;s institutions to interrogate and analyze new technologies, while simultaneously calling on research/academia &#8220;to ensure the continued implementation and use of strong encryption technology&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Council</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> may also be seeking to avoid the pitfall of any one arm/force within the bloc making itself look stupid by taking a doomed run at e2e encryption. </span>Instead, they hereby throw themselves collectively behind/atop a stupid slogan &#8212; &#8220;security through encryption and security despite encryption&#8221; &#8212; so hopefully the stupidity toward encryption stops here.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/on-encryption-and-counter-terrorism-eu-lawmakers-say-theyll-work-for-lawful-data-access/">Last week</a> EU lawmakers also said they&#8217;ll work to support &#8216;lawful&#8217; data access, as part of wide-ranging counter-terrorism agenda &#8212; with the Commission committing to &#8220;work with Member States to identify possible legal, operational, and technical solutions for lawful access and promote an approach which both maintains the effectiveness of encryption in protecting privacy and security of communications, while providing an effective response to crime and terrorism&#8221;.</p>
<p>But, again, nothing in that agenda went beyond talk of identifying &#8216;possible solutions&#8217; for lawful access to encrypted data &#8212; even as EU lawmakers committed to maintaining the effectiveness of encryption in the same breath. So <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/23/the-repeat-political-madness-of-never-ending-crypto-wars/">round we go again</a>&#8230;</p>
