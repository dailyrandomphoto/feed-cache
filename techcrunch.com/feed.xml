										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost overnight, platforms that offer non-dilutive capital for recurring revenue businesses have become white-hot. It was only in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/">March</a> that Pipe — which aims to be the “Nasdaq for revenue” — raised $150 million, but two months later had raised $250 million at a $2 billion valuation.</p>
<p>This fever is now reaching Europe, where today <a href="http://Capchase.com">Capchase</a> raises an additional $280 million in new debt and equity funding, led by i80 Group, following a $125 million round in June. But unlike Pipe, Capchase is playing both in the US and in Europe, where it has made €100m available to more than 50 companies in its first month of operation on the continent.</p>
<p>Right now it’s live in the UK and Spain but expects to expand across Europe this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Spanish-American company is also now launching ‘Capchase Expense Financing’ to enable companies to manage their largest expenses – such as legal bills, cloud hosting services, payroll and bonus payments, and recruitment fees &#8211;  without depleting their cash reserves, in either 3, 6, 9, or 12-month increments.</p>
<p>Miguel Fernandez, co-founder, and CEO of Capchase said: “Our new expense financing solution is a first in the industry, and we believe it will be a game-changer. Since we launched just over a year ago, we’ve seen first-hand the challenges that companies face when securing the financing they need to grow their business. Managing large expenses and having to make difficult decisions over how they spend their cash is one of the most consistent and trying issues that our clients face. There’s also a great opportunity to reduce costs by making use of the upfront discounts that vendors provide. Now Capchase users can pay upfront with Capchase, get a discount, and pay Capchase monthly over the following months.”</p>
<p>At interview Fernandez told me their main competitor is venture debt: “That is the one that we constantly keep winning against.”</p>
<p>He said: “We&#8217;re not limited to just monthly or quarterly subscriptions, we can work with any revenue. We apply intelligence to it and work with customers. It’s not just the ability to pull forward revenues to find the growth, but also what is the implied schedule in order to achieve a business goal.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sundae, a residential real estate marketplace that pairs sellers of dated or damaged property with potential buyers, has raised $80 million in a Series C funding round co-led by Fifth Wall and General Global Capital.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://sundae.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sundae</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a residential real estate marketplace that pairs sellers of dated or damaged property with potential buyers, has raised $80 million in a Series C funding round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-led by Fifth Wall and General Global Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QED Investors, Wellington Management, Susa Ventures, Founders Fund, First American Financial, Prudence Holdings, Crossover VC, Intersect Capital, Gaingels and Oberndorf Ventures also participated in the financing. The round marks San Francisco-based Sundae’s third financing in a 13-month time frame, bringing its total raised since its August 2018 inception to $135 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based company declined to reveal at what valuation its Series C was raised. It also declined to provide hard revenue figures, saying only that it saw a 600% year-over-year increase in revenue from June 2020 to June 2021.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup aims to help people who need to sell dated or “damaged” properties for a variety of reasons &#8212; such as job loss, illness or divorce. In some cases, according to CEO and co-founder Josh Stech, such vulnerable sellers get taken advantage of by &#8220;predatory fix and flippers” seeking to capitalize on their misfortune. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since sellers in these situations don’t typically have the funds to fix up their properties before selling, Sundae lists the property for them on its platform &#8211; serving as an intermediary between sellers and investors. There, it is visible to about 2,600 qualified off-market buyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company essentially aims to aggregate demand from “fix and flippers,” who use the marketplace to bid against each other for distressed properties. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the seller accepts and an inspection is completed, the company offers a $10,000 cash advance before closing to help homeowners with moving costs or other expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal is to displace wholesalers who exploit desperate or uninformed sellers and lock them into a contract which they turn around and assign to a property investor at a steep profit,” Stech said. “The tens of thousands of dollars in lost equity that goes to a wholesaler could mean the difference between paying off debts, or having enough money to retire.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sundae claims that on average, sellers receive 10 offers within three days on its marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch in January 2019, the startup has slowly been expanding its marketplace geographically. It went from operating in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">four markets in California at the end of last year to now operating in 14 markets across Florida, Colorado, Georgia, Texas and Utah. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sundae makes money by charging buyers in its investor marketplace a fee when it “assigns” them a property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first quarter of this year, the startup launched a dedicated online marketplace for investors, where they can view properties and submit offers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once an investor signs up to join the marketplace, they can access the full inventory of properties, including information such as photos, floor plan, 3D walkthrough and a third-party inspection report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company plans to use its new capital to expand to new markets, invest in its platform and “build brand awareness.” It also, of course, plans to boost its current headcount of 180 mostly remote employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vik Chawla, a partner at Fifth Wall, believes Sundae is serving a segment of the residential real estate market that has historically been overlooked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their marketplace model simultaneously solves a crucial pain point for sellers by disrupting the wholesale industry, while delivering a platform that property investors can count on for reliable investment opportunities,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://t.co/z9hNHQ0TmU?amp=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a $60M early-stage fund co-founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/joshbuckley">Josh Buckley</a>, Product Hunt’s CEO along with writer, founder and designer <a href="https://twitter.com/dcurtis">Dustin Curtis</a>. Two ex-Sequoia operators are part of the team at launch as well. <a href="https://twitter.com/MalikaCantor">Malika Cantor</a> as Partner and GM and Ashton Brown as Head of Program. The fund launches today and is self-described as ‘inspired by the Product Hunt community’. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team will be writing $300k checks for 5% of very early companies in any arena that seems promising to the partnership in a fixed deal structure that mirrors Y-Combinator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund will exist as a ‘sister company’ to Product Hunt (though it’s going to technically own it). Product Hunt, however, is the first of what the team says will be many companies it will own, create and operate in order to provide ‘direct value’ to its portfolio companies. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a chat with Buckley, Curtis and Cantor about the new fund and company and the way that they hoped to differentiate Hyper in a world of aggressively service-oriented venture firms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short version is: distribution. It’s hard to argue with the overall assumption that the Hyper team is working under &#8212; capital is majorly commoditized. Frankly, sometimes that’s all you want from an investor whose value add is more of a thorn in your side than anything. But, especially at the early stage there are a few funds and firms that offer a strong value outside of writing checks in the form of, say, hiring, sales introductions or board members that have relevant operational experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where Hyper differs, says Buckley, is that they see distribution as the biggest value add for a nascent startup at the stages where the firm hopes to invest. Product Hunt is one opportunity that he points to as an example. It’s an established launch pad to an audience of extreme early adopters that can provide a seed of a real user base &#8212; Hyper itself is </span><a href="https://t.co/xFChlu7aG6?amp=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launching via a post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll let the Hyper team’s words spell out what they say is its thesis:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyper believes that every company (B2B or B2C) needs access to distribution channels to find customers, users, and talented employees to join their teams. Hyper works with early-stage companies at three key junctures in a startup&#8217;s journey:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial customer acquisition and validation (often at the pre-Seed stage)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First product/company launch and hiring (often at the Seed stage)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scaling customer acquisition and fundraising (before the Series A)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders who go through the program will remain a part of the tight-knit Hyper founder community long past their Series A.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few months, Buckley says that Product Hunt has grown headcount by around 50% in part to boost its ability to act as an enhanced distribution channel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A short list of some of the people involved as advisors, mentors or investors themselves includes Alexis &amp; Serena Williams, Alfred Lin of Sequoia, Garry Tan of Initialized, Harry Stebbings, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Naval Ravikant, Owen van Natta, Ryan Hoover, Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic and Sriram Krishnan of a16z. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a pretty eclectic group, but if you squint you can see the shape of the ambitions that Hyper has reflected in the parties involved. A mix of media, venture and product figures is probably the right way to go if you want to back yourself into a media empire funded by venture capital returns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’ll be building additional media products as well, especially ones that focus on areas of hyper growth and high interest in order to both generate deal flow and to feature companies in the portfolio. Interestingly, unlike many marketing-operations-disguised-as-journalistic-enterprises, Curtis says that they want these to be real, functioning media companies and that startups funded by Hyper will be presented on those sites and platforms in clearly defined sections that make it clear that they are part of the program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, the team is careful to state that Product Hunt will remain a ‘neutral platform’ for launching products and that Hyper companies will get clearly marked slots on the site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surrounding those placements will be content that is produced by editorial media arms independent of the fund (though, in the end, funded by the profits of the fund). They’re not quite up to giving specifics about how they’re going to power these media properties initially but the funds management fees as well as most of its profits from carry will go towards cultivating the distro side. The other part of the ‘most’ will, one assumes, go to the individual investors. Curtis says that there could be other ways to obtain capital to speed up this process that is allowed by the unique structure of Hyper like debt or equity financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyper itself is trying to establish two lines of business. A portfolio of wholly owned companies like Product Hunt (which still counts AngelList as a majority investor and Ravikant on its board) and other new media brands. And the other component which includes the portfolio of Hyper funds (plural theirs) and a founder program that includes mentorship, twice-a-year-events, and other future efforts &#8212; eventually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mentorship component that Hyper hopes to add for founders in the fund is an 8-week founder program that includes individuals from “partners” like Andreeessen Horowitz, AngelList, Sequoia Capital, the Twenty Minute VC Podcast and Product Hunt helping founders to solve ‘key challenges’. Some of the participants are investors in Hyper, though none of the funds participated themselves The group includes some close to home figures as well, in Product Hunt GM Ashley Higgins and founder Ryan Hoover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program will also offer office hours with experts, an exclusive Product Hunt launch event and a Public Hyper Demo Day and Investor Demo Day to participate in within a year of being in the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hyper concept sounds fresh in combination, if not in components. An enormous amount of ink has been spilled, for instance, on the spinning up of the VC media apparatus as a bullhorn for a tech-optimism POV. But most of that content is understood to be talking the firm’s book and not intended to be seen as journalism. Though the media publications that Hyper is planning on forming have yet to be realized, there is enough of a differentiating spark here that could make it a unique play that attempts to straddle the worlds of editorial and venture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have thoughts about the way that venture and media interact, as you might imagine given what I do and <em>waves hands at the masthead</em> where we are having this little chat. Combining a media and investing apparatus is not a new concept &#8212; as TechCrunch </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/technology/michael-arrington-techcrunch-blogger-to-invest-in-start-ups.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology"><span style="font-weight: 400;">readers will know</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But it’s not without its complexities. Enthusiast media that works does so for a couple of major reasons, in my opinion:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Genuine obsession with the subject matter.</strong> The writers, editors and even business people involved must have a crazy thirst to understand and contextualize the subjects that they write about. There can be no in-between here, as they are speaking every day to an audience that is just as obsessed with it as they are and can detect any level of commitment to it that is less than 100%. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A patina of either trust or candor built over time.</strong> You can go into it with some bona-fides that you buy with a big name hire or series of them, and the reputations that they’ve built elsewhere. But if you’re full of shit, you’re going to lose &#8212; no matter how well positioned and funded you are. You may ‘win’ long term by turning what you’re doing into something else, a broad interest publication in niche clothing, for instance. But you won’t win at the enthusiast level.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>An intense, punishing commitment to momentum.</strong> The further you delve into any niche, the more knowledgeable your audience will be. This means that you must produce uniquely insightful, crisp, well-researched content every day and you must do it with a level of granularity that surpasses anyone else in your niche. Your audience lives and breathes this stuff so if you’re telling them things they’ve already read on 3 message boards, in private texts or in their work slack then you’ve lost. You’ve got to get subcutaneous and not just superficially so. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when you add in a layer of complexity that is proudly announcing your vested interests in the success of particular companies, it just ups the level of difficulty massively. I don’t think that it’s at all </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">impossible</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to run a fund that feeds a media arm, but it’s definitely a ‘doing a really hard thing while also on fire’ kind of operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which doesn’t mean that Hyper can’t pull it off. Product Hunt is the model for what they’re trying to do, creating close-to-the-ground media that attracts as many operators and investors as it does early adopters. Duplicating that in a variety of publications and events, however, is not easy at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will say that a bet on distribution as value add is still one of the better stabs that I’ve seen lately. The capital is, as Buckley told me, readily and generically available. And having your calling card be “we can help the first 10, 20 or 30 thousand people know that you even exist” isn’t a bad situation at all. It works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is, after all, what we do at TechCrunch, we just don’t take a cut. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement today is the Hyper the fund, and the fact that they’re opening applications to a small cohort of 25 companies. The applications are planned to open for roughly 4 weeks every quarter and the deadline for this tranche is August 10th, 2021 at midnight PT. The second cohort will open in November 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund is taking applicants worldwide though notes that some countries present legal complexities for investment. </span></p>

<p>Four months after announcing its last round, <a href="https://employmenthero.com/">Employment Hero</a> has closed another $140 million AUD (about $103 million USD) in funding. The Series E was led by <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/">Insight Partners</a>, the venture capital firm known for its ScaleUp program to help tech companies accelerate their growth.</p>
<p>Employment Hero is an automated human resources, payroll and benefits platform for SMEs. Founded in Sydney in 2014, the company is now expanding into Southeast Asian and Western European markets. Its previous funding announcement was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/australia-based-employment-hero-raises-45m-aud-for-its-global-expansion/">a $45 million AUD Series D announced in March</a>, led by online job platform SEEK, at the company&#8217;s previous valuation of about $250 million AUD.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now Employment Hero has bumped up its valuation $800 million in less than six months by reaching 133% year-on- recurring revenue growth. Co-founded by Ben Thompson, its chief executive officer, and chief technology officer Dave Tong, Employment Hero is used by 6,000 businesses, with a total of 250,000 employees. Over the past 12 months, the company says $14 billion in gross wages was processed through the platform.</p>

<p>“We always thought Insight Partners would be a great partner,” Thompson told TechCrunch. “We had been speaking with them for years, so when they asked if we would consider raising, we agreed it was definitely worth exploring. As it turned out all the stars were aligned, and we reached a deal that made sense and allowed us to keep scaling without having to switch back into capital raising mode.”</p>
<p>Over the past year, Employment Hero grew its headcount by 65% to 325 full-time employees and now has a permanent remote-first work model. The new capital will be used to hire for its engineering teams and for the company’s continuing international expansion.</p>
<p>Employment Hero began entering new markets in October 2020, launching localized versions of the platform in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and Singapore.</p>
<p>Thompson said Employment Hero will continue focusing on Malaysia and Singapore until the end of this year, while looking at ways to cross-promote SEEK’s products and services in Asia. After that, it plans to localize Employment Hero for Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Hong Kong and Vietnam.</p>
<p>To localize the platform, Employment Hero starts with employment contracts, policies, leave rules and pay rules. Then it integrates with tax authorities and pension funds, before focusing on local benefits providers to get discounts on non-discretionary expenses for users, like health insurance and mortgages.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, Thompson said Employment Hero’s teams shifted their focus to help companies adapt to a distributed workforce. Some of the services it launched include Global Teams, a professional employer organization (PEO) solution that pushes job openings to more than 1,700 career boards and helps companies onboard and manage remote workers. Employment Hero is also working with recruitment agencies that will help employers find remote workers.</p>

<p>Thompson said, “while it’s still early days for Global Teams, it’s definitely popular,” with dozens of companies in Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand using it to employ people in 21 countries.</p>
<p>Employment Hero’s Remote Work Report, released in June, found that 94% of respondents want to continue working remotely at least one day a week, up from 2% a year ago. Meanwhile, 74% of employers surveyed told Employment Hero that they plan to keep flexible working arrangements after COVID restrictions are lifted, up from 64% in 2020.</p>
<p>“We are seeing employers embrace remote work as a competitive advantage because it broadens their available talent pool and helps retain and engage their employees,” Thompson said. “Employers are now asking, how should we do things differently if we want to continue working remotely forever? This requires real intention and education, but it’s a whole lot better than losing great employees by forcing them back to office five days a week.”</p>
<p>In a statement about the investment, Insight Partners managing director Rachel Geller said, “We have been following Employment Hero’s journey for four years and have seen the impressive and consistent growth experience by the company. Its customer-centric solutions have been embraced globally by the small and medium business community and we are looking forward to supporting them through this next phase of their expansion journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.mural.co/">Mural</a>, a startup that builds digital collaboration software with a focus on visual presentation, announced that it has closed a $50 million Series C. The new capital, co-led by prior investors Insight Partners and Tiger Global, values the startup at more than $2 billion.</p>
<p>Previously, Mural was valued at around $500 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/visual-collaboration-startup-mural-raises-huge-118m-series-b/">when it closed a $118 million round last August</a>. Mural also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/mural-raises-23m-series-a-after-history-of-capital-efficient-growth/">raised a $23 million Series A</a> at the start of 2020.</p>
<p>Mural&#8217;s product focuses around a visual collaboration space, akin to a digital whiteboard. Given its product focus, it&#8217;s not hard to see why the startup had a good COVID cycle; the world&#8217;s companies moved to remote work en masse, leaving offices empty and physical whiteboards un-scribbled. Services like Mural helped fill that, and similar voids. TechCrunch caught up with Mural CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/batmelon">Mariano Suarez-Battan</a> and Insight managing director <a href="https://twitter.com/nikhilsachdev">Nikhil Sachdev</a> to learn more about deal mechanics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new unicorn also disclosed that customers generating $100,000 in ARRR tripled to more than 100 organizations in the last year, and that it now has seven customers bringing in at least $1,000,000 in ARR apiece. That second figure is up from a &#8220;couple&#8221; seven-figure deals at the start of 2020, a figure that the company disclosed at the time of its Series A.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TvZJU8FtjB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/visual-collaboration-startup-mural-raises-huge-118m-series-b/">Visual collaboration startup MURAL raises huge $118M Series B</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Visual collaboration startup MURAL raises huge $118M Series B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/visual-collaboration-startup-mural-raises-huge-118m-series-b/embed/#?secret=TvZJU8FtjB" data-secret="TvZJU8FtjB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Per Suarez-Battan, Mural has continued the torrid pace of growth that made it a breakout company in 2020. In the last year the company has tripled its annual recurring revenue (ARR), he said. That&#8217;s the same pace of growth that the company disclosed when it raised its Series B in Q3 2020. As the company has now disclosed that it has tripled in each of the last two years, we can infer that the company has reached material top line scale.</p>
<p>Mural &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/10/mural-ly-opens-its-web-based-creative-collaboration-platform-to-the-public/">known as Mural.ly through 2019</a> &#8212; however, was growing before the pandemic, and doesn&#8217;t appear to think that the eventual conclusion of the pandemic will be too deleterious to its growth rates. In a discussion concerning the company&#8217;s path after COVID-19, Suarez-Battan noted that many of his company&#8217;s customers have multiple offices in disparate locations. Those concerns, even if they returned to a fully in-office setup in time, would still have need for Mural and its software, goes the argument.</p>
<p>With more companies flipping to hybrid-friendly work environments, part-time office cultures, or fully remote organization structures, Mural&#8217;s market is moving toward its vision of collaboration at scale sans the need to be sitting next to the people with whom you are trying to be creative. Underscoring the point, Sachdev told TechCrunch that COVID was a &#8220;huge pull forward&#8221; in a trend that was long underway: remote work. He believes that companies executing collaborative, or creative work at a distance was a reality merely accelerated by COVID, not created by it.</p>
<p>The dollar amount of the Series C may seem a bit odd. Why did Mural raise less in its Series C than it did in its preceding Series B? Mural still had most of its previous round on its books, Sachdev said. Our read from that fact is that Mural simply didn&#8217;t need to raise another huge round. So, it didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Insider demand led to the funding event, which for Mural represents incredibly modest dilution (it sold around 4% of its shares at its new valuation) and a massive upsizing in its valuation (a little under 4x). Effectively, Mural was just handed the ability to go out into the market and buy whatever smaller companies and talent it wants, without worrying about dilution or cash concerns, respectively.</p>
<p>Quick growth wasn&#8217;t the only reason that Tiger and Insight wanted to buy more of Mural. According to the Insight MD, the startup has retained strong levels of efficiency as it has scaled, venture-speak for an ability to rapidly expand revenues while not similarly boosting the pace at which cash is consumed. It&#8217;s the venture equivalent of crowing about operating leverage, essentially.</p>
<p>Suarez-Battan also emphasized during his interview with TechCrunch that his company&#8217;s net dollar retention, or NDR, is strong. NDR is a key metric for modern software companies, as marginal revenue gains from existing customers are cheaper to secure than net-new accounts. Again, the theme that the metric details is efficient growth.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s lots to Mural worth our chewing on in time. The loop of consultants using its service, leading to new customers. How the firm works with consultants, period. The list goes on. Let&#8217;s see how quickly Mural can keep growing in the second half of 2021. The next time we chat with the firm it will be time to harangue it for hard revenue figures. Let&#8217;s see how that goes!</p>

Founded in India, <a href="https://www.healthifyme.com/">HealthifyMe</a> is betting that users around the world will prefer its range of customizable health programs. The Bangalore-based company announced today it has closed a $75 million Series C from LeapFrog and Khosla Ventures, with plans to grow its user base in India, Southeast Asia and North America.</p>
<p>HealthifyMe is the first Indian health tech startup LeapFrog has invested in, and Khosla Ventures’ largest investment in India to date. The company did not disclose its post-money valuation, but co-founder and chief executive officer Tushar Vashisht told TechCrunch it is now at “soonicorn” status.</p>
<p>Unilever Ventures, Elm and Healthquad also participated in the round along with returning investors Chiratae Ventures, Inventus Capital and Sistema Asia Capital. HealthifyMe has now raised more than $100 million in total.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vashisht said HealthifyMe is India’s top health and fitness app, but its long-term goal is to become the global leader. In North America, it is popular among Indian expat and Indian American communities, and now it will target other customer segments, too.</p>

<p>HealthifyMe’s products include HealthifySmart, which uses AI-based tech to customize diet plans for users, and HealtifyCoach, which also includes live conversations with coaches. During the pandemic, it launched two products: HealthifyPlus, for people who are managing chronic conditions like diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, high cholesterol or hypertension, and HealthifyStudio, with live workout classes.</p>
<p>The app also has a AI-based nutritionist called Ria that is trained for cuisines in different markets through a combination of user-tracked data, guidance from local nutritionists and databases from sources like the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>HealthifyMe will work with LeapFrog’s research and development hub, ImpactLabs, to develop more programs for people with chronic health conditions.</p>

<p>HealthifySmart and HealthifyStudio, its newest products, already contribute 25% to the company’s line. HealthifyMe also says it doubled its user base and revenue over the last year, recently surpassing 25 million downloads, and is currently on target to reach $50 million in annualized recurring revenue within the next six months. It has about 1,500 trainers and coaches on the platform, with plans to add 1,000 more to support its expansion.</p>
<p>Since HealthifyMe began operating first in cost-sensitive markets, it started using AI early on to scale efficiently, Vashisht said. As a result, it is able to offer products at lower prices than its competition.</p>
<p>“Today in the U.S., you have free DIY calorie counting solutions like MyFitnessPal and expensive human-assisted coaching and diet solutions like Noom and WeightWatchers,” said Vashisht. “But nothing in the middle exists that allows one to track nutrition and calories while getting advice at an affordable price point.”</p>
<p>About 25% of HealthifyMe’s revenue comes from outside of India, including Singapore and Malaysia. When it enters a new market, the company localizes its services using a playbook.</p>

<p>“We begin by building a food database with local foods. We also tailor our search algorithms and app language to ensure accurate food searches take place in the app,” Vashisht said. “Next, we hire 50 diet and fitness coaches locally to cater to the region’s population via the platform and launch HealthifyCoach locally. Once we have sufficient data, we were able to retrain and refactor our AI to suit local preferences.” That is how the company launched HealthifySmart in Singapore and Malaysia, and it plans to do the same thing in North America.</p>
<p>The company measures the efficacy of its program through user-reported statistics and working with researchers like Sridhar Narayan, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, to verify and analyze its data. Vashisht said average paying subscribers lose about 8 pounds in 180 days, while the top 10% lose more than 20 pounds.</p>
<p>For its HealthifyPlus customers, the company has seen a statistically significant impact on their Hemoglobin A1C (Hb1AC), LDL cholesterol and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Vashisht added that HealthifyMe plans to publish its results in the coming months, and also hopes to integrate with diagnostics providers in the future to track clinical indicators.</p>
<p>Part of the new funding will be used to double HealthifyMe’s current engineering and design teams, including through acqui-hires, with the company looking for digital health and wellness companies to buy. It will also fill senior leadership roles in operations, marketing, human relations and technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been a wild 2021 for NFT auction marketplace <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>. The startup was exceedingly well-positioned in a niche space when NFTs exploded earlier this year seemingly out of nowhere. Since then, the startup has found its user base expanding, the total volume of sales skyrocketing and more investor dollars being thrown at them.</p>
<p>The startup announced in March, it had closed a $23 million Series A, and now some four months later, the company tells TechCrunch it has raised another $100 million in a Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz at a $1.5 billion valuation. Other investors in the round include Coatue, CAA, Michael Ovitz, Kevin Hartz, Kevin Durant and Ashton Kutcher.</p>
<p>Despite a fall from stratospheric heights in the early summer, the broader NFT market has still been chugging along and OpenSea is continuing to see plenty of action. The startup saw $160 million in sales last month and is on track to blow past that figure this month, CEO Devin Finzer tells TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Pi2mk0twDn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">NFT marketplace OpenSea raises $23 million from a16z</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;NFT marketplace OpenSea raises $23 million from a16z&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/embed/#?secret=Pi2mk0twDn" data-secret="Pi2mk0twDn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One of the company&#8217;s clearer growth roadblocks has been infrastructure issues native to the Ethereum blockchain that its marketplace has been built around. The Ethereum blockchain, which has a number of network upgrades outstanding, has struggled to keep up with the NFT boom at times, leaving users footing the bill with occasionally pricey &#8220;gas&#8221; fees needed to mint an item or make a transaction. Though these fees have largely cooled down in recent weeks, OpenSea is aiming to make a move towards long-term scalability by announcing that they plan to bring support for several more blockchains to its platform.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re starting with Polygon, a popular Layer 2 Ethereum blockchain which boasts a more energy-efficient structure that will allow OpenSea to entirely eliminate gas fees for creators, buyers and sellers on that blockchain. Losing these fees may give OpenSea a better shot at expanding its ambitions, which include finding a future for NFTs in the gaming world and in the events space, Finzer says.</p>
<p>Beyond Polygon, OpenSea has plans to integrate with Dapper Labs&#8217; Flow blockchain as well as Tezos down the road, the company says.</p>
<p>Operating across multiple blockchains could create some headaches for consumers operating across platforms with differing levels of support for each network. Some NFT investors are also more hesitant to buy items on blockchains they see as less time-tested than Ethereum, worrying that newer chains may lose support over time. But overall, the user-friendly changes will likely be well-received by the wider NFT community which has seen the explosion in new interest stress-test its systems and highlight need for user interface and user experience improvements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The “subscribe to your car” movement has been taking off in recent years, with the appearance of Fleks in the UK (Europe), Cazoo (after its acquisition of Drover), Care by Volvo Hertz, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Into this space has appeared <a href="https://imove.no/en">imove</a> out of Norway, with what appears, at least, to be a new twist on the whole thing: a white-label platform offered to industry to enable it to offer these car subscription services under their own brands. imove’s platform allows users to subscribe to electric vehicles from eighteen different manufacturers and over 50 different models.</p>
<p>The startup has now closed a €19M / $22.3M Series A round led by pan-European online car market AutoScout24. It was joined by the VCs Norselab and Idekapital, as well as the Norwegian state climate investment company Nysnø. Existing owner Hedin Automotive also joined. The round consists of a new equity issue of €13M combined with a €6M secondary sale of shares.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2018, imove allows a company in automotive, finance, insurance, or even electricity and telecoms, to offer car subscriptions as an alternative to car ownership or leasing.</p>
<p>The team is led by co-founders Hans Kristian Aas (CEO) and Gunnar Birkenfeldt (CPO), who are jumping on a trend whereby (according to some estimates) some 20-30% of new car sales globally are predicted to be switched to car <em>subscriptions</em> by 2025.</p>
<p>Hans Kristian Aas, co-founder, and CEO said: “Amazing customer feedback, strong unit economics, and an industry ripe for change told us that the timing was right for pushing the ‘Scale button’.”</p>
<p>AutoScout24 is a large, pan-European online car market, and will act as a distribution channel for imove’s electric vehicle subscription service.</p>
<p>“With this investment, AutoScout24 clearly positions itself at the forefront of supporting new ownership models for consumers and customers, and makes a decisive step in supporting the EV introduction,” said Chief Strategy Officer at AutoScout24, Borja Muller.</p>
<p>While imove is clearly moving fast in Europe, there are several players offering technology for car subscription and fleet management. These include <a href="https://ridecell.com">Ridecell</a> (US-based), Clutch (US-based, owned by Cox Automotive), <a href="https://fleetonomy.io">Fleetonomy</a> (Israel) and <a href="https://vulog.com">Vulog</a> (France). So there&#8217;s plenty to play for in this race yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global Covid-19 pandemic had a chilling effect on a number of industries and their workforces, resulting in mass furloughs and layoffs. But now, with countries now taking steps back to &#8220;normal&#8221;, that has been leading, in many cases, back to a hiring surge. Today, <a href="https://www.smartrecruiters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SmartRecruiters</a>, one of the companies that has built software to handle that process more smoothly, is announcing $110 million in funding to seize the moment.</p>
<p>The funding, a Series E, is coming in at a $1.5 billion valuation, the company confirmed. Silver Lake Waterman is leading this round, with previous backers Insight Partners, and Mayfield Fund also participating.</p>
<p>The investment will be used in two areas. First, SmartRecruiters plans to continue expanding business &#8212; its primary customers are large enterprises with Visa, Square, McDonald’s, Ubisoft, FireEye, Biogen, Equinox and Public Storage among them, and the plan will be to bring on more of these globally. Jerome Ternynck, SmartRecruiters&#8217; CEO and founder, pointed out that one of its clients made a move recently in which it had to swiftly ramp up by 10,000 people in 90 days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;That is the scale of the great rehire that we are aiming to serve,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>And second, it plans to hire and invest more in product. Specifically, Ternynck said the company is looking to build more intelligence into its platform, so that it can help customers find ideal matches for roles and provide them with tools to automate and reduce the busy work of managing a recruitment process.</p>
<p>This is a notable area for growth, and one that smaller startups have also identified and are building to fix: just yesterday, one of them, Dover, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/dover-raises-20m-to-bring-the-concept-of-orchestration-to-recruitment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a Series A</a>.</p>
<p>Ternynck likes to describe SmartRecruiters as &#8220;the Salesforce of recruiting&#8221;, by which he means that it provides a system of record for large enterprises who can manage 100% of the process of recruitment, from sourcing candidates to hire.</p>
<p>&#8220;In recruiting tech, we are the mothership,&#8221; he said, with some 600 vendors integrated into its platform &#8212; a mark of how fragmented the wider industry really is.</p>
<p>(Salesforce, incidentally, is an investor in SmartRecruiters, and while right now it&#8217;s not directly working with its portfolio company to build recruitment into what it operates as essentially a massive CRM behemoth, it&#8217;s an interesting prospect and seems like a no-brainer that it might try to some day. Ternynck would not comment&#8230;)</p>
<p>There are already a lot of application tracking systems in the market that can handle the basics of logging candidates and managing their progress through the screening, interview, references, and hiring/rejection cycle &#8212; Ternynck, in fact <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerometernynck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded and sold</a> one of the pioneers in that space, But the problem with these is that they are limited and often work within their own silos. He refers to these ATS systems as &#8220;the first generation&#8221; of recruitment software, a generation that is now getting replaced.</p>
<p>There are some big changes driving that evolution, and specifically SmartRecruiters&#8217; growth. One key area is the bigger shift in &#8220;digital transformation&#8221;, precipitated by the pandemic but also a bigger shift to cloud-based computing and evolutions in big data management. Fragmentation is rife in recruiting, but we now are equipped in the world of IT with many, many ways of navigating that and using the wide amount of information out there to our advantage.</p>
<p>But there is another, more epistemological shift, too. Recruitment, and talent in general, has become a critical part of how a company conceives of its future success. Get the right people on board and you will grow. Fail to hire correctly and you will not, and you might even fail.</p>
<p>&#8220;This round and our progression signals the fact that CEOs have been forced to care more about recruiting,&#8221; he said. They want want to hire the best, he added, but that is fundamentally different from how recruiting has traditionally been approached, which is focused on cost per hire.</p>
<p>&#8220;This means recruiting is coming out of the administration function and into value add and sales and marketing,&#8221; he added. (That&#8217;s another interesting parallel with Dover which has gone so far as to conceive of its recruitment approach as &#8220;orchestration&#8221;, a word more commonly associated with sales software.)</p>
<p>The pandemic has had an impact here, too: employees and &#8220;hires&#8221; today are not what they used to be. It has become more acceptable to work remotely, and what people have come to expect out of jobs, and what roles they are coming from when applying, are all so different, and that also demands a different kind of platform to engage with them.</p>
<p>Indeed, that bigger area &#8212; sometimes referred to as &#8220;the future of work&#8221; &#8212; is part of what attracted this investment.</p>
<p>“Hiring talent and building human capital is more complex and important than ever, and SmartRecruiters is well positioned to help companies attract and land top talent,” said Shawn O’Neill, Managing Director and Group Head, Silver Lake Waterman, in a statement. “Their scale and customer growth are testament to their strong leadership and industry leading platform. We are excited to help fuel SmartRecruiters&#8217; next growth chapter.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, Ternynck noted that even despite the mass layoffs and furloughs experienced in some industries in the last year and a half, SmartRecruiters has seen business grow, even through some of the worst moments of Covid-19. Over the last 12 months, bookings have grown by 70%, he said. That&#8217;s a mark of how recruiting priorities are indeed changing, regardless of whether it&#8217;s a SmartRecruiters, or another kind of company entirely &#8212; and there are many, from Taleo and Cornerstone, through to smaller hopefuls like Dover, and even Salesforce &#8212; who might reap the spoils longer term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the modern world, we tend to like to know where our food comes from and this has massively influenced professional kitchens. For decades, food suppliers have sat on one side and distribution channels (restaurants and the like) on the other. But large wholesalers in the middle have traditionally crushed producers on prices and late payments. Professional kitchens can circumvent this by going direct to food producers.  But they can’t manage hundreds of direct relationships. It&#8217;s just not been possible. Until the Internet.</p>
<p><a href="http://collectivfood.com">Collectiv Food</a> is a new startup that addresses this with a new take on the food supply chain model. It directly sources products from suppliers, unlocking price advantages for both suppliers and buyers, it says. Its competitors include Brakes, Bidfood, and Transgourmet.</p>
<p>It’s now raised £12M / $16M in its Series A funding round led by VNV Global, along with VisVires New Protein (VVNP), Octopus Ventures, Norrsken VC, and existing investors, including  Partech, Colle Capital, and Mustard Seed. Frontline Ventures was the earliest investor in 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Launched in 2019, Collectiv so far operates in the UK and France. It operates by sourcing food directly from producers, disintermediating the wholesaler middleman, and delivering straight to professional kitchens. Customers include restaurants, hotels, catering firms, meal-kit companies, and dark kitchens. The company claims that this approach (which also involves multiple distribution points across cities) generates 50% less CO2 emissions than traditional supply methods better prices, fresher products, transparency, traceability, and more reliable service.</p>
<p>Customers include Big Mamma Group, The Hush Collection, Dirty Bones, Megan’s, Crussh, Butchies, Cocotte, Tossed, and Fresh Fitness Food. </p>
<p>Collectiv founder Jeremy Hibbert-Garibaldi said in a statement: “We’re being pushed by a combination of strong tailwinds: end-consumers demanding a better understanding of provenance; cities implementing air pollution regulations that limit large freight; a post-Covid hospitality industry desperate to improve margins but with limited staff availability to facilitate this in-house. Combined with our innovative model, we’re able to set our sights on not only becoming a European leader in food distribution over the next few years, but even a global one.”</p>
<p>Björn von Sivers, Investment Manager at VNV Global, said: “Collectiv’s innovative managed marketplace connects a fragmented supply of producers with the very fragmented demand of professional kitchens, creating improved transparency amongst other clear network improvements for all stakeholders.”</p>
<p>In his former profession as a Forensic Accountant, Hibbert-Garibaldi came across the business model for Collectiv after he investigated one of the largest supermarket chains in the UK and their food wholesale leg, mainly for violations of codes of conduct, such as how they were behaving with their suppliers. “I quickly realized that food supply chains were broken, with too much opacity and malpractice, and at the end of the day not benefiting any sides of the marketplace,” he said.</p>
<p>Engrained with a passion for food from his French and Italian origins, he quit his job and spend months in restaurant kitchens to understand the problems they faced: “I wanted to understand why it was so hard for them to source good products, know exactly where their food was coming from, and receive these products reliably and sustainably whenever they needed them. Using this I built my case study to get out to investors and start the business.”</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if Collectiv can scale, or take a chunk out of the vast food supply chain industry, but if it ends up appealing both to suppliers and distributors it will be very interesting to watch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/carlyle-to-acquire-live-broadcasting-and-streaming-tech-outfit-liveu-for-over-400m-say-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report yesterday</a> of an impending sale of LiveU &#8212; one of the big developers of live streaming hardware and software, used by some 3,000 major media organizations &#8212; today the company and its buyer Carlyle <a href="https://www.liveu.tv/liveu-news/press-releases/303-20201/carlyle-to-acquire-liveu-to-further-accelerate-global-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed the deal</a>.</p>
<p>The seller is Francisco Partners, another PE firm that acquired LiveU just two years ago for <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/190602/p20#a190602p20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 million</a>. LiveU and Carlyle are not disclosing the terms of this latest sale, but well-placed sources tell us it&#8217;s for over $400 million. Carlyle noted that equity for the investment will be provided by Carlyle Europe Technology Partners (CETP) IV, a fund that invests in middle market technology-focused opportunities in Europe and the U.S. LiveU is based out of Israel, and this is Carlyle&#8217;s first tech acquisition in the country.</p>
<p>LiveU&#8217;s valuation doubling over two years is partly a reflection of the state of media today. Specifically, video is the centerpiece of how content and information are consumed, and its presence is only growing, and so companies building tools to improve how it is captured and transmitted are hot.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another fillip to the video market has been the pandemic. LiveU will be used to record and transmit thousands of hours of events from the Tokyo Summer Games, which will be more reliant than ever on live video content given the absence of live audiences for a number of key events.</p>
<p>But it is also due to the fact that LiveU itself is growing and consolidating its position. Most recently, it <a href="https://www.liveu.tv/component/k2/303-20201/liveu-acquires-its-uk-channel-partner,-garland-partners-202103160749" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired its channel partner in the UK market</a>, Garland Partners, to build more direct relationships and expand business with its clients in the region.</p>
<p>The company has built out a vertically integrated proposition, which includes not just cameras and other equipment for shooting video, but also encoding equipment to send it, and then hardware for receiving and using the material.</p>
<p>Alongside that, it also has built software to compress data &#8212; essential for being able to capture high-quality video yet still being able to transmit it &#8212; which works using a hybrid of different kinds of cellular, satellite and other networks.</p>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s a resourceful system, which can be used in a modular or all-in deployments, and that flexibility and reliability have led to it signing on some 3,000+ media organizations as customers, who have used it across a number of high-profile events (sporting events and big news events feature strongly) as well as for day-to-day video coverage.</p>
<p>While Francisco has made a relatively quick flip of LiveU as an asset, it sounds like Carlyle might have more strategic plans. The PE firm said it &#8220;will use its deep experience in the media tech sector to support LiveU’s growth ambitions.&#8221; The company already invests in adjacent companies like Disguise, NEP, The Foundry, Vubiquity, BTI Studios and The Mill. It also sounds like LiveU will be used to help the firm continue the consolidation play.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carlyle will seek to further consolidate LiveU’s market position through M&amp;A activity and organic growth while capitalizing on the rapidly growing demand for high-quality live video transmission,&#8221; LiveU noted in a statement, adding that this will also include helping forge more media partnerships. The growing ubiquity of 5G will accelerate that trend, it said.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to partner with Carlyle as we look to expand LiveU’s global footprint and service offering. This is a significant milestone for LiveU and represents a strong vote of confidence in our business,&#8221; said Samuel Wasserman, CEO and cofounder of LiveU, in a statement. &#8220;Carlyle brings deep industry expertise with their track record in the media and technology space alongside a global network. We greatly thank Francisco Partners and IGP Capital for their support and partnership over the last few years.”</p>
<p>“Carlyle has a history of investing in fast-growing and highly innovative, disruptive media technology companies and is truly excited to partner with LiveU which is at the forefront of a rapidly growing market,&#8221; added Michael Wand, MD and co-head of the CETP advisory team, in a statement. &#8220;Our partnership with the LiveU team will allow us to support their growth, driven by a mixture of expanding into new verticals, targeted M&amp;A activity and through further developing their relationships with key media broadcasters, particularly in live sports where we are witnessing an exploding demand for live content. We believe that the ongoing shift towards high quality real-time video content, the cost advantages of bonded cellular versus alternative transmission technologies, and the opportunity to bring live broadcast to hitherto neglected areas such as semi-pro or non-professional sports, provides an enormous growth potential for LiveU.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It took SoftBank several years, but the Japanese investment giant is now ready to bet on India’s food delivery market. Swiggy said on Tuesday it has closed a $1.25 billion financing round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Prosus Ventures.</p>
<p>The new financing round, a Series J, includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/indias-swiggy-nears-5-billion-valuation-in-new-800-million-fundraise/">the $800 million investment the Bangalore-based startup</a> had disclosed to employees earlier this year. (SoftBank alone invested $450 million in the new round.) The new round, which Swiggy says was “heavily oversubscribed,” gives the six-year-old food delivery startup a post-money valuation of $5.5 billion.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/softbank-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-500-million-in-swiggy/">first reported</a> about Swiggy’s engagement with SoftBank and the proposed valuation of $5.5 billion in mid-April. Qatar Investment Authority, Falcon Edge Capital, Amansa Capital, Goldman Sachs, Think Investments and Carmignac and existing investors Accel Partners and Wellington Management also participated in the new round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Swiggy said the new financing round shows the turnaround it has demonstrated in the past few quarters. Like many other startups, Swiggy was severely hit with the pandemic. The startup said its recent bet to expand into grocery delivery, and pick-up and drop service has paid off. The value of orders it is processing now is 30% higher than those in the pre-Covid times, it said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Swiggy&#39;s performance this year, per Prosus Ventures. <a href="https://t.co/AqcKYQ8ml1">pic.twitter.com/AqcKYQ8ml1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Manish Singh (@refsrc) <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc/status/1341612973790412800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 23, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“The participation of some of the most visionary global investors is a huge vote of confidence in Swiggy’s mission and ability to build an enduring and iconic company out of India. The scope of food delivery in India is massive and over the next few years, we will continue to invest aggressively into growing this category,” said Sriharsha Majety, chief executive of Swiggy, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Our biggest investments will be in our non-food businesses that have witnessed tremendous consumer love and growth in a short span, especially in the past 15 months of the pandemic. I believe the next 10-15 years offer a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for companies like Swiggy as the Indian middle class expands and our target segment for convenience grows to 500 million users.”</p>
<p>The new investment comes at a time when Indian startups are raising record capital and a handful of mature firms are beginning to explore the public markets. Zomato, Swiggy’s chief rival in India, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">raised $1.3 billion in its initial public offering</a> last week and financial services startups Paytm and MobiKwik have also filed for their initial public offerings.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s food delivery market, which analysts at Bernstein expect to balloon to be worth $12 billion by 2022, they wrote in a report to clients earlier this year.</p>
<p>A third player, Amazon, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/amazon-expands-its-food-delivery-service-across-bangalore/">entered the food delivery market in India last year</a>, though its operations are still limited to parts of Bangalore. At a virtual conference ahead of the IPO last week, Zomato executives dismissed Amazon as a serious competitor for now. “There’s no major impact on market share from Amazon so far,” the company’s chief financial officer said.</p>
<p>For SoftBank, a regular fixture of the Indian startup ecosystem, this is the first time it has bet on a food delivery player. The Japanese conglomerate has backed Indian startups in multiple categories including e-commerce (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/flipkart-valued-at-37-6-billion-in-new-3-6-billion-fundraise/">Flipkart</a>, Snapdeal, Meesho, Lenskart, Firstcry), ride-hailing (Uber and Ola), and edtech (Unacademy). SoftBank has invested in several food delivery startups globally including DoorDash and Uber Eats. Prosus Ventures, an early investor in Swiggy, has also backed several food delivery startups globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;From its early days, I have had the privilege to watch Swiggy execute on their vision to become the leader in the convenience economy. Their focus on consumer delight, product innovation, and ecosystem support has made Swiggy a compelling digital experience in India. They have the railroads in place to empower multiple businesses to reach the new age consumer on a daily basis, and food delivery is just the beginning,” said Sumer Juneja, Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement.</p>
<p>Swiggy said it will deploy the fresh funds to accelerate its &#8220;multi-year strategy&#8221; of growing its core food delivery business and building new food and non-food adjacencies this year and beyond.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Choco is digitizing the food supply chain as the United States estimates of the food produced here approximately 40% is wasted.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The United States estimates of the food produced here <a href="https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs">approximately 40% is wasted</a>. Globally, $2.6 trillion annually is lost.</p>
<p>Berlin-based <a href="http://choco.com/">Choco</a>, which has built ordering software for restaurants and their suppliers, is working to digitize the food supply chain and announced $100 million in Series B funding, led by Left Lane Capital, to give it a $600 million post-market valuation. Joining in is new investor Insight Partners and existing investors Coatue Management and Bessemer Venture Partners.</p>
<p>The new round comes just over a year after Choco’s $63.7 million Series A, raised at two different periods, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/choco-raises-33-5m-to-bring-restaurants-and-suppliers-a-modern-ingredient-ordering-platform/">$33.5 million round</a> in 2019 and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/choco-gobbles-up-30-2m-at-a-250m-valuation-tweaks-restaurant-supplier-ordering-platform-to-sell-to-consumers-during-pandemic/">$30.2 million round</a> in 2020 — at a $230 million valuation — to bring total funding to $171.5 million since the company was founded in 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s core food procurement technology digitizes ordering workflow and communications for restaurants and suppliers. During the global pandemic, Khachab said Choco became the go-to tool for operators to be more efficient around procurement processes and reducing expenses as they adapted to the changing market conditions.</p>
<p>With the food industry a $6 trillion market, Choco CEO Daniel Khachab told TechCrunch he aims to make the food supply chain more transparent and sustainable in order to help increase margins in the food service sector and combat climate change.</p>
<p>The company did 14 months of food waste research and found that it was central to a lot of other global problems: Food waste is the third-largest driver of climate change and is causing deforestation — as evident by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-55130304">news from the Amazon</a> last year  — and the extinction of animals.</p>
<p>“It makes sense to try and solve it,” he added. “The food system is highly fragile, and what was shown in the first and second waves of the pandemic is how fragile and inflexible it was. It made the industry realize that it has to step up and that it can’t continue to work on pen and paper.”</p>
<p>Between the farmer and the end point, there are some nine parties involved, Khachab said. None are connected to another, which often means nine data silos and data not collected along the chain. It is important to connect them on one single platform so decision-making can be data-driven, he added.</p>
<p>As uncertainty swept across the food industry at the beginning of the pandemic, Khachab said Choco could either lay low and wait or invest in the company. He chose the latter, pumping up the team, regions and technology. As a result, Choco’s technology is stronger than it was 15 months ago and proved to be flexible amid the inflexible environment.</p>
<p>Choco saw orders quadruple on the platform in the past year, and gross merchandise value grew to $900 million annualized, up from $230 million, Khachab said.</p>
<p>As the company continues to learn how it can provide value to the food supply chain, half of the Series B funding will go into technology development. It will also go toward doubling its headcount, especially on the engineering side. Choco recently brought on ex-Uber and Facebook executive Vikas Gupta as chief technology officer, and Khachab said Gupta’s expertise will enable the company “to build the best technology team in Europe” and scale faster.</p>
<p>Choco is already operating in six markets, including the United States, Germany, France, Spain, Austria and Belgium. Khachab expects to expand in those markets and gain a footprint in new markets like Latin America, the Middle East and Asia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube has acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/7-month-old-simsim-secures-16m-for-its-social-commerce-in-india/">social commerce startup Simsim</a>, the Google-owned firm said on Tuesday. Neither of the firms disclosed the terms of the deal, but two people with knowledge of the matter told TechCrunch the Indian startup was valued at over $70 million.</p>
<p>Two-year-old Simsim had raised about $17 million prior to today&#8217;s announcement and was valued at $50.1 million in its 2020 Series B financing round.</p>
<p>The Gurgaon-headquartered startup helps small businesses in India transition to e-commerce by using the power of video and creators. The startup&#8217;s eponymous app acts as a platform to connect local businesses, influencers and customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The thesis, according to Rohan Malhotra of Good Capital, an early backer of Simsim, is: &#8220;micro-influencers are more effective at building a targeted audience (growth), creating entertaining experiences (retention), building trust (higher value) and personalising messaging (conversion). Consumer social platforms (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, etc.) cannot meaningfully monetise via advertising-financed models in India; this unlocks the opportunity for more deeply integrated transactional platforms. New internet users in India need an interactive seller-led experience to replicate the offline e-commerce experience this market is used to.&#8221;</p>
<p>He, like everyone else, declined to comment on the size of the deal. The Simsim chief executive didn&#8217;t respond to a query about the acquisition Monday evening (IST).</p>
<p>“We started Simsim with the mission of helping users across India shop online with ease, enabled through small sellers and brands showcasing and selling their products using the power of content by trusted influencers. Being a part of the YouTube and Google ecosystem furthers simsim in its mission,&#8221; Simsim cofounders Amit Bagaria, Kunal Suri and Saurabh Vashishtha said in a joint statement. Bagaria and Vashishtha previously worked together at Paytm.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot think of a better ecosystem in which to build simsim, in terms of technology, reach, creator networks and culture. We can’t wait to be part of YouTube and are excited to build simsim within the most admired tech company in the world.”</p>
<p>For YouTube, the acquisition will enable the video streaming giant help small businesses and retailers in India reach new customers in even more powerful ways, wrote Gautam Anand, VP of YouTube APAC, <a href="https://india.googleblog.com/2021/07/helping-viewers-discover-and-buy.html">in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The video streaming service, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/youtube-and-whatsapp-inch-closer-to-half-a-billion-users-in-india/">reaches over 450 million monthly active users in India</a>, doesn&#8217;t plan to make any immediate changes to Simsim and the startup&#8217;s app will continue to operate independently &#8220;while we work on ways to showcase Simsim offers to YouTube viewers,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s announcement is Google&#8217;s latest push in India, where it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">committed to invest $10 billion in the next couple of years</a>. The internet giant has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">backed Indian startups Glance and DailyHunt</a>, both of which operate short-video apps.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;With over 2500 YouTube creators with over one million subscribers, and the success of <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-youtube-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Shorts</a>, which we launched in India first, we’re committed to bringing the best of YouTube to India and growing the creator community by making it even easier for the new generation of mobile-first creators to get started,&#8221; he added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to the city survey of Bielefeld, Germany, part of our ongoing survey into European cities.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome to the city survey of Bielefeld, Germany, part of our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">ongoing survey into European cities</a>. If you&#8217;d like your city featured, just fill in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">this form</a> and add your city name. Once we have enough entries from a city, we will put your city on TechCrunch!</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.westfalen-blatt.de/Ueberregional/Nachrichten/Wirtschaft/4099368-Bereits-80-Gruenderfirmen-in-OWL-Risikokapital-und-Foerdergelder-helfen-Start-ups-sammeln-Milliarden-ein">local media reports</a>, Bielefeld’s has experienced a tech boom in recent years, with accelerators like the local <a href="http://foundersfoundation.de/">Founders Foundation</a> (backed by the Bertelsmann Foundation) and <a href="https://www.tecup.de/garage33/">Garage 33</a> (at the University of Paderborn) attracting a new wave of young company founders to the East Westphalia-Lippe region.</p>
<p>Notable startups to emerge include Semalytix, Valuedesk, Zahnarzt-Helden, StudyHelp, PartWorks and AMendate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Bielefeld suffers from the same ailment the rest of Germany is subject to: Most startups gravitate to Berlin, followed by Munich, then Hamburg (according to an initiative from <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/it-medien/gruenderszene-berlin-und-muenchen-sind-die-hochburgen-der-ki-start-ups-doch-diese-konzentration-ist-gefaehrlich/22710288.html?ticket=ST-6398724-J4XeeD4ErjqFE95MScfA-ap6">UnternehmerTUM</a> in Munich).</p>
<p>However, as Business Punk magazine <a href="https://www.business-punk.com/2021/03/vorbild-israel-wie-ostwestfalen-lippe-zum-gruenderinnen-hotspot-wurde/">found</a> earlier this year, the Ostwestfalen-Lippe region in northern North Rhine-Westphalia is home to some of Germany’s biggest companies. That means startups aiding large organizations to digitize post-pandemic have ready access to some of Germany’s largest companies and institutions.</p>
<p>Our survey respondents pointed out that the region is strong in sectors such as B2B because of the many old-school B2B companies in the manufacturing area. There is fairly ready access to many large family offices such as Dr. Oetker, Miele, CLAAS, Schüco and Bertelsmann, so there is a lot of capital available.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The region has a good momentum for startups in general, [largely] because of Founders Foundation. At the same time, them being the only institutional driver leads to a certain monoculture,” said one.</p>
<p>Deep tech technologies are a feature of the ecosystem, but there are “almost no B2C or direct-to-consumer” startups, said another respondent.</p>
<p>Commenting on the investment scene in the city, survey respondents said investors have &#8220;strong bonds to the industry and Mittelstand.&#8221; However, another commented that there are &#8220;only very few local investors with NRW or OWL focus like EnjoyVenture (Technologiefonds OWL), but not much more.&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, companies get decent attention from &#8220;national&#8221; investors, and Founders Foundation has really boosted the scene in the region. Angels are also becoming more active, and &#8220;there is a strong business angel community in Bielefeld who have been really supportive of the new startup scene.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="p1">Jonathan Maycock, co-founder and CEO, margin</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bielefeld&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
We are strong in the cryptotrading ecosystem. We are most excited by the adoption of Bitcoin as a financial asset by corporates and institutions as well as the ongoing network effect and adoption by the masses. We need to add support for DeFi trading venues alongside the centralized exchanges we already support.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Semalytix, Zahnarzt-Helden, Coindex and Valuedesk.</p>
<p><strong>What is the tech investment scene like in Bielefeld? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Since <a href="https://foundersfoundation.de/">Founders Foundation</a> started in Bielefeld in 2016 the startup scene has exploded. We joined the first accelerator and since then 24 startups have been founded and come through its programs. There is a strong business angel community in Bielefeld that has been really supportive of the new startup scene.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think will people stay in Bielefeld, move out, or will people move in?</strong><br />
We switched completely to home office once the pandemic got underway. For us, it has worked really well and we now have three employees who work outside of Bielefeld. Everything is more flexible now.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)?</strong><br />
Sebastian Borek (CEO of the Founders Foundation), Eduard R. Doerrenberg (managing director, Dr. Wolff Group).</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think Bielefeld’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
As Bielefeld is in the heart of the German &#8220;Mittelstand&#8221;, there are huge opportunities for tech startups to help these large industries take a leap forward with technical solutions using AI, blockchain and other technologies. The city is well served by Bielefeld University, which turns out highly qualified CS graduates every year. Especially with the superb backing of the Founders Foundation, the startup ecosystem in Bielefeld has a bright future.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Louis Schulze, ecosystem development manager, Founders Foundation</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bielefeld&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 19, 2021. In the old days, venture capital had seasons. VCs didn’t work in December, and the July-August period could be a bit hazy. Such variations have declined. Deal-making, it turns out, is now pretty much the theme for all seasons. Evidence? Just read what’s below! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/colombian-on-demand-delivery-startup-rappi-raises-over-500m-at-a-5-25b-valuation/">Rappi raises $500M:</a> </strong>The on-demand economy is still hot around the world, something we can know for sure thanks to Rappi’s latest half-billion-dollar raise. The Colombian delivery company is now worth $5.25 billion. That’s a lot of money. Per Crunchbase data, the unicorn has now raised more than $2 billion since inception. Rappi operates in nine countries and 250 cities across Latin America.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/18/zoom-buys-cloud-call-center-firm-five9-for-14-7-billion/">Zoom buys Five9:</a> </strong>Well, the deal got announced at least. It won’t close until next year. But the $14.7 billion transaction has folks talking. It’s a large amount of money, and it’s the combination of two public companies. Both companies, of course, are formerly venture-backed companies, and the deal could help set some pricing notes for other software M&amp;A. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/the-zoom-five9-deal-is-a-big-bet-for-the-video-conferencing-company/">has a look at the price of the deal here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Robinhood and Duolingo set prices for their IPOs:</strong> If you are into watching the biggest tech companies go public, you are in luck. We got fresh infusions of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/robinhood-targets-ipo-valuation-up-to-35b-amid-warning-that-crypto-incomes-are-slipping/">data from both Robinhood</a>, the U.S. consumer fintech giant, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/duolingos-ipo-could-cast-golden-halo-on-edtech-startups/">Duolingo, the U.S. edtech giant</a>. Enjoy!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/switch-raises-20m-for-a-personalized-engagement-system-designed-to-boost-health-outcomes/">Sweetch raises $20M to help you get off your backside:</a> </strong>If you wear a smartwatch, you’ve gotten notifications from it at the wrong time. A nudge to get up and move, say, when you are seated at a restaurant. Sweetch wants to provide smarter inducements for folks to take better care of themselves, framing it as a way to “outsmart chronic conditions.” Given how much we could all do better at health, I am curious about how this startup performs.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/dover-raises-20m-to-bring-the-concept-of-orchestration-to-recruitment/"><strong>Dover raises $20M to make recruiting more organized:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Recruiting is not a great process. Mostly it’s done by hand, and managed in spreadsheets, or perhaps a system like Lever. But startups think that there is more room for improvement. Dover is one such company, hoping that its software that helps recruiters “juggle and aggregate multiple candidate pools to source suitable job candidates automatically, and then manage the process of outreach” is just the ticket. And now it has raised from Tiger.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/breakr-raises-4-2m-to-connect-influencers-with-emerging-musicians/"><strong>Breakr wants to connect musicians and influencers:</strong></a> The days when radio play was the way to break into the mainstream are firmly behind us. Startups like Breakr want to help musical artists navigate the new world by connecting them to folks with their own audiences. Along the way, Breakr will take a 10% cut of fees generated from linking the two parties.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/recapped-lands-6-million-for-collaborative-sales-software-that-gets-the-customer-in-the-mix/"><strong>Recapped raises $6.3M for better sales software:</strong></a> Akin to how Dover wants to help make recruiting a smoother process, Recapped wants to improve the sales process, namely by building software that provides greater visibility into sales pipelines and by providing buyers with a similar digital interface that it provides to sales folks. Anything to make buying stuff less awful, please!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/jll-khosla-lead-jones-12-5m-series-a-for-real-estate-vendor-compliance/"><strong>Jones wants to make hiring commercial real estate vendors simpler:</strong></a> If you own a building, hiring folks to do work in or on said building is fraught with liability. Jones just raised $12.5 million to help CME folks “find and hire the people they need in a compliant way.”</li>
<li>TechCrunch broke the news that private equity group Carlyle is <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/carlyle-to-acquire-live-broadcasting-and-streaming-tech-outfit-liveu-for-over-400m-say-sources/">looking to spend more than $400 million on LiveU</a></strong>, a livestreaming service.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Founders: How well do you really understand seed-stage financing?</h2>
<p>A famous poem advises us not to compare ourselves with others, &#8220;for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same holds true for startup fundraising; the size of your seed round will be determined solely by your company&#8217;s immediate needs and the investors you&#8217;re working with.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember that fundraising is not the goal,&#8221; says three-time YC alum Yin Wu. &#8220;Building a successful business is.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you are an early-stage founder who&#8217;s seeking clarity about apportioning equity — or if you&#8217;re biting your nails over how much to raise — read this primer. It&#8217;s also a useful overview for early employees and co-founders who may be new to startup financing.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/velodyne-lidar-ceo-resigns-in-latest-internal-drama/">Chaos in lidar-world:</a></strong> The CEO is out at Velodyne, a lidar company that went public via a SPAC. The news follows much other post-SPAC drama, our own Kirsten Korosec reports. In short, going public does not ensure that a company’s ducks will remain in a row after its shares start to trade. Velodyne is now worth just $8.69 per share, down from a high of $32.50.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/cnn-streaming-service-will-offer-live-and-on-demand-content-in-early-2022/"><strong>CNN is going +:</strong></a> Yep, another streaming service with a “+” in its name is coming out. This time from cable news pioneer and hoster-of-many-useless-panels CNN. The company is apparently hiring heavily for the effort. CNN, I hereby offer to host a regular TechCrunch show on CNN+. Call me.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/uber-expands-its-grocery-delivery-service-to-more-than-400-us-cities-and-towns/"><strong>Uber wants to deliver more carrots:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s our takeaway from news that the ride-hailing giant is expanding its grocery-delivery service to some 400 new cities. Uber also has earnings coming up, so the timing of this news item isn’t an accident; the company will have something positive to chat about in case its earnings do not delight investors’ expectations regarding its trailing performance.</li>
<li>Today in cybersecurity, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/biden-china-exchange-hacks-ransomware/"><strong>the United States is pointing a finger at China</strong></a> for “the mass-hacking of Microsoft Exchange servers earlier this year, which prompted the FBI to intervene as concerns rose that the hacks could lead to widespread destruction,” TechCrunch reports. The climate regarding cyber fuckery is changing, with nation-states increasingly content to point a finger at China and Russia for bad behavior.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM will add a full-size electric pickup truck to its GMC lineup, the latest in a string of EV product announcements by the automaker in the past year as it pushes to deliver more than 1 million electric vehicles globally by 2025.</p>
<p>The EV pickup was shared in a slide deck during the media presentation and later confirmed to TechCrunch. Duncan Aldred, vice president of global Buick and GMC, didn&#8217;t provide further details about the vehicle or when it might go into production.</p>
<p>The GM brand is already aiming to begin production of its GMC Hummer EV in the fourth quarter of this year. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/gmc-reveals-the-hummer-ev-1000-hp-350-mile-range-and-0-60-in-around-3-seconds/">GMC Hummer EV</a>, which will be produced at the company&#8217;s Factory ZERO assembly plant in Detroit and Hamtramck, with a 350-mile range, 1,000 HP and up to 11,500 pound feet of torque with a starting price of $80,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The announcement comes three months after GM announced it would produce an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/gm-to-build-an-electric-chevrolet-silverado-pickup-with-more-than-400-miles-of-range/">electric Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck</a>, which will also be assembled at the Factory ZERO plant. The Chevrolet Silverado EV pickup will be based on the automaker&#8217;s Ultium battery platform and will have an estimated range of more than 400 miles on a full charge.</p>
<p>GM President Mark Reuss said at the time that the company is positioning the Chevrolet full-sized pickup for both consumer and commercial markets. The automaker plans to offer retail and fleet versions of the Silverado electric pickup with a variety of options and configurations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the weekend, an international consortium of news outlets reported that several authoritarian governments — including Mexico, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates — used spyware developed by NSO Group to hack into the phones of thousands of their most vocal critics, including journalists, activists, politicians and business executives.</p>
<p>A leaked list of 50,000 phone numbers of potential surveillance targets was obtained by Paris-based journalism nonprofit <a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/case/the-pegasus-project/">Forbidden Stories</a> and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/07/the-pegasus-project/">Amnesty International</a> and shared with the reporting consortium, including The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/">Washington Post</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/18/revealed-leak-uncovers-global-abuse-of-cyber-surveillance-weapon-nso-group-pegasus">The Guardian</a>. Researchers analyzed the phones of dozens of victims to confirm they were targeted by the NSO&#8217;s Pegasus spyware, which can access all of the data on a person&#8217;s phone. The reports also confirm new details of the government customers themselves, which NSO Group closely guards. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/18/hungary-orban-spyware/">Hungary</a>, a member of the European Union where privacy from surveillance is supposed to be a fundamental right for its 500 million residents, is named as an NSO customer.</p>
<p>The reporting shows for the first time how many individuals are likely targets of NSO&#8217;s intrusive device-level surveillance. Previous reporting had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/03/digital-violence-nso-group-spyware/">put the number of known victims</a> in the hundreds or more than a thousand.</p>
<p>NSO Group sharply rejected the claims. NSO has long said that it doesn&#8217;t know who its customers target, which it reiterated in a statement to TechCrunch on Monday.</p>
<p>Researchers at Amnesty, whose work was reviewed by the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, found that NSO can deliver Pegasus by sending a victim a link which when opened infects the phone, or silently and without any interaction at all through a &#8220;zero-click&#8221; exploit, which takes advantage of vulnerabilities in the iPhone&#8217;s software. Citizen Lab researcher Bill Marczak said <a href="https://twitter.com/billmarczak/status/1416801514685796352?s=20">in a tweet</a> that NSO&#8217;s zero-clicks worked on iOS 14.6, which until today was the most up-to-date version.</p>
<p>Amnesty&#8217;s researchers showed their work by <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/">publishing meticulously detailed technical notes</a> and a toolkit that they said may help others identify if their phones have been targeted by Pegasus.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt">Mobile Verification Toolkit</a>, or MVT, works on both iPhones and Android devices, but slightly differently. Amnesty said that more forensic traces were found on iPhones than Android devices, which makes it easier to detect on iPhones. MVT will let you take an entire iPhone backup (or a full system dump if you jailbreak your phone) and feed in for any indicators of compromise (IOCs) known to be used by NSO to deliver Pegasus, such as domain names used in NSO&#8217;s infrastructure that might be sent by text message or email. If you have an encrypted iPhone backup, you can also use MVT to decrypt your backup without having to make a whole new copy.</p>

	</p>
<p>The toolkit works on the command line, so it&#8217;s not a refined and polished user experience and requires some basic knowledge of how to navigate the terminal. We got it working in about 10 minutes, plus the time to create a fresh backup of an iPhone, which you will want to do if you want to check up to the hour. To get the toolkit ready to scan your phone for signs of Pegasus, you&#8217;ll need to feed in Amnesty&#8217;s IOCs, which it <a href="https://github.com/AmnestyTech/investigations/tree/master/2021-07-18_nso">has on its GitHub page</a>. Any time the indicators of compromise file updates, download and use an up-to-date copy.</p>
<p>Once you set off the process, the toolkit <a href="https://mvt-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ios/backup/check.html">scans your iPhone backup file</a> for any evidence of compromise. The process took about a minute or two to run and <a href="https://mvt-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ios/records.html">spit out several files in a folder</a> with the results of the scan. If the toolkit finds a possible compromise, it will say so in the outputted files. In our case, we got one &#8220;detection,&#8221; which turned out to be a false positive and has been removed from the IOCs after we checked with the Amnesty researchers. A new scan using the updated IOCs returned no signs of compromise.</p>
<p>Given it&#8217;s more difficult to detect an Android infection, MVT takes a similar but simpler approach by scanning your Android device backup for text messages with links to domains known to be used by NSO. The toolkit also lets you scan for potentially malicious applications installed on your device.</p>
<p>The toolkit is — as command line tools go — relatively simple to use, though the project is open source so it won&#8217;t be long before someone will surely build a user interface for it. The project&#8217;s <a href="https://mvt-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html">detailed documentation</a> will help you — as it did us.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A major attraction of Africa is its large population of 1.2 billion, which hints at a sizable addressable market. But what happens when your target audience is the governments of 54 countries?</p>
<p>In our situation, that was the case. We started <a href="https://www.domineum.io/">Domineum Blockchain Solutions</a> with the intention to help African governments solve problems with shipping and keeping records.</p>
<p>We knew it&#8217;d be hard work, but didn’t anticipate that getting our first customer would be the most difficult part.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Our first product was a cargo service that tracks shipment origin and movement and determines the contents of goods being imported or exported in any country. We built this to solve the problem of lost revenue due to shipments being passed through informal backdoor channels.</p>
<p>With our focus on sub-Saharan Africa, we approached four countries in 2019: our home country of Nigeria, plus Kenya, Gambia and Guinea-Conakry.</p>
<p>We started this conversation and didn’t get a substantial response from the four countries’ governments. They weren’t open to trying out our solution &#8212; it was new and they weren’t familiar with blockchain technology. Distraught, we decided to add a smaller country to our list: Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>The Freetown seaport, located in the country’s capital, is the main gateway for trade in and out of Sierra Leone, with 80% of trade passing through this port. The port has a long history as a trading hub and benefits from the country’s strategically important location midway between Europe and the Americas.</p>
<p>But Freetown isn’t one of the top ports in Africa or even sub-Saharan Africa; <a href="https://unctadstat.unctad.org/countryprofile/maritimeprofile/en-gb/694/index.html">a fraction of a percentage point</a> of the world’s trade shipment flows through its ports. The small African country, with about 0.1% of the world’s population, exports diamonds, cocoa and coffee and imports food, machinery and chemicals.</p>
<p>Notably, it faced big challenges in shipping these products in and out of the country. A Sierra Leonean supply chain manager <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2019/07/18/sierra-leone-trade-facilitation-improvements-are-starting-to-bear-fruit">described</a> this situation, “We used to face big challenges during the export process. There would be long delays at the port. Our trucks would arrive before midnight and could be stuck in queue for hours, even days. The documentation process was so complicated.”</p>
<p>According to the World Bank, Sierra Leone’s “trade challenges can be attributed to several factors: lack of access to trade information; high levels of physical inspections; multiple fees, licenses, permits and certificates; manual processes; and the lack of coordination among agencies.” Domineum set out to solve this.</p>
<p>Our initial conversations with the Sierra Leone government went well. Fortunately, Sierra had <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2019/07/18/sierra-leone-trade-facilitation-improvements-are-starting-to-bear-fruit">developed</a> a five-year plan (2018-2023), supported by the World Bank Group, to reduce the time and costs needed to move goods across its borders. The goal is to reduce trade costs by 10%. After three months of discussion, our cargo tracking system was implemented.</p>
<p>In late 2019, we started this partnership, and so far we’ve been able to capture $2 million in revenue that would have been lost. The business model is simple: We get a 40% commission out of extra revenue we’re able to capture for the Sierra Leone government via our cargo tracking system.</p>
<p>It’s typical when entering Africa to want to focus on the big and popular markets like Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya. But what we’ve learned so far is that there’s a high probability that these countries might not be your first entry point. A business-to-government model is a difficult one. There’s a lot of politicking that goes into working with the government.</p>
<p>What we’ve seen work is to approach other countries and gain a foothold, then use that as validation that the concept works. With the success of Sierra Leone, we’re hoping to return to other countries and get a better reception.</p>
<p>The success of Sierra Leone got us rethinking the services we were offering. The initial conversation started with a cargo tracking service, but then we wondered if we should offer a different service to countries that said no at first.</p>
<p>We identified that land registration was a common problem in Africa. More than <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/opinion/2013/07/22/securing-africa-s-land-for-shared-prosperity">90% of rural land</a> in Africa is undocumented and therefore vulnerable to land-grabbing. This hampers the growth of agriculture and other sectors because land is lost to other parties or taken forcefully by the government during times of conflict.</p>
<p>We returned to these countries, offering other services like land ownership registration via blockchain. We got a positive response from a state government in Nigeria to carry out a pilot program. We&#8217;re optimistic that once this pilot phase is over, we’ll be able to seal the next business deal.</p>
<p>What’s it like working with African governments? It&#8217;s a smaller addressable market. If you’re looking to pitch a product or service to governments in Africa, it’d be helpful to keep in mind that your first customer might be from a smaller country.</p>
<p>To seize other opportunities, we’ll keep looking to expand to other African countries with this mindset.</p>
