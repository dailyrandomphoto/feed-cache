<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/italy-fines-amazon-1-3-billion-for-abusing-its-market-position/">Italy fines Amazon $1.3B:</a></strong> The fine is due to the U.S. e-commerce giant having “abused its dominant market position and pushed third-party sellers to use the company’s logistics service Fulfillment by Amazon,” TechCrunch reports, citing the Italian Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato. Most tech fines are too small to even note. This one will sting.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/e-commerce-aggregator-merama-gets-its-horn-after-just-12-months-in-business/"><strong>Build a unicorn with this one weird trick:</strong></a> All you have to do, it appears, is tell investors that you are raising capital to launch or aggregate e-commerce brands in a particular market, and, viola, unicorn status. That’s our takeaway from not only covering dozens of rounds in the e-commerce rollup market lately and the fact that Merama went from zero-to-unicorn in less than a year.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/eu-gig-economy-proposal/"><strong>The EU gets ready to change the gig labor market:</strong></a> If your company depends on using contract labor in the European Union, bad news. Things are likely changing in the coming years. Per our own <a href="https://twitter.com/riptari" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha Lomas</a>, “EU lawmakers have formally proposed legislation for the gig economy they hope will improve conditions for platform workers across the bloc.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the day’s mix of startup happenings, one more piece of data for you to chew on. Silicon Valley may be seeing its status as the The Startup Market being challenged both at home and abroad, but another market is not changing as quickly. Namely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/work-bench-report-finds-just-1-9-of-venture-investment-going-to-female-enterprise-founders/">the funding landscape for women founding business-focused software companies</a>. Given just how big a chunk of the startup market such businesses comprise, the gender gap is staggering. (A small shoutout to our own <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ron Miller</a> for his <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller/status/1469025851664646152" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent reporting on inequities</a> in the startup industry is in order, I think.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/robotic-research-raises-228m-series-a-to-build-out-commercial-autonomous-offerings/">Robotic Research raises nearly a quarter billion dollars:</a> </strong>$228 million, to be clear, which is darn close. What does the company do? It turns out that Robotic Research has “spent the last two decades developing on- and off-road autonomous vehicles for the Department of Defense.” So, yes, this is another huge funding round for autonomous vehicles. Let’s hope that this check is indicative of progress <em>made</em>, instead of progress <em>anticipated</em>, regarding the huge problem space that the startup is tackling.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/petra-emerges-from-stealth-with-30m-raised-for-tunnel-boring-robot-swifty/"><strong>Today in Very Good startup names:</strong></a> If you were founding a startup that made underground drilling tech, what would you call it? Perhaps <a href="https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Petra_(Civ6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Petra</em></a><em>? </em>That would be a good name. And the robot itself? How about <em>Swifty</em>? Well, if you thought those would be good names, the Petra crew would agree. They just raised a $30 million Series A for their very not boring boring work.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/ledger-to-launch-crypto-debit-card/"><strong>Ledger to launch crypto debit card:</strong></a> If you own a lot of crypto, how to actually spend the stuff can be an issue. Ledger is working on a debit card to help the crypto-rich use that wealth IRL. In the meatspace, if you will. Coinbase has a similar product, to give an example. Even the Hodl Gang have to pay rent.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/deed-raises-10m-for-its-workplace-giving-platform/">Deed’s better corporate giving platform lands $10M:</a></strong> Many companies have a corporate giving plan in place. Some companies, for example, match employee charitable giving. Deed wants to help more companies do more with their giving work. The startup just landed $10 million for its efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Today in $8.5M-$8.7M rounds: </strong>Rare is it that we see two rounds with the same dollar amount under the $10 million mark. Today we have effectively three. First, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/bird-buddy-smart-bird-feeder-funding/">Bird Buddy raised $8.5 million</a></strong> for its smart bird feeder tech, no joke. Second, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/airplane-internal-tools/">Airplane raised $8.5 million</a></strong> for its developer workflow automation service. And <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/mio-raises-8-7m-series-a-to-make-enterprise-messaging-interoperable/">Mio raised $8.7 million</a></strong> to help make enterprise messaging services like Slack and Teams interoperable.</li>
<li>And then there was <strong>Rho</strong>, which is seeing its corporate spend product rapidly scale. So quickly in fact that investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/rho-raises-75-million-series-b-for-its-one-stop-corporate-spend-and-cash-management-solution/"><strong>just gave it a $75 million Series B</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Closing out today’s startup notes: Acronyms. Namely fintech acronyms. What would happen if you took B2B and smushed into BNPL? Aside from creating the simply awful B2BBNPL (B2BNPL? BBNPL? 2BNPL 2FURIOUS?) acronym, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/affirm-spinout-resolve-raises-25m-in-insight-partners-led-round-to-grow-b2b-buy-now-pay-later-offering/"><strong>Affirm spinout Resolve just raised $25 million</strong></a> for its efforts to bring the buy now, pay later payments and debt phenom to the business-to-business market.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage-based pricing is a companywide effort</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2244885" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/usage-based-pricing-is-a-companywide-effort-not-a-pricing-strategy/"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244885" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2244885 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1280903246.jpg" alt="three people jumping for bubbles" width="1024" height="707" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1280903246.jpg 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1280903246.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1280903246.jpg?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1280903246.jpg?resize=768,530 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1280903246.jpg?resize=680,470 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1280903246.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2244885" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=We+Are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We Are <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/usage-based-pricing-is-a-companywide-effort-not-a-pricing-strategy/">his latest guest post for TechCrunch+</a>, OpenView partner Kyle Poyar explains why usage-based pricing &#8220;is a companywide effort&#8221; that &#8220;requires ditching the old SaaS metrics playbook.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no fad: UBP went mainstream because SaaS companies that use it see dramatically higher growth and retention rates.</p>
<p>Citing examples from powerhouses like Twilio, Stripe, AWS and others, Poyar explains how UBP companies &#8220;share their customers&#8217; success&#8221; and reduce their risk of ending up with a CRM packed &#8220;with lots of unprofitable customers.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/tinder-is-partnering-with-spotify-to-launch-a-new-music-mode-feature/"><strong>Spotify and chill:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, “hanging out” to watch “Netflix” may have become an only marginally coded phrase in English of late, but with Tinder partnering with Spotify to allow users to “hear a 30-second looped preview of a potential match’s chosen song while checking out their profile,” we are curious about how long a variation of the theme will come to market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/netflix-launches-a-website-dedicated-to-news-about-renewals-exclusive-interviews-and-more/"><strong>Netflix takes on SEO spam with new website:</strong></a> American streaming giant has come out with a new website called “Tudum,” which, if you say it out loud, sounds roughly like the noise that the Netflix logo makes when you fire up its app on your television, staring down another night at home thanks to COVID-19. <em>Tudum!</em> Anyhoo, the website “will host consumer news about renewals and release dates,” TechCrunch reports. Which means that those articles about “What To Watch On Netflix November 28, 2021” may lose some of their SEO juice.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/gm-rare-earth-magnet-us-supply-chain/"><strong>GM locks in supplies to build domestic EV tech:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Deciding to build electric vehicles is a step in a longer journey that includes some delicate sourcing work. Getting one’s hands on the raw materials required for battery production is no easy task. Nor is “locking in a domestic source of rare earth minerals, alloy and finished magnets for the electric motors” work that GM has recently undertaken.</li>
<li>And, finally for today’s news roundup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/meta-rolls-out-a-suite-of-new-features-and-discovery-tools-for-facebook-live-creators/"><strong>Meta has rolled out new tooling for Facebook Live users</strong></a>.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tim Berners-Lee’s startup, Inrupt, has raised about $30 million in its Series A financing round, a source familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Forte Ventures led Inrupt&#8217;s new round, the two said Thursday, but both declined to disclose the size of the deal. The round saw participation from “all existing investors,” including Akamai Technologies and Glasswing Ventures, as well as new investors Allstate and the Minderoo Foundation’s Frontier Technology Initiative.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/tim-berners-lee-startup-inrupt-funding/">reported in late October</a> that the three-year-old <a href="https://inrupt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inrupt</a> was in talks to raise between $30 million to $50 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245773" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Inrupt &#8212; founded by the creator of the standards of the world wide web, Berners-Lee, and technologist John Bruce &#8212; is attempting to “reshape the internet” by building a platform that gives users control of their data. The Inrupt team includes cryptography expert Bruce Schneier.</p>
<p>“Business transformation is hampered by different parts of one’s life being managed by different silos, each of which looks after one vertical slice of life,” said Berners-Lee in a statement. “Meanwhile, that data is exploited by the silo in question, leading to increasing, very reasonable, public skepticism about how personal data is being misused.”</p>
<p>Inrupt’s platform enables users to store their personal data in something called a POD (Personal Online Datastores). These PODs are interoperable with decentrealized applications and can be decoupled whenever the user prefers to do so. Inrupt believes, it said in an investor pitch obtained by TechCrunch, that it is attempting to emulate the core infrastructure of companies such as Visa for credit card processing and Verisign, which commercialized the DNS standard.</p>
<p>“This approach allows consumers to take control of their data while giving governments and companies — and their app developers — a more seamless transition into a new internet era and regulatory regime (e.g., GDPR),” wrote Hunter Hartwell, principal at Forte Ventures, <a href="https://medium.com/forteventuresinsights/a-foundation-for-web3-from-the-creator-of-web1-our-investment-in-inrupt-2467a620133e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a blog post</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our thesis for the investment in Inrupt is a simple one: consumers, governments, and many companies are eager to move towards a truly open and collaborative web (aka Web3), and Inrupt’s enterprise Solid server (ESS) represents the most technically advanced and commercially viable path to realizing that future. Embedded in our thesis is the belief that this top-tier team is uniquely qualified to meet the requirements and expectations of government and corporate partners, as well as the broader public,” he added.</p>
<p>Inrupt&#8217;s customers include governments and enterprises. The startup has signed contracts with governments of Sweden, Argentina and Basque, TechCrunch reported earlier. It generated $225,000 in revenue last year, and $200,000 in revenue in September, the report said.</p>
<p>The startup will deploy the funds to “expand its global footprint of Solid deployments in both the government sector and the commercial sector,” said Hartwell.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The company formerly known as Facebook is taking a step toward its goal to transport us to the metaverse. Now, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/facebook-horizon/">Horizon Worlds</a> &#8212; the Second Life or Minecraft of Meta&#8217;s VR apps &#8212; is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/horizon-worlds-open-in-us-and-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding</a> out of invite-only beta, opening up to all users over 18 years old in the U.S. and Canada. This is a huge milestone for the app, which was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/facebook-horizon/"> first announced</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>The free app is a social world-building playground. When you enter the app (after a short tutorial if it&#8217;s your first time), you&#8217;re presented with three options: play (games), attend (events) and hang out. You can explore experiences that Meta itself created, plus community-generated spaces, which anyone can build. In October, the company announced <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/expanding-horizon-new-funding-to-support-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$10 million in funding</a> for creators building these VR experiences, incentivizing users to make new games and hangouts.</p>

<p>Before you enter any of these virtual spaces, the platform reminds you that anyone you interact with is a real person.</p>
<p>On the primary menu, which you access by looking at your left wrist, there&#8217;s a safety button that you can press, which instantly sends you to your &#8220;Safe Zone,&#8221; a private room where you can take a break or block, mute and report people.</p>
<p>One of the first hangout spaces users might encounter is the Plaza, a space created by Meta. Our legless avatar threw paper airplanes with strangers and even spoke with a community moderator, who chatted with newcomers and helped explain how the controls work (they&#8217;re intuitive enough, but take a few minutes to get used to). It was a weirdly pleasant experience, absorbing the futuristic scenery and listening as people around us chatted about their avatars&#8217; outfits, making metaverse small talk.</p>
<p>But in user-generated spaces, there won&#8217;t always be these human moderators who could intervene if something goes wrong. It&#8217;s not realistic to expect to see a Meta representative in every space in Horizon Worlds &#8212; it might even feel a bit creepy &#8212; but the metaverse poses new challenges in keeping people safe online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Meta has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-ai-enforce-rules-engineers-doubtful-artificial-intelligence-11634338184" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled</a> to remove hate speech and violent images from Facebook, and the company is reeling from the impact of leaked internal documents that show how its app Instagram can be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/seeking-to-respin-instagrams-toxicity-for-teens-facebook-publishes-annotated-slide-decks/">dangerous</a> for teens&#8217; mental health. Just yesterday, head of Instagram Adam Mosseri <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/instagrams-adam-mosseri-senate-hearing-teen-safety/">testified</a> before Congress about online safety for children and teens. But a metaverse world poses additional challenges, as it&#8217;s a more immersive audio-visual experience. Clubhouse <a href="https://www.protocol.com/moderation-clubhouse-building-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled to moderate</a> its live audio rooms, and even Twitter has <a href="https://twitter.com/SBkcrn/status/1465659201800347651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run into issues</a> with harmful content on Spaces as of late. Twitch streamers have dealt with &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/streamers-are-boycotting-twitch-today-to-protest-the-platforms-lack-of-action-on-hate-raids/">hate raids</a>,&#8221; too.</p>
<p>But in terms of user experience, Horizon Worlds is a massive step up from Horizon Venues, Meta&#8217;s platform for immersive events (once Worlds is globally accessible out of beta, Venues might be rendered obsolete).</p>
<p>Right now, if you use Venues, you just get dropped into a blocky entry area, like a hallway in a movie theater. You can choose from a few rooms to enter, where you can watch a pixelated recording of a Billie Eilish concert on loop, for example. Worlds already feels more engaging and promising than Venues. But as Horizon Worlds opens itself up for millions of users to join, Meta needs to prove that it&#8217;s capable of keeping a social platform safe.</p>
<p>To run Horizon Worlds, you&#8217;ll need to download the free app on a Quest 2 device. As of January 13, 2022, it will no longer be supported on Quest 1.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So your company is going WFH/Office hybrid. Great! Working from home more rules, even if management decisions or the specifics of your role mean it can&#8217;t happen <em>every</em> day.</p>
<p>Now, how do you coordinate who goes in the office and when? Does it have to be the same day(s) every week? Do you just pick a random day and hope there&#8217;s a desk open? What if you&#8217;re the only one who went in that day — did you really need to commute? Do we track all this in a spreadsheet, or do we need a whole separate tool just to keep track of it?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getofficely.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Officely</a> wants to handle it all right through a tool many teams are already on anyway: Slack. They&#8217;ve just raised a $2 million seed round to grow from here.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245730" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Officely&#8217;s main draw is desk booking, allowing you to group desks by which office they&#8217;re in — or, if you&#8217;ve got a bunch of desks, into &#8220;neighborhoods&#8221; within an office. You can see how many people are going in to an office on any given day, see if there&#8217;s a desk open for you, and join if so. There&#8217;s also a few other customizations, like flagging if anyone is bringing a dog into the office on each day — for the folks who might want to stay home because of allergies or, if you&#8217;re like me, only want to go into the office when there&#8217;s at least one dog there.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2245751" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245751" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2245751" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Booking-Giff.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="578" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245751" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Officely</p></div></p>
<p>You can set up customizable health screening surveys to make sure no one has a fever or known exposures, and have it automatically remind people to fill out the survey on the morning they&#8217;re expected to come in. If someone gets sick, Officely can also help with contact tracing, building a list of the employees who were in the office on the same days.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve also recently been experimenting with an &#8220;Office Chat&#8221; feature, which automatically creates a new Slack room at the beginning of a day, invites everyone who is scheduled to be in that day, then archives it at the end of the day. Great for figuring out lunch plans without bugging everyone back at home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I fired up a test instance of Officely, and it was really quite smooth. The UI for customizing some things away from their defaults can feel a bit buried, but that&#8217;s mostly because they&#8217;re working within the boundaries of being a Slack app — but they also do a bunch of neat stuff I didn&#8217;t even realize Slack apps can do. Team TC isn&#8217;t spending much time in the office right now so I couldn&#8217;t stress test it super hard, but I liked what I saw enough that we&#8217;ll probably give it a spin if/when we return to the office.</p>
<p>Officely is currently free for small teams, with the free plan capped at 10 employees and one office. If you&#8217;ve got more employees or more offices, they&#8217;ll charge $2.50 per office employee per month (&#8220;We only ever charge for your employees that use Officely to book into the office,&#8221; they note.) Once you grow past 500 employees, they offer custom pricing plans.</p>
<p>So why build the whole thing within Slack? &#8220;The interesting challenge with desk booking tools is the software has to be adopted by everyone in the company to be effective,&#8221; co-founder Max Shepherd-Cross tells me. Convincing everybody to onboard onto some new web app is tough; Slack, meanwhile, is where many companies&#8217; mishmash of teams are already used to coming together.</p>
<p>Officely is a pivot; the team started back in 2017 with a different focus: hotel room booking. &#8220;We just got <em>crushed</em> by COVID. Overnight, we lost all of our customers,&#8221; says Shepherd-Cross. &#8220;After crying into our pillows for a couple of weeks, we had the realization that offices of the future are going to be run like hotels of the past. [&#8230;] The whole booking infrastructure we&#8217;d spent the previous four years building for hotels, we now need for offices.&#8221;</p>
<p>This round was led by TEN13, and backed by angel investors Vu Tran (co-founder of learning platform Go1) and Adam Schwab (CEO of travel co. Luxury Escapes).</p>

The new in-feed experience reflects on people&#8217;s year on the platform and curates it into a shareable card. The new feature is available globally starting today and will be accessible until December 30th.</p>
<p>On Instagram, users can share a custom end-of-year &#8220;Playback&#8221; time capsule to their IG Story. The feature leverages the Stories Archive, so users can customize and select up to 10 stories to share with their followers. To be eligible for this feature, users need to have posted more than three stories this year or have Stories Archive turned on. The platform will suggest Playback posts for you, but you&#8217;ll also have the option to pick what you want to share. Users will see a message in their Instagram feed inviting them to create their own Playback. The new feature will be available to users for several weeks.</p>

<p>In previous years, Instagram users have created their own version of an end-of-year feature where they would post their top nine images in a photo grid. This year, Instagram is offering an in-app method for its users to create shareable end-of-year content.</p>
<p>Both Facebook and Instagram&#8217;s new features are fully customizable so users can add or remove content and posts that they choose. Meta notes that these two features are rolling out over the next few days to all users around the globe.</p>
<p>The launch of the new features comes as shareable end-of-year recaps have become increasingly popular thanks to Spotify’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/spotifys-wrapped-2021-arrives-with-artist-video-messages-blend-and-even-a-game/"> annual Wrapped</a> experience that is widely shared across social media each year. Facebook and Instagram join many other digital giants looking to mimic the popular feature by releasing their own versions. For example, Reddit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/reddit-rolls-out-personalized-end-of-year-recaps-with-stats-about-users-habits/">rolled out</a> personalized recaps with stats about users&#8217; habits this week; meanwhile, Snapchat is expected to launch its &#8220;Year End Story&#8221; this month as well.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The world let out a collective sigh of relief when 2021 arrived. We congratulated ourselves for navigating 2020 and welcomed the year when things would finally go back to normal. But as we wrap the year, it’s become clear that &#8220;normal&#8221; is a thing of the past.</p>
<p>This is a reality growth marketers live in everyday. What worked yesterday may not work today and likely won’t work tomorrow. Let’s look at the three growth trends we saw in 2021 and how they will shape marketing in 2022.</p>
<h2>Less data, more privacy and the return of growth hacking</h2>
<p>In April 2021, Apple rolled out iOS 14.5, which made it so that apps required your permission to track your online behavior and serve personalized ads. Predictably, most users didn’t think twice before opting out. Suddenly, the user-level tracking data central to effective audience targeting and marketing attribution was restricted.</p>
<p>Apple implemented this shift in the name of consumer privacy, pledging to create a “safe and trusted place for users to discover apps.” But this change also shifted the power away from social media advertisers such as Facebook and Snap, who went from having unfettered access to user-level browsing and buying data to now receiving only aggregated information, often limited to the past 24 hours.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Meanwhile, platforms like Apple can track performance within their closed ecosystems. In fact, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4c19e387-ee1a-41d8-8dd2-bc6c302ee58e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook, YouTube, Snap and Twitter lost nearly $10 billion</a> in ad revenue, while Apple’s advertising business (search ads) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/074b881f-a931-4986-888e-2ac53e286b9d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tripled its market share</a>.</p>
<p>The change severely limits advertising algorithms and how much data can be used to optimize marketing campaigns. These limitations are localized to mobile activity today, but Apple has also unveiled a new feature for <a href="https://www.litmus.com/blog/apple-mail-privacy-protection-for-marketers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email</a> to hide your IP address from senders. Google is following suit and will start restricting device level IDs from advertisers.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Brands that have had the most success with advertising on influencer platforms urge marketers: &#8220;Don’t make ads, make TikToks.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h3>Predictions for 2022</h3>
<p>No longer armed with user-level data or access to robust platform attribution, marketers will have to roll up their sleeves and do it themselves. Top performers will embrace the roots of marketing measurement and media mix modeling, which involves comparing sales with marketing spend and using regression analysis to draw correlations and assign weightings to your marketing channels.</p>
<p>Brands will also need to experiment by evaluating advertising effectiveness by using <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/blog/tips-strategy/incrementality-testing-for-marketers/">incrementality tests</a>, such as turning channels on and off for select periods of time and using <a href="https://artofmarketingscience.github.io/what-are-geo-experiments/">geographic holdouts</a> (selecting control cities with no ad spend). Growth marketers will also need to collaborate more with their internal data science teams to construct bespoke attribution models, as one size will not fit all.</p>
<h2>TikTok, influencers and the dominance of native creative</h2>
<p>TikTok continued its meteoric rise this year, surpassing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/">1 billion monthly active users</a> in September. Influencer platforms are increasing their share of consumer screen time (~24 hrs/month for TikTok and ~22 hrs/month for YouTube in the U.S.).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">When I started getting involved in clean tech 1.0 financing back in 2005, “climate change” was some future event.</p>
<p>Hurricane Katrina had just happened, and many experts viewed it primarily as a failure of the government to take care of its weakest citizens in the face of a natural disaster, not as climate change’s early shot. Al Gore’s movie, “An Inconvenient Truth,” had not come out yet. The scale of human-made CO<sub>2</sub> and its impact on temperature were still somewhat debated. Most key scientists and investors understood, but the general population and politicians were ambivalent at best.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2021: Climate change looks like a misnomer and we are in a true climate crisis. We see historic fires in Greece, Portugal and North America’s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/western-wildfires" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entire West Coast</a>; epic floods in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/23/europe/germany-floods-belgium-climate-change-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germany</a>; devastating tornadoes in historically temperate geographies such as the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57605651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Czech Republic</a>; record-breaking hurricanes in the Caribbean and Philippines; drought in Syria that ultimately led to civil war; destruction of the Great Barrier Reef. The list goes on. Nearly every region in the world has been heavily affected.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245500" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The climate crisis is real, happening now and really hurting us. So what do we do about it, and how do we allocate our money, time and brainpower to develop solutions? I believe it is a financial and a moral imperative to make climate technology, together with medicine, the main priority of humanity.</p>
<h2>The financial imperative</h2>
<p>If you don’t reduce carbon in your portfolio and in your business, you will become a dinosaur. Several stakeholders are coming together to create a financial groundswell.</p>
<p>Pensions and endowments are under increasing pressure to divest from fossil fuels. Shareholders are moving away from the likes of Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon, while more than 70 ESG/energy transition companies have <a href="https://qz.com/2036760/the-climate-tech-spac-boom-is-just-getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gone public via SPACs and IPOs</a> in the U.S. just in the past 18 months. Out of these companies, I would be willing to bet that 10 or more will be decacorns and two or three will be hectocorns.</p>
<p>For insurance companies, the natural hazard risk models have broken. FEMA maps are increasingly becoming obsolete; <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/100-year-floods-happening-term-change/story?id=78969683" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100-year floods</a> are happening every few years. Fire risk maps need to be completely redrawn. Having spent most of my adult life on the East and West coasts of the U.S., the damage is real. If buildings are on fire or underwater, they don’t have much value. We are discussing these issues with large insurers and the interest is unprecedented.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Governments are finally putting tough building codes in place. For example, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/16/10percent-london-offices-at-risk-of-becoming-obsolete-under-new-energy-rules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10% of buildings in London</a> will not be up to code in early 2022. U.S. cities and states have been slower to adopt, but if you don’t think this is coming, look at other regulatory patterns where the EU led and the U.S. followed.</p>
<p>Tenants are demanding cleaner buildings, especially among Gen Zs and millennials. Consumer brands, like <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-announces-2-billion-climate-pledge-fund-invest-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability/climate-innovation-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.unilever.com/news/press-releases/2020/unilever-sets-out-new-actions-to-fight-climate-change-and-protect-and-regenerate-nature-to-preserve-resources-for-future-generations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unilever</a>, are investing billions to invest in climate technology.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as usual in recent history, technology has come to save the prior fumbles by governments and populations. Many promising technologies have matured and now have an easier path to entering the mainstream. The levelized cost of electricity from solar and onshore wind <a href="https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2021/Jun/IRENA_Power_Generation_Costs_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> 85% and 56%, respectively, between 2010 and 2020.</p>
<p>While technological progress has been on an encouraging trajectory in energy and in transportation thus far, we are nowhere near done, especially in real estate and critical infrastructure. Specifically, just deploying the existing technologies in the built environment/real estate will not be sufficient. Even if we ignore payback and return requirements, which are often too difficult to meet, we would take care of less than 50% of the carbon emissions in the built environment with existing technologies, according to a Fifth Wall analysis. Therefore, I believe the focus needs to be twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scale up existing technologies so that payback declines from more than 10 years to two to five years. That’s where growth capital and eventually infrastructure investments come in.</li>
<li>Invent and firm up new technologies. That’s where government, national labs, universities, angel investors and venture capital come in.</li>
</ul>
<p>To tackle the crisis, capital must flood in and even more so than in the past few encouraging years, during which climate tech VC investment <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2020/climate-tech-investment-report-climate-week.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased</a> 40x between 2013 and 2019. We already have several multibillion-dollar tech and biotech venture and growth funds; now is time for several multibillion-dollar climate tech funds globally.</p>
<h2>The moral imperative</h2>
<p>If the financial impact is not convincing enough, I hope the appeal to human decency will be. I have heard so many times from some of the smartest investors in the world that this is not a good time to invest in climate &#8212; and, even more shockingly, that climate is not an “investable thesis.” It is too difficult, too large of a problem, too capital-intensive; we need to leave it to the government.</p>
<p>The short-termism and cynicism are infuriating. If we don’t invest in a major way now, when is the right time? When Northern California’s old forests have burned down? When North Carolina’s beautiful Outer Banks are shredded by hurricanes? When Amazon is worth $5 trillion, while its employees cannot find an insurable home on the West Coast? I would argue we have been focusing our precious resources on the wrong problems.</p>
<p>For the past 20 years, the brightest young people have focused their brains on how to trick people into double-clicking on an ad, getting eyeballs and likes. While certainly major advancements have been made in compute power and interconnectedness, I call the obsession with the social media world of Facebook and Twitter a colossal waste of brainpower given the challenges around health and climate.</p>
<p>The new generation of business leaders must be cut from a different cloth. I want the next Mark Zuckerberg to invent and scale a new battery. The next Jeff Bezos needs to look like Ryan Morris from Turntide Technologies, who is revolutionizing the electric motor industry. The next Jack Dorsey needs to create a new cement or other building material to create sustainable buildings. The next Steve Jobs needs to figure out how to consume, produce and transport water sustainably. Elon Musk might be controversial to some, but the truth is the world needs 10 more Elon Musks. Thus, my call to the next generation of entrepreneurs is to think about carbon, not clicks.</p>
<p>If we believe that the climate crisis is too complex and cannot be fixed fast enough, let’s look at biotech. In a time of crisis, humanity has proved its ability to act decisively. The amazing speed during the pandemic to develop and use vaccines, new monoclonal antibody treatments and ventilator technologies saved lives. Innovation from Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech saved the world from the precipice of an even bigger tragedy &#8212; and this inspires new biotech entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>We need the same urgency applied to climate tech. Many accuse climate tech investors, including myself, and climate scientists as alarmists. I would argue we are not being alarmist <em>enough</em>. The crisis is already unfolding; our minds and bodies are just wired not to feel it too much. Humans have a hard time panicking about a long-lasting, gradually worsening misery. Humanity is the proverbial frog being boiled in the CO<sub>2</sub>-loaded oceans.</p>
<h2>Not investing in climate tech is inexcusable</h2>
<p>Over the past 15 or so years, I have been on both the losing and the winning side of this struggle. We have experienced epic investment failures in biofuels and solar. At the same time, we have enjoyed incredible improvements and wins in batteries, carbon nanotubes, graphene nanomaterials, agtech, solar and wind technology.</p>
<p>I am not naïve; I know how difficult it is to build climate tech businesses. I know it is a capital-intensive sector. I know it takes years to perfect these technologies with a significant component of hardware. I fully appreciate how difficult it is to work with utility and real estate relics and to get them to off-take novel technology when their whole model is built on minimizing capital expenditures and maintenance costs during both construction and operation.</p>
<p>I know we got the timing wrong so many times. The point is this: Because the problem is so large and so hard, we need the brightest scientists, entrepreneurs, lawyers and financiers on it. We do not have a choice. To me, it is not an option to tell my children I was on the wrong side of history: actively supporting the destruction of our planet. I sincerely believe building inefficient, carbon-churning buildings and driving gas-guzzling cars will be looked at in 30 years the same way we look at tobacco or asbestos today: inexcusable.</p>
<p>COVID-19 was the first global war of our generation. Climate is the next, much bigger, one and it will last for several generations. Young entrepreneurs, please, think more about carbon and less about clicks. We will support you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As I<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/deed-pulls-your-employers-charity-and-volunteer-program-into-slack-to-keep-it-front-of-mind/"> wrote</a> earlier this year, <a href="https://www.joindeed.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deed</a>&#8216;s mission is a clearcut one: take the employee giving/charity/volunteer program that many big companies have, and make it better. Give it a proper home — one with a modern UI, built-in community management tools and that hooks into your workflow (read: Slack) so as to not be forgotten.</p>
<p>With that they were able to quickly get some big names on board, citing the likes of Airbnb, Stripe, Box and Adidas as customers quickly after launch. Now they&#8217;ve raised a $10 million Series A to keep the ball rolling.</p>
<p>Last week I hopped on a call with Deed co-founder Deevee Kashi, who stepped away from a conference he was speaking at to catch me up on what&#8217;s new with the company. He tells me that this latest round was led by Earlybird, and backed by PruVen Capital, Y Combinator and Paua Ventures, along with a few names that seem extra interesting from a strategic standpoint — like David Clarke (former CTO of the enterprise workplace management tool Workday), Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Jeffrey Katzenberg&#8217;s Wndrco.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245648" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>One thing Kashi tells me about is an evolving focus for Deed right now: helping companies figure out what their employees really care about, and how to shape the company&#8217;s efforts — often wrapped up under a label of &#8220;Environmental, Social, and Governance&#8221; (or ESG) — accordingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;ESG investments are at record highs, right?&#8221; he says. &#8220;Companies are spending a lot of money, but they are not getting [employee] buy-in before doing so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal for Deed is really changing ESG, and the strategies around ESG, from &#8216;me&#8217; to &#8216;we&#8217;.&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Really empowering employees to take action around causes they care about, thereby allowing companies to listen to and discover what their employees actually care about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of making that work, he says, will involve giving individual employees — not just those in charge of a company&#8217;s social impact team — more abilities to create and manage programs, fundraisers and volunteer campaigns. &#8220;[It&#8217;s about] empowering the employees themselves to manage the program for the company, as opposed to the companies managing the program for the employees.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other part, he notes, is building out their data team and finding ways to &#8220;measure and report on impact&#8221; in a clear, actionable way.</p>
<p>Before this, Deed had raised $2 million in a seed round in late 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remember all the way back to December 2020. Where were you? What were your plans? What did you expect and hope the new year would bring? I suspect I’m not alone in feeling like I’ve spent much of the past year on a hamster wheel, with better days just over the horizon. Truth is, few of us reasonably expected the pandemic to stretch on for this long. And our expectations of “normal” have adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>As we reflect on how the last year has played out for robotics &#8212; and the way things look, going forward &#8212; the pandemic is, once again, the primary force guiding practically every facet of the industry. As I mentioned last week, we’re going to spend these next few weeks wrapping up the year here on Actuator. This week, I want to talk about delivery robotics, a category that’s seen some of the biggest investment this past year.</p>
<p>But first, we’ll be asking some of the industry’s leading names to reflect on the year that was &#8212; and help us forecast how 2022 might look for robotics and automation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245088" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2245095" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245095" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2245095" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cmubd.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="441" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cmubd.jpg 1799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cmubd.jpg?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cmubd.jpg?resize=300,129 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cmubd.jpg?resize=768,330 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cmubd.jpg?resize=680,293 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cmubd.jpg?resize=1536,661 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cmubd.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245095" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CMU/Boston Dynamics</p></div></p>
<p>First up is Matthew Johnson-Roberson, who recently became the director of CMU’s Robotics’ Institute. Johnson-Roberson served as co-director for the University of Michigan’s Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicles and co-founder of Refraction AI &#8212; which is to say, it’s not surprising that he offers some insight into how things will look for the autonomous driving industry.</p>
<p><strong>What was the defining robotics/AI/automation trend of 2021?</strong> I’m seeing increasing trends in application-specific AI companies (computer vision tasks, robotics devices to solve a problem, chat bots for x, etc.). Those seem poised to continue as the market looks for good fits for increasingly powerful algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>What will 2022 bring for these categories?</strong> In the coming year, I expect more of the large self-driving companies to continue their consolidation and more to go public as they prepare to burn capital attempting to expand and serve customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week we also spoke to Rob Playter, the longtime Boston Dynamics executive who was appointed CEO early last year.</p>
<p><strong>What was the defining robotics/AI/automation trend of 2021?</strong> Legged robots coming of age. 2021 saw the introduction of multiple legged robots to the market. Quadrupeds are leaving the lab and entering the workplace, and the ongoing labor shortages plaguing many industries has only intensified the need. We&#8217;ve seen strong interest for Spot around industrial use cases where mobile robots can navigate worksites that include stairs, doors and other obstacles that would foil wheeled or tracked robots. Our customers are using Spot as a dynamic sensing platform to collect reliable, repeatable data around their sites for tasks like thermal anomaly detection in industrial manufacturing, radiation mapping in nuclear facilities and digital twin modeling on construction sites. Products like Spot are proving they can add real value in the real world.</p>
<p><strong>What will 2022 bring for these categories?</strong> Operational adoption. In 2022 customers will begin deploying mobile robots like Spot at greater scale across their enterprises. We&#8217;ve seen tremendous uptake by industrial innovation teams exploring mobile robots for a wide variety of applications, and next year we expect to see customers integrating more robots into their asset management programs and day-to-day operations. But for industrial mobile robots to expand rapidly at enterprise scale, we also need to see greater reliability from the industry as a whole. We&#8217;ve seen a lot of products announced that are conceptual-only or that have only been deployed in small proof-of-concept exercises. As more and more businesses look to invest in real-world technology, the most reliable, robust and accessible products will prevail.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195465" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195465" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2195465" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg" alt="Nuro-Las Vegas fundraising round" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195465" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nuro</p></div></p>
<p>Few segments of this industry gained more traction over these past two years than delivery. Prior to the pandemic, much of the conversation around autonomous delivery centered around regulation and questions of demand. After the first several months of the pandemic brought much of the world to a standstill, leaving many afraid to venture outside the safety of their own homes, delivery services like Seamless and Uber Eats saw a sharp uptick in usage.</p>
<p>While stay-at-home orders have loosened in much of the world throughout 2021, myriad issues have continued to plague industries, leaving sharp demand for automation. These include widespread staffing shortages for food service and other blue-collar jobs, as well as global supply chain and shipping issues. That is to say that delivery issues aren’t just a matter of last- or middle-mile &#8212; it’s every segment here.</p>
<p>For those reasons (for starters, at least), it’s unsurprising that so much of this has been met with a massive uptick in investments across the board. As with so much of robotics, problems analysts expected companies would be tackling five or 10 years down the road are suddenly impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>Nuro led the way with one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/nuro-lands-investment-from-google-tiger-global-in-new-600-million-round/">biggest robotics raises in recent memory</a>, led by (who else?) Tiger Global. The $600 million Series D, announced early last month, increased the company’s valuation north of 70%, to $8.6 billion. Integral to the deal is a new partnership with Google Cloud, which finds both parties pushing the service toward commercialization, as they “explore opportunities together to strengthen and transform local commerce.”</p>
<p>If you’ve spent any time near college campuses, there’s a decent chance you’ve seen delivery robots like Kiwibot out in the world. And while funding &#8212; and, in Nuro’s case, production &#8212; is ramping up, you’re almost certainly getting a majority of packages delivered to you by human beings at this point.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241938" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241938" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2241938" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg" alt="The Coco One sidewalk delivery robot powered by Segway on the Palisades" width="1024" height="819" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg 4653w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg?resize=768,614 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg?resize=680,544 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg?resize=1536,1229 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg?resize=2048,1638 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241938" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Coco</p></div></p>
<p>Speaking of campuses, UCLA spinout Coco saw a decent size round early this year with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/last-mile-robotic-delivery-firm-coco-raises-36m/">a $36 million raise</a>, bringing the company’s funding up to $43 million. Co-founder and CEO Zach Rash insisted that the time is now for such delivery technologies, noting in a release, “I strongly believe the delivery service industry in its current state is massively under-serving merchants. We have an enormous opportunity to create a better experience for hundreds of thousands of merchants and their customers, today. This is not a research program experimenting with technology to be productized at some unknown point in the future.”</p>
<p>The firm, formerly known as Cyan Robotics, doesn’t have a high-profile partner like Nuro’s Domino’s deal, thought it does list 18 partners, largely in the Los Angeles area. It’s currently operating deliveries in Santa Monica and five other LA areas. So, while it’s true that robotic deliveries are currently more the exception than the rule, if you order food in the right place at the right time, it just might be a robot on the other end.</p>
<p>This week, the company also announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/segway-makes-its-first-foray-into-sidewalk-robot-delivery-with-coco-partnership/">a manufacturing deal with Segway</a>. The latter&#8217;s VP of global business development, Tony Ho, tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is just the beginning of our partnership. We will stay on the product side of things, and Coco will be the operators. So it’s a bit similar to the micromobility space where we provide the vehicles and hardware and they provide the relationship with the city and the staff and the whole operation behind it. Right now, we’re seeing this almost like it was with scooters in 2017, where the whole industry is booming. It’s a land grab.</p></blockquote>

<p>Starship, meanwhile, kicked off the year with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/starship-technologies-raises-17m-to-roll-out-more-delivery-bots/">healthy $17 million raise</a>. The company is among those robotic delivery services focused on getting food to campuses, announcing plans to expand from 15 universities to 100.</p>
<p>Autonomous trucking had a great year, as well, citing similar concerns around staffing shortages. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/self-driving-truck-startup-kodiak-robotics-raises-125m/">Kodiak Robotics raised a $125 million Series B</a>, with plans to double its headcount, while Swedish firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/autonomous-trucking-startup-einride-raises-110m-ahead-of-expansion-into-united-states/">Einride drummed up $110 million</a>, with plans to expand into the U.S.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119707" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119707" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2119707" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg" alt="Serve Robotics Uber Postmates" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119707" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Serve Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>And as we transition into the robotics news of the week, here’s yet another delivery raise. The $13 million Series A comes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/uber-spinout-serve-robotics-gets-13m-seed-round-to-expand-sidewalk-robot-deliveries/">courtesy of Serve Robotics</a>, which spun out from Uber’s Postmates earlier this year. “Our goal is to put robots in every major U.S. city in the next two to three years,” co-founder Ali Kashani said of the company’s grand ambitions.</p>
<p>7-Eleven’s investment wing, 7-Ventures, was involved in the round. The convenience store giant is especially bullish about robotics deliveries these days, having piloted with Nuro, among others. Delivery Hero, which also participated in the round, has worked with Starship previously.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244494" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244494" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2244494" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Recording-2021-12-07-at-4.23.01-PM.2021-12-07-16_24_45.gif" alt="" width="600" height="509" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244494" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Petra</p></div></p>
<p>Next, we move underground, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/petra-emerges-from-stealth-with-30m-raised-for-tunnel-boring-robot-swifty/">Petra emerges from stealth</a> to announce a $30 million Series A. The company uses thermal technology to bore tunnels into some of the strongest rock on Earth. To demonstrate this feat, the startup also announced that its robot, Swifty, successfully bored a 20-foot tunnel through Sioux Quartzite at a rate of one-inch-per-minute.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Kim Abrams says:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve invented a completely new way to excavate rock and this will have profound implications on the future of tunneling. By delivering a boring solution that affordably undergrounds utilities through high-grade rock, we can finally protect communities from exposure to wildfires and ensure the safety of critical infrastructure in disaster-prone areas, especially in places like the Sierra Nevada mountains, Rocky Mountains, and coastal regions.</p></blockquote>

<p>A <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/system-designing-training-intelligent-soft-robots-1207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fun bit of research from MIT CSAIL</a> to close us out this week. The lab unveiled “Evolution Gym,” a testing simulator for soft robotic designs. It’s still a simulation, of course, but it offers some interesting insights into how compliant robots can adapt to different environmental challenges.</p>
<p>CSAIL notes, “The result looks like a little robot Olympics. In addition to standard tasks like walking and jumping, the researchers also included some unique tasks, like climbing, flipping, balancing, and stair-climbing.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix has launched a <a href="http://www.netflix.com/tudum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new website</a> called &#8220;Tudum,&#8221; which will host consumer news about renewals, release dates and extra content featuring its TV shows and movies. The company is marketing the website as &#8220;a place to discover more about your Netflix favorites.&#8221; For a more curated experience, users can log into the website with their Netflix account. Netflix says the website is still currently in its early days, as it plans to continue to build it out and add new features in the future.</p>
<p>Tudum will feature extra content and information about Netflix&#8217;s TV shows and movies. For example, Netflix notes that users will be able to dig deeper into its content and use the website to find out things like where else they&#8217;ve seen the cast of &#8220;The Witcher&#8221; and whether &#8220;Maid&#8221; is based on a true story. The website includes exclusive interviews, cast breakdowns, information about content that&#8217;s popular on the platform, a trending news section, details about upcoming shows, an explore section and more.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Say hello to Tudum — a backstage pass that lets you dig deeper into the Netflix films, series, and stars you love! It’s still early days but you can expect exclusive interviews, behind-the-scenes videos, bonus features, and more.

<p>&mdash; Netflix (@netflix) <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1468988824588013569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Tudum, which is named after the sound users hear when they press play on Netflix, is also the name of Netflix&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/netflix-sets-tudum-its-first-ever-virtual-global-fan-event-for-september-25/">global virtual fan</a> event that took place in September. The event included exclusive first looks and panels with stars from some of Netflix&#8217;s most popular titles. It featured conversations with the creators and stars of some of Netflix’s most popular shows, including “Stranger Things,” “Emily in Paris,” “The Witcher,” “The Crown,” “Cobra Kai” and “Bridgerton.”</p>
<p>The streaming giant&#8217;s chief marketing officer, Bozoma Saint John, announced the launch of the new website in a <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/meet-tudum-your-backstage-pass-to-the-netflix-stories-you-love" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, stating that Netflix is &#8220;e<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">xcited to introduce Tudum for fans to dive deeper into the stories they love, fuel their obsessions and start new conversations. It’s still early days, and our launch today is just the beginning.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The new website is now accessible around the globe but is currently only available in English. It&#8217;s unknown if Netflix plans to launch the website in more languages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome to part two of our venture capital-recommended book gift guide for 2021!</p>
<p>Yesterday we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/gift-guide-the-best-non-business-books-for-2021-recommended-by-vcs/">tackled <em>non</em>-business books</a> recommended by a raft of venture capitalists. Today we’re flipping it around and talking about books with a business theme. There were a few titles that straddled the gap, so if any of the below strike you as a modest stretch regarding how <em>businessy</em> they are, well, we hear you.</p>
<p>Regardless, keep in mind that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">The Exchange</a> is paywall-free today again, as we’re huge book fans and wanted to keep this as accessible as possible. Oh, and <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anna</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> will be dropping their personal recs in this weekend&#8217;s Exchange newsletter, which lots of you already receive on Saturdays, but you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">get here</a> if you’d like.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245444" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A big thanks to the dozens of venture capitalists who contributed ideas to these posts, and double points to those who didn’t have an assistant handle their emailing! Oh, and we only had two books recommended by the people who wrote them, which was a lower ratio than we anticipated. Good job!</p>

<p>Recommended by <a href="https://twitter.com/vc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Chapman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/zachcoelius" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zach Coelius</a>, this book carries blurbs from Kara Swisher and Nick Bilton, so it appears to be one that crosses the technology-media divide that we occasionally have to treat like a DMZ. The gist is that the market for zero-day cyber weapons is not what it once was. In the old days, the United States controlled the arsenal. At great expense, but who cares. Then it lost control of the zero-day world. And what comes next, people say, is staggering.</p>

<p>Daisy Garcia at <a href="https://twitter.com/JetBlueVentures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JetBlue Ventures</a> recommended it alongside Reeves Wiedeman&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Billion-Dollar-Loser-Spectacular-Neumann/dp/0316461369" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Billion Dollar Loser: The Epic Rise and Spectacular Fall of Adam Neumann and WeWork</a>,&#8221; describing both books as &#8220;good reminders to invest in what you know and also fun.” Alex and Anna both read &#8220;Bad Blood,&#8221; and from our desks, this book is the rare must-read in the business book pantheon. You must read it to understand how far things can go off the startup rails, and, frankly, learn a hell of a lot about the world of business.</p>

<p>Next year, we’ll add a section for books that we bought and have on our shelves but have yet to start. &#8220;An Ugly Truth&#8221; is one such book. Alex bought a copy when it came out and has been promising himself since that he will stop reading fiction and get around to it. So far, so bad, but it’s still a book that feels like a mandatory read.</p>
<p>Why? Because Facebook is hardly giving up on its long-term goals. The company is shifting its growth model somewhat, but has hardly gone through a DNA-level change regarding how it considers its political setup (one owner, led by the blind) or operational goals (all your eyes are belong to us). We should take this one off the shelf and read it. You, too.</p>

<p>This one has been on Anna&#8217;s reading list ever since she listened to the &#8220;<a href="https://www.radicalcandor.com/candor-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radical Candor&#8221; podcast</a>, which distills the book&#8217;s ideas into a conversational format. But whatever medium you choose, make sure you don&#8217;t stop at the title, or you might misunderstand the message. Being radically candid is not about being brutal; it is a form of kindness, because honesty beats niceness.</p>
<p>This could apply to many areas in life, but this is definitely business content, and especially relevant to the startup and tech world. Author Kim Scott is a former Apple and Google executive and knows a thing or two about leadership &#8212; we are not surprised that VCs are reading. &#8220;The book provides great guidance on delivering effective feedback — whether it’s positive or negative,&#8221; Steffens noted. &#8220;It has helped me recommit to passing quickly when I’m not convinced of the opportunity — and to deliver that message clearly, so there’s no room for confusion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maximizing value creation for shareholders is, at times, not a very good idea. That’s because the cost of doing so in particular situations creates such heavy societal burdens that it’s a clear net-negative for humanity. A few examples that come to mind include the oil industry hiding its knowledge of global warming for decades, the tobacco industry fighting the obvious truth that smoking is cancerous and the recent lobbying efforts by alcohol companies to combat cannabis legalization. The impact of those actions was unchecked carbon emissions, lots of cancer deaths and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/07/america-drinking-alone-problem/619017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">miserable rates of alcoholism</a>.</p>
<p>And then there are the Sacklers. Not that we want to diminish the impact of the above shareholder-value-creating actions, but the Sacklers might have them beat. If you’re not aware, the Sackler dynasty helped foment an opioid addiction epidemic, recycling some of their ill-gotten gains into charitable donations — the standard billionaire method of hiding the source of their wealth with some media-friendly wrapping paper. We want to read this book to better understand just how things went so wrong, for so long.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Aristocracy of Talent&#8221; comes with a recommendation from Molten&#8217;s James Clark, but also with a blurb from one of Anna&#8217;s favorite thinkers, <a href="https://twitter.com/sapinker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steven Pinker</a>. Here&#8217;s what he wrote about Adrian Wooldridge&#8217;s latest book: &#8220;This unique and fascinating history explains why the blame now being piled upon meritocracy is misplaced — and that assigning responsibilities to the people best able to discharge them really is better than the time-honored customs of corruption, patronage, nepotism and hereditary castes. Wooldridge upends many common assumptions and provides an indispensable back story to this fraught and pressing issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are all for upending assumptions here, especially when the topic is so frequently brought up in our tiny bubble — and we are curious to read more.</p>

<p>So there’s this idea in the market that the blockchain world is akin to a new internet. There are some issues with the idea, chiefly that blockchain tech runs on the internet, making it at most a layer-two effort for the web. Still, the concept that what today’s hackers are building will tear up the past and rewrite the future is strong.</p>
<p>Enter &#8220;The Infinite Machine,&#8221; which digs into the Ethereum blockchain, which some compare to an infinite computer or machine. We have our questions. For example, how did the web3 kids manage to build a computer that costs so much money to simply access? Snark aside, it’s worth taking the time to understand precisely why some folks are so rabidly bullish about the crypto market. They might be right!</p>

<p>You may have heard about this book on TechCrunch: Our colleague Connie Loizos <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/were-now-very-much-at-war-with-china-argues-a-provocative-new-book">interviewed its author</a> a couple of months ago. Their conversation covered key themes of the book &#8212; Silicon Valley, China, Russia &#8212; and made us keen to find out more, though not particularly reassured. From Connie: &#8220;Helberg lays out how China’s &#8216;techno-totalitarian&#8217; regime may be first impacting the Chinese people (its &#8216;first victims,&#8217; he says), but why its efforts to increasingly control the software and the hardware of the internet are a real and present and fast-escalating danger to the U.S. and democracies everywhere.&#8221; Having written quite a bit about China in 2021, and being aware that it will likely play some part in 2022, this makes a great candidate from our reading list.</p>

We’re surprised that more poker books didn’t make the list. But Purushotham brought one to us, so we made sure to include it. Per the investor, the book, written by “World Series of Poker champion-turned-business consultant Annie Duke, explains why it’s essential to embrace uncertainty when we make decisions.” That may seem counterintuitive, but as Purushotham noted, “whether you’re deciding which company to invest in, which product to build or which growth strategy to follow, the key to placing the best bets is accurately assessing what you do and don’t know, and accepting that great decisions don’t always lead to great outcomes — because luck always has a hand to play.”</li>

<blockquote><p>“At Citi Ventures, we like to say that &#8216;culture is the backbone of innovation,&#8217; and as Citi’s Leadership Principles make clear, a culture of innovation begins with creating space for everyone’s insights and ideas to be shared and heard. That, in turn, starts with listening. The best-selling book &#8216;You’re Not Listening&#8217; describes how difficult true listening is, despite — or perhaps because of — our constant access to digital communication channels and engagement opportunities. The book provides an important road map for reversing this trend and can help build a strong foundation for driving empathy, innovation and transformation.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ledger.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ledger</a> is the latest crypto company working on a debit card that connects directly with a crypto wallet. The company unveiled at its Ledger Op3n conference plans to launch its own debit card called the Crypto Life card.</p>
<p>While Ledger is better known for its hardware wallets, the company has been working hard on the software part called <a href="https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ledger Live</a>. From the Ledger Live app on desktop and mobile, users are not limited to sending and receiving crypto assets.</p>
<p>They can also buy and sell crypto assets with integrations with third-party companies. Ledger Live also supports staking and swaps through various partners, such as Changelly, Wyre, ParaSwap and 1inch. Everything remains integrated with the hardware wallet for transaction confirmations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245586" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ledger’s debit card has been designed with <a href="https://baanx.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baanx</a> and will be available in the U.K., France and Germany at some point during the first quarter of 2022. People based in the U.S. will be able to get a card in Q2 2022.</p>
<p>After receiving your card, you’ll be able to top it up from the Ledger Live app with BTC, ETH, USDT, EURT, USDC, XRP, BXX, BCH or LTC. When you use your card for a transaction, cryptocurrencies are instantly converted to the fiat amount at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>Cardholders will also be able to receive their paychecks into their card account directly. They’ll be able to convert a percentage of their paycheck into BTC and ETH every time they get paid.</p>
<p>Finally, Ledger users who want to keep most of their wealth in crypto assets will be able to open a line of credit to get cash on the card. For that feature, you have to deposit a certain cryptocurrency amount as collateral.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DeFi lending protocols are usually overcollateralized, which means that users have to borrow less than what they have in their crypto wallet. So it’s going to be interesting to see how the Ledger credit feature works when it ships.</p>
<p>Ledger will compete with debit cards from Coinbase, Bitpanda, Binance, Crypto.com, etc. But if you’re already using Ledger products, having a card that integrates well with the Ledger ecosystem could be particularly important when choosing a debit card.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A<a href="https://docsend.com/view/zi9kfxbsc36xx3sy"> new report</a> from early-stage venture capital firm <a href="https://www.work-bench.com/">Work-Bench</a> confirmed what you probably already know: Startups with women founders are getting a mere sliver of the overall funding pie. What&#8217;s more, the percentages are far worse in the enterprise, where Work-Bench tends to invest.</p>
<p>The numbers, which were based on Work-Bench research along with data from PitchBook and Crunchbase, showed over 25% of startups receiving funding included at least one female founder, but when you looked at just enterprise software companies, the number plunged to a dismal 1.9%.</p>
<p>The fact is that research has proven these numbers make little sense. As the report authors wrote, &#8220;research has shown that female-led teams generate 35% higher return on investment than all-male-led teams.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245511" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Yet the gap persists.</p>
<p>Jessica Lin, co-founder and general partner at Work-Bench, said that one of the motivations for starting her firm was the persistent lack of female representation at the corporate level, among startup founders and particularly at VC firms that control the purse strings.</p>
<p>The first step was to build a database of female founders, which she said the firm has been working on for the past four years and updates on a regular basis. They made this database <a href="https://t.co/kngN3YniD2">publicly available</a>. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always said behavior change also requires data,&#8221; Lin told me.</p>
<p>The impetus behind the report was to put that data to work, showing investors just how pronounced the problem is and tracking progress (or lack thereof) over time. And she especially wanted to focus on the enterprise, where her firm operates, because she said there was a distinct lack of data in that area.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;So this is the first time we&#8217;ve said, &#8216;Hey, why don&#8217;t we actually put it together [into a report]?&#8217; So I would love to tell you that maybe in a year from now we can see that sub-2% number has gotten to 3%. But we just had to have a baseline somewhere,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>While the number is small, there are some areas where women are more likely to be involved in funded startups. The biggest area by far was HR/future of work with 35.1%, followed by data/AI/machine learning with 19.8%, and sales and marketing with 12.2%.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2245557" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245557" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2245557" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-12.35.44-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="Work-Bench female founders report.

<p>Women face a number of challenges. For starters, there is still a <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/4467/female-employees-at-tech-companies/">lack of women in leadership roles</a> at major tech companies. If more women held jobs with higher salaries, they could not only act as mentors, but participate<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/31/one-womans-mission-to-build-a-network-of-female-and-non-binary-angel-investors/"> in angel rounds</a> that could help drive more women-led startups.</p>
<p>Idit Levine runs the startup <a href="http://solo.io">Solo.io</a>, a cloud-native software company that recently landed a $135 million Series C investment on a $1 billion valuation. As Levine <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/solo-io-reaches-1b-valuation-with-135m-series-c-investment/">told me at the time of her funding</a>, she&#8217;s frustrated by tokenism in the tech industry:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I never asked for anybody to give me this discount because I’m a woman. Actually, sometimes it has been irritating. Oh, we want to give you a talk because you’re a woman. It pissed me off. You need me to give a talk because I am damn good.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet many women lack her confidence. The <a href="https://thenewstack.io/pushing-back-how-women-in-tech-overcome-imposter-syndrome/">New Stack reported</a> on a recent panel at KubeCon, where a group of women talked about the obstacles they face as an underrepresented group in cloud-native technologies. Many of the panelists expressed a common feeling among underrepresented groups of imposter syndrome &#8212; feeling like they don&#8217;t belong even though they clearly have the skills and abilities.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/4-women-in-engineering-discuss-harassment-isolation-and-perseverence/">June TechCrunch article</a> on the experience of four women engineers in tech, Yury Roa, SRE technical program manager at ADL Digital Labs in Bogota, Colombia, told me that imposter syndrome can be a real impediment for women in tech:</p>
<blockquote><p>“One barrier for us related to being the only woman in the room is that [it can lead to] impostor syndrome because it is common when you are the only woman or one of few, it can be really challenging for us. So we need to gain confidence, and in these cases, it is very important to have role models and leadership that includes women,” Roa said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Work-Bench is a small firm trying to make a big impact by providing data to illustrate inequities in the system. As Lin noted, data can drive change, but it&#8217;s going to take a full-blown systemic shift to move these numbers. That&#8217;s going to require more women being promoted as executives and investing as angels and venture capitalists.</p>
<p>Only then can we truly move the needle. Because 1.9% is not good enough. Not by a long shot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.firstresonance.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Resonance</a> makes software for making hardware. The company&#8217;s Ion platform provides an all-in-one option for anyone who has to manage manufacturing lines, supply chains, engineering and design, among other things. Now, with $14 million in new funding, the company aims to scale up its presence and make a full-court press on the hardware makers of the world.</p>
<p>Founded by a team of former SpaceX engineers, First Resonance was created because they felt the processes they&#8217;d helped create at the launch provider would be helpful to people making everything from drones to toys to&#8230; other rockets.</p>
<p>When we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/founded-by-former-spacex-engineers-first-resonance-pitches-tools-to-make-things-the-spacex-way/">first covered them last summer</a>, the company was just getting started. Now it has built up momentum it hopes to keep as it targets more and bigger customers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245540" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;In 2020, First Resonance was just getting its first customers. It was a year where manufacturers and people building hardware definitely needed something to connect their people working from home with the factory, and connect multiple types of factories — it just happens that the product we&#8217;re building here perfectly suits itself to that,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Karan Talati.</p>
<p>With 15 customers at the end of 2020 and twice that now, the Ion platform has shown that it has value to people making serious hardware: Joby Aviation, Reliable Robotics, Astranis and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;The complexity of managing not just how to build such a sophisticated product, but the complexity of the part assembly and the sophisticated multi-level BOM that goes into that&#8230; What Ion is doing is helping these companies define that complexity and understand it — with a level of granularity that lets them make rapid and iterative adjustments to their design and manufacturing process,&#8221; said Talati.</p>

<p>A key part of that is automated but powerful tracking of parts and processes, something that their team at SpaceX got very good at while working on launch vehicle reusability.</p>
<p>&#8220;The key difference between what SpaceX has done compared with everyone else is really understanding down to what serial number, what lot number were on a given rocket. They knew which parts were exposed to a certain condition or error,&#8221; explained Talati. &#8220;That&#8217;s the exact challenge our customers are facing. Automakers spend billions on recalls because they have to recall every vehicle. But Tesla recently did a recall of only 3,000 Model Ys, because they have that level of granularity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Early customers have found this capability extremely valuable and asked for more of it. Tracking a part from purchasing to receiving, installation, servicing and beyond creates not just opportunities for savings like Tesla&#8217;s, but a database that can be mined for insights.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yfDiZL8D930?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Companies have been managing this stuff for a long time, but generally using half a dozen disconnected systems, some legacy and some cutting-edge. For instance, the design work may be happening in live AR collaboration sessions and saved to the cloud, then distributed via a modern productivity suite, but it&#8217;s all held back when it goes to a factory and parts workflow that&#8217;s been the same since the &#8217;90s. It was never great, but the pressures of 2020 and 2021 may have pushed some companies over the edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s this mess of generic tracking tools, email templates, spreadsheets and disconnected processes. Increasingly we have customers coming off these old systems, where they procured them a long time ago and now they&#8217;re looking into digital transformation,&#8221; said Talati.</p>

<p>Even larger, richer companies that could build their own brand-new stack are opting to go with Ion, he said, imitating other successful companies that choose to bolt on a market-ready process rather than spend a year and tens of millions designing their own.</p>
<p>The $14 million A round was led by Craft Ventures, with participation from Blue Bear Capital, Fika Ventures, Stage VP and Wavemaker. The money will go toward scaling and improving the company, particularly their &#8220;go to market team.&#8221; But the product is evolving too, with the team working on integrating more sources of data into intelligence streams that produce actionable insights within seconds of changes. And embracing more factories and hardware types with an expanded SDK is also on the horizon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our customers are really embracing that flexible, data-driven approach, and Ion fits the bill,&#8221; said Talati.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Solid Power, the solid-state battery developer backed by Ford and BMW, is hitting the public markets running with a spike in stock price shortly after trading opened Thursday.</p>
<p>The company is one of a handful in the electric mobility space to have gone public via a merger with a blank-check firm. Solid Power announced the merger with special purpose acquisition company Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp III in June, at a post-deal implied market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/bmw-and-ford-backed-solid-power-will-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-1-2b-deal/">valuation of $1.2 billion</a>.</p>
<p>The deal ultimately generated around $542.9 million to Solid Power, very near to the estimated $600 million due to the notably low number of redemptions prior to the shareholder vote. The cash includes $195 million PIPE and $347.9 million of cash held in trust.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245562" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s funds that the company will need, as it seeks to commercialize the world’s first solid-state battery for electric vehicles. Solid-state batteries &#8212; so named because they use a solid, rather than liquid, electrolyte &#8212; are considered by many to be the next breakthrough in battery technology. Developers say they minimize the fire risks associated with conventional batteries by eliminating the flammable electrolyte, in addition to offering superior energy density, or battery range.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Can solid state batteries power up for the next generation of EVs?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/embed/#?secret=FcDIxVpUCv" data-secret="FcDIxVpUCv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Solid Power has been hard at work, expanding its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/solid-power-expands-production-capacity-to-deliver-test-batteries-to-bmw-ford-in-2022/">Colorado factory footprint</a> as it prepares pilot production of its commercial-grade, 100 ampere battery cells in early 2022. Those cells will head to investors Ford and BMW for automotive testing. Solid Power plans to use the capital from the transaction to fund operations through vehicle integration, which the company anticipates will take place in 2026.</p>
<p>The company’s long-term business plan is not to become a large-scale battery producer, like industry giants LG Chem or SK Innovation. The ultimate aim is to license out the cells to OEMs and manufacturers. “Long term, we’re a materials company,” CEO Doug Campbell told TechCrunch earlier this year. “We want to be the industry leader in solid electrolyte materials.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Solid Power is not the only solid-state battery developer to go public via SPAC, nor is it the only one to have received investment from a big automaker. Indeed, it seems that the major automotive OEMs have been picking their horses in the solid-state race, with rival QuantumScape receiving backing from Volkswagen and Stellantis and Mercedes-Benz lining up their funds behind <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/stellantis-mercedes-benz-invest-in-solid-state-battery-developer-factorial-energy/">newer entrant Factorial Energy</a>.</p>
<p>QuantumScape completed its own SPAC deal in November 2020. Like other mobility SPACs, it saw its fair share of stock price volatility, with shares cresting as high as $114 in December before settling around $20-25. Whether Solid Power’s stocks will face similar tumult remains to be seen. The company is trading under the ticker symbol $SLDP.</p>

		Lucy Heskins is an early-stage startup marketing adviser and the creator of <a href="https://www.ohblimey.com/">Oh, Blimey</a>, a marketing resource for first-time founders and their teams. She focuses primarily on B2B SaaS as well as product-led startups in the HR and people tech spaces.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Before you can hire a full-time marketer, you must first get to know your potential customer and what is going on in their life that will ultimately trigger them into using you.</p>
<p>If you can get to grips with the below areas you’ll be much more prepared when deciding what type of marketing resource you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why would a customer subscribe to your product?</li>
<li>What triggers your customer to decide your product is the one?</li>
<li>Who else are you competing against?</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m going to introduce you to three frameworks that’ll help you get answers to the above, but more importantly, show you how to apply this to marketing and what it can help you unlock and learn. This topic is something I created a resource on: <a href="https://www.ohblimey.com/how-to-talk-to-people-and-land-your-first-customer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to talk to people and land your first customer</span></a>.</p>
<h2>Why would a customer subscribe to your product?</h2>
<p>You may have heard a marketer refer to Jobs to Be Done (JTBD). In essence, this is something that helps you to understand what your customer is looking to achieve when ‘hiring’ your product.</p>
<p>A basic example: You don’t hire a hammer to pop a nail in the wall, you hire a hammer to hang a picture to make your room look nice. The hammer is helping you make your room appear attractive, perhaps sellable, or stylish because you want to impress others.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The same goes with a tech product. You need to work out what your product can help your customer achieve.</p>
<p><strong>The process: </strong></p>
<p>You want to interview the right customers and ask questions such as, ‘what are you ultimately trying to achieve? ‘What’s the first thing you’ll do’ or ‘Have you tried to fix this problem yourself, and if so, which products have you cobbled together?’</p>
<p>There’s certainly a science to the questions to ask, but the emphasis needs to be on <strong>what</strong> they are trying to accomplish. Take note, this can be a lengthy process because you have to really dig into interviews, but the rewards are totally worth it.</p>
<p><strong>How to apply it to your startup’s marketing: </strong></p>
<p>It can help you with targeting your customer base. There’s a chance you may identify a few potential jobs people wish to achieve. Use the findings to identify the group that will pay the most to get the ‘job’ done the best. This may help to speed up the sales cycle or identify more lucrative customer opportunities.</p>
<h2>What triggers your customer to decide your product is the one?</h2>
<p>Whilst there are many frameworks out there to help you navigate this customer research piece, the effective ones are broadly based on the work of Moesta. He suggests there are six stages a customer will go through when buying something: first thought, passive looking, active looking, deciding, onboarding and ongoing use.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

Read on, and check <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#24513748-ac7b-490b-ad48-4b0767bf0c58">the event agenda</a> for the specific days. <strong>Note:</strong> All listed times will automatically reflect your geographic time zone.</p>
<p><strong>Fast Money, Team Space: Company Concept, Capital and Customers</strong> — Disruptive and game-changing technology and entrepreneurial initiatives are the new space norm. However, a great technical design is not enough to sustain these entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing an idea across markets also takes capital and customers. Transitioning from concept to development phase is more likely to succeed when a company can obtain stable forms of capital and potential long-term customers. Today’s Fast Money session — with Jordan Noone (Embedded Ventures) and Chris O&#8217;Connor (Harpoon Ventures) — focuses on how a startup was able to identify the right venture partners to grow their business and secured opportunities to prototype and test their designs with the U.S. government. Presented by The Aerospace Corporation.</p>
<p><strong>Securing Space at Speed</strong> — The demand signal is clear: the U.S. government needs to spur innovative commercial capabilities to excel in an increasingly contested space domain. Hear directly from Steve Isakowitz (The Aerospace Corporation), Pete Muend (National Reconnaissance Office) and Tim Trimailo (Blackjack/CASINO, SSC/DCIR) — leaders driving government-commercial collaborations about opportunities to help usher in the next era of achievement in space. Presented by The Aerospace Corporation.</p>
<p><strong>How Tech Startups Do Business with the DoD and U.S. Space Force</strong> — Sam Riehn (SBIR Advisors Inc.) will describe the three main problems technology startups face when working with the Dept of Defense (DoD) and the U.S. Space Force. he’ll discuss how you can overcome them to win multi-million-dollar deals using the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. Presented by SBIR Advisors Inc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>University Showcase: New Frontiers in Space Exploration From OSAM to xGEO</strong> — As space technology gets smaller and less expensive, more and more countries, universities and people can participate. We’ve seen thousands of small satellites launched into earth orbit from numerous developers over the past decade, many of whom were new to space. What’s next for on-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing (OSAM) and orbital debris clean up as small spacecraft move beyond earth orbit and the geostationary satellite belt (xGEO) into open space (cis-lunar space), and onto the lunar surface itself? We’re showcasing university trail blazers in space exploration. Meet the people working on the projects — Jonathan Black (Virginia Tech), Dr. Debra L. Emmons (The Aerospace Corporation), Kathleen C Howell (Purdue University), Moriba Jah (The University of Texas at Austin) and Ricardo Sanfelice (University of California) — find out what’s ahead, and how you can participate. Learn about the technologies that are shaping a world where OSAM, xGEO and “cis-lunar” are becoming household terms. Presented by The Aerospace Corporation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[With developers in mind, the company gives engineers back the time they were spending building internal tools and away from product engineering. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.airplane.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airplane</a> on Thursday launched runbooks, a developer tool for automating internal workflows, in private beta and on Product Hunt.</p>
<p>Runbooks enables engineers to compose tasks and built-in integrations, like SQL, REST APIs and Slack, into workflows that run JavaScript code, can feed that into a SQL database or combine data from Stripe and be accessible to non-engineering team members.</p>
<p>Airplane was founded in 2020 by Josh Ma, former CTO at Benchling, which is also backed by Benchmark, and Ravi Parikh, co-founder of digital insights startup Heap. With developers in mind, the pair wanted to give engineers back the time they were spending building internal tools and away from product engineering.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245065" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>“We spent time brainstorming ideas, and one of the big pain points we both saw at our companies was the lack of internal tooling,” Parikh told TechCrunch. “Tools let people deal with customer data and resolve issues, like deleting data or merging accounts, but sometimes, a customer success team would ultimately have to escalate a task to engineering teams.”</p>
<p>That could mean dozens of tickets every day piling up and interrupting the engineering team, he added. Its first product was Airplane tasks, which transforms duct-taped scripts and cron jobs into safe, reusable tools, Parikh said.</p>
<p>The remote-first company has hubs in San Francisco and New York, and though it has been around for a short period of time, it already has a couple of paying customers and hundreds of users building and running on Airplane in various use cases, including administration operations, customer onboarding, approval flows and long-running tasks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product unveiling was buoyed by $8.5 million of Series A funds in a round led by Benchmark. As part of the investment, Eric Vishria is joining Airplane’s board.</p>
<p>In the past year, the SaaS company grew into a team of 10 people across three countries. The new funding will enable Airplane to double its employee headcount and invest in product and technology development, like building self-service products.</p>
<p>“What used to take hours, days or even weeks now takes between two and five minutes with Airplane,” Parikh said. “All an engineer has to do is run a deploy command and configure the user interface. We had a customer even tell us that adoption of our product enabled them to clear out a queue of requests to zero, for the first time, that had piled up over five years.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After the resounding success of several crowdfunding campaigns for its gamified smart bird feeder, Bird Buddy has raised an $8.5 million seed round. Its first product will ship in a few months, but it&#8217;s just the start of what the company hopes will be a new approach to using tech to better enjoy nature.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an ambitious statement of purpose from a company working on something as apparently trivial as a bird feeder. But co-founder and CEO Franci Zidar explained how this market is something of a sleeping giant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Birdwatching is the second biggest outdoor hobby in the U.S., and huge internationally,&#8221; he said. No doubt this trend accelerated during the pandemic, when for many people birds provided a pleasant reminder that there is indeed a world outside their windows. &#8220;We spent the first half of 2020 doing a lot of validation, and it&#8217;s something people are really passionate and active about. Every metric that came back was insane.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243787" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Still, one wonders, if everyone loves birds so much, why other camera-equipped bird feeders haven&#8217;t become commonplace. Zidar thinks they&#8217;re coming at the whole thing from the wrong direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;They saw these original ones as something for people super into birdwatching,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;But what we realized is it&#8217;s not just about building a smart bird feeder, but a brand and a company about reconnecting people with nature. We needed the beautiful hardware piece that people will have in the yard, but a big part of it was that story of reconnecting. It speaks to people who are bird-curious but didn&#8217;t get into it because it seemed passive — so we made something that turned passivity into activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly, although the Bird Buddy doesn&#8217;t look fundamentally different (though better designed, to be sure) from what&#8217;s out there already, and costs about the same ($200 to pre-order), it looks like a way <em>into</em> the hobby rather than something only a serious hobbyist would buy.</p>
<p>The secret is in the life-imitates-art-imitates-life fact that birds are very Pokémon-like. Obviously birdwatching existed before the popular monster collection game, but they tap into the same &#8220;collect them all&#8221; instinct that some people have. Birds are &#8220;the perfect collectible,&#8221; Zidar said, an observation which manages to be both a crucial insight and face-palmingly peak tech.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243814" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/birdbuddy-app.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243814" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2243814" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/birdbuddy-app.gif" alt="Animated image of the Bird buddy interface and 'catching' a bird." width="500" height="602" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2243814" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bird Buddy</p></div></p>
<p>But being precious about how people engage with one&#8217;s hobby is the very kind of gatekeeping behavior that deters those people from even trying. A cute app with badges, notifications, points, social sharing and other modern conveniences may not be how people envisioned the birdwatching community growing, but that may be just what&#8217;s needed.</p>
<p>The feeder itself seems nicely designed — they scored Kyle Buzzard, who designed the Chromecast and various other consumer tech items, whose friendly, rounded approach shows through here as well. It also looks big enough to accommodate medium-sized birds, something roofed designs don&#8217;t always allow. (If jays don&#8217;t fit, the feeder ain&#8217;t it, as I say.)</p>
<p>Not everyone can sit by their window all day and watch the birds come and go (though I do). So being able to be aware of who stops by, and receiving a pleasant surprise in the form of a seasonal species or neighborhood regular popping up in your notifications is a great alternative.</p>

I love these guys. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bird Buddy</p></div></p>
<p>Inside the app there are the sort of &#8220;New bird!&#8221; achievements and tracking you might expect, and options to share images with others in the app or on social media. Feeders can also be made public — not for constant viewing but for individual bird visits.</p>
<p>One very attractive feature still in development is identifying individual birds, not just species. This would be a huge boon for birdwatchers who care about which jay or junco exactly is visiting their feeder — you could name it, compare with a friend down the block. Is Francine the flicker coming to your yard too?</p>
<p>Of course the smart layer comes with some risks, as typified by Ring, which has attracted controversy due to acting as a police surveillance network. Zidar acknowledged this tension as one faced by a lot of smartened-up gadgets.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very top of mind for us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no silver bullet, but knowing about the Ring fiasco gives us a lot of insight. We&#8217;ll make the device as secure as we can possibly make it, no low-hanging fruit with easy vectors of attack. Having said that, it&#8217;s your device, no one can access it unless you want to add your wife, your kids. Anyone who wants to share with the community, there will be a couple layers to that, like sharing for an hour, just sharing pictures of birds. The live thing doesn&#8217;t let you forget about it.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rAjH5h4UvlU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Image analysis also provides a protective layer — images with people are automatically discarded. Users will be guided during onboarding to point their feeder at bushes or trees. And there will be the usual reporting capabilities necessary to a social platform.</p>
<p>One may very well wonder why, after three successive and successful crowdfunding runs on Kickstarter, IndieGoGo and a self-hosted system, totaling some $10 million, does this company need another $8.5 million in capital?</p>
<p>&#8220;With the best of intentions, millions of dollars disappear overnight when you&#8217;re building hardware,&#8221; explained Zidar. &#8220;You have to order components, pay taxes, fulfillment, shipping, all that not counting that 2021 was the worst possible year to build hardware, right? Availability was shrinking, prices were fluctuating, we had to have redundant components becasue we weren&#8217;t sure which we would be able to get. Shipping costs have risen 6-8 times too. Even shipping in January — we were supposed to ship in September originally — is kind of a miracle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Importantly though, he continued, the investment comes from a recognition by General Catalyst that the company represents an opportunity to engage with an under-capitalized population of hobbyists who spend hundreds on binoculars but buy $30 feeders. Zidar hopes to build a company whose primary intent and brand is that &#8220;reconnecting with nature&#8221; idea mentioned before, and for which the Bird Buddy is just the first step.</p>
<p>For him and his co-founder, &#8220;we&#8217;ve both done a lot of interesting stuff&#8230; but rarely do you have a core mission you can align with, making people care about nature and wildlife. And the best way to do that is get them to engage with us — to build a huge community of people who do that. So we&#8217;re building a brand that people will love and trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a very amateur birder myself I find it an attractive project, but of course it all depends on the execution. Hopefully we&#8217;ll be able to test out a Bird Buddy when it ships early next year and give an informed verdict on whether the team accomplished what it set out to do.</p>
