<li id="tc-target-mid-article-2227003" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto">The stock market wasn&#8217;t incredibly dramatic this morning, from an index-viewpoint. Crytpos were slightly more exciting but only moderately. A host of earnings results this week should provide us with fireworks, however.</li>
<li>And on the subject of crypto regulation, news from Congress <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/06/house-sends-infrastructure-bill-with-crypto-tax-provision-to-us-president/">isn&#8217;t great for fans of coins and chains</a>. And the rising <a href="https://www.protocol.com/nft-game-tax-scholarships">popularity of NFT games</a> could put consumers in bad tax territory.</li>
<li>The SoftBank Vision Fund 1 <a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/financials/financial_reports/financial-report_q2fy2021_01_en.pdf">posted poor results</a>, harming SoftBank&#8217;s earnings, and leading to the company promising a huge share buyback.</li>
<li>And Elon Musk made news not only for tweeting some <a href="https://twitter.com/cate_long/status/1457504084764811265">sort of dick joke</a> at an American Senator, but also for <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088">polling Twitter regarding</a> whether or not he should sell 10% worth of Tesla shares. That&#8217;s <em>one</em> way to do corporate governance, I suppose.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/matter-labs-scores-50m-from-a16z-to-bring-zero-knowledge-rollup-scaling-to-ethereum/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">Matter Labs raised $50 million</a>, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/07/h2o-ai-raises-100m-at-a-1-7b-valuation-for-tools-to-make-ai-usable-by-any-kind-of-enterprise/">H2O.ai raised $100 million</a>.</li>
<li>And weekend chat concerning this piece <a href="https://wptavern.com/amp-has-irreparably-damaged-publishers-trust-in-google-led-initiatives">detailing Google&#8217;s history with AMP underscores</a> just how much trust is being lost between major American tech companies and their communities.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com">Zoomcar</a> said on Monday that it has raised $92 million in a new financing round as it looks to expand its car sharing marketplace to many new nations and explore the public markets next year.</p>
<p>New York City-headquartered SternAegis Ventures led the eight-year-old startup’s Series E financing round, the two said.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based Zoomcar, which has raised $207 million to date, allows users to rent cars by the month, week, day or even hour. The startup, which counts India as its biggest market, operates in several nations including many in Southeast Asia and the MENA regions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230515" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Sequoia Capital India-backed startup, which employs over 300 people, says it has amassed over 10,000 cars on its platform. Zoomcar works with individuals, SMEs that operate fleets and semi-professional who have a couple of cars to source cars on its marketplace.</p>
<p>It also maintains partnerships with banks and insurance firms and offers a range of cars from compact to luxury and “everything in between.”</p>
<p>The startup sees EV as a big focus moving forward, said Greg Moran, co-founder and chief executive of Zoomcar, pointing to success of Toro and other firms in developed markets.</p>
<p>“We are the largest emerging-market focused marketplace for cars in the world. Think of us as Airbnb for cars, but for emerging markets,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Globally, there are about 35 countries that are emerging markets. All of these have less than 10% of car ownerships. In fact, most of them have car ownership of less than 5%. So you have a huge middle class that simply doesn’t have access to private cars. But they need to use these cars a couple of times a month,” he said.</p>
<p>Moran said the startup will deploy the fresh capital to expand the marketplace in over 20 countries in the next 18 months.</p>
<p>Zoomcar is also currently aiming to file for an IPO next year, Moran said, adding that he is evaluating listing on a U.S. exchange. (This is in line with several Bangalore-based startups that are also eyeing Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange for listing in the next two years.)</p>
<p>“Zoomcar sits at the intersection of several powerful global trends across urban mobility. At SternAegis, we’re delighted to support the impressive Zoomcar team in fulfilling their vision of creating the best car sharing experience across the world’s fastest growing, most dynamic markets,” said Adam Stern, chief executive of SternAegis Ventures, in a statement.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In essence, Chinese regulatory action is harming the value of a U.S. stock, which is bringing down the value of a Japanese investment fund, which raised most of its capital from the Middle East.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank lost some investing preeminence in recent years as names like Tiger and a16z rose to new heights thanks to rapid-fire dealmaking and eager willingness to prepay for startup growth. But as SoftBank continues to cut checks from its Vision Fund 2, we&#8217;re still seeing results trickle in from the time when the Japanese conglomerate was the world&#8217;s key startup backer thanks to its mega-sized Vision Fund 1.</p>
<p>And the recent news is less than stellar.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>SoftBank&#8217;s <a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/financials/financial_reports/financial-report_q2fy2021_01_en.pdf">earnings</a>, <a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/presentations/2021/earnings-presentation_q2fy2021_01_en.pdf">disclosed today,</a> include sharp losses from Vision Fund 1 after several of its key investments lost value. There was good news in the mix as well, but reported gains were only able to blunt losses other investments racked up.</p>
<p>Now, notably, we get to chat about Middle Eastern money, Chinese regulation, the U.S. stock market <em>and</em> SoftBank at the same time &#8212; they are all connected. This will take a little explaining, but, yes, we&#8217;re talking about Didi.</p>
<h2>Whoops</h2>
<p>Crunchbase data <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/didi-dache/company_financials/investors">lists three separate investments</a> from SoftBank into Didi, the Chinese ride-hailing giant that famously won a fight with Uber over its domestic market. SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 1 was, of course, also an investor in Uber. It&#8217;s complicated.</p>
<p>The Japanese telco and investing behemoth was a big enough shareholder in Didi at the time of its IPO that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/softbank-uber-tencent-set-to-reap-rewards-from-didi-ipo/">TechCrunch noted</a> it controlled around 21.5% of the ride-hailing company at that moment.</p>
<p>When Didi went public at $14 per share, it was worth around $67 billion. Since then, things have gone poorly for the company, which ran afoul of Chinese regulators, who made it stop <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/04/didi-app-pulled-from-app-stores-after-suspension-order/">accepting new customers and pull its app</a>. Shares of Didi &#8212; a company firmly outside the good graces of the Chinese Community Party &#8212; are now worth just $8.12 per share.</p>
<p>SoftBank reckons that after investing a total of $12.073 billion into Didi through its Vision Fund 1 vehicle, its investment was worth just $7.544 billion as of September 31, 2021, and $7.864 billion as of November 5, 2021. The gap between the company&#8217;s investment price and current value is stark.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube is looking to give <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/">its TikTok rival, Shorts</a>, a competitive advantage. The company confirmed it&#8217;s expanding a recent global test that defaults the YouTube mobile app to open directly in Shorts if the user had previously watched Shorts videos before exiting. In other words, instead of being taken to the YouTube homepage when you return to the app, you&#8217;d be dropped into the short-form video experience.</p>
<p>The company said the test, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167/youtube-test-features-and-experiments?hl=en">announced</a> publicly last week, has been running on iOS only for a small percentage of global users. YouTube now says it&#8217;s preparing to expand the experiment to Android, as well.</p>
<p>The test will only target users who are engaging with YouTube&#8217;s answer to TikTok, known as Shorts. First launched over a year ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/">initially in India</a>, YouTube Shorts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">arrived in the U.S</a>. this March and has since expanded to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/youtube-expands-tiktok-rival-shorts-to-the-uk-canada-latin-america-lets-users-tap-all-of-youtube-for-tunes/">other global</a> markets over the course of 2021. The short-form video platform allows users to create up to 60-second videos set to music, original audio, or &#8220;remixed&#8221; content sourced from other YouTube videos &#8212; unless creators have opted out of having their content repurposed in Shorts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230485" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like TikTok and its competitors from Instagram and Snapchat, Shorts includes video creation tools that let users either upload videos or film new content directly in the app. It also offers a set of basic editing features to do things like adjust the video&#8217;s speed, set a timer, combine clips, or even use a green screen effect, among other things.</p>
<p>According to a YouTube spokesperson, the company is looking to understand with the new test whether or not users find it helpful to start off from where they left off the last time they closed the app.</p>
<p>But the test also signals how YouTube sees TikTok, and the broader shift to short-form videos, as a potential threat to its business. Although TikTok popularized the short-form, vertical feed format, it has since been inching into YouTube&#8217;s territory. This summer, for example, TikTok officially extended the maximum video length <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiktok-expands-max-video-length-to-3-minutes-up-from-60-seconds/">to 3 minutes</a>, up from 60 seconds. And it&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/tiktok-is-reportedly-testing-5-minute-videos/">spotted testing</a> 5-minute videos in recent months.</p>
<p>To better take on TikTok, YouTube this year announced its plans to directly pay Shorts creators with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/youtubes-100-million-shorts-fund-to-challenge-tiktok-goes-live/">introduction</a> of a $100 million YouTube Shorts Fund that will run over the course of 2021 to 2022. These payouts may range anywhere from $100 to $10,000, based on viewership and engagement with the Shorts videos.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But simply incentivizing the creative community may not be enough to give YouTube an edge. So it&#8217;s now trying a more aggressive tactic &#8212; dropping users back into Shorts upon relaunching the app, if that&#8217;s what they had last watched. By doing so, it&#8217;s possible those users will scroll and watch a few videos before they do whatever they came to do in the app. And if they were just launching YouTube because they had time to kill, the app will aim to capture their attention with Shorts&#8217; content.</p>
<p>The test arrives at a time when the use of Shorts has been growing. During its Q2 <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/alphabet-inc-googl-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcrip/">earnings</a>, YouTube parent comapny Alphabet announced Shorts had surpassed 15 billion daily views, up from 6.5 billion in <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/alphabet-inc-googl-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcrip/">Q1</a>. But some of this increase could be attributed to market expansions, and not necessarily increased user demand.</p>
<p>YouTube declined to specify how long these new tests will run, saying only that it will make that determination based on user and creator feedback, in addition to metrics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.myfunnow.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FunNow</a> is a booking app for spontaneous people. For example, you can reserve a manicure or restaurant seat and head right over. As people start to spend more time outside their homes, FunNow is prepping itself for expansion into more countries. The Taipei-based company announced today it has closed a Series B of $15 million.</p>
<p>The round was co-lead by Perfect Hexagon Commodity &amp; Investment Bank and Ascendo Ventures, with participation from the corporate venture arms of PChome, KKday and Wistron. It also included returning investors CDIB Capital, Darwin Ventures, Accuvest, Sanput Travel Group and CSV Venture Fund, which is jointly managed buy NEC Capital Solutions and Venture Labo Investment.</p>
<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer TK Chen told TechCrunch that FunNow originally planned to start raising its Series B in 2020 before COVID hit. Despite dealing with the pandemic’s impact in all of its markets, including Hong Kong and Malaysia, the company began to see business improve during the second quarter of this year. Its Series B brings FunNow’s total funding, including its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/12/taiwan-startup-funnow-gets-5m-series-a-to-help-locals-in-asian-cities-find-last-minute-things-to-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 Series A</a>, to about $22.5 million, and will be used to expand the number of categories in its app, adding night clubs, karaoke bars and catering, for example, and enter new countries, including Thailand, Singapore and Japan.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230369" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Taiwan startup FunNow gets $5M Series A to help locals in Asian cities find last-minute things to do&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/12/taiwan-startup-funnow-gets-5m-series-a-to-help-locals-in-asian-cities-find-last-minute-things-to-do/embed/#?secret=4wP3GrAJaa" data-secret="4wP3GrAJaa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>During the pandemic, FunNow faced different challenges in each of its markets. For example, cases in Kuala Lumpur were low for most of this year before an outbreak that started in May. In Taiwan, FunNow’s biggest market, life was relatively normal until an uptick in cases triggered a lockdown from May to August, causing its revenue to decline sharply, but now its returned to about 80% of its pre-pandemic performance.</p>
<p>During the outbreaks, FunNow’s team adapted the app’s services. For example, in Malaysia, it talked to food and beverage merchants and discovered that customers prefer to pick up food instead of waiting for deliveries, so it added takeaway bookings. “Within two months, our return for takeaway was almost the same as dine-in revenue,” said co-founder and chief global strategist CC Chang.</p>
<p>The app already had multi-channel reservation tools, so it began adapting the types of hotel reservations offered, adding daytime options, with stays of 4, 6 or 12 hour increments. For example, people who wanted to dine somewhere, but not in a restaurant, could book a room for a few hours and order room service. Some users, tired of WFH, booked hotel rooms to work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“We kept innovating, developing the app, developing more functions and also acquired a great team in Southeast Asia, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, and also in Hong Kong,” said Chen. “We wanted to raise money now so we can expand market share as soon as possible, once the pandemic is under control.”</p>
<p>He added that COVID has changed consumer habits. For example, people now use online bookings more since walk-ins are discouraged in many places, and they prefer the convenience of FunNow over a phone call. People also started taking advantage of times when the COVID situation is relatively under control to do things like get salon services.</p>
<p>FunNow is facing more competition, however, as startups that used to focus on international travel switched to “staycations.” For example, both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/klook-200-milllion-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoftBank-backed Klook </a>and PickTime now also offering local bookings for many categories that overlap with FunNow. Chen said he anticipates that “the competition between us will ultimately get bigger and bigger.”</p>
<p>One of the ways FunNow differentiates is its emphasis on “daily life” activities—for example, food, hair cuts, manicures or massages, instead of packages centered around destinations, like theme parks, tourist spots or other cities.</p>
<p>“We are really focused on instant booking,” said Chang. “It’s important to our users because it’s more convenient. You don’t have to make a phone call and we have 10 different categories that are based on daily life, so if you are used to FunNow to do your hair, your nails, make salon appointments, order bouquets or cakes for parties, you won’t easily switch to other platforms.”</p>
<p>FunNow’s Series B included the corporate venture arms of e-commerce platform PChome, tour and activity booking app KKday and electronics manufacturer Wistron. Chen said their investment means that FunNow will be able to work with all three companies to “accelerate the growth of a lifestyle ecosystem.”</p>
<p>For example, PChome, one of the most popular shopping apps in Taiwan, might feature FunNow activities during promotions. People browsing on PChome for Mother’s Day gifts could see FunNow bookings for restaurants in the app.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, KKday offered international travel bookings, but is now focused on staycations, or local activities. By working together, Chen said the two companies plan to become more formidable rivals to Klook. “We can’t give a lot of details right now, but the basic idea is to combine resources. For example, they have a lot of activities and we have dinners and massages. If we come together, we can combine our suppliers and get more traffic and orders to merchants.”</p>

<p>FunNow will seek other similar partnerships to drive low-cost traffic. Known for being one of Apple’s manufacturing contractors, Wistron’s role in FunNow’s booking ecosystem seems less obvious, but Chen explains its “not a pure strategy partner. Wistron has spent a lot of time focused on digitizing Taiwan’s market, and created a corporate fund to invest in startups, and we will get a lot of support from them.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Ascendo Ventures managing director Aaron Shih said, “FunNow’s performance during the COVID-19 pandemic shows that the company’s operating conditions are optimistic and have huge potential for overseas expansion.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every development team needs documentation to help onboard new developers and track the details behind the project. If you&#8217;re producing an external API, it&#8217;s even more critical to have good instructions on how to implement it, but it&#8217;s traditionally an area that most programmers don&#8217;t love keeping up with.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where <a href="http://swimm.io">Swimm</a>, an Israeli startup, comes in. It&#8217;s created a solution to prompt developers to include documentation, make it easier to create it, and even lets them know when it&#8217;s fallen out of date. Today the company announced a healthy $27.6 million Series A to keep growing the solution. It is also releasing Swimm in beta today.</p>
<p>The round was led by Insight Partners and Dawn Capital with help from existing investors Pitango First and TAU Ventures. Swimm said it has now raised a total of $33.3 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230457" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Oren Toledano, CEO and co-founder at Swimm, says documentation often gets short-changed by developers, who would prefer to concentrate on coding, and the company wanted to make it easier and more integrated with the coding process.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal of Swimm is to create an easy way for developers to create documentation that is very coupled with the code itself. &#8230; And I think the most important part of it is that once we&#8217;ve connected the code to the dock, Swimm is able to follow changes in the code base itself and flag docs that are outdated because something has changed,&#8221; Toledano said.</p>
<p>Swimm actually becomes part of the delivery pipeline, either through the IDE or on GitHub, and it can flag whenever there is a change. It works much like comments in a word processing program where you can accept those changes or make additional corrections as you see fit. The solution is language-agnostic, meaning it should work for all types code.</p>
<p>In essence, Toledano said the company is treating the documentation as code.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The docs sit where the code sits in the user&#8217;s repository, and it behaves as code, meaning when you&#8217;re pushing your code, you&#8217;re also pushing Swimm documentation, and it goes through the same process, the same CI [pipeline], the same apps that deploy code, and then we&#8217;re able to use this environment to make sure that the documentation stays up-to-date,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company currently has 30 employees, with a couple of people in the U.S., one in Berlin and the rest in Tel Aviv. He says that the employee base is over 40% women today, and as they hire they want to move that to half. They intend to build the hiring infrastructure to make sure they are bringing in a diverse group of candidates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once we get there, I think we are going to be open and ready with the knowledge and infrastructure in terms of the HR and people infrastructure we&#8217;re building to look at additional populations that are underrepresented in Israel,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the way to do it is to partner with organizations that are [active] in Israel to promote this population to the high-tech world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company launched in 2019 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/swimm-raises-5-7m-to-help-teams-document-their-code/">got $5.7 million in seed funding</a> in April 2020. Today&#8217;s round closed in May.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Companies snapping up merchants selling on Amazon to build in more e-commerce economies of scale into the model are on a rapid pace of growth at the moment, fueled in no small part by giant infusions of money from the world of venture capital. In the latest development, Berlin&#8217;s <a href="https://razor-group.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Razor Group</a> &#8212; one of the more ambitious of the aggregators out of Europe &#8212; has now raised $125 million of equity funding in a Series B round that CEO and co-founder Tushar <span class="s1">Ahluwalia said</span> pushes the company past a $1 billion valuation.</p>
<p class="p1">In a sea of startups that have collectively raised billions of dollars to scoop up smaller Amazon-based merchants, Razor believes that its numbers speak to it being one of the biggest, and possibly the biggest of all in Europe, even as more 70% of its revenues are actually generated from the U.S..</p>
<p class="p1">Razor said that it is profitable on a group Ebitda basis; going to post $400 million in revenues for the year ending in December; and on track to pass $1 billion in sales in 2022, on a business model that Ahluwalia claims is not simply based on en masse &#8220;rolling up&#8221; smaller Amazon merchants that have been built on top of the e-commerce giant&#8217;s marketplace and <a href="https://services.amazon.co.uk/services/fulfilment-by-amazon/features-benefits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fulfillment (FBA) infrastructure</a>. Its ambition: yes, buy them up, but then integrate them into a wider operation and eventually move away from being wholly dependent on Amazon.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230425" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Our pitch is not that we are an FBA acquirer, but that we work in three phases: acquire, operationalize and then transform,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Technology helps us to be very good in each of those.&#8221; Ahluwalia said that 12% of Razor&#8217;s revenues are already &#8220;non-Amazon&#8221; and the plan is for the to move up to over 20% in the next three quarters. &#8220;We&#8217;ll also be more diversified,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p class="p1">This Series B is an all-equity round &#8212; the equity aspect being a contrast to a lot of the raises made by startups in the same business as Razor&#8217;s, including a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $400 million round Razor itself raised</a> in March of this year, which was $375 million of debt for acquisitions, and $25 million in equity. It&#8217;s coming from a mix of new and previous investors, including <span class="s1">Fortress Investment Group, 468 Capital, Victory Park Capital, Presight Capital, Blackrock, Jebsen Capital, Redalpine and GFC (GFC is the fund from the Samwer Brothers of Rocket Internet fame: Ahluwalia and another co-founder, Christoph Gamon, are both Rocket alums). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reason for raising equity is to have more flexibility with the capital than Razor (or others in the space) might have when raising debt.</span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;We estimate that half of the Series B will be used for acquisitions with the remainder for hiring, building the operation and doubling down on certain markets like China,&#8221; said Gamon, who is Razor&#8217;s managing director. Razor currently has some 300 employees with operations in Berlin, Delhi, Austin, London, B<span class="s1">angalore and Shenzhen.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Razor launched only 14 months ago, but it has been taking a page from the Rocket playbook in aggressive expansion. From a standing start, the company is now on track to have some 80 merchants in its group by the end of this year, covering some 150+ plus brands. As a point of reference, in March the company had just 30 brands in its stable.</p>
<p>That quick expansion underscores the frenzy of activity that we have seen in this space, as startups amass large piles of capital to buy up, integrate and scale merchants that have built successful businesses around selling on Amazon, by way of the company&#8217;s marketplace and <a href="https://services.amazon.co.uk/services/fulfilment-by-amazon/features-benefits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fulfillment infrastructure</a>, but might lack the funds, talent or exit strategy to scale beyond that.</p>
<p>Just a couple of weeks ago, Thrasio &#8212; one of the big players out of the U.S. &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/thrasio-the-amazon-aggregator-raises-1b-in-fresh-funding-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-10-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $1 billion</a> on a $5 billion valuation; Perch <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $775 million</a> in May of this year, and we know of at least one other competitor to them about to also announce a major round; and these are just three recent, big deals. Others include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/uk-based-heroes-raises-200m-to-buy-up-more-amazon-merchants-for-its-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroes</a>, which raised $200 million in August;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/olsam-raises-165m-to-buy-up-and-scale-consumer-and-b2b-amazon-marketplace-sellers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Olsam</a> ($165 million); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/suma-brands-raises-150m-to-acquire-more-third-party-brands-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suma Brands</a> ($150 million); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/elevate-brands-banks-250m-to-roll-up-third-party-merchants-selling-on-amazons-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate Brands</a> ($250 million); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/factory14-raises-200m-to-jump-into-the-amazon-marketplace-roll-up-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factory14</a> ($200 million); as well as <a href="https://heyday.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heyday</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Razor Group</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branded</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SellerX</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/">X2</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/benitago-group-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benitago</a>, Latin America’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/valoreo-raises-50m-to-roll-up-latam-e-commerce-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valoreo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/founded-by-former-carousell-ovo-and-fave-execs-rainforest-raises-36m-to-aggregate-asia-pacific-amazon-marketplace-sellers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainforest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/una-brands-launches-with-40m-to-acquire-brands-on-multiple-asia-pacific-e-commerce-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Una Brands</a> out of Asia.</p>
<p>This gives those third-party merchants looking to sell up <em>a lot</em> of options when it comes to buyers.</p>
<p>So the trick for the Razors of the world is to both figure out how to find those that are under the radar but poised to grow, or to pay a premium, or bring together assets in a clever way that will make them more valuable in the longer term.</p>
<p>Razor&#8217;s pitch is that it&#8217;s able to do this by way of a tech platform built from the ground up that analyzes the long tail of merchants selling on marketplaces like Amazon, and then helps to integrate those that it acquires to operate them as a more singular business in terms of sourcing, marketing, and logistics.</p>
<p><b></b><span class="s1">Shrestha Chowdhury, another co-founder who is Razor&#8217;s CTO, said that to date Razor has used its platform to analyze and evaluate some 1.5 million Amazon merchants, and out of that it has already sourced 80,000 potential targets. Those two numbers should give you some idea of the scale and opportunity, but so should the fact that Razor has only acquired 80 merchants to date.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike most other players we don’t rely on FBA brokers,&#8221; Chowdhury said. &#8220;We source proprietary deal flow.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that seems to be at the crux of Razor&#8217;s approach: speed, but also a dose of trust and experience to follow through on that. “Deal-making is something extremely personal,” Ahluwalia said to me back in March. “A seller needs to like you. Our calculations have allowed us to be the first in these deal conversations.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.agrify.com/vertical-farming/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAsqOMBhDFARIsAFBTN3d9gLl2NXCdiB415Yy_MHEvAuki6zh6cXjss5ju3dxd_egj4deRQ9MaAlIJEALw_wcB">Agrify</a> currently sells computer-controlled vertical farming units for cannabis. But that&#8217;s just the starting point for Agrify. The company is quickly going vertical itself, adding features and acquiring more companies as it builds out a total solution provider for the cannabis industry.</p>
<p>Cannabis is among the most valuable crops in the United States. According to Leafy&#8217;s Cannabis Harvest Report 2021 (<a href="https://leafly-cms-production.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02140733/LeaflyCannabisHarvestReport_2021.pdf">PDF</a>), it&#8217;s estimated to be worth $6.2 billion &#8212; and that&#8217;s just in the eleven states where it&#8217;s legal for adult retail purchase.</p>
<p>Cannabis farmers, just like every other commercial farmer, employ countless systems to increase yields and maximize the taste, size, and durability. Often these farmers use several platforms from several vendors. As every CTO knows, that&#8217;s normal in 2021. Agrify wants to change this approach.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230483" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Agrify aims to be the grower&#8217;s only system and sells a platform that offers unparalleled control over the growing process. Thanks to two recent acquisitions, the company will also provide a similar system for the extraction process, allowing its customers to grow, harvest, and process cannabis with only one system. And the company doesn&#8217;t intend to stop here. CEO Raymond Chang tells me he sees Agrify becoming one of the fastest-growing and most vertically integrated solutions in the cannabis space.</p>
<p>Raymond Chang co-founded the company in 2016 and raised $4.5 million over two funding rounds. Instead of seeking additional venture capital, Chang took the startup public in January 2021. The company&#8217;s stock hit the market at $12.74, and it climbed to an all-time high of $33.06 in August before sliding down to $15 in October. As of writing, the stock is surging, quickly nearing its all-time high.</p>
<p>Despite working within cannabis, the company is listed on the NASDAQ as Agrify doesn&#8217;t bundle cannabis with its equipment. It&#8217;s considered a non-plant touching, ancillary company to the cannabis industry. This is important. The company sidesteps all the regulatory hurdles facing plant-touching cannabis companies, including the restrictive banking and fundraising laws.</p>
<p>Chang doesn&#8217;t regret taking Agrify to public. There&#8217;s pros and cons, he said, noting the company needs to be more disciplined and transparent, but the IPO resulted in a windfall of cash.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We were able to acquire these two really awesome extraction companies [Precision Extraction Solutions and Cascade Sciences],&#8221; Chang said, &#8220;partially because we&#8217;re public. We&#8217;re able to do so in cash and with [company stock] shares. The internal goal is to fill two thirds of the growth organically, but a third will probably come from acquisitions. So we&#8217;re going to continue to consolidate this industry. And having that public currency is a huge plus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agrify growing platform starts with genetics. Growers pick from a list of pre-selected stains that work with the Agrify system. Since the system is working with a known quantity, the platform can maximize the yield by controlling several vital variables, including lighting, watering, and humidity. There&#8217;s no more guessing. Select the genetics, and let Agrify&#8217;s system take it from seed to store.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s high-tech vertical farming units (VFUs) are key to the operation. These growing racks house and grow high-value plants like cannabis, hemp, and other herbs. The units stack, allowing cultivators to grow two sets of plants with the footprint of one. Gangplanks link the units together.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see consistent consistency issues around cultivation, and it&#8217;s even worse around cannabis 2.0 products, &#8221; Chang said.</p>
<p>Agrify sees its customers looking at two options: Either their raw harvest to a processor or process it themselves. Naturally, Agrify wants growers to opt for the latter.</p>
<p>Recently,<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/nasdaq-traded-agrify-corp-acquires-211011667.html"> the company spent $50 million</a> purchasing Precision Extraction Solutions and Cascade Sciences, two leading cannabis and hemp extraction and processing companies. According to Agrify, these two companies previously worked with 30 multi-state operators and over 1000 cannabis and hemp customers. Because of this transaction, Agrify gains physical presence in seven states.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a couple more companies we need to acquire,&#8221; Chang said. &#8220;When you look at the customers, it&#8217;s all about how we can help them increase their return on investments. It&#8217;s all about better space utilization and pushing for higher yield, pushing for lower costs and just more automation.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With seven weeks left in holiday shopping, e-commerce platform <a href="https://www.curated.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curated</a> aims to help you find the perfect pair of skis or golf clubs and is attracting additional capital to expand its offerings. Following a hefty $39 million Series B announced in April, the company secured a $75 million Series C in a round led by CapitalG.</p>
<p>Joining CapitalG in the round are existing investors Forerunner Ventures, which first came in during Curated’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/forerunner-ventures-newest-bet-is-curated-a-marketplace-that-matches-pros-with-people-buying-high-ticket-items/">$22 million Series A</a> round in 2019, and Greylock. The latest round gives the company total funding of $141.5 million.</p>
<p>Eduardo Vivas, Curated co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch the new round was unexpected, as interest from investors poured in, driven in part by the company’s growth of 300% year over year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230162" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company was co-founded in 2017 by Vivas, Peter Ombres, Alex Vauthey and Annabel Liu, who had previously worked together at LinkedIn. They noticed just how transactional online shopping was and how difficult it is to find the right product amid the thousands of product choices.</p>
<p>With the U.S. e-commerce market poised to reach its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/u-s-e-commerce-on-track-for-its-first-1-trillion-year-by-2022-due-to-lasting-pandemic-impacts/">first trillion-dollar year by 2022</a>, the company developed a network of over 1,000 experts who get paid to provide their knowledge, bringing an in-person shopping experience online to assist with purchasing high-consideration products, initially sporting equipment for skiing, golf, camping, hiking and biking.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;US e-commerce on track for its first $1 trillion year by 2022, due to lasting pandemic impacts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/u-s-e-commerce-on-track-for-its-first-1-trillion-year-by-2022-due-to-lasting-pandemic-impacts/embed/#?secret=qtCCsbOJBu" data-secret="qtCCsbOJBu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Here’s how it works: Consumers answer a few questions about the products they are looking for, and Curated matches them to a category expert who provides a list of personalized recommendations and will text or jump on a phone call to guide the consumer to the right product, which the consumer can buy directly from Curated.com.</p>
<p>“The buying journey is about having fun,” Vivas told TechCrunch. “You enjoy the process just as much as imagining what you are going to get. It used to be the old cliché line that men don’t like shopping, but really, everyone can obsess over the buying process, but the ability to talk to someone who is brilliant is what we bring to life.”</p>
<p>The company is working with retail brands, including Callaway Golf, The North Face, Rossignol and Burton. Over 1 million people have already used the tool to shop and Vivas touts a near 0% return rate compared to between 10% and 30%, on average, of online shopping experiences.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the new funding will be used to double the company’s team of 100 and go into R&amp;D so that it can expand into new categories. Curated has eight categories today, and Vivas intends to launch 15 to 20 more in the next year, including coffee and home goods, like barbecues.</p>
<p>Interest from CapitalG introduced the Curated team to general partner Laela Sturdy, who is joining Curated’s board as part of the investment.</p>
<p>“She is one of the most special people in the world and after meeting her, I knew I wanted to be in business with her,” Vivas said. “This fundraising was the right thing to do, even though it was unexpected, for the purposes of accelerating into more categories of high-consideration purchases.”</p>
<p>Sturdy, after experiencing the company herself, said customer feedback was one of the first things that attracted her to the company. She could tell that people “were feeling the product love, and that is super important.”</p>
<p>Curated was also differentiating itself by investing in a technology platform that identifies, onboards and matches experts with consumers. In fact, many of the experts Sturdy spoke with said they were excited about the prospect of being able to get paid to talk about the things they love.</p>
<p>“Rarely do you get to see that on both sides,” she added. “The experience is unlike anything, which is why Curated has to be one of the transformative e-commerce companies of our generation.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[CEO Andrew Ng says industries should adopt a data-centric approach to building AI, which provides a more efficient way for manufacturers to teach an AI model what to do.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just over a year after launching its flagship product, <a href="https://landing.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Landing AI</a> secured a $57 million round of Series A funding to continue building tools that enable manufacturers to more easily and quickly build and deploy artificial intelligence systems.</p>
<p>The company, started by former Google and Baidu AI guru Andrew Ng, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/landing-ai-launches-new-visual-inspection-platform-for-manufacturers/">developed LandingLens</a>, a visual inspection tool that applies AI and deep learning to find product defects faster and more accurately.</p>
<p>Ng says industries should adopt a data-centric approach to building AI, which provides a more efficient way for manufacturers to teach an AI model what to do, using no code/low code capabilities, which include just a few mouse clicks to build advanced AI models in less than a day.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230233" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We kicked off the data-centric AI movement and are quite pleased that other companies have started talking about it,” he told TechCrunch. “In manufacturing, every factory does something different, so the problem becomes how we can help 10,000 manufacturers build 10,000 different models without having to hire a lot of manpower.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230236" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230236" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230236" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image001.jpeg?w=680" alt="Andrew Ng, Landing AI" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image001.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image001.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image001.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image001.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image001.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image001.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2230236" class="wp-caption-text">Andrew Ng, founder and CEO. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Landing AI</p></div></p>
<p>AI is expected to create $13 trillion of realized value to the world’s economy by 2030, <a href="https://internetofbusiness.com/a-i-2030-13-trillion-boost-to-economy-but-deep-disparity-mckinsey/#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20(AI)%20could,from%20management%20consulting%20firm%2C%20McKinsey." target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a McKinsey study</a>. Ng says not much of that is realized yet, as it remains challenging to build different AI models.</p>
<p>He believes Landing AI has cracked the code for building these models, and raised the Series A round after seeing product market fit and wanted to be able to scale the team to make the product better.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>McRock Capital, an investment firm focused on the industrial Internet of Things, led the investment and was joined by Insight Partners, Taiwania Capital, Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), Intel Capital, Samsung Catalyst Fund, Far Eastern Group’s DRIVE Catalyst, Walsin Lihwa and AI Fund.</p>
<p>Landing AI has made strides in building its product, but Ng said the company is still in the early stages of the data-centric AI movement and wants to make additional progress and innovate on some technology that is still missing.</p>
<p>For example, while previously building a speech recognition system with 350 million data points, he found that AI technology invented for that many data points does not work as well in manufacturing settings with limited images to find defects. Part of the data-centric movement is to develop tools to help domain experts by utilizing less than 50 images to provide a clearer example of what is a defect.</p>
<p>“We’ve reached a point where it is working and we are eager to scale everything,” Ng said. “We’ve been fascinated for years on how to crack the recipe and take AI to other industries, and we are finally getting there with data-centric AI.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://notabene.id/">Notabene</a>, a New York, NY-based crypto compliance SaaS startup, has raised $10.2 million in a Series A funding round co-led by F-Prime Capital and Jump Capital. The latest investment brings Notabene’s valuation to $45 million.</p>
<p>New investors include crypto exchanges <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/african-crypto-usage-spurs-luno-as-customers-reach-7m/">Luno</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/with-investors-expecting-a-latin-american-cryptocurrency-boom-mexicos-bitso-raises-62-million/">Bitso</a>, who were Notabene’s customers prior to the fundraise, as well as the venture capital arms of Blockfi and Gemini Frontier Fund. Illuminate Financial, CMT Digital, Fenbushi Capital and ComplyAdvantage CEO Charlie Delingpole also participated as new backers in the Series A, joining existing investors including Castle Island Ventures and Green Visor Capital. Notabene raised a $1.76 million seed round in October 2020, six months after the company was founded.</p>
<p>Notabene’s software helps its 50-plus customers, many of which are crypto exchanges, comply with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) “travel rule” imposed in 2019. The travel rule requires crypto exchanges in FATF member countries to exchange customer-identifying information for transfers above $1,000 to ensure compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. FATF <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf">issued new guidance</a> around the travel rule in October, clarifying the specifics around what exchanges need to do in order to comply.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230151" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Notabene fills a need from exchanges for technology that enables this transfer of information between parties in a transaction while preserving user privacy. The identify-verification process requires anonymous wallet addresses on the blockchain to be linked to real-world customers. Notabene CEO Pelle Brændgaard told TechCrunch that it is crucial to ensure this information is only seen by the parties involved in the transaction and Notabene itself.</p>
<p>Brændgaard added that beyond ensuring compliance, the identity-verification services Notabene provides also help build trust between consumers transacting in crypto, who want to ensure they are transacting with the correct counterparty and avoiding the risk of fraud.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the proceeds from the funding round to scale its technology to support an influx of new customers.</p>
<p>Of 25 crypto exchanges who responded to a survey by investor <a href="https://jumpcap.com/">Jump Capital</a>, 90% said they plan to use Notabene for travel rule compliance, Peter Johnson, a Jump Capital partner who is joining Notabene’s board of directors, told TechCrunch. Johnson said Jump’s investment was motivated, in part, by “overwhelming market feedback” that Notabene’s product was solving a crucial issue for the crypto industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Notabene’s biggest competitors are industry working groups implementing centralized protocols for compliance. The Travel Rule Protocol (TRP) working group, which counts banks including Fidelity Investments and Standard Chartered among its members, is one of the most notable. Under such centralized protocols, member institutions and exchanges share data, and their users can easily transact with one another in a compliant manner.</p>
<p>Brændgaard said that these groups can foster exclusion, given their membership is largely composed of U.S.-based exchanges.</p>
<p>“We have a few companies that are in Nigeria, for example, and Nigeria doesn&#8217;t have a regulatory framework for crypto. So if you have a gatekeeper that goes in and says, &#8216;we only expect fully regulated companies,&#8217; that means that they&#8217;re automatically out,” Brændgaard said of centralized groups like the TRP. “It doesn&#8217;t matter if they have built up a good, strong, serious, well-respected compliance function over the years.”</p>
<p>Notabene’s founding team and many of its early employees came from decentralized identity startup <a href="https://www.uport.me/">UPort</a>, Brændgaard said. He said he hopes Notabene’s decentralized framework, informed by the work they did at UPort, can build trust across exchanges without limiting membership.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous vehicle startup Gatik has reached a new milestone in its partnership with Walmart and within the industry.</p>
<p>Gatik said Monday it has pulled the safety operator from behind the wheel of two self-driving box trucks that operate in Walmart&#8217;s home turf of Bentonville, Arkansas. This means the startup&#8217;s box trucks are driverless on a commercial route — a first for the industry, according to <span class="il">Gatik </span>CEO and co-founder Gautam Narang.</p>
<p>Gatik has taken a different approach from other competitors in the autonomous vehicle sector. The Palo Alto-based startup isn&#8217;t targeting consumers. Instead, Gatik uses its autonomous trucks to shuttle groceries and other goods from large distribution centers to retail locations. Gatik, which came out of stealth in 2019, has been shuttling goods for Walmart in Arkansas and Louisiana, and for Loblaw Companies Limited in in Ontario, Canada.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230347" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>More recently, Gatik expanded into Texas following a Series B fundraising round of $85 million. Gatik has 25 self-driving trucks in its total fleet, which are spread out among Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, California and Canada.</p>
<p>Gatik first started driverless operations in August, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/gatik-expands-autonomous-box-truck-operations-to-texas-with-85-million-in-new-funds/">TechCrunch noted at the time</a>. Walmart and Gatik have now released more details about the driverless operations. Gatik has five self-driving trucks operating in Arkansas, which are used to shuttle goods for Walmart. Two of these trucks are fully driverless now and operate seven days a week on a 7.1-mile route between a Walmart fulfillment center (or dark store) and one of its neighborhood markets.</p>
<p>Gatik still has safeguards in place, however. An employee is in the passenger seat of the truck, there is a chase vehicle and it only operates in fair weather conditions. A third-party company evaluated the self-driving system prior to launching the driverless operations, Naraang said.</p>
<p>Narang told TechCrunch the aim is to scale fully driverless operations across its other sites as well — and at a faster pace. &#8220;It took us about 24 months since our commercial launch to get to a point where we could safely take the driver out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That time to unmanned will be reducing over time. Basically, getting to fully driverless operations in new markets and in new routes will become faster.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[For Them intends to launch up to five products in the next year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://forthem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For Them</a> announced $2 million in pre-seed funding as it launches its first two products for the queer community: a breathable binder and multi-use intimacy serum.</p>
<p>Chloe Freeman, an actor, producer and entrepreneur started the company last year after completing an entrepreneur-in-residence program at prehype. They previously founded a production company, Boycott Entertainment, that raised more than $1 million to date for underrepresented creators</p>
<p>Freeman, a queer, non-binary person of color, told TechCrunch they didn’t see any wellness products that spoke to them or their peers, but rather to the majority of cisgender people.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230197" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“As someone who didn’t fit that bucket, I went looking for products that fit my unique wellness journey, but couldn&#8217;t find them,” they said. “I wanted to dig in and see how to change the narrative.”</p>
<p>That was particularly true with For Them’s first product, a chest binder to help reduce gender dysphoria. Freeman asked peers about their experiences and then went out and bought all of the binders they could find and “was shocked” at how uncomfortable the binders were — the itchy fabric and the synthetic materials — and aimed to make a better one, they said.</p>
<p>The investment was led by Resolute Ventures and includes Yes VC, Animo Ventures, Gaingels Spark Fund and a group of over 10 individual investors including Toyin Ajayi, co-founder and president of Cityblock Health; Lindsay Ullman, co-founder of Umbrella; Ashley Mayer, former Glossier executive; and Jackie Rice, co-founder, Tribe AI.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to create additional products, to continue building its community and for talent acquisition. Freeman intends to create an equally diverse team as the community For Them aims to serve.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“This is a huge opportunity to work with an underserved community that needs products that speak to them,” Freeman added.</p>
<p>In addition to the binder and Fluid intimacy serum, which has CBD oil, they intend to build two or three additional products. The company’s product pipeline will be community-driven. Freeman’s strategy is to gather ideas from For Them’s community and produce what they need. The community sits on Discord currently, which Freeman said provides anonymity, especially when speaking about personal problems.</p>

<p>For Them has 800 people on the waiting list for the binder, which Freeman said was deliberate so that the company was able to adequately serve them within the next month. Once the company makes it through that list, more customers will be able to purchase products.</p>
<p>Melanie Travis, founder of swimwear company Andie Swim, is one of For Them’s investors and advisors and said now was a “great time to be starting something” and is looking forward to seeing what works and what the company can create.</p>
<p>At this stage, Travis said investment is mostly about the founder and finds Freeman to be “ a smart, remarkable person who is passionate about the purpose and the category.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes founders come up against a brick wall, and you are looking at the founder’s ability to just bust through that brick wall, and I saw all of that in Chloe,” she added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As some of the most popular cryptocurrencies reach all-time-highs, plenty of new users and decentralized app developers are embracing the Ethereum network and quickly discovering that the blockchain remains a pretty crowded place to do business. Ethereum&#8217;s insufficient network volume limits have led to slow transactions and prohibitively pricey fees, but it&#8217;s a familiar problem for longtime developers in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>What is new is the wider availability of so-called Ethereum &#8220;rollup&#8221; scaling solutions. These developer products reduce the traffic on the central Ethereum blockchain by offloading the hard work of processing transactions to efficient secondary chains that record data of transaction batches to the main Ethereum network. What this means functionally is that developers can earn the benefits of speedier and cheaper transactions without having to lose the security of the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="https://matter-labs.io/">Matter Labs</a> is one of a handful of blockchain startups building out a sophisticated rollup product, but the team believes that their solution <a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync</a> is destined to beat out the competition. The startup tells TechCrunch it has just closed a $50 million Series B investment led by a16z Crypto just months after closing a Series A led by Union Square Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230246" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ethereum scaling is a serious business with just a few major players; a16z Crypto already backed one this year, leading the February Series A of developer Optimism. In August, Lightspeed backed Offchain Labs, maker of Arbitrum &#8212; another Ethereum scaling solution with a lot of developer interest. Both developers are building a type of rollup called an &#8220;optimistic rollup,&#8221; Matter Labs is building a similar product called a &#8220;ZK rollup&#8221; that takes a notably different approach leveraging zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to scale transactions in a manner that&#8217;s fundamentally more secure but is also much more computationally intense.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JxyayFgkVM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/offchain-labs-raises-120-million-to-hide-ethereums-shortcomings-with-arbitrum-scaling-product/">Offchain Labs raises $120 million to fix Ethereum&#8217;s shortcomings with its Arbitrum product</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Offchain Labs raises $120 million to fix Ethereum&#8217;s shortcomings with its Arbitrum product&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/offchain-labs-raises-120-million-to-hide-ethereums-shortcomings-with-arbitrum-scaling-product/embed/#?secret=JxyayFgkVM" data-secret="JxyayFgkVM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The differences between the two are fairly technical, but they essentially differ in the way that the legitimacy of the transactions inside the rollups are determined. Blockchains work by various nodes across a network reaching a consensus for what the verified history of transactions on said network looks like. With optimistic rollups, Ethereum treats the bundled transactions as legitimate by default, while withholding withdrawals for several days to allow participants in the network time to prove if the batch was fraudulent and should be rejected. Meanwhile ZK rollups leverage complex mathematical proofs which allow the Ethereum network to quickly verify and accept the legitimacy of a given transaction batch.</p>
<p>Matter Labs isn&#8217;t the only group building a ZK rollup product, but their primary advantage is that they&#8217;ve already deep in testing a solution to help Ethereum developers not only process transactions inside zkSync but also operate smart contracts based on the Solidity programming language natively inside of the product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It has tended to be the case historically that zk-based scaling solutions forced developers to learn a new programming language,&#8221; a16z Crypto general partner Ali Yahya tells TechCrunch. &#8220;[Matter Labs] has succeeded in building a compiler for Solidity that takes down normal smart contracts that run on Ethereum to a zero-knowledge proof so that they can be used with [zkSync].&#8221;</p>
<p>In the short-term there are some clear advantages for optimistic rollups, chief of which is that many of them are already publicly available to developers with wide capabilities. While zkSync is already live on the Ethereum mainnet, mainnet support for smart contracts won&#8217;t arrive until early next year, the company says. Matter Labs CEO Alex Gluchowski expects ZK rollups to reign supreme soon enough though, an opinion notably shared by Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin who wrote in a January<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html"> blog post</a> that &#8220;in the medium to long term ZK rollups will win out in all use cases&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see a world where optimistic rollups remain in the very near term,&#8221; Gluchowski tells TechCrunch. &#8220;If crypto becomes as successful as the visionaries picture it &#8212; that all the world&#8217;s digital economy lives on blockchains &#8212; then it has to use zero-knowledge proofs. We simply don&#8217;t have any other technology that can support this massive scale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>The <strong>Specialty Equipment Market Association</strong> trade show, which we know as <strong>SEMA</strong>, has long been the place to go to see quirky and flashy modifications to vehicles. This year, a major shift occurred that reflects what is happening across the country. I wasn&#8217;t able to attend this year, but folks I spoke to said they have never seen so many gas-to-electric conversions of sports cars, vintage hot rods and the like.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230331" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course, there was also a number of automakers displaying their new electrified vehicles, including the Ford F-100 Eluminator concept truck. We care about this concept because it showcases something that Ford is actually going to sell. The automaker is selling (available online or at a local dealer through Ford Performance Parts) the Eluminator electric crate motor. The motor comes from the Mustang Mach-E GT Performance Edition and produces 281 horsepower and 317 lb.-ft. of torque.</p>

<p><strong>Lime</strong> closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/lime-raises-523-million-as-it-prepares-to-go-public/">$523 million round</a> made up of convertible debt and term loan financing, the next step as the company prepares to go public next year, according to CEO <strong>Wayne Ting</strong>. The largest chunk of the round is convertible note, which means it will convert to shares when Lime goes public, something Ting says the company will do next year, but he didn&#8217;t say when or how. About $20M of that total funding will go towards the company&#8217;s decarbonization efforts. Among many initiatives that Lime put forth in time for COP26 is the company&#8217;s goal to get 80% of its manufacturing and supply chain partners to set their own carbon emissions goals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Bird</strong>, one of Lime&#8217;s biggest competitors, went public via the old SPAC route on Friday.  Shares of Bird closed basically flat at $8.40. Bird plans to use the money from the IPO to expand existing operations and launch in new cities. After Bird&#8217;s shareholders voted for the merger earlier this week, shares of the SPAC, <strong>Switchback II Corporation</strong>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/shareholders-approve-bird-spac-merger-stock-promptly-falls/">sunk more than 20%</a> before recovering.</p>
<p>Singapore-based <strong>Neuron Mobility</strong> is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/e-scooter-company-neuron-trials-1500-scooters-that-can-detect-and-correct-unsafe-riding/">updating its N3 scooters</a> with a new OS and additional onboard sensors to help it detect and correct dangerous or inconsiderate riding. A lot of companies have come out with some form of tech angled at offering the rider assistance in not driving like a jerk (Spin, Voi, Bird, Superpedestrian and Helbiz to name a few&#8230;), but they haven&#8217;t all delivered on that promise &#8220;at scale,&#8221; whatever that means. Neuron will be trialing about 1,500 of these upgraded scooters in Australia, Canada and the UK over the next six months.</p>
<p>European micromobility company <strong>Dott</strong> became one of the latest operators to integrate with Google Maps. Dott&#8217;s e-scooters and e-bikes will show up on the app in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain and the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Helbiz</strong> launched a fleet of 250 e-scooters in Sacramento, California after securing a one-year permit.</p>
<p>The UK and <strong>Beam</strong> launched a partnership in Australia and New Zealand to raise awareness of electric mobility in order to help reduce transport-fueled carbon emissions. They&#8217;re offering incentives in the form of ride credits to those who have yet to use a form of electric mobility.</p>
<p><strong>Gojek</strong>, Indonesian mobility and on-demand platform, and <strong>Gogoro</strong>, a Taiwanese micromobility battery swapping platform company, announced a partnership to electrify two-wheel transportation in Indonesia. The two, along with Indonesian national energy company Pertamina, are starting a battery swapping and Gogoro Smartscooter pilot scheme in Jakarta.</p>
<p><strong>PeopleForBike</strong> and <strong>Call2Recycle</strong> have teamed up to create the first industry-wide electric bicycle battery recycling program in the United States. The hope is to unite the sector under one battery recycling solution.</p>

<p>I wanted to turn your attention to an autonomous vehicle company that seems to be able to raise abundant amounts of capital and still remain under the radar.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about <strong>Nuro</strong>, the autonomous delivery company founded in 2016. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/nuro-lands-investment-from-google-tiger-global-in-new-600-million-round/">raised $600 million</a> in a fundraising round led by new investor Tiger Global Management. Google was another new investor in this round.</p>
<p>The funding has pushed Nuro&#8217;s valuation to about $8.6 billion &#8212; or some 72% higher than a year ago &#8212; according to people who spoke to me on condition on anonymity. A group of mostly existing investors joined the Series D round, including Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, China-based venture firm Gaorong Capital, grocery retailer Kroger, SoftBank Vision Fund 1, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and Woven Capital, a venture arm of Toyota subsidiary Woven Planet.</p>
<p>Much of it will be spent on commercializing and scaling the production of its third-generation vehicle at a new facility in Southern Nevada. Construction on its manufacturing facility will begin in December and is expected to be completed in 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>42dot</strong>, a South Korea-based autonomous transportation-as-a-service startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/korean-autonomous-driving-startup-42dot-bags-88-5m-series-a-to-support-its-growth/">raised $88.5 million</a> (104 billion WON) in a Series A round of funding that included participation from new investors like Shinhan Financial Group, Lotte Rental, Lotte Ventures, STIC Ventures, We Ventures, DA Value Investment and others.</p>
<p><strong> Autobrains</strong>, an Israeli-based company that develops AI technology for assisted and autonomous driving, <a href="https://autobrains.ai/">raised $101 million</a> in Series C funding round led by Temasek. Additional participants in the round include new investors Knorr-Bremse AG, VinFast and existing investor BMW and strategic partner, Continental.</p>
<p><strong>Breadfast</strong>, an online grocery delivery company that wants to become a regional leader in the sector, raised $26 million in Series A financing from lead investors Vostok New Ventures and Endure Capital. JAM Fund (led by Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen), YC Continuity Fund, a large unnamed Saudi-based fund, Shorooq Partners, 4DX Ventures and logistics giant Flexport also participated.</p>
<p><strong>Delimobil</strong>, Russian car-sharing company, decided to postpone its initial public offering due to market conditions, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-delimobil-ipo/russian-car-sharing-firm-delimobil-says-it-has-postponed-ipo-idUSKBN2HP26L">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Momenta</strong>, an autonomous vehicle developer from China, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/momenta-500-million/">raised another $500 million</a> that was added to its Series C round. The funding comes two months since it announced a $300 million investment from General Motors. This latest injection of capital brings the total of the startup&#8217;s Series C to over $1 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Opibus</strong>, a Swedish-Kenyan EV conversion company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/ev-conversion-startup-opibus-raises-7-5m-to-start-bus-and-motorcycle-mass-production/">raised $7.5 million</a> in pre series A round. The startup raised $5 million in equity and $2.5 million in grants in a round led by Silicon Valley fund At One Ventures, backed by Factor[e] Ventures and pan-African VC firm Ambo Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> hopes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/electric-vehicle-maker-rivian-seeks-to-raise-8-4-billion-in-ipo/">raise up $8.4 billion</a> in its initial public offering, according to a regulatory filing posted this past week. The Amazon-backed company said in the filing that it plans to offer 135 million shares at a price between $57 and $62. Underwriters also have an option to buy up to 20.25 million additional shares. If underwriters exercise that option, Rivian would raise as much as $9.6 billion.</p>
<p>Based on the number of outstanding shares, that would put its market valuation at about $53 billion. If employee stock options and other restricted shares are considered, Rivian&#8217;s valuation could be as high as $60 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Spartan Radar</strong>, a biomimetic radar company, closed $15 million in a Series A round led by Prime Movers Lab. Additional investors include 8VC and Mac VC. The round follows a $10 million raise earlier this year.</p>
<p><strong>Scale AI</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/scale-ai-acquires-siasearch-to-give-companies-the-same-data-engine-superpowers-that-tesla-has/">acquired SiaSearch</a>, a spinout of European venture studio Merantix that has built a data management platform that acts as a search engine for petabyte-scale data captured by advanced driving assistance and automated driving systems.</p>
<p><strong>Zepto</strong>, a new Indian-based grocery delivery startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/31/indias-zepto-a-10-minute-grocery-delivery-app-founded-by-two-19-year-old-stanford-dropouts-raises-60-million/">raised $60 million</a> in a round led by Glade Brook Capital. Nexus, Y Combinator, Global Founders Capital, as well as angel investors Lachy Groom, Neeraj Arora and Manik Gupta also participated in the round, which values Zepto at $225 million.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner.</p>
<p><strong>Quick note from Kirsten</strong>: After the newsletter was &#8220;put to bed,&#8221; Congress passed President Biden&#8217;s infrastructure bill, mostly along party lines. Expect more details on that next week.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s talk briefly about the <strong>Hertz-Tesla</strong> deal. I know, I can hear you groaning already. One of the things that both Tesla played up was that Hertz is paying sticker price for the 100,000 Teslas it ordered (apparently without a contract, though that&#8217;s another story).</p>
<p>But they likely didn&#8217;t pay full price. In fact, Turo&#8217;s VP of government relations, Lou Bertuca, told me he was 100% certain that Hertz didn&#8217;t pay sticker price, thanks to a tax loophole that allows rental car companies to avoid paying sales tax. He told me that each year states lose out on around $4 billion in taxes due to this loophole.</p>
<p>The sales tax exemption was designed for car resellers, but car rental companies have also been able to benefit from this &#8216;sale for resale exemption.&#8217; &#8220;They&#8217;re buying something tax-free and making lots of money by renting it out,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Anytime a car rental company says they&#8217;re paying the same rate as everybody else, the only thing you need to keep in mind is they&#8217;re not paying the sales tax that everybody else is paying, whether they&#8217;re buying a Tesla or Ford.&#8221; (TechCrunch reached out to Hertz for comment.)</p>
<p>Around five or six states are currently reconsidering this loophole, Bertuca said. Of course, Turo, a peer-to-peer marketplace for car rental, has its own dog in this fight. And it&#8217;s important to note that state and local governments can levy taxes on rental car companies that peer-to-peer rental companies (like Turo) are exempt from &#8212; here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/rental-companies-battle-car-sharing-services-over-taxes">good run-down</a> on that battle.</p>
<hr />
<p>In other news, <strong>Canada</strong> said it would &#8220;respond appropriately&#8221; should the U.S. pass the proposed increase for consumer tax incentives for electric vehicles. The country&#8217;s Innovation and Industry Minister <strong>Francois-Philippe Champagne</strong> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-canada-would-respond-us-tax-credits-american-built-evs-minister-2021-11-04/">told Reuters</a> that the proposal &#8212; which would provide an additional $4,500 for EVs made in the U.S. and in union shops and $500 for U.S.-made batteries &#8212; would run contrary to the USMCA trade agreement we have with Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>He joins a growing chorus of foreign auto and auto parts manufacturers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/toyota-honda-urge-congress-to-reject-expanded-tax-incentive-that-would-benefit-ford-gm-stellantis/">including Toyota and Honda</a>, who are opposing the additional funds.</p>
<p>I listened to a <a href="https://apma.ca/2021/10/29/what-buy-american-means-for-canadas-auto-sector/">pretty interesting interview</a> with <strong>Flavio Volpe</strong>, president of Canada&#8217;s Automotive Parts Manufacturers&#8217; Association, who made the case that &#8216;American-made&#8217; is ultimately a nice political slogan that doesn&#8217;t accurately reflect dynamics on the ground. He noted that $9 billion worth of auto parts are exported from Michigan for assembly in Ontario &#8212; parts that would go into cars that would be excluded from the additional incentive, should it pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really in our business, we operate as if there&#8217;s no border, because there hasn&#8217;t been,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>If you have a spare 20 minutes, I encourage you to listen to the entire interview. It definitely made me think about the automotive supply chain in a new way.</p>

<p>Just a quick little note that I&#8217;ve been meaning to share. Remember Starsky Robotics? This was the self-driving trucks startup that shut down in March 2020 as competition and consolidation in the industry heated up.</p>
<p>Co-founder and former CEO Stefan Seltz-Axmacher is back with a stealth startup focused on robotics and autonomy, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanseltzaxmacher/">according to his profile in LinkedIn</a>. Next to it, he states &#8220;More info soon!&#8221;</p>

The company held an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/cruise-lays-out-its-plan-for-how-it-will-make-robotaxis-a-reality/"> &#8220;Under the Hood&#8221; event</a> that was meant, besides a recruiting activity, to lay out its technical and development road map. CTO and co-founder <strong>Kyle Vogt</strong> released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmvZBiWYkFQ">YouTube video</a> of his driverless ride and late Friday the company filed an application for the CPUC Driverless Deployment Permit, as well as the accompanying required Passenger Safety Plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cruise has hit another important milestone today as the first company to apply for the final state permit required to launch an autonomous ride-hail service in California. Our accompanying Passenger Safety Plan outlines the safety and accessibility measures passengers can expect from start to finish in our AVs &#8212;- a critical facet of our overall, holistic approach to safety at Cruise,&#8221; Prashanthi Raman, head of global government affairs at Cruise, said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.</p>
<p><strong>Embark</strong> announced a partnership with Luminar to equip its truck fleet with Luminar&#8217;s long-range radar. Embark says this partnership will help the company as it tries to achieve commercial deployment and delivery of its 14,200 non-binding truck reservations in 2024.</p>

But remember, refundable $100 pre-orders are not the same as purchases! Let&#8217;s see how many that the leap this coming spring.</p>
<p><strong>Lucid Group</strong> has spent the last week delivering its Air electric vehicle to customers. The company also opened up its 11th store (it calls them &#8220;studios) in Washington DC.</p>
<p><strong>Nikola Corp.</strong>, the electric truck developer, is in talks with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/nikola-sets-aside-125-million-to-settle-with-sec/">pay a $125 million</a> civil penalty as part of an ongoing probe by the regulator into whether the company mislead investors.</p>

<p><strong>Velodyne Lidar</strong> named <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/theodore-tewksbury-to-take-over-as-velodyne-ceo/">Theodore Tewksbury as its new CEO</a>, the most recent in a string of changes to Velodyne&#8217;s C-suite since the beginning of this year. Tewksbury was the CEO of Eta Compute, a company that develops edge vision sensors. As you might recall, the company has been without a CEO for several months, after Velodyne announced the departure of Anand Gopalan in July.</p>
<h3>Ride-hailing</h3>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> and <strong>Lyft</strong> posted earnings this week.</p>
<p>Lyft kicked things off with news that it reached <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/lyft-reports-adjusted-profitability-as-revenue-per-rider-rises/">adjusted profitability</a> as riders returned to the U.S. ride-hailing company&#8217;s service. Lyft reported revenues of $864.4 million in the third quarter, a 73% pop from the $499.7 million in the same year-ago period.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Uber squeaked out $8 million worth of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/uber-squeaks-tiny-adjusted-profit-in-q3-despite-2-4b-net-loss/">adjusted EBITDA</a> &#8212; a very modified profit metric &#8212; while still posting net losses of more than $2 billion. Uber&#8217;s gross bookings (or the value of all goods and services that flowed through its platform) totaled $23.1 billion, up 57% on a year-over-year basis. That figure translated to revenues of $4.8 billion, up 72% compared to the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>To be clear, while adjusted EBITDA is one metric of profitability it&#8217;s not the grown-up GAAP profitability. Still, it&#8217;s a noteworthy milestone for these businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sneaker fit startup, <a href="https://neatsy.ai/">Neatsy.ai</a>, has snagged $1 million in seed funding after a b2b pivot. Investors in the round include Cabra VC, Flyer One VC and some unnamed business angels.</p>
<p>The US startup, which was founded back in March 2019 by Artem Semyanov (the former head of the machine learning team at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/prisma-labs-raises-6-7m-for-its-ai-powered-approach-to-visual-editing/">Prism Labs</a>), is now fully focused on selling its fit-tech to e-tailers via an SDK.</p>
<p>Neasty&#8217;s approach relies on 3D scanning technology found in the iPhone X or later (aka, the TruthDepth camera for FaceID) &#8212; so (currently) it only works for a subset of iOS users.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230412" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The AI has also only been trained to provide personalized fit recommendations for a handful of sneaker brands at this stage: Namely <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nike, Jordan, Converse, Adidas, Reebok, Yeezy, Puma, New Balance, Asics, Under Armor and Vans.</span></p>
<p>But it&#8217;s eyeing expanding its fit recommendations with the seed funding.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4TUI95yW8w"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/neatsy-wants-to-reduce-sneaker-returns-with-3d-foot-scans/">Neatsy wants to reduce sneaker returns with 3D foot scans</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Neatsy wants to reduce sneaker returns with 3D foot scans&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/neatsy-wants-to-reduce-sneaker-returns-with-3d-foot-scans/embed/#?secret=4TUI95yW8w" data-secret="4TUI95yW8w" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For those who can tap into its tool, Neatsy claims the tech measures the foot with an accuracy of 1-2 millimetres (it also flags that all scanning takes place on the user&#8217;s device itself to maintain privacy).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For its b2b mode</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">l, Neasty is monetizing SDK usage based on the number of users &#8212; setting a price per Monthly Active User.</span></p>
<p>And for e-tailers it touts an average drop of 39% in shoe returns as online shoppers are able to get a virtual gauge on the best fit and so will be able to pick a better sized pair of kicks for their feet &#8212; which it also claims translates into a 20% increase in ARPU (or an additional $0.5/month per user).</p>
<p>So far it has two ecommerce marketplaces/fashion industry enterprises signed up to use its tech &#8212; driving its annual revenue (ARR) to hit $120k over the past year.</p>
<p>It also slates a number of ongoing pilots that it&#8217;s hoping will convert into paying customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the paying clients are currently in Europe, we also see great potential in the further rollout to European markets&#8230; as Germany, the UK, France are home for great sportswear and fashion companies, as well as for large online fashion marketplaces. As well as thousands of SMB shops and brands for whom we are developing an entry-tier product,&#8221; says Semyanov.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are also looking at the US market, as we currently have several brands testing our tech (yet for free) but we are optimistic here. Probably you remember Nike was announcing the launch of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/with-new-fit-technology-nike-calls-itself-a-tech-company/">Nike Fit app a couple of years</a> ago but somehow it never saw the light of day. We would be happy to help them with our tech (kidding, or not).&#8221;</p>
<p>As well as pushing to sign up more e-tailers, Neasty plans to use the seed funding to dial up its product development. On that front, Semyanov says it&#8217;s looking to diversify the range of supported footwear &#8212; to include formal shoes and children&#8217;s footwear.</p>
<p>He says it&#8217;s also trying to hone its AI to be able to pick up on specific foot conditions &#8212; such as detecting flat feet and hyperpronation.</p>
<p>Launching versions of the tech for the web and Android is also on the cards, as 3D depth cameras have proliferated over the past few years &#8212; with a number of Android smartphone also packing this kind of camera hardware (such as Samsung&#8217;s DepthVision tech).</p>
<p>The seed fund will also go on simplifying the product integration process and building a customer success team, per Semyanov.</p>
<p>Asked about potential orthopaedics use-cases, Semyanov says Neasty got interested in how the 3D measurements could help with conditions like Pronation/Supination after being contacted by the NFL&#8217;s San Francisco 49ers last year.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;[The 49ers were] interested in whether we could test the newcomers of pronation and supination, because it’s extremely important for future players. Turns out that Pronation is the main factor in injuries in running sports. We were unable to help SF49ers at the time, and never thought of this feature before. We started looking into the topic and after some testing and research we concluded that we actually could make it work,&#8221; he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;If you look at the feet from the side, you could distinguish whether it is pronated or supinated, and we &#8216;look&#8217; at the feet with the camera measuring depth and distance therefore we could teach the algorithm to identify that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is for sure going to be one of a few next developments for Neatsy’s product,&#8221; Semyanov adds. &#8220;We are currently consulting with the orthopediologist and it seems that this is a huge problem not only for professional sportsmen but for everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smartphone cameras are already powering plenty of activity (and investor activity) in the digital health space &#8212; with a number of startups focused on using camera-based tracking to help with musculoskeletal disorders for example (e.g. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/kaia-health-grabs-75m-on-surging-interest-in-its-virtual-therapies-for-chronic-pain-and-copd/">Kaia Health</a>).</p>
<p>Returning to retail use-cases, Semyanov says Neatsy.ai is also considering expanding to support fit for specialist kit such as ski and snowboard equipment &#8212; given that ski shoes tend to be pricey (&#8220;and it’s always painful for people to misunderstand the size&#8221;).</p>
<p>But in the near term he says the focus will be on adding fit recommendations for kids&#8217; shoes, given the size/fit issue can be especially tough for little growing feet.</p>
<p>It does also have ecommerce-related ambitions beyond feet too &#8212; if it can get 3D-scanning to work for other retail use-cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always say that in the future all the sizes or size charts will become obsolete, and only ‘Your Size’ will exist for each customer. With the help of our algorithm, it is gonna happen with the shoes and we’ll see if it could be applied to clothes and eyewear as well,&#8221; he adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.jumo.world/">JUMO</a>, a South Africa- and London-based company that offers financial services to entrepreneurs and businesses in emerging markets, has raised $120 million in a new round of funding led by Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company. The company is now valued at $400 million, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/emerging-markets-loan-start-up-jumo-gets-120m-lift-pzvdcwwmt">according</a> to The Times.</p>
<p>The round, which marks Fidelity’s first investment in an African company, also saw the participation from fintech giant Visa and London-based investment management firm Kingsway Capital. It is also coming a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/south-african-fintech-startup-jumo-raises-second-50m-vc-round/">raising $55 million</a> in a similar unnamed financing round.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In total, JUMO has raised more than $200 million in equity and debt rounds from backers such as Brook Asset Management, Finnfund, Proparco, Leapfrog and Goldman Sachs since founder and CEO <a href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/andrew-watkins-ball-32451996">Andrew Watkins-Ball</a> launched the company in 2015.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230380" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech, which refers to itself as a banking-as-a-service platform, says it uses AI to power financial services, particularly lending in emerging markets where over 1.7 billion people do not have basic access to financial services, 42% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia are unbanked and only 11% of adults are under credit bureau coverage in Africa.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To meet these constraining needs in both markets, JUMO offers core products around savings, credit to customers and businesses, as well as infrastructure to banks, fintechs and eMoney operators. Some partners include MTN, Airtel, Tigo, Ecobank, Absa, Letshego, Mansa Bank and Telenor.</p>
<p>When JUMO raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/jumo-raises-52m-led-by-goldman/">its $52 million</a> in 2018, it opened an office in Singapore to enter Asia, but the company seems to have closed shop there based on information from its statement. Presently, the fintech only states Cape Town, Nairobi, Porto and London as its primary operational and tech hubs.</p>
<p>In terms of active operational markets, though, the fintech is present in six African markets &#8212; Ghana, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Ivory Coast and South Asian country Pakistan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far, JUMO has served loans worth over $3.5 billion to more than 18 million customers across these markets, granting up to 120 million individual loans.</p>
<p>According to the current number of eMoney subscribers on its platform with access to loans, JUMO says it has an opportunity to disburse $29 billion a year. The company adds that this number can grow to $40 billion when it expands to Nigeria and Cameroon in 2022.</p>
<p>The company’s operational costs also strengthen this assertion. JUMO claims to have lowered its costs to $1/customer per year, which gives it some advantage to scale efficiently across a total addressable market of 150 million customers.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Fidelity participation in JUMO’s round continues a growing list of first-time US investors who have made their first checks in African tech this year, especially fintech. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Avenir Growth Capital’s co-lead round in Flutterwave</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/african-fintech-opay-valued-at-2b-in-softbank-vision-fund-2-led-400m-funding/">SoftBank’s backing of Opay</a> come to mind.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s exciting to be part of the wave of US capital being invested in payments and fintech on the continent – there are some great businesses being built and we are proud to play a role supporting capital providers to reach customers with great products,” said Watkins-Ball in a statement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The founder says JUMO is focused on making it easier for capital providers to reach new customers at affordable prices. The six-year-old company also wants to help banks make “predictable returns” by providing a full range of infrastructure and services from core banking to underwriting, KYC (know your customer) and fraud detection services.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2019, the total bank capital and assets under management deployed on JUMO’s platform has increased to 160%, which signifies the platform’s importance to these financial institutions.</p>
<p>Asides from the expansion into Nigeria and Cameroon, JUMO says it will use the investment to improve and increase the number of financial products it offers to small and medium businesses. It also plans to provide longer-term lending options for merchants and bigger businesses.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“JUMO’s lending platform is highly attractive in its ability to scale across markets and drive financial inclusion by creating access to credit for consumers and small businesses,” said Melissa McSherry, the global head of Risk and Identity Services at Visa in a statement. “We are excited about our investment in JUMO and are looking forward to accelerating adoption of JUMO’s platform across markets and delivering on Visa’s mission of helping individuals, businesses, and economies to thrive.”</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The U.S. Department of Commerce asked global semiconductor manufacturers and automakers on 23 September to “voluntarily” fill out a questionnaire about the supply chain pertaining to their chip inventory, sales, orders, customers’ information and more.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We have other tools in our toolbox that require them to give us data. I hope we don’t get there.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BrightChamps, an Indian edtech startup that is attempting to bridge the learning gap left by K12 schools, said on Monday it has raised $51 million in a new financing round and $63 million since launching a year ago as the Goa-headquartered firm looks to expand its footprints in over 10 nations.</p>
<p>The startup, which is valued at nearly $500 million in the new financing round led by Premji Invest (the private investment office of technology billionaire Azim Premji), teaches kids programming and other skills in over 10 markets including several in Southeast Asia, as well as the U.S., and Canada, <a href="https://brightchamps.com">BrightChamps</a> co-founder and chief executive Ravi Bhushan told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Bhushan, who was homeschooled and previously served as the chief technology and product officer at property portal PropTiger, said schools across the world are failing to teach kids several important life skills. &#8220;It&#8217;s not an India problem. Schools across the globe are teaching kids how to change the style of text in Microsoft Word in the name of technology,&#8221; he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230320" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup &#8212; which has amassed over a hundred thousand registered students, and achieved profitability &#8212; is &#8220;building a &#8216;weapon of mass instruction&#8217; and is leading the disruptive wave which will make India one of the largest exporters of transformative digital education,&#8221; said Deborah Quazo, Managing partner at GSV Ventures, in a statement. TechCrunch reported in July that BrightChamps was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">engaging with investors</a> to raise money at over $500 million valuation.</p>
<p>Over a thousand teachers across the globe have joined BrightChamps to teach kids, Bhushan said. &#8220;Children have the option to learn skills in any local language they prefer,&#8221; he said, adding that the startup is working to expand its offerings. It will soon add financial literacy to its curriculum, he said.</p>
<p>Bhushan said the startup&#8217;s growth has been completely organic so far and it has not used any money raised from the investors. &#8220;We are growing solely with the money we have earned from our customers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>BrightChamps has been one of the most talked startups in India in the past one year and has already been approached by one of the largest edtech giants in the country with a buyout offer, TechCrunch has learned.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, which spoke for the first time last week after TechCrunch approached it to confirm the funding round, said it intended to announce its offerings and earlier financing round last year, but decided against it because it didn&#8217;t want to celebrate a milestone at a time when the home nation was trying to fight the pandemic.</p>
<p>Bhushan declined to comment on any acquisition offer BrightChamps has received, but said he is building the startup with a very long-term vision and is not looking to make short-term transactions. &#8220;Education, as you can tell, has been my passion since the childhood. I am here to build an iconic brand,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a significant whitespace in the category in which BrightChamps operates, he said, when asked how the startup plans to deploy the fresh funds. &#8220;One area is the potential of kids learning from each other. We have done experiments around it. So we are going to launch a peer-to-peer experience,&#8221; he said, adding that eventually the startup wants to build a platform like Stack Overflow for kids. &#8220;We are also looking to host olympiads and tech hackathons,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>BrightChamps is also exploring opportunities to acquire some firms that share its mission and sensibilities, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In less than a year after inception Brightchamps has established itself as one of the fastest growing Ed tech companies in the markets that it serves . Leveraging Human Resources globally to deliver personalised experiences, along with an unique ability to hyper differentiate learning pathways, Brightchamps is on the path to proving that the power of data and learning can be combined for differentiated outcomes,” said T Kurien, Managing Partner of Premji Invest, in a statement.</p>
