										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.merge.dev/">Merge</a>, a startup that helps its users build customer-facing integrations with third-party tools, today announced that it has raised a $4.5 million seed round led by NEA. Additional angel investors include former MuleSoft CEO Greg Schott, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince, Expanse co-founders Tim Junio and Matt Kraning, and Jumpstart CEO Ben Herman.</p>
<p>Launched in 2020, the core focus of Merge is to give B2B companies a unified API to access data from what is currently about 40 HR, payroll, recruiting and accounting platforms, with plans for expanding to additional areas soon. But Merge co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shensiding/">Shensi Ding</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilfeig/">Gil Feig</a>, who have been lifelong friends and previously worked at companies like Expanse and Jumpstart, stress that the service isn&#8217;t aiming to replace workflow tools like MuleSoft or Jumpstart.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152875" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152875" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2152875" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="751" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg?resize=768,563 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg?resize=680,499 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg?resize=1536,1126 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg?resize=2048,1502 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2152875" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Merge</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;What we built is more similar to Plaid than MuleSoft or other things,&#8221; Feig said. &#8220;We built a unified API, so we&#8217;re fully embedded in a customer&#8217;s product and they build one integration with us and can automatically offer all these integrations to their customers. On top of that, we offer what we call integrations management, which is a suite of tools to automatically detect issues where the customer would have to get involved &#8212; automatically detect that stuff and handle it without ever having to involve engineering again.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Merge&#8217;s systems detect issues with an integration, maybe because a data schema in an API response has changed without notice (which happens with some regularity), Merge&#8217;s engineers can fix that within minutes, in part because the teams also built an internal no-code tool for building and managing these integrations. Over time, it may offer those internal tools to external users as well, but that&#8217;s still a while out, the team tells me.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152874" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152874" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2152874" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="750" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg?resize=768,562 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg?resize=680,498 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg?resize=1536,1124 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg?resize=2048,1499 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2152874" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Merge</p></div></p>
<p>As Ding also noted, B2B buyers today also simply expect their tools to feature integrations with the service they use. &#8220;Companies, when they purchase a vendor, they expect that vendor to have integrations with all the other vendors that they own,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They don&#8217;t want to have to purchase a vendor and then purchase a workflow product and then connect those products.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while Merge&#8217;s focus right now is squarely on a few verticals, the plan is to expand this to far more areas shortly, likely starting with CRM. &#8220;Salesforce has a pretty large market share, so we thought that it wasn&#8217;t going to be as interesting of a market,&#8221; Ding said. &#8220;But it turns out that their API is so complex that customers would still prefer to integrate with us instead if we simplify it for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ding and Feig tell me the company, which came out of stealth about two months ago, already has about 100 organizations on its platform, varying from seed-stage companies to publicly listed enterprises. The team credits its focus on security and reliability (and its SOC II compliance) with being able to bring on some of these larger companies despite being a seed-stage company itself.</p>
<p>To monetize the service, Merge offers a free tier (up to 10,000 API requests per month) and charges $0.01 per API request for additional usage. Unsurprisingly, the company also offers customized enterprise plans for its larger customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The time and expense associated with building and maintaining myriad API integrations is a pain point we hear about consistently from our portfolio companies across all industries,&#8221; said NEA managing general partner Scott Sandell, who will join the company&#8217;s board. &#8220;Merge is tackling this ubiquitous problem head-on via their easy-to-use, unified API platform. Their platform has broad applicability and is a massive upgrade for any software company that needs to build, manage, and maintain multiple API integrations.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Art </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agrawal was growing up in India, a car ride was a rare treat, and car ownership was a dream. When he moved to the U.S. and bought his first car, he was shocked by how much it cost and how difficult it was to maintain a car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2012, he co-founded a company called YourMechanic that provides on-demand </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">automotive mobile maintenance and repair services. Over the years, the challenge of helping consumers more easily find car insurance was in the back of his mind. So in 2017, he teamed up with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lina Zhang</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Musawir Shah</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to found Jerry, a mobile-first car ownership “super app.” The Palo Alto-based startup launched an AI/ML-powered car insurance comparison service in January 2019. It has quietly since amassed nearly 1 million customers across the United States as a licensed insurance broker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today as a consumer, you have to go to multiple different places to deal with different things,” Argawal said. “Jerry is out to change that.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now today, <a href="http://getjerry.com">Jerry</a> is announcing that it has raised more than $57 million in funding, including a new $28 million Series B round led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodwater Capital. A group of angel investors also participated in the round include Greenlight president Johnson Cook and Greenlight CEO Timothy Sheehan; Tekion CEO Jay Vijayan; Jon McNeill, CEO of DVx Ventures and former president of Tesla and ex-COO of Lyft; Brandon Krieg, CEO of Stash and Ed Robinson, co-founder and president of Stash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Argawal says Jerry is different from other auto-related marketplaces out there in that it aims to help consumers with various aspects of car ownership (from repair to maintenance to insurance to warranties), rather than just one. Although for now it is mostly focused on insurance, it plans to use its new capital to move into other categories of car ownership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also believes it is set apart from competitors in that it doesn’t refer a consumer to an insurance carrier’s site so that they still have to do the work of signing up with them separately, for example. Rather, Jerry uses automation to give consumers customized quotes from more than 45 insurance carriers “in 45 seconds.” The consumers can then sign on to the new carrier via Jerry, which would even cancel former policies on their behalf.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With Jerry, you can complete the whole transaction in our app,” Argawal said. “We don’t send you to another site. You don’t have to fill out a bunch of forms. You just give us some information, and we’ll instantly provide you with quotes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its customers save on average about $800 a year on car insurance, the company claims. Jerry also offers a similar offering for home insurance but its focus is on car ownership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company must be doing something right. In 2020, Jerry saw its revenue surge by “10x.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some context, Jerry sold a few million dollars of insurance in 2019, according to Argawal. This year, he said, the company is on track to do “three to four times” more than last year’s numbers.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no other automated way to compare and buy car insurance, because all the APIs are not easily accessible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What we have done is we have automated the end to end journey for the consumer using our infrastructure, which will only scale over time.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerry makes recurring revenue from earning a percentage of the premium when a consumer purchases a policy on its site from carriers such as Progressive.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the marketplaces are lead-gen. A very small percent of their revenue is reoccurring,&#8221; Argawal said. &#8220;For us, it&#8217;s 100% of our revenues.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodwater Capital’s Chi-Hua Chien notes that the insurance space has historically been a very challenging category from a customer experience perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They took something that has historically been painful, intimidating and difficult for the customer and made it effortless,” he told TechCrunch. “That experience will more broadly over time apply to comparison shopping and maintenance, too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chien said he was also drawn to the category itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a competitive category because 100% of drivers need to have auto insurance 100% of the time,” he said. “That’s a large market that’s not going to go away. And since Jerry is powered by AI, it will only serve customers better over time, and just grow faster.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The countdown to this IPO filing has been ticking for several quarters, so seeing the document drop on a Monday morning was just good fun.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At long last, the Monday.com crew dropped <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1845338/000110465921067423/tm211978-4_f1.htm">an F-1 filing</a> to go public in the United States. TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/02/kicking-off-2020-with-4-new-members-of-the-100m-arr-club/">long known</a> that the company, which sells corporate productivity and communications software, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/monday-com-surpassed-130m-arr-before-the-remote-work-boom/">scaled north of $100 million</a> in annual recurring revenue (ARR).</p>
<p>The countdown to its IPO filing &#8212; an F-1, because the company is based in Israel, rather than the S-1s filed by domestic companies &#8212; has been ticking for several quarters, so seeing Monday.com drop the document on this Monday morning was just good fun.</p>

<p>The Exchange has been riffling through the document since it came out, and we&#8217;ve picked up on a few things to explore. We&#8217;ll start by looking at the company&#8217;s revenue growth on a historical basis to see if it has accelerated in recent quarters thanks to the pandemic. Then, we&#8217;ll turn to profitability, cash burn, share-based compensation expenses and product vision.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a lot to chew through, so no more dilly-dallying. Into the numbers!</p>
<p>As always, we&#8217;re starting with revenue growth because it&#8217;s still the single most important thing about any venture-backed company.</p>
<h2>Revenue adds are accelerating</h2>
<p>This is great news for the startup, its employees and its investors. From 2019 to 2020, Monday.com grew its revenues from $78.1 million to $161.1 million, or 106%.</p>
<p>From Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, the company&#8217;s revenues grew from $31.9 million to $59.0 million. That&#8217;s about 85% growth. So, by what measure do we mean that the company&#8217;s revenue growth is accelerating? Its sequential-quarter revenue growth is picking up. Observe the following:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152833" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152833" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2152833 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-17-at-9.58.13-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="283" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-17-at-9.58.13-AM.png 733w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-17-at-9.58.13-AM.png?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-17-at-9.58.13-AM.png?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-17-at-9.58.13-AM.png?resize=680,283 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-17-at-9.58.13-AM.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2152833" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Monday.com F-1 filing</p></div></p>
<p>From Q2 2019 to Q3 2019, the company added around $4 million in revenue. From Q2 2020 to Q3 2020, that number was $6.1 million. More recently, the company&#8217;s revenue added $7.6 million from Q3 2020 to Q4 2020, which accelerated to $8.8 million from the final quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021. Of course, from an ever-larger base, the company&#8217;s growth rate may decline. But the super-clean and obvious <em>expanding</em> sequential revenue gains at the company are solid.</p>
<p>The fact that it added so much top line in recent quarters also helps explain why Monday.com is going public now. Sure, the markets are still near record highs and the pandemic is fading, but just look at that consistent growth! It&#8217;s investor catnip.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hello and welcome back to The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a crypto-meets-transportation story for you before we move onto the rest of the news.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Just weeks after Tesla CEO Elon Musk and CFO Zach Kirkhorn said they believe in the longevity of bitcoin, the company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-technoking-of-tesla-orders-a-halt-to-bitcoin-car-payments/">changed its stance</a>. Musk, who has dubbed himself Technoking, tweeted that Tesla has suspended purchases of its electric vehicles with the cryptocurrency because of its concern about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal.</p>
<p>The tweet from Musk sent the price of bitcoin down. Ah, but wait, the crazy hijinks were just getting started. Musk&#8217;s tweet was clear that while bitcoin was out, other cryptocurrencies were in. &#8220;We are also looking at other cryptocurrencies that use &lt;1% of Bitcoin&#8217;s energy/transaction,&#8221; the tweet said. Anyone who has followed Musk&#8217;s cheerleading of Dogecoin could have predicted what would come next. On May 13, Musk tweeted &#8220;Working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising.&#8221;</p>
<p>So there you have it. Perhaps, Dogecoin — which Musk jokingly called a hustle on SNL — will soon be Tesla&#8217;s crypto of choice.</p>

<p>The big micromobility news of the past week is that <strong>Bird</strong>, the shared electric scooter startup that&#8217;s scootin&#8217; around in over 200 cities across three continents, is going public via a SPAC. Bird is merging with blank-check company Switchback II in an attempt to get cash fast and achieve profitability by 2023, confirming earlier reports from dot.LA after the website had gotten its hands on Bird&#8217;s investor pitch deck.</p>
<p>Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company will lead the deal&#8217;s $160 million in private investment in public equity, with Apollo Investment Corp. and MidCap Financial Trust chucking in another $40 million in asset financing.</p>
<p>The SPAC deck reveals that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">Bird lost $387.5 million</a> in 2019 and $208.2 million in 2020, even as it laid off 400 people in 2020. As a company with a huge cost structure and unprofitable revenue, which was made more unprofitable as the pandemic took its toll, Bird really needs this deal to work. Shifting business models may be just the thing. Buying up scooter fleets and deploying them around the world is simply too costly to work. Its move to go &#8220;franchise&#8221; and get other smaller companies to build fleets under its brand name during the pandemic generated 94% of its &#8220;sharing&#8221; revenue in the second half of 2020. So maybe there&#8217;s hope for the company after all. It&#8217;ll certainly need it if it intends to sustain its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/bird-to-spend-150-million-on-european-expansion-plan/">expansion into Europe</a> in the coming years.</p>
<h3>Speaking of expansion &#8230;</h3>
<p>Singapore&#8217;s Neuron Mobility, the e-scooter sharing company that&#8217;s taken off in Australia and New Zealand, has announced plans to expand its reach deeper into the Commonwealth. Neuron recently won a contract to operate in Ottawa, so it&#8217;ll be heading to Canada in the coming month, with more cities in the country to come, according to the company. The company will give out free monthly passes to eligible Public Health and Emergency Service workers in the Canadian capital.</p>
<h3>Meanwhile in Africa</h3>
<p>Uganda-based, two-wheel ride-hailing platform SafeBoda announced that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/the-motorcycle-ride-hailing-wars-in-nigeria-and-uganda-is-safebodas-to-lose/">completed 1 million rides</a> in the Nigerian city of Ibadan. For reference, boda-bodas in Uganda, or okadas in Nigeria, are local motorcycle taxis, so SafeBoda is disrupting this offline market while also leading ahead of the big guns like uberBODA and Bolt boda. Given the money and reputation behind Uber and Bolt, it&#8217;s somewhat surprising, and heartening, to see SafeBoda outstripping its competition. The company completes about 80,000 rides a day in Uganda, and Uber and Bolt only complete about 10,000 rides in the country.</p>
<h3>New product roundup</h3>
<p>Stromer&#8217;s new e-bike, the <a href="https://www.stromerbike.com/en/models/st2">ST2 S-Pedelec</a> comes at a steep price of $5,699, but it&#8217;s got some serious power behind it. With a 750-watt rear-wheel CYRO motor and a 618kWh battery, it can go up to 28 mph and up to 75 miles in range. If someone steals the bike, 3G and Bluetooth connection has got you covered with GPS localization and Smartlock. Comes in sport or comfort frames in royal blue or dark grey.</p>
<p>Razor scooter, those iconic early 2000s silver fold-up legends, has unveiled its new RipStik Rush, the electric RipStik 2.0. Sportier riders who like to flex their moves will love this scooter because the back end of the board allows you to fishtail, carve and drift like you would with a snowboard or wakeboard, according to the company. Razor will also be bringing their C25 e-scooter, which is more geared towards the daily commuter, to retail this summer.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Last year, we saw nearly two dozen transportation startups go public via a merger with special purpose acquisition companies. Most of those were electric vehicle and lidar companies. This year, we are starting to see other transportation-related companies, including autonomous trucking startup TuSimple and now <strong>Plus AI</strong>.</p>
<p>Plus announced this week plans to merge with Hennessy Capital Investment Corp. V in a transaction with a post-combination valuation of $3.3 billion. Plus is expected to trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol &#8220;PLAV.&#8221; The transaction is supported by $150 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from funds and accounts managed by BlackRock and the D. E. Shaw Group.</p>
<p>The company said the capital provided by the public market will help it begin mass production of its so-called PlusDrive autonomous vehicle platform in 2021 with heavy-truck manufacturer FAW. Plus is also working with IVECO to jointly develop autonomous trucks that will be deployed across China, Europe and other geographies, the company said.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clarios</strong>, the Wisconsin-based battery maker that was acquired by Brookfield Asset Management in 2019, filed confidentially for an IPO, <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/brookfield-is-said-to-pick-bofa-jpmorgan-for-clarios-ipo">Bloomberg reported</a>. Brookfield is reportedly is seeking to have the portfolio company valued at more than $20 billion in an IPO.</p>
<p><strong>ForU Worldwide</strong>, the Chinese freight-as-a-service transportation platform, filed for a<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849633/000119312521160307/d935463df1.htm"> $100 million IPO</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Innovusion</strong>, a five-year-old lidar company and a supplier to Chinese electric car upstart Nio, just landed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/innovusion-64-millions-series-b/">Series B funding round of $64 million</a>. The new proceeds boost its total investment to more than $100 million. As TechCrunch&#8217;s Rita Liao notes, this is not a small amount, but the startup is in a race crowded with much bigger players that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars, like Velodyne and Luminar. Temasek, the Singaporean government&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund, led Innovusion&#8217;s latest financing round. Other investors included Bertelsmann Asia Investment Fund, Joy Capital, Nio Capital, Eight Roads Ventures, and F-Prime Capital.</p>
<p><strong>Telkomsel</strong>, a unit of Indonesia&#8217;s largest telecom operator Telkom, invested an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/telkomsel-invests-an-additional-300-million-in-gojek/">additional $300 million</a> in ride-hailing and payments firm Gojek. The investment comes just months after the network provider wrote a $150 million check to the Southeast Asian firm. The announcement comes amid Gojek working to seal a proposed merger with e-commerce platform Tokopedia. The $18 billion deal would result in a new entity called GoTo, according to media reports. Telkomsel&#8217;s investment today likely makes it one of GoTo&#8217;s top eight investors.</p>
<p><strong>WeRide</strong>, the Chinese autonomous driving company, said it has achieved its Series C funding round that brings its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/chinas-weride-secures-more-funding-pushing-valuation-to-3-3-billion/">post-money valuation to $3 billion</a>. The round, which WeRide declined to provide details on beyond saying that it is in &#8220;the hundreds of millions,&#8221; comes  four months after securing Series B fundraising of $310 million. WeRide intends to use this funding round to invest in R&amp;D and commercialization as it works toward the next-generation of Level 4 driving, a term that means a vehicle can drive without human intervention in some environments and conditions. The company is also using the funds to prepare to commercialize its technology.</p>
<h2>Waymo: Executive exits and construction cones</h2>

<p>Waymo&#8217;s PR team most certainly had a busy week.</p>
<p>First up, is an article from me on the departure of Waymo&#8217;s chief financial officer Ger Dwyer and its head of automotive partnerships and corporate development Adam Frost &#8212; two longtime executives at the autonomous vehicle company.</p>
<p>The exits come amid some executive shuffling following CEO John Krafcik&#8217;s exit earlier this year. Krafcik announced in April that he was stepping down as CEO. Chief Safety Officer Deborah Hersman left in December and Tim Willis, who was head of manufacturing and global supply and general manager of Waymo&#8217;s Laser Bear lidar business, departed in February. Sherry House, who had been at Waymo since 2017 and was most recently treasurer and head of investor relations, left the company in April. She is now CFO at Lucid Motors.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/waymos-cfo-and-head-of-automotive-partnerships-are-leaving-the-autonomous-vehicle-company/">I noted in my article</a>, some of the critical leaders, and the people directly below them, have remained. Tekedra Mawakana, who was COO, and Dmitri Dolgov, the CTO, are now co-CEOs of Waymo. Department heads directly below Mawakana and Dolgov are still at Waymo with a few exceptions, according to LinkedIn profiles. In March, both David Twohig, who was director of Future Automotive at Waymo, and Qi Hommes, who was once head of system safety, left. Hommes is now director of system safety engineering and analysis at Zoox, according to LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Changes at the top oftentimes cause a ripple effect of shuffling positions and even exits. Expect more in the weeks and months to come.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a <a href="https://youtu.be/zdKCQKBvH-A">video was released</a> by a regular user of the company&#8217;s Waymo One ride-hailing service, which uses a mix of driverless vehicles and those with a safety operator behind the wheel. This individual captured the entire trip, which devolved into a suboptimal situation when the vehicle entered into a work zone with construction cones. The vehicle became confused and essentially paralyzed. Waymo then stepped in remotely to send path planning instructions, but then sent incorrect guidance, which compounded the problem. Eventually, a roadside assistance team physically arrived and completed the trip.</p>
<p>The incident is a reminder of how much work still needs to be done in autonomous vehicles. It also illustrates just how many humans it takes to support one driverless vehicle on the road. Expect more incidents like this across the industry. On a side note, rival Cruise <a href="https://twitter.com/Cruise/status/1393302375994064896?s=20">tweeted out a video</a> showing its vehicle navigating a construction zone. I&#8217;m sure the timing was completely coincidental.</p>
<h2>Policy corner<a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2037863 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png" alt="the-station-delivery" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></h2>
<p>I&#8217;m back with more policy news. This week, let&#8217;s kick things off with the U.S. Postal Service.</p>
<p>You might remember that in February, the U.S. Postal Service awarded a multi-billion dollar contract to OshKosh Corp. to replace between 50,000 to 165,000 aging trucks with a mix of diesel and electric powertrain delivery vehicles over the next 10 years. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy later specified to Congress that only around 10% of those new delivery trucks would be electric, a number that many in Washington and beyond argued was not high enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lack of commitment from the USPS to electrify its fleet directly contradicts the Biden administration&#8217;s goals and executive order to clean up pollution from the US government&#8217;s vehicles,&#8221; said Gina Coplon-Newfield, the director of the Sierra Club&#8217;s Clean Transportation for All campaign.</p>
<p>Now, House lawmakers are <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3077?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22HR+3077%22%5D%7D&amp;s=6&amp;r=1">advancing a bill</a> that would, in part, authorize an additional $8 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to switch to electric vehicles. The language adding the funds was tacked onto a bill to improve mailed ballot tracking. Given that President Joe Biden said back in January that he is committed to replacing the federal government&#8217;s fleet of around 650,000 vehicles with electric models, it was definitely more than a little odd that USPS picked a mixed diesel-electric bid less than one month later.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Washington state Governor Jay Inslee vetoed a <a href="http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Amendments/Senate/1287-S2.E%20AMS%20ENGR%20S2584.E.pdf">section of a bill</a> that would have phased out the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles starting from model year 2030. This would have been the first time a state mandated all-electric auto sales via legislation, instead of executive order. Of states that have ICE phase outs in place &#8212; California and Massachusetts &#8212; both were established via orders signed by their respective governors and start in 2035.</p>

<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Volkswagen Group</strong> and <strong>Argo AI</strong>, which is supplying the company with a self-driving system that will allow it to commercially transport people and goods by 2025, provided an update this past week. Much of the briefing covered old ground. But there were a few new details, notably that testing will begin on <span lang="EN-US">European roads later this year, which builds on initial work completed at a test track that was established next to the Munich airport.</span></p>
<h3>In-car tech</h3>
<p><strong>Ford Motor</strong> is beefing up its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/ford-is-bringing-significant-wireless-software-updates-to-its-vehicles/">in-vehicle software offerings</a> with built-in Alexa voice assistant and a wireless software update ecosystem. Ford&#8217;s over-the-air software updates, which it has branded Power-Up, will have the capability of updating &#8220;virtually all&#8221; of the computer modules in new Ford vehicles, not just the ones that focus on infotainment, the company said in a statement Thursday. Ford estimates that Power-Up will be able to update more than 80 computer modules on higher-end models. The automaker aims to manufacture 33 million vehicles equipped with this service and Alexa by 2028.</p>
<h3>Delivery</h3>
<p><strong>The Information&#8217;s</strong> Paris Martineau spent five months investigating <strong>Amazon</strong> and the more than <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-deadly-toll-of-amazons-trucking-boom">50 serious crashes</a> involving its semi-trucks used over the last three years.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong>, <strong>Canoo</strong>, <strong>Fisker</strong>, <strong>Lordstown Motors</strong> and <strong>Nikola Corp</strong> were flying high when they went public through mergers with special purpose acquisition companies. A <a href="https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/ev-startups-lose-more-40-billion-after-going-public">Bloomberg report</a> found these five companies were worth $60 billion when they first went public. But the last few months have delivered some harsh lessons. Three of the companies plunged to new lows this week as short-seller attacks, management turmoil and execution issues led investors to reconsider their prospects. They&#8217;ve lost more than $40 billion of market capitalization combined from their respective peaks.</p>
<p><strong>California</strong> <strong>Gov. Gavin Newsom </strong>debuted a new proposal that earmarks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/california-gov-newsom-proposes-3-2b-in-ev-investment-as-part-of-economic-recovery-package/">$3.2 billion to boost EV infrastructure and adoption</a> in the state. Under the proposal, over half of the $3.2 billion budget would go toward replacing 1,150 trucks, 1,000 transit buses and 1,000 school buses with electric models. Another $800 million would be put toward the state&#8217;s Clean Cars 4 All program, which aims to help lower-income drivers upgrade to a zero- or near-zero car, as well as further rebates or clean vehicles. The proposal earmarks $500 million toward infrastructure and $250 million would go toward manufacturing grants. Newsom did not specify what type of infrastructure programs would qualify; it&#8217;s likely those funds would go toward charging.</p>
<p><strong>Fisker</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/fisker-and-foxconn-sign-deal-to-build-electric-vehicles/">signed an agreement</a> with Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that assembles iPhones, to co-develop and manufacture a new electric vehicle. Production on the car, which will be sold under the Fisker brand name in North America, Europe, China and India, will begin in the U.S. by the end of 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Ford </strong>and<strong> BMW </strong>have each appointed members to the board of Solid Power, the solid state battery company that recently raised $130 million in a Series B round. Ford picked Ted Miller, manager of electrification subsystems and power supply research, and BMW chose Rainer Feurer, a senior vice president of corporate investments.</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong> also confirmed this week that its all-electric pickup truck will be named the F-150 Lightning, resurrecting a name that once donned the SVT F-150 in the 1990s. The company hasn&#8217;t said much about the powertrain, range or other specs. However, Ford President and CEO Jim Farley provided new details about the electric pickup that is coming to market next year. Most notably, it seems that the battery on the Ford F-150 Lightning will have the ability to power a home during an outage. Ford has touted the capability of its Hybrid F-150 to power a job site or tools, but this is the first time the company has said one of its vehicles could act as a backup generator to a home.</p>
<p><strong>Harley-Davidson</strong> has spun out its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/harley-davidson-spins-out-livewire-into-a-standalone-electric-motorcycle-brand/">LiveWire electric motorcycle</a> as a standalone brand, complete with a new logo and brand identity. The company first unveiled the LiveWire electric motorcycle in 2018 with a listing price of $29,799, placing it on the higher end for motorcycles. It went into production the following year, with some bumps, including a brief halt to production due to a charging-related problem on one of the motorcycles. The &#8220;first LiveWire-branded motorcycle&#8221; will launch on July 8. Its public debut will come a day later at the International Motorcycle Show.</p>
<p><strong>Hyundai Motor Group</strong> said it will invest $7.4 billion in the U.S. by 2025 — money that will be used to produce future electric vehicles, improve production facilities and develop what the automaker describes as smart mobility solutions. The company is also going to invest in improving electrification and hydrogen energy.</p>
<p><strong>Subaru</strong> announced new details about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/subaru-solterra-ev-2022/">its first-ever EV</a>, which is set to hit the market in 2022. Subaru will call its first EV the Solterra, a fitting name for a brand synonymous with outdoor adventures and you know, the sun and the Earth. Subaru&#8217;s first full-fledged EV will be an SUV that ships with the manufacturer&#8217;s well-regarded all-wheel-drive capabilities. The Solterra is built on a new platform the company is developing in partnership with <strong>Toyota</strong>, which the latter company will use for its bZ4X crossover.</p>
<p><strong>Ultium Cells LLC</strong>, a joint venture between General Motors and LG Chem, has executed an agreement with Canadian company Li-Cycle to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/gm-and-lg-chems-ultium-cells-partners-with-li-cycle-to-process-manufacturing-waste/">recycle critical materials</a> from the scrap produced from Ultium&#8217;s manufacturing processes from its Lordstown plant, starting later in 2021. The materials from the Lordstown location will be sent to Li-Cycle&#8217;s recycling location in Rochester, New York, to be processed and returned to the battery supply chain.</p>
<h3>Hydrogen</h3>
<p><strong>Toyota</strong> tapped Japanese company <strong>ENEOS</strong> to help develop the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/toyota-partners-with-eneos-to-explore-a-hydrogen-powered-woven-city/">hydrogen fuel cell system</a> that will power its futuristic prototype city Woven City. The vision for the 175-acre city, where people will live and work amongst all of Toyota&#8217;s projects, including its autonomous e-Palette shuttles and robots, is to build a fully connected ecosystem powered by hydrogen fuel cells. ENEOS, a Japanese petroleum company that&#8217;s investing heavily into hydrogen, will help make Toyota&#8217;s &#8220;human-centered&#8221; city of the future. This new partnership not only signifies Toyota&#8217;s backing of hydrogen over electric, but it also could help Japan achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.</p>
<h3>Studies</h3>
<p>Global consulting firm <strong>AlixPartners </strong>forecasts that the ongoing semiconductor shortage will cost automakers globally $110 billion in lost revenues this year, up from the firm&#8217;s estimate in late January of $61 billion. In total, the firm is now forecasting that production of 3.9 million vehicles in total will be lost in 2021. The pandemic-induced shortage has been compounded by a fire in a key chip-making fabrication plant, severe weather in Texas and a drought in Taiwan, according to Mark Wakefield, global co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners.</p>
<p>This problem isn&#8217;t going away either. There are up to 1,400 chips in a typical vehicle today. The rise in consumer electronics, which the majority of the chip supply goes towards, continues to put pressure on the automotive industry. There has always been a need for supply chain resiliency. But now, there is a broader push from the industry and governments to shore up the supply chain for the long term.</p>
<p><strong>Nexar</strong>, a company that makes an AI-based dashcam app to monitor road safety, put 36 vehicles on the streets of Milan in February. While driving around, the company collected images from dash cams and AI to map on-street parking spots and documented <a href="https://data.getnexar.com/solution/parking/">262,163 free street parking spots</a> in a month. This interesting nugget of information is part of a wider study conducted by Nexar to better understand how curbsides are used.</p>
<p>Nexar said the free parking spot identification along with the creation of a crowd-sourced map of such data was accomplished using vision (and specifically car camera vision). One of the goals, the company said, was to demonstrate that vision data can replicate the human understanding of what a parking spot is.</p>
<h2>Events and opportunities</h2>
<p>There are a number of events coming up — and not just TC Sessions: Mobility 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Ford Motor</strong> will hosts its Capital Markets Day on May 26. A webcast will open at 9:15 a.m. EDT and the event will start promptly at 9:30 a.m. EDT. After the presentation, CEO Jim Farley and CFO John Lawler along with other Ford executives host a question-and-answer session with the analyst community. You can <a href="http://www.shareholder.ford.com">check it out here.</a></p>
<p>The <strong>Petersen Automotive Museum</strong> is launching a new three-month incubator program that is focused on women-led businesses in the automotive sector. Each year, the museum will choose one California-based startup with five or fewer employees and provide them with hands-on mentorship, access to the Petersen network of sponsors and partners, and a $25,000 to $30,000 investment. Applications are reviewed by the program&#8217;s selection committee. Once accepted, the startup will work alongside the Petersen&#8217;s mentorship team to develop a custom program that addresses its business goals. Applications are being accepted now through July 31, 2021. <a href="https://www.petersen.org/business-incubator-program">Click here to</a> apply.</p>
<p><strong>Self Racing Cars</strong> is scheduled for October 16 to 17 2021 at Thunderhill Raceway. If you&#8217;re not familiar, the event is organized each year by Joshua Schachter. The event is an autonomous racing series that has a hobbyist-maker vibe. It&#8217;s as much about tinkering and troubleshooting as it is about going around the track.</p>
<p>While there are different teams, it is a decidedly collaborative environment. I&#8217;ll never forget the first year that Schachter hosted the event. It was here that I first met and befriended AlexRoy, now one of my co-hosts on the Autonocast podcast. It&#8217;s where George Hotz of Comma.ai finally got his vehicle around the track (Alex and I in the backseat) and won the competition. And it was where I was introduced to a young and then unknown guy named Austin Russell who was working in stealth on what we would all eventually learn was a lidar company called Luminar.</p>
<p>Check the website <a href="http://selfracingcars.com/">for more information</a> and to sign up to participate. Right now, it looks like Nvidia is signed up and that list will likely grow in the coming months. And I hope to see you all there in the fall.</p>
<p><strong>TC Sessions: Mobility 2021! </strong>The June 9 event is right around the corner and I hope you&#8217;ll all be there. The agenda is packed for this one-day virtual event. You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/announcing-the-agenda-for-tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">check out the agenda here</a>.</p>
<p>A few highlights:</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have a panel on self-driving deliveries with <strong>Starship Technologies</strong> co-founder and CEO and CTO <strong>Ahti Heinla</strong>, <strong>Amy Jones Satrom</strong>, who heads operations at <strong>Nuro </strong>and <strong>Gatik</strong> co-founder and CTO <strong>Apeksha Kumavat</strong>. We&#8217;ll have one-on-one interviews with <strong>Pam Fletcher, </strong>who is leading innovation efforts at <strong>GM</strong> as well as <strong>Rimac Automobili</strong> founder and CEO <strong>Mate Rimac</strong>, <strong>Scale AI</strong> co-founder and CEO <strong>Alex Wang </strong>and <strong>Zoox</strong> co-founder and CTO <strong>Jesse Levinson</strong>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have investors, of course, including one panel with <strong>Clara Brenner</strong> of <strong>Urban Innovation Fund</strong>, <strong>Quin Garcia</strong> of <strong>Autotech Ventures</strong> and <strong>Rachel Holt</strong> of <strong>Construct Capital. </strong>Then there&#8217;s investor and LinkedIn founder <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong>, whose SPAC merged with Joby Aviation. Hoffman and Joby founder and CEO <strong>JoeBen Bevirt </strong>will come together to talk about what lies ahead. We also plan to bring together community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer <strong>Tamika L. Butler</strong>, Remix co-founder and CEO <strong>Tiffany Chu</strong> and Revel co-founder and CEO <strong>Frank Reig </strong>to talk about equity, accessibility and shared mobility in cities.</p>
<p>One other panel we haven&#8217;t promoted yet will focus on China and robotaxis. The panel is bringing together <strong>Jennifer Li</strong>, vice president of finance at <strong>WeRide</strong>, <strong>Jewel Li</strong> who is COO of <strong>AutoX</strong>, and<strong> Huan Sun</strong>, who heads up<strong> Momenta Europe. </strong>These executives, from three leading Chinese robotaxi companies (that also have operations in Europe or the U.S.) will join us to provide insight into the unique challenges of developing and deploying the technology in China and how it compares to other countries.</p>
<p>And there is more. Have a question for any of these folks? Email me; I want to hear from you! And remember some of the panels will have a live question-and-answer period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After seven years at Google, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacquelle?originalSubdomain=ch">Jacquelle Amankonah Horton</a> knew there was a white space in social between fans and creators. She built <a href="https://www.faveforfans.com/">Fave</a> to fill in that gap, and the company today announced the close of a $2.2 million seed round.</p>
<p>Female Founders Fund, HYBE, Sony Music, Warner Music, Concord Music, Quality Control, Right Hand Management, Techstars Music and Betaworks all participated in the round.</p>
<p>Fave is all about the relationship between fans and creators. As Horton describes it, creators and artists have a variety of ways they can reach out to their fans and share their lives, but for the super fans out there, there is no way to truly express their adoration beyond the flat experience of commenting on an Instagram post or liking a tweet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fave is broken down by fandoms (starting with Swifties/Taylor Swift), allowing allows fans to connect with one another, create content, and buy and sell fan-themed merchandise and artwork to one another. Fave&#8217;s go-to-market is focused on the fans themselves, though the hope is to also bring creators on to the platform, which ultimately gives them another revenue stream.</p>
<p>Creators and Fave alike can generate revenue through advertising or through a transaction fee on goods sold through the marketplace. Fave takes a 10 percent cut on all transactions, whether sold by the creator or a fan.</p>
<p>Alongside the announcement of the funding, Fave is also launching into public beta.</p>
<p>Horton explained to TechCrunch that one tactic for the company is to engage with the top influencers for each respective fandom. Across fan communities, there are people who are relatively well-known as the top fans, sharing content and often getting recognized by the creator.</p>
<p>Fave is onboarding these influencers early on in the creation of a fandom to attract the rest of the fans over to the platform. The startup is also looking to capitalize on some of the competitiveness involved in being a super fan, giving creators the ability to set up contests and let their fans compete. Users that do well are rewarded with points that can be spent in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Horton said that she grew up as a super fan herself and can relate to the users.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was the girl in her bedroom who knew every lyric of every song, how many freckles they have, and fell asleep to the movie every single night just to hear the sound of his voice,&#8221; said Horton. &#8220;But I wasn&#8217;t able to go sit front row at a concert or spend $70 on a sweatshirt so the artists got nothing from me despite my deep passion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hope is to give fans a place where they can truly let their fan flag fly, while giving artists a way to connect directly with fans. Though the startup only has one fandom open right now, they&#8217;re actively listening to users on the platform to determine which fandoms to build out next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of this morning&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/">announcement</a> of Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/">next-generation music service</a> featuring lossless audio and spatial audio with support for Dolby Atmos, Amazon is making a move likely aimed at retaining its own streaming music subscribers. The company says that going forward, its high-quality streaming tier, Amazon Music HD, will be made available to all eligible Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers at no extra cost.</p>
<p>Amazon first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/amazon-launches-amazon-music-hd-with-lossless-audio-streaming/">announced</a> Amazon Music HD in fall 2019 with access to over 50 million songs that would stream in what Amazon is calling HD, with a bit depth of 16 bits and a sample rate of 44.1kHz (around CD-quality). It also promised &#8220;millions&#8221; more songs that would stream in Ultra HD, or 24-bit, with a sample rate of up to 192kHz (or better than CD quality).</p>
<p>Today, Amazon Music&#8217;s HD catalog has grown to more than 70 million songs and there are over 7 million Ultra HD tracks available. Amazon Music HD customers can also access a growing catalog of songs remixed in 3D Audio formats such as Dolby Atmos and Sony 360RA, which can be played back on Amazon&#8217;s own high-fidelity speaker, the Echo Studio.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Music in 360RA can also be streamed via Amazon Music HD on Sony’s RA5000 and RA3000 speakers by using Alexa Cast, the company notes.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hmAuBh1Fh2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/">Apple to add lossless audio to Apple Music at no additional cost</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple to add lossless audio to Apple Music at no additional cost&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/embed/#?secret=hmAuBh1Fh2" data-secret="hmAuBh1Fh2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The launch of HD streaming was seen as a way to counteract the threat from the music streaming service Tidal, which had been catering to audiophiles with higher quality streams, as well as a way to differentiate its service from larger streaming rivals, like Apple and Spotify &#8212; the latter which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/"> recently announced a high-end subscription of its own</a>, Spotify HiFi, whose pricing and launch date is yet unknown.</p>
<p>Before today, Amazon Music HD was priced at $12.99 per month for Amazon Prime subscribers and $14.99 per month for anyone else. Now, Amazon says that new and existing subscribers to the Amazon Music Unlimited Individual Plan ($7.99/month for Prime members and $9.99/month otherwise) or the Family Plan ($14.99/month) can upgrade to Amazon Music HD at no additional cost &#8212; essentially a $5 per month savings.</p>
<p>The changes will kick in at the next billing cycle, and are supported in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Canada, France, Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we first launched Amazon Music HD, our goal was to lead the industry by enabling music fans around the world to stream the best quality recording, the way artists intended their music to be heard,&#8221; said Steve Boom, VP of Amazon Music, in a statement about today&#8217;s news. &#8220;We’re thrilled now to make Amazon Music HD available to everyone at no extra cost. All music fans should have access to this quality of music, and now they do,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The move by Amazon to make its HD catalog a free upgrade follows this morning&#8217;s announcement from Apple that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/">it will add lossless audio to Apple Music at no additional cost,</a> starting next month. Apple touts over 75 million songs in lossless audio. The upgrade will also bring spatial audio with support for Dolby Atmos. Given the shift in the market, the pressure is on Spotify to make its HiFi music service competitively priced, as well.</p>
<p>Amazon Music Unlimited has been seen as the dark horse of music streaming, given its potential to grow to a larger size simply based on its ties with Amazon&#8217;s popular Prime subscription. The service had 55 million subscribers since early 2020, but Amazon declined to provide an updated figure today. For comparison, Apple Music <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/apple-music-surpasses-60-million-subscribers/">announced</a> 60 million subscribers in 2019 and was estimated to have grown to <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/apple-music-statistics/">72 million</a> by early 2020 and likely more than<a href="https://musically.com/2020/02/19/spotify-apple-how-many-users-big-music-streaming-services/"> 80 million</a> by now. Spotify, meanwhile, has <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-28/spotify-reports-first-quarter-2021-earnings/">158 million</a> paid subscribers.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>There was lots to get through today, so, in order, here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early-stage founders can still apply for the impending Disrupt Battlefield event. You can sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/deadline-extended-apply-to-startup-battlefield-at-tc-disrupt-2021/">here</a> if that&#8217;s you. It&#8217;s going to be a lot of fun, tbh.</li>
<li>From the weekend: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/san-francisco-tech-companies-sitting-on-record-amounts-of-empty-space.html">San Francisco real estate is a mess</a>; Twitter Blue <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393541248049303555">is coming</a> and I am hype about it; Elon Musk roiled crypto markets by being himself, which doesn&#8217;t speak too highly of the asset class.</li>
<li>AT&amp;T is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/att-confirms-deal-to-combine-its-warnermedia-subsidiary-with-discovery-inc-in-pure-play-43b-deal/">getting out of the TV game to some degree</a>, selling media assets to help pay down debt. Just like Verizon did <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">by selling TechCrunch and family to Apollo</a>.</li>
<li>We also chatted about two Indian mega-rounds: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/merchant-commerce-platform-pine-labs-raises-285-million/">Pine Labs raising $285 million</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/indias-moglix-valued-at-1-billion-in-120-million-fundraise/">Moglix raising $120 million</a>.</li>
<li>From the early-stage front, two rounds this morning for your pleasure: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/sequoia-leads-5m-pre-seed-in-egypts-1-month-old-digital-bank-telda/">Telda&#8217;s super-cool pre-seed round</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/fresh-out-of-yc-houm-raises-8m-to-improve-the-home-rental-and-sales-market-in-latam/">recent Y Combinator-grad Houm&#8217;s latest investment</a>, which explains why the accelerator program is still so popular.</li>
<li>Extra Crunch Live this week is Shaun Maguire (Sequoia) + Samir Vasavada (Vise) on Wednesday, May 19th, at 3pm ET/12pm PT.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/">announced</a> that it is adding some new features to its music streaming service&nbsp;Apple Music. Starting next month, users will find some new options, such as spatial audio with support for Dolby Atmos as well as lossless audio files.</p>
<p>Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/">recently announced</a> a new high-end subscription tier with CD-quality, lossless audio files. But Spotify HiFi isn’t included in Spotify Premium by itself. You’ll have to pay a bit more money to stream lossless audio. Pricing hasn’t been disclosed yet.</p>
<p>Apple’s move is a bit different as lossless audio is going to be included in the basic Apple Music subscription tier. For $9.99 per month, you’ll be able to choose between various audio quality settings. By default, Apple and other streaming services compress audio files so that it doesn’t require a lot of bandwidth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can also choose CD-quality, lossless streaming — 16 bit at 44.1 kHz. In that case, you’ll receive lossless audio files. Behind the scenes, Apple uses its own lossless audio format (ALAC, Apple Lossless Audio Codec). But that shouldn’t have an impact as FLAC, WAV or ALAC files sound exactly the same — it’s lossless audio.</p>
<p>If you have a <em>truly</em> unlimited mobile plan, you can even choose 24 bit at 48 kHz or 24 bit at 192 kHz. In that case, the average weight of a song should be around 250MB — yep, that’s a lot of bytes. Apple says you have to use an external, USB digital-to-analog converter to take advantage of the hi-resolution lossless tier. Plugging a pair of headphones with your iPhone won’t cut it.</p>
<p>The entire Apple Music catalog of 75 million songs will support lossless audio. Music distributors already upload lossless audio files when they submit a song to streaming services. Adding lossless audio is all about surfacing those files to the end users.</p>
<p>As for spatial audio, it’ll be enabled by default on hardware that supports Dolby Atmos, such as AirPods and Beats headphones with an H1 or W1 chip. The most recent iPhone, iPad and Mac models also support Dolby Atmos. But it sounds like songs have to be remastered for Dolby Atmos specifically.</p>
<p>At first, only “thousands of songs” will support spatial audio. Artists include J Balvin, Gustavo Dudamel, Ariana Grande, Maroon 5, Kacey Musgraves and The Weeknd. You’ll be able to identify those tracks with a badge in the user interface.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As gaming platforms capitalize on pandemic-fueled traffic to their digital worlds, brands that drive culture in the physical world are fighting to ensure they don’t miss any new opportunities. A new partnership between Roblox and Gucci brings digital items from the fashion house into the platform’s metaverse alongside a new limited-run digital experience.</p>
<p>Gucci&#8217;s new experience teams a set of virtual spaces with a set of digital branded items in an effort to immerse Roblox users inside a world that feels unique to the Gucci brand and Roblox platform. The new space, called <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/05/gucci-garden-experience/">Gucci Garden</a>, debuts today for a two-week run on the Roblox platform.</p>
<p>The environment takes advantage of recent advances in the game engine powering Roblox, bringing users a high-dynamic set of environments that they can traverse as blank mannequins, which evolve visually as users move through different spaces. Different rooms in the experience draw influence from different Gucci campaigns of the past several years. The digital event&#8217;s rollout accompanies a real-world multimedia event in Florence, <a title="https://www.gucci.com/us/en/st/capsule/gucci-garden" href="https://www.gucci.com/us/en/st/capsule/gucci-garden" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gucci.com/us/en/st/capsule/gucci-garden&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621353006286000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMnHN6yoUBSfFZSYoQNC_FNgcyQA">Gucci Garden Archetypes</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The rollout follows an early pilot with creator Rook Vanguard in releasing Gucci-branded digital items to the platform this past December.</p>

<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Gucci CMO Robert Triefus details how the luxury fashion brand has been redefining its approachability as it extends its reach to digital platforms like Roblox &#8212; which the company sees as an opportunity that&#8217;s growing too quickly to ignore.</p>
<p>“Hats off to Roblox, scale came quickly,” Triefus tells TechCrunch. “Gucci is scale, though it’s taken us 100 years, and it took Roblox about 100 days.”</p>
<p>For high-fashion brands, the digital sphere has presented plenty of challenges when it comes to preserving exclusivity on a medium that begs for mass adoption. Triefus says Gucci has aimed to lean into the access offered by digital platforms as a way of promoting a more inclusive brand.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s so much talk today about the metaverse,” Triefus says. “In the last 6 years, [Creative Director Alessandro Michele] has created a Gucci Metaverse but it&#8217;s not necessarily a digital manifestation, it&#8217;s a narrative.”</p>
<p>Luxury and authenticity have been some of the central sells of blockchain-based NFTs, something Triefus still sees opportunities for down the road. &#8220;It’s astonishing to me how fast the conversation around NFTs has exploded,” Triefus says. &#8220;We’ve been studying blockchain for a long time as you might imagine, authenticity of product and of experience is extremely important.”</p>
<p>In addition to experiments with Roblox, late last year Gucci partnered with startup Genies to outfit user avatars.</p>

<p>Virtual items from real world retailers have been relatively slow to pop up inside digital worlds, though as user perceptions of paying for digital goods have shifted, platforms are moving to capitalize.</p>
<p>“We don’t partner with very many brands,” Roblox exec Christina Wootton tells TechCrunch. “One thing that was very special when we started speaking with Gucci is that they took the time to understand our platform and what works well for designers and creators in our community.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another major telco in the U.S. is making a big move away from being a full player in media services, and specifically content creation. Today AT&amp;T said that it is combining its WarnerMedia division with Discovery Inc.</p>
<p>The deal is being structured as a &#8220;Reverse Morris Trust&#8221; transaction that will give AT&amp;T $43 billion in a combination of cash, debt securities and WarnerMedia’s retention of certain debt. The deal will see AT&amp;T shareholders receive stock representing 71% of the new company, while Discovery shareholders will have 21%, the companies <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/warnermedia_discovery.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in an announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav will lead the new, combined company. It&#8217;s not clear what role Jason Kilar, the CEO of WarnerMedia currently, will have, but his name is not mentioned in the press release. He is currently the CEO of Warner Media, AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey confirmed in a press conference today..</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The deal confirms rumors <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-05-16/att-merge-media-assets-discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over the weekend</a>, and it comes weeks after Verizon Communications announced that it would be selling off its own non-telecoms interests, Verizon Media, in a deal with Apollo Management in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$5 billion deal</a>. [TechCrunch is a part of Verizon Media.] Zaslav said in a press conference with Stankey that the deal was hammered out in secret in &#8220;my Greenwich Village townhouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a press conference, executives from both firms said they expect the deal to be completed by mid-2022. They said they will be announcing a new name in due course, too.</p>
<p>At a time when streaming is the name of the game in media &#8212; this is where consumers are watching, and they are watching in more ways than ever before such as phones and tablets, and that means not just classic media companies, but also a wide range of technology companies are also investing big here &#8212; this is creating nothing short of a content colossus.</p>
<p>It will include some 200,000 hours of iconic programming with more than 100 of the &#8220;most cherished, popular and trusted brands in the world.&#8221; These include HBO, Warner Bros., Discovery, DC Comics, CNN, Cartoon Network, HGTV, Food Network, the Turner Networks, TNT, TBS, Eurosport, Magnolia, TLC and Animal Planet. The companies confirmed that they plan to include news in the largely entertainment-focused group. They say it will have annual revenues of approximately $52 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $14 billion, and a free cash flow conversion rate of around 60% and &#8220;at least $3 billion in expected cost synergies.&#8221; (That will be a tough one to see play out … that is a lot of cuts.)</p>
<p>On the other side, it&#8217;s something of a retreat for AT&amp;T, which spent years building out (and fighting regulators) its own Warner empire, which had been intended to be the telco&#8217;s big play to not just provide the network for people to interact with services &#8212; be it voice, broadband or mobile &#8212; but the content itself.</p>
<p>Yes, AT&amp;T shareholders will still keep 71% of the company, but this deal indicates that the company sees more value in building that body of content creation as its own entity independent of it. Not least, it will likely give those individual content companies significantly more empowerment for striking deals with other network providers without any vested interests in those deals. But in addition to that, it will free the media companies to explore which channels might be best for what they are producing, even when those channels might compete directly with AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>In media and communications, there was a time when all people could talk about was &#8220;triple play&#8221; (TV, broadband and voice) and then &#8220;quad play&#8221; (adding in mobile) as the ideal suite of services to capture consumers and their entertainment and information appetites (and by association their media/advertising appetites). That&#8217;s proven to be a much more complicated dream to realize, however, so it&#8217;s no surprise to see the companies today touting what a great &#8220;pure play&#8221; deal this is for everyone.</p>
<p>“This agreement unites two entertainment leaders with complementary content strengths and positions the new company to be one of the leading global direct-to-consumer streaming platforms,&#8221; said AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey in a statement. &#8220;It will support the fantastic growth and international launch of HBO Max with Discovery’s global footprint and create efficiencies which can be reinvested in producing more great content to give consumers what they want. For AT&amp;T shareholders, this is an opportunity to unlock value and be one of the best capitalized broadband companies, focused on investing in 5G and fiber to meet substantial, long-term demand for connectivity. AT&amp;T shareholders will retain their stake in our leading communications company that comes with an attractive dividend. Plus, they will get a stake in the new company, a global media leader that can build one of the top streaming platforms in the world.”</p>
<p>Zaslav and Discovery may have been a one-time competitor to the Warner empire but it&#8217;s a different tune now:</p>
<p>&#8220;During my many conversations with John, we always come back to the same simple and powerful strategic principle: These assets are better and more valuable together,&#8221; Zaslav said in a statement. &#8220;It is super exciting to combine such historic brands, world-class journalism and iconic franchises under one roof and unlock so much value and opportunity. With a library of cherished IP, dynamite management teams and global expertise in every market in the world, we believe everyone wins … consumers with more diverse choices, talent and storytellers with more resources and compelling pathways to larger audiences, and shareholders with a globally scaled growth company committed to a strong balance sheet that is better positioned to compete with the world’s largest streamers. We will build a new chapter together with the creative and talented WarnerMedia team and these incredible assets built on a nearly 100-year legacy of the most wonderful storytelling in the world. That will be our singular mission: to focus on telling the most amazing stories and have a ton of fun doing it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buzzy face-swapping video app <a href="https://hey.reface.ai">Reface</a> is expanding its reality-shifting potential beyond selfies by letting users upload more of their own content for its AI to bring to life.</p>
<p>Users of its iOS and Android apps still can&#8217;t upload their own user generated video but the latest feature &#8212; which it calls Swap Animation &#8212; lets them upload images of humanoid stuff (monuments, memes, fine art portraits, or &#8212; indeed &#8212; photos of other people) which they want animated, choosing from a selection of in-app song snippets and poems for the AI-incarnate version to appear to speak/sing etc.</p>
<p>Reface&#8217;s freemium app has, thus far, taken a tightly curated approach to the content users can animate, only letting you face swap a selfie into a pre-set selection of movie and music video snippets (plus memes, GIFs, red carpet celeb shots, salon hair-dos and more).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the new feature &#8212; which similarly relies<span style="font-weight: 400;"> on </span>GAN (generative adversarial network) algorithms to work its reality-bending effects &#8212; expands the expressive potential of the app by letting users supply their own source material to face swap/animate.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Y292BX2eZa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/deep-science-ai-is-in-the-air-water-soil-and-steel/">Deep science: AI is in the air, water, soil and steel</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Deep science: AI is in the air, water, soil and steel&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/deep-science-ai-is-in-the-air-water-soil-and-steel/embed/#?secret=Y292BX2eZa" data-secret="Y292BX2eZa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Some rival apps do already offer this kind of functionality &#8212; so there&#8217;s an element of Reface catching up to apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/deep-fake-video-app-avatarify-which-process-on-phone-plans-digital-watermark-for-videos/">Avatarify</a>, Wombo and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/myheritage-now-lets-you-animate-old-family-photos-using-deepfakery/">Deep Nostalgia</a>.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also going further as users can also swap their own face into their chosen source content. So you could, for example, get to see yourself as a singing Venus de Milo, or watch your visage recite a poem from the middle of a pop-art painting like Andy Warhol&#8217;s <em>Marilyn</em>.</p>
<p>The Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup is still being cautious as it expands what users can do with its high tech face-shifting tool &#8212; saying it will be manually moderating all uploads from the new feature.</p>
<p>Rivals in the deepfake space are arguably pushing its hand to open up functionality faster, though, with apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/deep-fake-video-app-avatarify-which-process-on-phone-plans-digital-watermark-for-videos/">Avatarify</a> already letting users animate their own snaps. And &#8212; notably &#8212; a Reface spokeswoman told us it&#8217;s planning to make user generated video uploads available &#8220;in the near future&#8221;.</p>
<p>Pro users are getting a little taster &#8212; as they can upload their own GIFs to face swap into with this latest feature release too.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re really excited to see what Reface users do with swap-reenactment, which is a major technical milestone in terms of the machine learning technology inside of the app,&#8221; said CEO Dima Shvets in a statement. &#8220;Reface content creators have been clamoring for more tools for personalized content and self-expression &#8211; and this feature delivers, dramatically extending the opportunities for realizing their vision and creativity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The still young app has proved popular over its short run, garnering viral buzz via social media shares as users were keen to show off their funny face swaps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of March 2021 Reface said it had 100M installs some 14 months since going live. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a longtime real estate developer based in Chile, Benjamin Labra was able to spot gaps in the buying and renting markets in Latin America. To meet demands, he started <a href="https://houm.com/cl/">Houm</a>, an all-in-one platform that helps homeowners rent and sell their properties in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh out of Y Combinator’s W21 cohort, today Houm announced an $8 million seed round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think the concept sounds like Brazil’s unicorn, QuintoAndar, it’s because Houm is very similar. While QuintoAndar dominates the Brazilian market, Houm operates in Chile, Mexico and Colombia, and aims to capture the rest of Spanish-speaking LatAm.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of Houm as a homeowner-run Zillow meets TaskRabbit. The company offers a marketplace run by the property owners themselves and cuts out the realtor by employing 200 freelancers who prepare the property for sale or to manage it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Houmers, as they are called, go to the owner&#8217;s home, take photos and then help possible buyers or renters view the property. For their work, Houmers are compensated each time a home they worked on sells or gets rented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Houm’s selling proposition isn’t just the ease of use it provides; instead, it also serves as a guarantor in my ways, making the buying process more accessible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Colombia and Mexico, for someone to be your guarantor, they have to have a property that’s free of mortgage so it can be used as collateral,” Labra told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the flip side, the company also guarantees that renters will get paid every month, and if a tenant falters, Houm covers the cost. “You really have nothing to lose if you use Houm,” Labra said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can imagine that a company like Houm now has all sorts of data on the real estate market, especially around sales and rental prices. As a result, Houm uses this data in an algorithm that helps the homeowner determine a fair price for their property, but the listed price remains up to the owner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which was founded in 2018 and is based in Chile, now has about 200 full-time employees, in addition to their freelance team. While Labra declined to say how many active users it has, he said Houm is now showing a property every eight minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current funding round had no lead investor but includes Y Combinator, Goodwater Ventures, OneVC, Vast VC, Liquid2 and Myelin. The company plans to use the money to expand within the region, perfect its algorithm and generally speed up growth.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egypt has a population of over 100 million people. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country has a high mobile and internet penetration necessary for a young and tech-savvy population with 61% below 30</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite its youthful population, two out of every three individuals are currently unbanked in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s the same situation in MENA, where only 40% of the population have access to a bank account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital banks have enormous potential in the region. Today, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched one, <a href="https://telda.app/">Telda</a> is announcing a $5 million pre-seed round to digitize how Egyptians save, send, and spend money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago, we reported that Egyptian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/egyptian-startup-flextock-closes-3-25m-in-the-largest-pre-seed-yet-in-mena/">e-commerce fulfillment startup Flextock</a> had raised the largest pre-seed in MENA</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But that has changed today with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telda&#8217;s fundraise surpassing that record with a considerable margin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in both MENA and Africa (Autochek&#8217;s $3.4 million) for now</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telda </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month by CEO <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-sabbah-064726bb">Ahmed Sabbah</a> and CTO <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/youssefsholqamy">Youssef Sholqamy</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Telda, Sabbah was the co-founder and CTO of Egypt&#8217;s <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/telda-launch/">ride-hailing company Swvl</a>, and Sholqamy, a former senior engineer in Uber&#8217;s infrastructure team</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabbah said he and his co-founder had been looking at the fintech space at their former workplaces. However, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fter his experience using N26 while visiting a friend in Berlin in 2015, his eyes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">opened</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the possibilities of digital banking in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was fond of the idea, and it was coming from a huge pain of payments we had in Egypt and the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for me, I was kind of like waiting for this to happen in Egypt, or if not, I thought I&#8217;ll tap into the opportunity someday,&#8221; he told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Youcef and I have been like watching out the space for a while when the first digital bank started like six years ago, and watching how they grew in markets where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banking is more mature than this region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So imagine an opportunity in a region like Egypt where banking is even way, way less mature.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The North African country is one of the highest consumer spending markets in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its private consumption accounts <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/egypt/private-consumption--of-nominal-gdp#:~:text=Egypt%20Private%20Consumption%20accounted%20for,91.1%20%25%20in%20the%20previous%20quarter.">for </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 85% of its nominal GDP, and only <a href="https://www.amcham.org.eg/publications/business-monthly/issues/274/October-2018/3784/coming-soon-a-cashless-society">4% of its </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> GDP is cashless</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In essence, Egypt is heav</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cash reliant, and card usage in the country is very much in its infancy. Disheartened by the non-customer-centric banking experiences, Telda </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide an alternative.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152771" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152771" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2152771" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-145.png?w=680" alt="Telda" width="680" height="288" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-145.png 1329w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-145.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-145.png?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-145.png?resize=768,325 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-145.png?resize=680,288 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-145.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2152771" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Telda</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any digital bank globally, Telda enables customers to create a free account to send and receive money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And also a card to use online, in stores, make withdrawals and pay bills. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while the service is currently live, Telda cards are yet to be distributed to existing and new customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telda affirmed that it is the first company to receive a license from the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) under its new regulations to issue cards and onboard customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And by doing so, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he one-month-old company has made major progress in a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> short time, even though </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtaining that license took lengthy dialogue with regulators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;First movers will usually have to make all the effort with the regulators and with the bank and try to pave the way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this was one of the hardest parts &#8212; convincing regulators to trust and regulate our banking business and to provide payment financial services to our consumers,&#8221; the CEO said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But because Telda&#8217;s proposition aligns with the CBE&#8217;s vision of digitizing payments in the country, it had little choice but to grant them the license</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A different issue the company has faced was finding a partner bank to provide these services. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And to do that, Telda had to convince the bank that their services were complementary and wouldn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">entirely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overlap</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That means </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trying to be as much independent as possible from the infrastructure of the bank. This was quite crucial for us to be able to move right and as fast as a startup, not as slow and pretty much tied to the pace of the bank&#8217;s technology and operations,&#8221; he continued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the founders&#8217; experience in Swvl and Uber, the importance of building a great team cannot </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be overemphasized</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">barely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> any blueprint to look at in launching a digital bank in Egypt, so Telda is building how it knows best: hiring exceptional talent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CEO, the team comprises</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Egyptians who returned to the North African country to build Telda after working for corporations like Facebook, Microsoft, Uber, Noon, and McKinsey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MENA appears to be ripe for a digital banking experience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per GSMA Intelligence, 280 million people in the region are mobile internet users, and growth is not slowing down</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The frustration with traditional banks is particularly acute with the younger generation, who crave a simple, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">user-friendly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and transparent experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Telda has been able to onboard an impressive list of investors, including Sequoia Capital, for this reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The giant US VC firm led the pre-seed round as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berlin-based Global Founders Capital (GFC) and emerging markets-focused fund Class 5 Global participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telda is Sequoia&#8217;s first venture in Africa, MENA, and the wider GCC region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight years ago, the VC giant led an <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/companies/nubank/">infamous seed investment</a> in Latin American digital bank Nubank before it began to go full throttle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now with more than 38 million customers, Nubank is the world&#8217;s largest digital bank with a valuation of $25 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sequoia will be looking for a similar success story in Telda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are many parallels between Brazil and Egypt. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both countries boast a large, young, talented, and tech-savvy population with a strong appetite to innovate,” said Sequoia Partner George Robson of the investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are delighted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to partner with Telda and earmark our first investment in the region.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telda intends to fast-track its card production and distribution with this new funding. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it currently has more than 30,000 signups already, with half of that already requesting cards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also plans to capitalize on Sequoia&#8217;s name for hiring and expansion, the CEO continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hiring is key for us. We want to scale the team into a world-class team that&#8217;s willing to tap into the opportunity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we aspire for is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growing in Egypt, start to deliver cards for the early adopters, and we see ourselves reaching close to a million cards in our first year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investments in Egypt have been growing in leaps and bounds over the past three years, accompanied by a growing, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">vibrant ecosystem. Egypt recorded the largest number of investment deals last year per Partech Africa. With 86 deals completed, the country contributed 24% to the total number of deals made on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GFC partner Roel Janssen referring to the budding ecosystem in his statement, said: “We are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> impressed by Sabbah and Sholqamy and love their vision for building the region’s leading digital banking app, and we are proud to be part of their journey</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is GFC’s first investment in Egypt, and we see that Egypt has the potential to become an important hub in the global tech ecosystem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After operating in the red for 14 years, JD.com&#8217;s logistics subsidiary is getting ready for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. JD Logistics will price its share between HK$39.36 and HK$43.36 apiece, which could see the firm raise up to about HK$26.4 billion or $3.4 billion, according to its <a href="https://staticpacific.blob.core.windows.net/press-releases-attachments/1310152/HKEX-EPS_20210517_9767993_0.PDF">new filing</a>.</p>
<p>JD.com, Alibaba&#8217;s e-commerce rival in China, began building its own logistics and transportation network from the ground up in 2007 and spun out the unit in 2017, following a pattern where major segments of the tech giant became independent, such as JD.com&#8217;s health and fintech units. JD.com is currently the largest shareholder of JD Logistics with an aggregate stake of 79%.</p>
<p>Unlike Alibaba, which relies on a network of third-party partners to fulfill orders, JD.com takes a heavy-asset approach like Amazon, building up warehouse centers and keeping its own army of courier staff. As of 2020, JD Logistics had over 246,800 employees working in delivery, warehouse operations among other customer services. Its total headcount was 258,700 last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A major strategic decision JD Logistics made once it became independent was opening its technologies to external customers beyond the scope of JD.com&#8217;s own demand, helping retailers like Skechers optimize their logistics operations. As a result, the share of its revenue from external customers rose from 29.9% in 2018 to 38.4% in 2019, and to 43.4% in the nine months ended September 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our growth strategy is partially based on the assumption that the trend toward outsourcing of supply chain services will continue,&#8221; the firm said in its prospectus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Third-party service providers like us are generally able to provide such services more efficiently than otherwise could be provided &#8216;in-house,&#8217; primarily as a result of our expertise, technology and lower and more flexible employee cost structure.&#8221;</p>
<p>But retailers may switch to in-house supply chain operations themselves if they see risks in relying on third-party providers, the company added.</p>
<p>The main selling point of JD Logistics is its same- or next-day delivery, thanks to warehouses it keeps close to end consumers. It said about 90% of the total orders it processed were delivered on the same or next day in 2020.</p>
<p>Such user experience comes at a substantial cost for JD Logistics, though losses are shrinking. The firm posted a net loss of 2.8 billion yuan, 2.2 billion yuan and 11.7 million yuan in 2018, 2019 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.</p>
<p>Its gross profit margin improved from 8.5% during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to 10.9% for the same period in 2020, primarily due to economies of scale, better operational efficiency and government subsidies for reductions in social security funds contributed by employers and waivers of toll charges during COVID-19.</p>
<p>JD Logistics reached into instant delivery by partnering with Dada, a Chinese last-mile delivery service, to form JDDJ, short for &#8220;JD Arrives Home&#8221; in Chinese. JDDJ has been Walmart&#8217;s on-demand delivery service provider in China <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/20/walmart-in-china-is-now-testing-same-day-grocery-delivery-from-dada-via-wechat/">since 2016</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ride-hailing giant Gojek and marketplace Tokopedia, Indonesia&#8217;s two biggest startups, said on Monday they have combined their businesses to form GoTo Group, the largest technology group in the Southeast Asian nation, the fourth most populous country that is currently navigating to contain the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gotocompany.com">GoTo</a> will be preparing for a dual listing &#8212; in New York and Jakarta &#8212; later this year, executives said. Gojek’s Andre Soelistyo will lead the combined business as GoTo Group CEO, with Tokopedia’s Patrick Cao serving as GoTo Group President. Kevin Aluwi will continue as CEO of Gojek and William Tanuwijaya will remain CEO of Tokopedia, the two firms said in a joint announcement.</p>
<p>The combined entity is &#8220;a globally unique and highly complementary ecosystem,&#8221; the two firms said as they look to better compete with heavily funded super app Grab and e-commerce platform Shopee. GoTo executives claimed that the combined entity features:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>Total Group Gross Transaction Value (GTV) of over $22 billion in 2020</li>
<li>Over 1.8 billion transactions in 2020</li>
<li>Total registered driver fleet of over two million as of December 2020</li>
<li>Over 11 million merchant partners as of December 2020</li>
<li>Over 100 million monthly active users (MAU)</li>
<li>An ecosystem that encompasses 2% of Indonesia’s GDP</li>
</ul>
<p>The deal, which has been in the works for several months, comes after Gojek spent several quarters exploring a merger with Grab. Tokopedia, meanwhile, was in talks late last year to pursue a public listing this year. Gojek and Tokopedia began talking earlier this year and last month moved to seek approval from their respective investors. During their talks, the proposed valuation of GoTo was $18 billion.</p>
<p>The companies, which have together raised about $8.2 billion over the years (according to research firm Tracxn), didn&#8217;t comment on the final valuation Monday nor did they disclose any other financial terms of the deal.</p>
<p>The friendship of Gojek and Tokopedia founders may have helped close this deal. The two companies first began working together in 2015 to accelerate e-commerce deliveries using Gojek’s local network of drivers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The companies will continue to thrive and coexist as stand-alone brands within the strengthened ecosystem,&#8221; they said on Monday.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Grab has since announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/grab-to-go-public-in-the-us-following-40-billion-spac-deal/">plans to go public in the U.S. via SPAC</a>, and is seeking a valuation of $40 billion, which if materializes at the current terms, would be the biggest-ever deal of its kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today is a truly historic day as we mark the beginning of GoTo and the next phase of growth for Gojek, Tokopedia and GoTo Financial. Gojek drivers will deliver even more Tokopedia packages, merchant partners of all sizes will benefit from strengthened business solutions and we will use our combined scale to increase financial inclusion in an emerging region with untapped growth potential. For the consumer, GoTo Group will continue to reduce frictions and provide best in class delivery of goods and services. This is the next step of an exciting journey and I am humbled and proud to lead the GoTo movement,” said Andre Soelistyo, CEO of GoTo Group, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Moglix, an industrial business-to-business marketplace in India, said on Monday it has raised $120 million in a new financing round at $1 billion valuation, becoming the 13th firm from the world&#8217;s second largest market to attain the unicorn status this year.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s Series E financing round was led by Falcon Edge Capital and Harvard Management Company (HMC). Existing investors, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India and Venture Highway also participated in the round, which brings <a href="https://www.moglix.com/">Moglix</a>&#8216;s to-date raise to about $220 million. TechCrunch reported earlier this year that Tiger Global was in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">talks to invest in Moglix at $1 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p>“We started six years ago with a firm belief in the untapped potential of the Indian manufacturing sector. We had the trust of stalwarts like Ratan Tata, and a mission to enable the creation of a $1 trillion manufacturing economy in India. Today, as we enter the next stage of our evolution, we feel this financing milestone is a testimony to our journey of innovation and disruption,&#8221; said Rahul Garg, founder and chief executive of Moglix, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Six-year-old Moglix &#8212; founded by IIT Kanpur and ISB alumnus Rahul Garg &#8212; serves over 500,000 small, medium-sized business and enterprises. It has established 3,000 manufacturing plants across India, Singapore, the UK and the UAE and counts manufacturing giants such as Hero MotoCorp, Vedanta, Tata Steel, Unilever and Air India and NTPC as its customers.</p>
<p>Moglix runs a supply chain network of 16,000 suppliers, over 35 warehouses and logistics infrastructure. With close to 500,000+ SKUs on its platform, the startup claims to be the largest e-commerce platform of industrial goods in India.</p>
<p>Moglix, Zetwerk, and Infra.Market have built business-to-business e-commerce platforms for niche categories in the South Asian nation in recent years, illustrating wider adoption of e-commerce in India.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moglix’s distinctive customer value proposition and ROI are visible in its outstanding customer and revenue retention numbers. We believe Moglix is now well poised to scale and we are thrilled to back the Company in the next phase of its growth,&#8221; said Navroz D. Udwadia, Co-Founder of Falcon Edge Capital, in a statement. He said the investment firm studied and tracked Moglix for years before writing its check.</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s announcement follows nearly two-dozen large-sized investments secured by Indian startups in recent months. Earlier on Monday, Pine Labs said it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/merchant-commerce-platform-pine-labs-raises-285-million/">raising $285 million at $3 billion valuation</a>, up from $1 billion in early 2020. KKR said it had invested $95 million in Lenskart.</p>
<p>Social commerce Meesho, subscription platform Chargebee, social network ShareChat, messaging platform Gupshup, and fintech firm CRED are among some of the Indian startups that have become unicorns in recent weeks. Most of these rounds have been led by Tiger Global or Falcon Edge Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pine Labs, a startup that offers merchants payments terminals, invoicing tools and working capital, said on Monday it has completed the first close of a $285 million funding as the nearly two-decade-old firm looks to expand its offerings and build and scale an online payments gateway.</p>
<p>Baron Capital Group, Duro Capital, Marshall Wace, Moore Strategic Ventures and Ward Ferry Management financed the new funding round, while existing investors Temasek, Lone Pine Capital and Sunley House Capital also participated in it, the Indian startup said.</p>
<p>The new round valued <a href="https://www.pinelabs.com/">Pine Labs</a> at $3 billion, up from about $2 billion in a December round last year and $1 billion in early 2020. Pine Labs operates in several Southeast Asian markets as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>B. Amrish Rau, chief executive of Pine Labs, told TechCrunch in an interview that the new financing round enabled secondary transactions for its founder, employees and early investors including Sequoia Capital. The round may also be extended, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled to welcome marquee investors like Marshall Wace, Baron Capital Group, Ward Ferry Management, Duro Capital and Moore Strategic Ventures to the already pristine cap table of Pine Labs. This is an exciting phase in our journey as we enter newer markets,&#8221; said Rau in a statement.</p>
<p>The startup, which also counts PayPal among its investors, serves over 140,000 merchants. Its payments terminal &#8212; also known as point-of-sale machines &#8212; are connected to the cloud, and offer a range of additional services such as working capital &#8212; to the merchants.</p>
<p>Pine Labs&#8217;s payments terminal has integration with over two dozen banks and financial and technology partners. This differentiates Pine Labs from the competition, whose terminals typically have integration with just one bank. Each time a rival firm strikes a new partnership with a bank, they need to deploy new machines into the market. This makes the whole deployment expensive for both the fintech and the bank. (This is why you also often see a restaurant has multiple terminals at the check out.)</p>
<p>Rau said Pine Labs, which has deployed about 600,000 payment terminals, has been able to assemble such a wide integration with the banking ecosystem because of its years-long relationship and expertise.</p>
<p>Pine Labs runs an analytics app on debit card base of banks it tied up to determine the extent of credit to be made available to every cardholder. Pine Labs then converts large payments into EMIs (equated monthly instalment) using its Pine Pay Later application. mid the pandemic late last year, the startup was onboarding over 10,000 new businesses to the platform each month.</p>
<p>Pine Labs is the market leader in many categories. The startup &#8212; which acquired Qwikcilver in 2019 &#8212; assumed over 95% of the market share in gift cards in the financial year that ended in March 2020. Its point-of-sale machines are some of the most widely used in the industry.</p>

<p>“We are very excited to be a part of the technological transformation that Pine Labs is driving on the ground in payments and the multiple interlinkages and efficiencies it is able to create by providing faster, cost effective consumer access to a broader range of financial products such as BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later), where it is driving a pioneering effort on behalf of the financial system. We are also excited about an Indian business being able to drive regional and potentially global adoption of its Intellectual Property and this represents significant optionality for the future,” said Amit Rajpal, CEO and Portfolio Manager of Marshall Wace Asia, in a statement.</p>
<p>Rau said the startup will deploy the fresh capital to build and expand an online payments gateway and engage with hospitals, pharmacies, governments and other entities as its first set of clients. The startup also plans to make offers of Fave, a Southeast Asian startup it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/pine-labs-acquires-southeast-asian-startup-fave-for-45-million/">acquired last month</a>, available to merchants in India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello friends, and welcome back to Week in Review!</p>
<p>Last week, I wrote about Facebook&#8217;s never-ending Trump problem. This week, I&#8217;m looking at Elon Musk&#8217;s wild week of whipping crypto markets.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this on the TechCrunch site, you can get this in your inbox from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><span class="s1">newsletter page</span></a>, and follow my tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny"><span class="s1">@lucasmtny</span></a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The big thing</h2>
<p>This week, Elon Musk may have crashed the crypto markets with a few tweets.</p>
<p>Musk has always been anything but predictable but retail and institutional investors are also anything but dismissive of his ability to pump up markets &#8212; especially if there&#8217;s a good joke to tell in the meantime. A few days after he crashed Dogecoin because of his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he called the currency a &#8220;hustle,&#8221; he drove the price of Bitcoin &#8212; a cryptocurrency with a $1 trillion market cap &#8211;down as much as 17% with a tweet basically noting that he now believes Bitcoin is bad for the environment and that Tesla will not be accepting Bitcoin payments for its cars after all.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QXoi803mKC"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-technoking-of-tesla-orders-a-halt-to-bitcoin-car-payments/">Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla, orders a halt to bitcoin car payments </a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla, orders a halt to bitcoin car payments &#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-technoking-of-tesla-orders-a-halt-to-bitcoin-car-payments/embed/#?secret=QXoi803mKC" data-secret="QXoi803mKC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The impact was immediate. Crypto investors flooded into his mentions pleading for mercy and complaining to each other in public and private that he shouldn&#8217;t have been so rash. Unrelated coins across the cryptosphere dipped as investors worried whether the tweet, shipped at a tenuous moment for this bull run would drag the space down to earth. A later tweet that he was working with Dogecoin developers directly on improving its efficiency sent the joke coin (worth billions of dollars) surging and supplied crypto investors with a worrying insight that perhaps this is all just a joke to Musk.</p>
<p>Days later, Bitcoin has erased months of gains &#8212; though Dogecoin isn&#8217;t doing too poorly.</p>
<p>Musk has had his own dealings with the SEC in recent years, but his market moving tweets have seemed dubious at times but have generally seemed to be just another case of him trolling. Tesla&#8217;s investment in Bitcoin has complicated this somewhat, and while it&#8217;s not known whether he actually has holdings of Dogecoin, he&#8217;s certainly put himself in a less flexible legal arena when his company has a billion dollar stake in the fortunes of Bitcoin which he seems to lord control of over with his Twitter.</p>
<p>Retail investors aren&#8217;t used to blowing up a billionaire&#8217;s mentions and eliciting a response and there&#8217;s a certain irresistible power that comes with that especially for pumping nascent bets like Dogecoin, but I suspect that there&#8217;s going to be some reticence among a certain class of investor to invite Musk&#8217;s brand of randomized volatility into their wallets.</p>

<p><em>Here are the TechCrunch news stories that especially caught my eye this week:</em></p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/uber-lyft-to-give-free-rides-to-covid-19-vaccine-sites-in-deal-with-white-house/">Uber and Lyft supplying free rides to vaccine appointments</a><br />

The Covid-19 pandemic has taken yet another year of Burning Man away from attendees. The festival in the Nevada desert has been a favorite of high-profile tech executives, but this year they&#8217;ll have to settle for a wholly virtual experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/vitalik-buterin-donates-1-billion-worth-of-meme-coins-to-india-covid-relief-fund/"><b>Ethereum creator donates $1 billion to India Covid recovery</b></a><br />

Alleging fake reviews and behaviors that violated its store policies, Amazon took the nuclear option on a number of massive Chinese sellers on its platform that were responsible for billions in merchandise value. Those account holders aren&#8217;t too happy and Amazon isn&#8217;t too repentant.</p>

<p><em>Some of my favorite reads from our Extra Crunch subscription service this week:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/"><b>The Expensify EC-1</b></a><br />
&#8220;Let&#8217;s make it clear from the outset that this story is about an expense management SaaS business called <strong>Expensify</strong>. As you’d expect, yes, this is about the expense management market and how Expensify has grown, its technology and all of that. Normally, that would make us change the channel. But this is also a story about pirates; peer-to-peer hackers who asked, “Why not work from Thailand and dozens of countries across the globe?” and actually did it using P2P hacker culture as a model for consensus-driven decision-making — all with pre-Uber Travis Kalanick in a guest-starring role..&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/is-there-a-creed-in-venture-capital/"><b>Is there a creed in venture capital</b></a><br />
&#8220;Entrepreneurs and investors should recognize that contracts are worth very little without the ongoing relationship management that keeps all parties aligned. Enforcement is so unusual in the world of startups that I consider it a mostly dead-end path. In my experience, good communication is the only reliable remedy. <em>This</em> is the way.<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/5-ways-to-raise-your-startups-pr-game/"><b>5 ways to raise your startups PR game</b></a><br />
&#8220;I get emails every week from companies coming out of stealth mode, wanting to make a splash. Or from a Series B company that’s been around for a while and hopes to improve their branding/messaging/positioning so that a new upstart doesn’t eat their lunch. How do you make a splash? How do you stay relevant?&#8221;</p>
