										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of home-exercise giant Peloton are falling today, off some 13.6% as of the time of writing. This comes after the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-apologizes-agrees-to-treadmill-recall/">announced</a> a recall of its treadmill product, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">TechCrunch reported</a> that the company failed to fix a security issue regarding user data.</p>
<p>The value of Peloton shares soared during the pandemic, as the company&#8217;s product found itself in secular updraft driven by a move to working, and working out, from home in the face of COVID-19&#8217;s spread. Worth around $30 per share at the start of 2020, Peloton&#8217;s stock price shot more than $150 per share by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Today, after losing more than $13 per share in value, Peloton equity is worth just $83.50 per unit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s decision to recall its &#8220;Tread+&#8221; and &#8220;Tread&#8221; treadmills comes with a warning that those who had bought the devices should &#8220;immediately stop using it and contact Peloton for a full refund or other qualified remedy.&#8221; The decision to stop selling the devices, and finance a recall of all units comes after a child died after an incident involving one of the treadmills. Other injuries have been reported.</p>
<p>The American Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, wrote that accepted the recall and sale-cessation decision, adding that the agreement came after &#8220;weeks of intense negotiation and effort.&#8221; The CPSC had <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-Stop-Using-the-Peloton-Tread">warned consumers</a> earlier this month about &#8220;the danger of popular Peloton Tread+ exercise machine after multiple incidents of small children and a pet being injured beneath the machines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peloton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/17/consumer-agency-warns-against-peloton-tread-use-as-company-pushes-back/">fired back</a> at the time saying that it was &#8220;troubled by the [CPSC&#8217;s] unilateral press release about the Peloton Tread+ because it is inaccurate and misleading.&#8221; The company added that there was &#8220;no reason to stop using the Tread+, as long as all warnings and safety instructions are followed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whoops.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s backtrack is not only incredibly embarrassing from a public perception perspective &#8212; Peloton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/17/consumer-agency-warns-against-peloton-tread-use-as-company-pushes-back/">got into a scrap</a> with the CPSC about whether or not it was trying to impede its investigation, which was a very bad look &#8212; but perhaps even more destructive to its brand than making the same decision earlier would have proved.</p>
<p>But for Peloton, the day&#8217;s bad news was hardly monotopical. Instead, TechCrunch reported this morning that &#8220;Jan Masters, a security researcher at Pen Test Partners, found he could make unauthenticated requests to Peloton’s API for user account data without it checking to make sure the person was allowed to request it.&#8221; As we reported, given the known high-profile politicians who are Peloton users, this is more than a mere consumer data-breach matter.</p>
<p>Even worse, Master had told Peloton about the matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Masters reported the leaky API to Peloton on January 20 with a 90-day deadline to fix the bug, the standard window time that security researchers give to companies to fix bugs before details are made public.</p>
<p>But that deadline came and went, the bug wasn’t fixed, and Masters hadn’t heard back from the company, aside from an initial email acknowledging receipt of the bug report. Instead, Peloton only restricted access to its API to its members. But that just meant anyone could sign up with a monthly membership and get access to the API again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Between the death of a child, a failed attempt to attack critics, a massive recall, the cessation of sales of a product line, and a self-induced privacy fiasco, it&#8217;s a bad day for Peloton. Not that I won&#8217;t ride my own Peloton later today, I&#8217;ll just do so while shaking my fist at the corporate overloads who pay the instructors that actually make their entire business function.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.emcap.com/">Emergence</a>, the 18-year-old, San Mateo, Ca.-based venture firm focused on enterprise tech startups, has rounded up nearly a billion dollars in capital commitments across two funds. It closed its sixth early-stage fund with $575 million; the outfit also raised a so-called opportunity fund for the first time, closing it with $375 million in capital commitments.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a significant shift away from standard operating procedure for Emergence, which has funded a string of highly successful companies at their earliest stages but has, until now, maintained a conservative approach when it comes to fundraising, closing its fifth fund in 2018 with <a href="https://www.emcap.com/thoughts/emergence-capital-announces-fund-v-dedicated-to-changing-the-way-the-world/">$435 million</a> and its fourth fund with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/02/11/emergence-capital-raises-new-335m-fund-for-cloud-enterprise-collaboration-investments/">$335 million</a> in 2015.</p>
<p>Emergence was an early investor in Zoom, Veeva, Bill.com, SuccessFactors and Box, among many other outfits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We talked with cofounder Jason Green late last year about the firm&#8217;s approach and he said then that it had picked up the pace during the pandemic.</p>
<p>As he said then, Emergence is now &#8220;very much a data-driven, thesis-driven outbound firm, where we’re reaching out to entrepreneurs soon after they’ve started their companies or gotten seed financing.&#8221; He&#8217;d also said at the time that as of late last year, the firm was poised to close more deal than &#8220;maybe [we] have ever done in the history of the firm, which is amazing to me [considering] COVID. I think we’ve really honed our ability to build this pipeline and have conviction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its portfolio company, Zoom, obviously helped too. &#8220;Zoom is actually helping expand the landscape that we’re willing to invest in,&#8221; Green said at the time. &#8220;We’re probably seeing 50% to 100% more companies and trying to whittle them down over time and really focus on the 20 to 25 that we want to dig deep on as a team.&#8221;</p>
<p>We talked with Green, who is stepping back from the firm, about this new fund yesterday; we&#8217;ll have more from that new conversation tomorrow. In the meantime, the new funds will be managed by cofounder and general partner Gordon Ritter and general partners Kevin Spain, Santi Subotovsky, Joe Floyd, and Jake Saper, each of whom joined the firm as junior investment professionals. They are joined by principal Carlotta &#8220;Lotti&#8221; Siniscalco, who joined the firm in 2018.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://engineears.com/">EngineEars</a> today announced a $1 million raise. The company’s first round of funding features investments from Kendrick Lamar, DJ Mustard, Roddy Rich and <span class="il">Slauson</span> and Co. &#8220;Quality of sound is still important in music,” Lamar said in a quote provided to TechCrunch. “Ali has always been a progressive thinker. Engineers will transcend the culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>The service was launched in 2018 by Grammy winner Derek “MixedByAli” Ali, who has worked on a slew of high-profile tracks from artists including Lamar, Jay Rock, SZA, Nipsey Hussle and Snoop Dogg.</p>
<p>The educational courses turned into a touring curriculum, with 15 workshops in four countries, where Ali says he was able to determine what the community most needed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“During that time, we really learned what the problem is,” says Ali. “All of the problems entailed tracking payments, being credited, the antiquated business model of file transfers and essentially just helping an independent audio engineer sustain and create a business for themselves.”</p>
<p><div style="width: 300px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-2147653-1" width="300" height="450" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Derek-Ali-Teaser-4-4x5-1.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Derek-Ali-Teaser-4-4x5-1.mp4">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Derek-Ali-Teaser-4-4x5-1.mp4</a></video></div></p>
<h6><strong>Source:  <a href="https://www.claimastories.com/">Claima Stories </a></strong></h6>
<p>EngineEars has since branched out into something more akin to a marketplace for audio engineers. Independent mixers can offer their services and connect with artists and labels, get credit for the tracks they&#8217;ve worked on and &#8212; perhaps most importantly in the world of freelancing &#8212; get paid.</p>
<p>The platform launched an alpha version in January and since has 120 engineers verified by an existing vetting process. The invite-only service has another 2,000 people on its waiting list, according to Ali.</p>
<p>The service is currently working on a feature roadmap based on the requests of existing users and looking toward potential additions like the ability to buy beats, going forward. Other suggested features include contract negotiations for work-for-hire, but much of this is still very much in early stages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Once the design, manufacturing and certification of electric aircraft is complete, urban air mobility companies face a cascade of logistical issues, including building an app that connect customers to rides and finding dedicated take-off and landing areas.</p>
<p>A new partnership between autonomous air taxi developer Wisk Aero and air mobility ride platform Blade Urban Air Mobility aims to provide a solution.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Wisk will own and operate up to 30 aircraft on Blade’s network of dedicated air terminals along short-distance routes. Wisk will be compensated based on flight time, along anticipated minimum flight hour guarantees, the companies said in a news release Wednesday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s a smart move for both companies. Blade does not own aircraft itself, but instead brokers private air travel service through a digital platform. However, the craft they offer are conventional rotorcraft, such as helicopters and seaplanes. The partnership will help “accelerate Blade&#8217;s transition from conventional rotorcraft to safe, quiet, emission-free Electric Vertical Aircraft,&#8221; Rob Wiesenthal, CEO of Blade, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Wisk, born out of a joint venture between Kitty Hawk and Boeing, will be able to benefit from Blade’s experience as an air mobility service provider. Once Wisk achieves certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, it will be able to immediately ramp up via Blade’s network.</p>
<p>The companies say they are committed to an “open-network” approach to Urban Air Mobility, with Wisk providing aircraft to multiple customer platforms and likewise Blade using many different electric aircraft developers for its ride services. Not all electric vertical take-off and landing companies will likely take the partnership route. Joby Aviation CEO JoeBen Bevirt has stated publicly that the company intends to be vertically integrated between its vehicle development and air taxi operations.</p>
<p>Blade is one of a suite of air mobility companies, including Joby, that have announced its intention to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. In December 2020 Blade said it would merge with SPAC Experience Investment Corp at a valuation of $825 million. The deal includes $400 million in gross proceeds and $125 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the oldest of 12 children, Bunim Laskin spent much of his teen years looking for ways to help keep his siblings entertained. Noticing that a neighbor’s pool was often empty, Laskin reached out to ask if his family could use her pool. To make it worth her while, he suggested that they could help cover her expenses for maintaining the pool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, five other families had made the same arrangement with her and the pool owner had six families covering 25% of her expenses. This meant that the neighbor was actually making money off her pool. The arrangement sparked a business idea in Laskin’s mind. At the age of 20, he founded <a href="http://www.swimply.com">Swimply</a>, a marketplace for homeowners to rent out their underutilized pools to local swimmers, with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asher Weinberger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cedarhurst, New York-based company launched a beta in 2018, starting with four pools in the New Jersey area. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We used Google Earth to find houses, and then knocked on 80 doors with a pool,” CEO Laskin recalls. “We got to 100 pools organically. Word of mouth really helped us grow.” The site was pretty bare bones, he admits, with potential customers only able to view photos of the pools and connect with the pool owner by phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, Swimply did around 400 reservations and raised $1.2 million from friends and family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Swimply launched what he describes as a “proper” website and app with an automated platform. It grew “4 to 5 times” that year, again mostly organically. In an episode that aired in March 2020, the company appeared on Shark Tank but went home without a deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Swimply, Laskin said, pivoted right into the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were the perfect solution for people when the world was falling on its head,” he said. The company restructured its offering to ensure that pool owners did not have to interact with guests. “It was the perfect, contact-free, self-serve experience to hang out and be with people you quarantined with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC then came out to say that it was safe to swim because chlorine could help kill the virus, and that proved to be a big boon to its business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On one end, it was a way for people to have a normal day and on the other, it helped give owners a way to earn an income, at a time when many people were being affected financially,” Laskin told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business took off in 2020 with revenue growing 4,000% and now Swimply is announcing a $10 million Series A round. Norwest Venture Partners led the financing, which also included participation from Trust Ventures and a number of angel investors such as Poshmark founder and CEO Manish Chandra; Rob Chesnut, former general counsel and chief ethics officer at Airbnb; Ancestry.com CEO Deborah Liu and Michael Curtis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swimply is now operating in a total of 125 U.S. markets, two markets in Canada and five markets in Australia. It plans to use its new capital in part to expand into new markets and toward product development.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2147921" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2147921" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2147921" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image0.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="574" height="327" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image0.jpeg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image0.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image0.jpeg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image0.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2147921" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Swimply</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way it works is pretty straightforward. Swimply simply connects homeowners that have underutilized backyard spaces and pools with those seeking a way to gather, cool off or exercise, for example. People or families can rent pools by the hour, ranging in price from $15 to $60 per hour (at an average of $45/hour) depending on the amenities. New markets that Swimply has recently expanded to include Portland, Oregon; Raleigh, NC and the California cities of Oakland, San Luis Obispo and Los Gatos. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The shifting mindset from younger generations about ownership is a huge contributor to increased growth of the Swimply marketplace,” said co-founder Weinberger, who serves as Swimply’s COO. “Swimming is the third most popular activity for adults and number one for children, and yet no other company has tackled the aquatic space to make swimming more affordable and accessible&#8230;until now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company declined to provide hard revenue figures, Laskin said Swimply was seeing “7 digits a month in revenue” and 15,000 to 20,000 reservations a month. Families represent the most popular reservation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People can book and pay through our platform, and only 20% of hosts ever meet their guests,” Laskin said. “We’re enabling a new kind of consumer behavior with what we’re doing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is planning to use its new capital to also rebuild much of its tech infrastructure and boost its customer support team to be more “readily available.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also now offering a complimentary up to $1 million worth of insurance per booking for liability as well as $10,000 for property damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swimply has a little over 20 employees, up 10 times from 2 people in December of 2020. It plans to double that number over the next few months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s model has proven quite lucrative for some owners, according to Laskin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Last year, there were some owners who earned $10,000 a month. One owner in Denver earned $50,000 last year and he had signed up toward the end of the summer. He should make over $100,000 this year,” Lasken projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its only criteria is that owners offer a clean pool. Eighty five percent of hosts offer restrooms as well. If they don’t, they are limited to one-hour reservations with a max of five guests. Swimply has also partnered with local pool companies, and if they pay one of its owners a visit and certify that pool, that owner gets a badge on the site “so guests get an additional level of security,” Laskin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ed Yip of Norwest Venture Partners admits that when he first heard of the concept of Swimply, he “didn’t know what to make of it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the more he heard about it, the more excited he got.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the holy grail for a consumer investor. We’re not changing consumer behavior, but rather productize the experience and make it safer and easier on both sides,” Yip told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What also gets the investor excited is the potential for Swimply beyond just swimming pools in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re seeing a ton of demand from hosts wanting to list hot tubs and tennis courts, for example,” Yip said. “So this can turn into a marketplace for shared outdoor resources and that’s a huge market opportunity that adds value on both sides.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the concept of monetizing underutilized space is a growing concept. Earlier this year, we reported on Neighbor, w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hich operates a self-storage marketplace, raising $53 million in a Series B round of funding. Neighbor’s unique model aims to repurpose under-utilized or vacant space — whether it be a person’s basement or the empty floor of an office building — and turn it into storage.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the same time as it&#8217;s cracking down on the advertising businesses run by rivals, Apple is introducing a new way for developers to advertise on the App Store. Previously, developers could promote their apps after users initiated a search on the App Store by targeting specific keywords. For example, if you typed in &#8220;taxi,&#8221; you might then see an ad by Uber in the top slot above the search results. The new ad slot, however, will reach users <em>before</em> they search. This can expose the app to a wider audience.</p>
<p>This new and more prominent ad placement is found on the App Store&#8217;s Search tab, which sees millions of visits from Apple device owners every month. Today, the Search tab offers two sections below the search box itself: a &#8220;Discover&#8221; section that highlights current App Store trends, and a &#8220;Suggested&#8221; section with recommended apps and games to try. The ad will appear in the latter section at the top of the list of Suggested apps.</p>
<p>These new ad placements, which Apple calls &#8220;<a href="https://searchads.apple.com/help/advanced/0071-book-search-tab-campaigns/">Search tab campaigns</a>,&#8221; are being made available as part of Apple&#8217;s Search Ads Advanced service, and can take advantage of the assets that developers have already uploaded to their App Store product page &#8212; like the app&#8217;s name, icon and subtitle. Because developers are buying a direct placement on the App Store, they don&#8217;t need to submit keywords as they would for other App Store ads, nor any other creative assets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2147909" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2147909" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2147909" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-10.22.33-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="612" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-10.22.33-AM.jpg 1488w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-10.22.33-AM.jpg?resize=150,135 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-10.22.33-AM.jpg?resize=300,270 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-10.22.33-AM.jpg?resize=768,692 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-10.22.33-AM.jpg?resize=680,612 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-10.22.33-AM.jpg?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2147909" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Like the existing Search results campaigns, there&#8217;s no minimum spend required for a Search tab campaign. Developers can spend as little or as much as they want, then start, stop or adjust the campaign at any time, says Apple. Ad pricing is based on a cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM) model. The actual cost is the result of a second price auction, which calculates what the developer will pay based on what the next closest bidder is willing to pay. Impressions are counted when at least 50% of the ad is visible for one second, Apple notes.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s decision to expand its advertising business appears to be a calculated move timed with the launch of iOS 14.5, the latest version of the iPhone&#8217;s operating system. Through a feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">App Tracking Transparency (ATT),</a> rolling out in iOS 14.5, Apple is cracking down on apps that track users&#8217; data without permission. After updating, users will see a new pop-up box appear in each app, where the developer will ask permission to collect and share the user&#8217;s information with data brokers and other third parties, if they previously collected this information without users&#8217; consent. Users can also go into their iOS Settings to turn on or off app tracking for individual apps at any time.</p>
<p>The change is shaking up the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/237974/online-advertising-spending-worldwide/">$350+ billion</a> digital ad industry, led by Facebook and Google. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">Facebook has argued</a> the impacts of the change <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-facebook-clash-over-ads-small-businesses-fear-theyll-be-impacted-11618009627">will hurt small businesses</a>, which have historically relied on highly targeted, personalized ads that allow them to reach potential customers without spending a lot of money. Advertisers, meanwhile, have suggested that Apple&#8217;s changes will <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-privacy-changes-are-poised-to-boost-its-ad-products-11619485863">benefit its own bottom line</a> at the expense of their own.</p>

<p>But Apple&#8217;s response, to date, has simply been that the changes were necessary to protect consumer privacy. People should have a right to know &#8220;when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites,&#8221; the company said, &#8220;and they should have the choice to allow that or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to early <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">data by Flurry Analytics</a>, only around 11% of users are opting in to being tracked after the iOS 14.5 launch. For app publishers looking to acquire new users, that could make this new ad slot look more appealing than it would have, had it launched before ATT rolled out.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s plans to launch the new ad slot were reported by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5527ddd1-77a8-4cd0-82fd-4568be5da80f">Financial Times</a> in April, which noted that, ultimately, the changes may be more about money &#8212; they could also be about control. In years past, getting featured on the App Store could boost a company&#8217;s valuation as new users flooded in. Apple may want to shift that power away from third-parties and back to itself and its own App Store both in terms of app discovery and anointing the next hit apps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peloton today <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-and-Peloton-Announce-Recall-of-Tread-Plus-Treadmills-After-One-Child-Death-and-70-Incidents-Recall-of-Tread-Treadmills-Due-to-Risk-of-Injury">announced that it will be cooperating</a> with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), agreeing to two voluntary treadmill recalls for the Tread+ and Tread versions of its home treadmill system.</p>
<p>Those who have purchased the systems can contact the connected fitness company for a refund. The company has also agreed to stop selling and distributing both models in the U.S. Last month, CEO John Foley <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/17/consumer-agency-warns-against-peloton-tread-use-as-company-pushes-back/">said the company was &#8220;troubled&#8221;</a> by the CPSC’s decision to go public with its findings, calling them &#8220;inaccurate and misleading.&#8221; Today&#8217;s news finds the executive offering a much more contrite statement.</p>
<p>“The decision to recall both products was the right thing to do for Peloton’s Members and their families,” Foley says. “I want to be clear, Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize. Today’s announcement reflects our recognition that, by working closely with the CPSC, we can increase safety awareness for our Members.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The voluntary recalls are a response to ongoing safety concerns around the fitness equipment. The CPSC cites more than 70 incidents in total, including the death of a young child. According to the commission, &#8220;a six-year-old child recently died after being pulled under the rear of the treadmill. In addition, Peloton has received 72 reports of adult users, children, pets and/or objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones, and lacerations.&#8221;</p>
<p>CPSC acting chairman Robert S. Adler said in a statement, &#8220;I am pleased that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Peloton have come to an agreement to protect users of the Peloton Tread+ and Tread products. The agreement, which the Commission voted this morning to accept, requires Peloton to immediately stop selling and distributing both the Tread+ and Tread products in the United States and refund the full purchase price to consumers who wish to return their treadmills. The agreement between CPSC and Peloton is the result of weeks of intense negotiation and effort, culminating in a cooperative agreement that I believe serves the best interests of Peloton and of consumers.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The recall includes some 125,000 Tread+ (the older system, renamed with the arrival of a new budget device) and 1,050 Tread models in the U.S., along with an additional 5,400 in Canada. The warning issued alongside the Tread+ recall states, &#8220;Adult users, children, pets and objects can be pulled underneath the rear of the treadmill, posing a risk of injury or death,&#8221; while the Tread&#8217;s notes, &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The touchscreen on the treadmill can detach and fall, posing a risk of injury to consumers.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Consumers will have until November 6, 2022 for a full refund. After that, the company will only issue an undetermined partial refund.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s initial pushback owed, in part, to the fact that home fitness equipment has long been known to present safety concerns &#8212; particularly with small children and pets present. It seems likely that we&#8217;ll hear more on Peloton&#8217;s stance during tomorrow&#8217;s earnings call. The company had a banner 2020, due to the pandemic, but shares have dropped 8% on the news. Today also saw some key security concerns with its platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">go public</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is known for its pitch-offs. We&#8217;ve had them in cities all over the world, and heard from hundreds of startups who have shared the story of their company on our stages.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to be bringing the pitch-off to Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>Anyone in the audience on an episode of Extra Crunch Live can virtually &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; to be selected to pitch in front of the audience and get feedback from our all-star guests.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On ECL, pitch-off startups will have two minutes to tell us about their company. This is the equivalent of an elevator pitch — imagine running into a VC or potential customer at a tech conference like Disrupt or bumping into them at a park. As such, no visual aids are allowed, including decks, videos, demoes, etc.</p>
<p>Essentially, what can you convey with your words, in a short time frame, to get people to both understand your startup and be excited about it?</p>
<p>This is a critical skill, and we&#8217;re creating the space for founders to practice and improve.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m amped to have FirstMark&#8217;s Rick Heitzmann and Orchard founder Court Cunningham as guests on Extra Crunch Live on May 5. This founder/investor duo know exactly what it takes to deliver a great pitch.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">It’s an entrepreneur’s market in digital health today, with startups raising <a href="https://rockhealth.com/reports/q1-2021-funding-report-digital-health-is-all-grown-up/">record-breaking</a> funding at soaring valuations and debuting on public markets to eager investors.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/healthcare-unicorn-exit-activity/">CB Insights, </a>as of March 3, 2021, there are 51 healthcare unicorns &#8212; “startups” &#8212; worth $1 billion or more around the world. Global venture capital funding, including private equity and corporate VC, into digital health was the highest ever in the first quarter 2021 at <a href="https://mercomcapital.com/product/q1-2021-digital-health-healthcare-it-funding-ma-report/">$7.2 billion, according to Mercom Capital Group.</a></p>
<p>The massive influx of capital to healthcare should not be surprising; the pandemic has made it starkly clear that digital health is the future of healthcare. To that end, we should anticipate additional healthcare exits worth more than $1 billion in the near term. Which again, is great for entrepreneurs &#8212; as long as they understand how hard it is to build a unicorn in healthcare. Today, becoming a unicorn requires founders who are long on vision and operational experience.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Today, becoming a unicorn requires founders who are long on vision and operational experience.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Company founders most often turn to veteran investors for help with grand-slam strategies to create the next healthcare unicorn. That&#8217;s why many of them seek counsel from the <a href="http://www.merckghifund.com/">Merck Global Health Innovation Fund</a>: Because we have the experience, resources, successful track record and networks to build real scale in digital health.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, lots of investors jumped in to invest in digital health for the first time. But we&#8217;ve been investing for more than a decade. Two of our portfolio companies, <a href="https://www.preventicesolutions.com/">Preventice Solutions</a> and <a href="http://go.teladochealth.com/livongo/">Livongo, </a>exited last year as unicorns, rounding out the $6.2 billion in digital health market value MGHIF has exited over the last two years. And we are expecting two more unicorn exits in 2021. But we&#8217;re not stopping there; we&#8217;ll be investing our $500 million fund in drone-supported supply chain technologies, telehealth, AI, digital pathology, remote clinical trials and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT).</p>
<p>Given our success, here are four instrumental strategies to building a unicorn in digital health that we know work.</p>
<h2>Raise the &#8220;right amount&#8221; of capital to build the right company</h2>
<p>We often ask entrepreneurs: Would you rather own 20% of a $50 million company or 5% of a $1 billion company? To most, the answer is obvious. In our experience, too many entrepreneurs worry about dilution and never raise the right amount of capital.</p>
<p>It’s well known that companies with rapidly growing revenues are valued at a premium &#8212; but it’s important to remember that this is hard to do in healthcare. Getting to scale takes time because healthcare is so complicated and involves so many stakeholders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/4007687c-0c98-483c-b742-e7fc1df3c375?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/alex"> Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> dug into the world of the IPO. Not just the numbers and the metrics and the calculations of valuations at diluted, and non-diluted, share counts. No. We wanted to talk about the morality <em>and</em> efficacy of going public.</p>
<p>So to round out our conversation we enlisted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevecakebread">Steve Cakebread</a>, the CFO of <a href="https://www.yext.com/">Yext</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garth-mitchell-34837511/">Garth Mitchell</a>, the CFO of <a href="https://www.latch.com/">Latch</a>. Cakebread is known for being aboard the Salesforce, Pandora and Yext IPOs. Mitchell has sat on both sides of the table during the IPO process, and is currently helming the money equations as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/unpacking-chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-deals-for-latch-and-sunlight-financial/">Latch approaches the public markets via a SPAC</a>.</p>
<p>For more context, Yext, a company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/01/the-25-million-demo-yext-scores-a-big-round-from-ivp-after-techcrunch50-debut/">first launched at a TechCrunch event back in 2009</a>, provides data tooling and search software to businesses, while Latch builds software and hardware for rental-focused buildings. Yext is public. Latch will be in a few months.</p>
<p>Back to our topic, we asked Cakebread to talk about his thesis on why going public earlier than later can help a company&#8217;s maturity process <em>and</em> can help provide greater returns to the general public. The CFO has written a rather good book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/IPO-Playbook-Insiders-Perspective-Company/dp/1733959122">about the IPO process</a> more generally and what it means for a company&#8217;s internal processes, but his morality notes especially stood out because it&#8217;s an argument far less noisy than the POP critics. Baked beans come up, somehow!</p>
<p>We also asked Mitchell to talk about Latch&#8217;s choice to go public, and what opportunities and challenges the SPAC route brings for the company. Of course, there&#8217;s a SPAC joke in there (or two), but we get into broader &#8220;what&#8217;s next&#8221; debates about if more companies will start to leave the private world, venture capital&#8217;s role in this whole mess and the financial lift of going to the public market.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy the show, and get excited: Equity is going to have more guests on from time to time, and we welcome any suggestions <a href="https://twitter.com/EquityPod">you want to throw at us. </a></p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’ve been working for a large tech company on an H-1B visa for about a year and a half. I’d like to establish my own company while maintaining my current, secure job. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can I keep working on the H-1B, found my own company, and then have my startup sponsor me for an H-1B or another visa?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Scrappy in Santa Clara</strong></p>
<p>Hi Scrappy,</p>
<p>You need to be very careful while navigating this process because there are many different legal requirements that you need to pay careful attention to so you comply with U.S. immigration laws. But yes, it is possible for you to <em>own</em> a portion of a business on H-1B, and it is possible for a founder to obtain an H-1B transfer to <em>work </em>at the startup.</p>
<p>Take a listen to a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/069-how-to-have-2-jobs-when-youre-on-an-h-1b/">recent podcast episode</a> in which I discuss having two H-1B jobs — or concurrent H-1Bs. Concurrent H-1Bs enable your second employer — in this case, your startup — to avoid having to go through the H-1B lottery process because you have already gone through that process with your current employer.</p>
<h2>Consult with experienced attorneys</h2>
<p>Be kind to your attorneys &#8212; you will need their support to navigate this process! Before you embark on creating your startup, you should review and discuss your employment contract and NDA with an employment lawyer.</p>
<p>Big companies often require employees to obtain their consent prior to forming a startup. You should also consult with an experienced immigration attorney when considering embarking on this path and determining how to structure your startup. The H-1B has specific requirements that you and your startup must meet to qualify.</p>
<h2>Employer-employee requirement</h2>
<p>As you probably already know, the H-1B visa allows you to work for a specific employer in a specific job at a specific location. That means you cannot work for or at your startup under your current H-1B. Therefore, we often advise clients not to found any startup as a sole proprietorship. There will probably need to be a corporation or a limited liability company.</p>
<p>You may be advised to find a co-founder or two. One of the key requirements for the H-1B that you need to keep in mind is your startup and you must have an employer-employee relationship. That means someone at your startup, such as a co-founder, must have the ability to hire you, supervise you, hold you accountable for poor job performance, and fire you, according to the terms and conditions of the H-1B.</p>
<p>Also, you may need to work with a corporate attorney to draft certain bylaws, and it can be helpful if you personally own less than 50% of your startup. All of these things depend on the specific details of your situation, so definitely talk to experienced attorneys to guide you through, step by step!</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<h2>Salary requirement</h2>
<p>Your position and your startup must meet other requirements for an H-1B. To qualify for an H-1B, the future position must meet the definition of a “specialty occupation.” That means your position requires theoretical and practical application of highly specialized knowledge.</p>
<p>It also means you must have at least a bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience in a field that’s directly related to the position.</p>
<p>Moreover, your startup must be able to pay you the prevailing wage for the position and for the location where your startup or the position is based. Prevailing wages, which are determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, are broken down into four levels based on experience, with Level I being an entry-level position and Level IV being the most experienced.</p>
<p>Before filing an H-1B petition on your behalf to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), your startup’s immigration attorney will have to first submit a Labor Condition Application (LCA) for certification by the Department of Labor. An LCA seeks to ensure that the wages and working conditions of American workers are not negatively impacted by an H-1B position.</p>
<p>Equity in a company and stock options are not considered wages in the H-1B context. Therefore, your startup will need to show that it can afford to pay you the prevailing wage as well as support business operations.</p>
<p>If you’re pre-revenue, this can be shown by a business plan plus your bank statements showing your runway from an initial investment. The amounts required depend on the details of your company’s situation.</p>
<h2>Other things to keep in mind</h2>
<p>There are no restrictions on the number of hours an individual on an H-1B must work. An H-1B position can be full time or part time or involve working just a few hours a week. Take a listen to my podcast on best practices for submitting <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-09-what-makes-a-strong-h-1b-petition/">a strong H-1B petition</a>.</p>
<p>Concurrent H-1B employment can last as long as the original H-1B with your large tech employer. If you want to remain permanently in the United States, you or one of the companies sponsoring your H-1B should apply for a green card at least a year before your sixth year on the H-1B. (If you apply for a green card before your sixth year on an H-1B, the sponsoring employer can continue to extend your H-1B beyond six years until you receive your green card so you don’t have to leave the United States to apply at a U.S. embassy in your home country).</p>
<p>If you want to apply for a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">green card on your own</a>, consider the EB-1A green card for individuals with extraordinary ability or the EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) for individuals with exceptional ability.</p>
<p>Other <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/020-sponsoring-employees-for-perm-green-cards/">employment-based green cards</a>, such as the EB-2 green card for professionals holding advanced degrees and EB-3 for skilled workers and professionals, require an employer to sponsor you as well as the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/permanent">PERM</a> process, which can be challenging if you own substantial equity in the company.</p>
<p>Check with your current employer to find out if the company is willing to sponsor you for a green card. Depending on the timing, you might be able to bypass a second H-1B completely, avoiding the employer-employee relationship restrictions with your startup venture.</p>
<p>The work permit that comes in the I-485 adjustment of status process is unrestricted as to the type of employment in which you can engage!</p>
<p>Wishing you the best on your journey,</p>
<p>Sophie</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.timescale.com/">Timescale</a>, makers of the open-source TimescaleDB time series database, announced a $40 million Series B financing round today. The investment comes just over two years after it got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/timescale-announces-15m-investment-and-new-enterprise-version-of-timescaledb/">a $15 million Series A</a>.</p>
<p>Redpoint Ventures led today&#8217;s round, with help from existing investors Benchmark, New Enterprise Associates, Icon Ventures and Two Sigma Ventures. The company reports it has now raised approximately $70 million.</p>
<p>TimescaleDB lets users measure data across a time dimension, so anything that would change over time. &#8220;What we found is we need a purpose-built database for it to handle scalability, reliability and performance, and we like to think of ourselves as the category-defining relational database for time series,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Ajay Kulkarni explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that the choice to build their database on top of Postgres when it launched four years ago was a key decision. &#8220;There are a few different databases that are designed for time series, but we&#8217;re the only one where developers get the purpose-built time series database plus a complete Postgres database all in one,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While the company has an open-source version, last year it decided rather than selling an enterprise version (as it had been), it was going to include all of that functionality in the free version of the product and place a bet entirely on the cloud for revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided that we&#8217;re going to make a bold bet on the cloud. We think cloud is where the future of database adoption is, and so in the last year [&#8230;] we made all of our enterprise features free. If you want to test it yourself, you get the whole thing, but if you want a managed service, then we&#8217;re available to run it for you,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The community approach is working to attract users, with over 2 million monthly active databases, some of which the company is betting will convert to the cloud service over time. Timescale is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/21/timescale-db/">based in New York City</a>, but it&#8217;s a truly remote organization, with 60 employees spread across 20 countries and every continent except Antarctica.</p>
<p>He says that as a global company, it creates new dimensions of diversity and different ways of thinking about it. &#8220;I think one thing that is actually kind of an interesting challenge for us is what does D&amp;I mean in a totally global org. A lot of people focus on diversity and inclusion within the U.S., but we think we&#8217;re doing better than most tech companies in terms of racial diversity, gender diversity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>And being remote-first isn&#8217;t going to change even when we get past the pandemic. &#8220;I think it may not work for every business, but I think being remote first has been a really good thing for us,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s content decision review body, a quasi-external panel that&#8217;s been likened to a &#8216;Supreme Court of Facebook&#8217; but isn&#8217;t staffed by sitting judges, can&#8217;t be truly independent of the tech giant which funds it, has no legal legitimacy or democratic accountability, and goes by the much duller official title &#8216;Oversight Board&#8217; (aka the FOB) &#8212; has just made the biggest call of its short life&#8230;</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s hand-picked &#8216;oversight&#8217; panel has voted against reinstating former U.S. president Donald Trump&#8217;s Facebook account.</p>
<p>However it has sought to row the company back from an &#8216;indefinite&#8217; ban &#8212; finding fault with its decision to impose an indefinite restriction, rather than issue a more standard penalty under its existing rules (such as a penalty strike or permanent account closure).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/news/226612455899839-oversight-board-upholds-former-president-trump-s-suspension-finds-facebook-failed-to-impose-proper-penalty/">press release</a> announcing its decision the board writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class="_8gv4 _8gv1 _OBTypography__text _8gv7">Given the seriousness of the violations and the ongoing risk of violence, Facebook was justified in suspending Mr. Trump’s accounts on January 6 and extending that suspension on January 7.</span></p>
<p class="_8gu_ _8-v2"><span class="_8gv4 _8gv1 _OBTypography__text _8gv7">However, it was not appropriate for Facebook to impose an ‘indefinite’ suspension.</span></p>
<p class="_8gu_ _8-v2"><span class="_8gv4 _8gv1 _OBTypography__text _8gv7">It is not permissible for Facebook to keep a user off the platform for an undefined period, with no criteria for when or whether the account will be restored.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The board wants Facebook to revision its decision on Trump&#8217;s account within six months &#8212; and &#8220;decide the appropriate penalty&#8221;. So it appears to have succeeded in&#8230; kicking the can down the road.</p>
<p>During a press conference, the FOB&#8217;s co-chairs Michael McConnell and Helle Thorning-Schmidt and its director of admin, Thomas Hughes, discussed the ruling and the process undertaken to reach it &#8212; which was a majority decision, with some minority opinions included in the <a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/FB-691QAMHJ">full decision</a> published today.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The FOB confirmed that while it agrees Facebook had sufficient justification to suspend Trump&#8217;s account on January 7 (and to remove posts that violated its policies against praise for violent acts), it believes the tech giant imposed an improper penalty which was not in line with its own rules.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Its requirement is that Facebook revisit the case, with the board essentially encouraging it to take a full six months to deliberate, and then either restore Trump&#8217;s account, make the ban permanent or define a suspension for a set period of time.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The opinion stresses that Facebook&#8217;s own policies do not authorize an indefinite suspension,&#8221; said McConnell during a call with reporters, emphasizing that the company&#8217;s own policies don&#8217;t allow for such a &#8216;fence-sitting&#8217; restriction and noting too that internationally recognized principles of freedom of expression &#8220;maintain that restrictions on speech must be clearly stated understandable&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indefinite penalties of this sort do not pass the international or American smell test for clarity, consistency and transparency,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The board&#8217;s role is to ensure that Facebook&#8217;s rules and processes are consistent with its content policies, its values and respect human rights,&#8221; said Thorning-Schmidt. &#8220;In applying an indeterminate and standard-less penalty and then referring the case to the board to resolve Facebook actually shirked its responsibilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The board insists that Facebook apply and justify a clear penalty.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went through a long list of policy recommendations the FOB is making alongside the Trump decision &#8212; such as that when it imposes a ban on an influential user it should assess the risk of inciting harm before the suspension period ends and that influential users who still pose a risk of harm should not be reinstated &#8212; suggesting that if Facebook takes its recommendations on board it will have a much easier time making a decision on Trump at the second pass.</p>
<p>The seven policy recommendations also include the suggestion that Facebook publish a new policy to govern its response to crisis situations and set limits on its discretion &#8212; including a requirement to review its own decision within a fixed time.</p>
<p>The board also wants Facebook to conduct a review of the role its platform played in contributing to a narrative of election fraud &#8212; and publish the report.</p>
<p>Facebook is not bound by FOB policy recommendations. But it is bound by individual case decisions and has seven days to implement them (although, in this case, it&#8217;s a bit of a meaningless deadline &#8212; but presumably Facebook will need to begin its review of Trump&#8217;s suspension within a week).</p>
<p>Thorning-Schmidt said the policy recommendations build on what she called &#8220;a pattern of recommendations&#8221; it has issued in other cases this year that she said &#8220;called out shortcomings in Facebook&#8217;s content policies and called for far greater transparency from the company&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decision made by the Oversight Board today illustrates, in my view, exactly why independent oversight matters. Anyone who is concerned about Facebook&#8217;s excessive concentration of power should welcome the Oversight Board clearly telling Facebook that they cannot invent new, unwritten rules when it suits them,&#8221; she went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;The board&#8217;s purpose is to shift Facebook from an arbitrary approach to content moderation to one where Facebook&#8217;s rules are clear, transparent and treat all users fairly. This is important not just for users in the United States but users all over the world, including the countless political leaders, campaigners and dissidents around the world who depend on Facebook to engage with communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A session with journalists, the FOB was asked whether it wasn&#8217;t itself shirking its responsibility by bouncing a decision on Trump right back to Facebook. Thorning-Schmidt denied it was passing the buck &#8212; arguing it&#8217;s given the company clarity on the steps it needs to take to move past the current impasse.</p>
<p>&#8220;The board has made a clear decision. Facebook&#8217;s initial suspension of president Trump was correct. That&#8217;s very clear. But also we&#8217;re saying that an indefinite ban was not acceptable &#8212; and the reason why is because Facebook actually failed to follow its own rules on removing harmful content by choosing an indefinite suspension,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to point out that this is perhaps more a decision that concerns Facebook and its users, rather than Trump. Because what we&#8217;re basically saying is that it can&#8217;t be left up to Facebook to just choose their own penalty for users &#8212; they have to follow their own rules. If users have to follow the community standards and the values of Facebook and Instagram, Facebook has to do the same. So we&#8217;re basically saying that all users are equal and that Facebook also has an obligation towards the community standards &#8212; and that is to follow their own rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>McConnell confirmed that Facebook&#8217;s second decision on Trump could indeed be appealed or referred back to the board again &#8212; extending the uncertainty around the future of the former U.S. president&#8217;s Facebook deplatforming for (potentially) even longer than six months. So it&#8217;s clear that the divisive issue of Trump&#8217;s social media speech will remain in play for months more at the very least.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly a substantial possibility [the board will be asked to decide Trump&#8217;s case again in future],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if Facebook follows our recommendations and does what we&#8217;re hoping&#8230; this time the decision will be deliberate, it will be in accordance with Facebook&#8217;s rules, it will be clearly explained, it will be on the basis of actual findings about severity of the conduct and the possibility of likelihood of future harm &#8212; and, at that point, our expectation and hope is that it will be a much easier matter because Facebook will have done what it should have done the first time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to emphasize that this is not the only case in which Facebook has engaged in ad-hoc-ery,&#8221; he added. &#8220;As we see so many &#8212; we&#8217;ve gotten over 20,000 appeals from users &#8212; who are frustrated at not knowing what the rules were, not knowing why Facebook took the decision it took. A kind of bewildering mess. And I believe that the very existence of an independent oversight board is designed to change the culture of content moderation on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Facebook knows that there is someone looking over their shoulder and insisting upon clarity, transparency, consistency, fairness, then it is &#8212; I think &#8212; much more likely that we&#8217;ll be seeing some internal reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook has responded briefly to the board&#8217;s ruling, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/facebook-oversight-board-decision-trump/">writing</a> that it welcomes the panel&#8217;s upholding of its decision to ban Trump.</p>
<p>It added that it will now consider the requirement to re-examine the penalty it imposed and &#8220;determine an action that is clear and proportionate&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the meantime, Mr. Trump’s accounts remain suspended,&#8221; Facebook added.</p>
<h2>The rest is&#8230; silence?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly been a very quiet five months on mainstream social media since Trump had his social media ALL CAPS megaphone unceremoniously shut down in the wake of his supporters&#8217; violent storming of the capital.</p>
<p>For more on the background to Trump&#8217;s deplatforming do make time for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/facebook-trump-oversight-board-decision/">this excellent explainer</a> by TechCrunch&#8217;s Taylor Hatmaker.</p>
<p>But the short version is that Trump finally appeared to have torched the last of his social media rule-breaking chances after he succeeded in fomenting an actual insurrection on U.S. soil on January 6. Doing so with the help of the massive, mainstream social media platforms whose community standards don&#8217;t, as a rule, give a thumbs up to violent insurrection&#8230;</p>

<p>However the platforms <em>had</em> given Trump a pass for years, letting him bully, abuse and spread hate, <em>and</em> amplify and launder disinformation about anything he didn&#8217;t agree with &#8212; including his presidential rival, Joe Biden. And later the election itself (which, for the record, Trump lost and Biden won but you&#8217;d never know it if your &#8216;touchstone of truth&#8217; was the self-pity-prism of Trump&#8217;s reality-denying tweets.)</p>
<p>January 6&#8217;s chaos and violence shouldn&#8217;t have been a shock to anyone, given that Trump playbook has always been to say the quiet part out loud &#8212; frequently in ALL CAPS on the most mainstream social media platforms. But these tech giants made like they were shocked anyway, and suddenly sprung into action &#8212; finally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">suspending Trump en masse</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter, a long time Trump apologist &#8212; whose platform happened to garner massive global attention by merit of being Trump&#8217;s antisocial megaphone &#8212; announced he was banned for good. (It has recently been surveying users for views on its policies toward world leaders and got nearly 49,000 people responding to its call for feedback &#8212; but has yet to announce any next steps or policy changes.)</p>
<p>Facebook also banned Trump, initially for &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">at least two weeks</a>&#8221; &#8212; and then &#8220;indefinitely&#8221;. But it quickly threw a curve ball, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/facebook-oversight-board-trump-facebook-suspension/">saying it would refer this &#8216;indefinite&#8217; ban to the FOB</a> &#8212; outsourcing the possibility of a Trump Second Act on its platform, if its hand-picked &#8216;external experts&#8217; decided to make it so, neatly deflecting flak from its decision to ban Trump in the process.</p>
<p>The homebrew review body had only started accepting cases in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-oversight-board-controversy/">October 2020</a> &#8212; delivering its first batch of content review decisions in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/facebooks-oversight-body-overturns-four-takedowns-and-issues-a-slew-of-policy-tweaks/">January</a>.</p>
<p>This has been quotidian work down in Facebook&#8217;s content review trenches (nipples; nazis; lots of hate speech) that could hardly prepare the still-bedding-in FOB for making an irrevocable call on Trump.</p>
<p>Indeed, in a prefiguring of today&#8217;s indecisive FOB ruling, board member Alan Rusbridger appeared to chafe at the Manichean division available to it &#8212; to unban or not to unban &#8212; by hankering, during a House of Lords testimony in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/facebooks-oversight-board-already-a-bit-frustrated-and-it-hasnt-made-a-call-on-trump-ban-yet/">March</a>, for the equivalent of a soccer-style &#8216;yellow&#8217; card option (so that &#8220;if you didn’t want to ban somebody for life but you wanted to have a ‘sin bin’ so that if they misbehaved you could chuck them back off again&#8221;, as he put it). But the Board&#8217;s rules and bylaws had already been prewritten by Facebook.</p>
<p>The weeks rolled on and after being swamped with responses to its call for public feedback the FOB opted to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/facebooks-decision-review-body-to-take-weeks-longer-over-trump-ban-call/">give itself a bit more time</a> to decide Trump&#8217;s case &#8212; doubtlessly feeling the glare of global significance.</p>
<p>Among those petitioning very publicly for Trump to stay banned from Facebook are Facebook&#8217;s former CSO, Alex Stamos, and Facebook&#8217;s current VP of spin, the former deputy prime minister of the U.K., <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/referring-trump-suspension-to-oversight-board/">Nick Clegg</a>. &#8220;We believe our decision was necessary and right,&#8221; the latter wrote in January vis-a-vis the Trump ban &#8212; before &#8216;cheersing&#8217; a pint of homebrew self-review Kool Aid by adding glibly: &#8220;Given its significance, we think it is important for the board to review it and reach an independent judgment on whether it should be upheld.&#8221;</p>
<p>The roster of civil society organizations urging that Trump <em>not</em> get back the keys to Facebook&#8217;s eyeball kingdom is as predictably long as Trump was relentlessly loud when he was allowed to SHOUT on social media.</p>
<p>But in the wake of the former president&#8217;s big tech deplatforming, a number of politicians outside the U.S. did a verbal equivalent of that shivery thing when you feel like someone is walking over your grave &#8212; expressing misgivings that tech giants could just deCAPSitate an actual president. Some did also seize the moment to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/europe-seizes-on-social-medias-purging-of-trump-to-bang-the-drum-for-regulation/">press the case for platform regulation</a> too, though.</p>
<p>Every nail-bitingly high stakes decision for the future of democracy which Facebook gets to casually flip to the FOB for &#8216;review&#8217; is another nail in the coffin of actual accountability, critics say.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Facebook&#8217;s slickest crisis PR yet; a performative mockery of democratic oversight as Facebook&#8217;s hand-picked &#8216;high court&#8217; of experts presides opaquely, and opines academically, over a fantastically minuscule number of decisions vs the countless billions that its platform configures and imposes on individuals, communities and societies all around the world <em>on a daily basis</em>.</p>

<p>Of course the FOB hasn&#8217;t been invested with policy-making power by Facebook. All it gets to make are token decisions to provide Facebook with some self-generated PR to set against the ongoing conflagration over how its arbitrary decisions and blackbox algorithms control and shape so much global speech&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">A private greedy opaque fickle institution that controls the flow of public debate and spies on everyone and isolates our information flows from each other and makes money off of hate is issuing an edict today, as you may have heard, with great fanfare. </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>One of these token decisions happens to be about Trump &#8212; and today&#8217;s ruling is certainly the FOB&#8217;s most significant yet.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s interesting to see a degree of pushback from the board. If Facebook had hoped it had fashioned an obedient, difficult-decision-outsourcing vehicle that it could use to sidestep blame by offloading the trickiest content-related decisions it may be disappointed to find its home-made review body has asked it to go back and make a proper call.</p>
<p>Even if that might mean Trump getting his megaphone back after all.</p>
<p>But by combining the requirement for Facebook &#8216;look again&#8217; at its Trump ban with a slew of fresh policy recommendations that push it to standardize its rules and processes, the board is putting pressure on the tech giant to essentially agree to platform-wide changes whilst its decisions are under the glare of the public spotlight &#8212; aka, the sort of changes that Facebook&#8217;s rules and bylaws for the FOB don&#8217;t actually empower it to make.</p>
<p>So &#8212; you could say &#8212; well played.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the board remains a self-regulatory vehicle. Its membership has been stacked by Facebook from the start &#8212; which made it a baseline requirement that recruits to its (indirect) payroll are &#8220;committed to free expression&#8221;.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://oversightboard.com/meet-the-board/">first cohort</a> (of 20 members) includes law professors, former journalists and politicians, free speech and digital rights champions&#8230; In short, it&#8217;s staffed with Facebook&#8217;s kind of experts; principled intelligentsia who can gloss its self-regulatory vehicle with external gravitas and respectability, by lending their deep critical and academic thinking, while simultaneously aligning with its speech maximizing direction.</p>
<p>So this game still looks like a win-win for Facebook.</p>
<p>If the &#8216;worst&#8217; outcome (for Facebook) is that it gets, not just simple blame-deflection, but some sharp pointers on how to transform its baffling mess of ad hoc rules into something that better resembles a globally acceptable speech moderation standard then it could get to perform all sorts of reputation-washing off of the back of the FOB&#8217;s claimed consensus.</p>
<p>That said, the worst outcome for Facebook may be that it&#8217;s far too rotten for reform. That it ignores the board&#8217;s recommendations and the board then bites back. (Notably, the FOB did mention today that it&#8217;s setting up a working group to monitor Facebook&#8217;s implementation of its decisions and also how it responds to its policy recommendation. So the message from its hand-picked experts remains: &#8216;Facebook, we are watching you&#8217;.)</p>
<p>But what of Trump? He hasn&#8217;t been taking being cancelled on social media too kindly. Or, well, we assume not, given how much he railed against big tech &#8216;censorship&#8217; before they pulled the plug. But we must admit to not having remembered to care &#8212; because, quite frankly, we&#8217;ve been enjoying not reading his non-existent tweets and posts this whole, glorious time.</p>
<p>For evidence of Trump&#8217;s FOMO you need only look at the &#8216;exclusive&#8217; news story published by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-launches-new-communications-platform-months-after-twitter-facebook-ban">Fox News</a> yesterday &#8212; which reported that the former president has launched his own &#8220;communications platform&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The space will allow Trump to post comments, images, and videos,&#8221; Fox wrote, suggesting Trump may have finally discovered the existence of the Internet, months after he was forcibly logged off of Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>Although the personal blog &#8212; for that is what a website which publishes the ravings of one person is &#8212; which is named, much like the (Facebook) Oversight Board, with a very Trumpian mixture of self-aggrandizement and homespun normalcy (&#8216;From the Desk of Donald J. Trump&#8217;) &#8212; appears to have been active since March 24, judging by date stamps on the handful of posts.</p>
<p>But has anyone been listening to Trump the blogger? Did any stocks tank when he typed alone in anger? If a Trump blog post is published in a readership vacuum can less than zero fucks be given?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s strange to think of Trump as just so much outrageous social media content. But remove the shouty mouth from the megaphone and &#8212; sad truth is &#8212; it&#8217;s not the platforms that fell silent.</p>
<p>Whether Trump gets his megaphone back from Facebook in another half year remains to be seen. In the meanwhile enjoy the silence.</p>

Lynk’s experts cover a wide range of industries and sectors and include C-suite executives, independent consultants, lawyers, engineers, financial analysts and scientists. The platform also has collaboration tools, so teams can automatically transcribe question-and-answer sessions, search transcripts and share notes.</p>
<p>“Our platform capabilities, the scope and depth of our network and our customer service that’s paired with technology is really quite synergistic with how UBS is looking at their business,” Lynk co-founder and chief executive officer Peggy Choi told TechCrunch. “They have demonstrated a very strong innovation track record in the equity research space, so this is a great extension to their suite of offerings.”</p>
<p>During the pandemic, Lynk’s clients in the investment sector have used it to perform research and due diligence on potential investments remotely, which Choi expects to continue even after travel picks up again.</p>
<p>“Relying on on-the-ground experts, working with them to verify assumptions and develop convictions before making an investment is a must,” said Choi. “We’re really seeing a structural change and that is also what UBS is hearing from its customers.”</p>
<p>In a press statement, UBS Global Head of Research Dan Dowd said, “We are proud of our innovation track record and are highly focused on helping investors get to the crux of key investment debates as rapidly as possible. Showcasing Lynk’s technology and expertise has the potential to substantially accelerate the investment processes of our clients.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">About 180 million people globally suffer from infertility. In the United States, <a href="https://www.fertilityanswers.com/13-stats-know-infertility/#:~:text=The%20natural%20fertility%20rate%20is,will%20have%20to%20try%20again">one in eight </a>families have trouble conceiving. The statistics are only getting worse, as male infertility and miscarriages continue to increase.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alifehealth.com/">Alife Health</a>, a San Francisco-based startup founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paxton-maeder-york-00108736">Paxton Maeder-York</a>, thinks it can help. The startup wants to use artificial intelligence to increase fertility outcomes. Specifically, it wants to optimize in vitro fertilization, a fertility treatment that requires a series of expensive and emotionally-taxing procedures with varied success rates.</p>
<p>Founded last year, the startup just raised a $9.5 million seed round, led by Lux Capital. Other investment firms include Amplo, IA Ventures and Springbank Collective as well as angel investors such as Anne Wojcicki, the founder and CEO of 23andMe, Fred Moll, the founder of Intuitive Surgical and Auris, and Amira Yahyaoui, the founder of Mos and Sequoia Scout.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I personally believe that improving the quality of care through personalized treatments and reducing costs by increasing the success outcome rate can be incredibly impactful here, not just for the broader population but also specifically for minority groups,” Maeder-York said.</p>
<p>The founder began his career building surgical robots to fight lung cancer at Auris Health which was acquired by Johnson &amp; Johnson in 2019. Now, he’s onto finding a way to help physicians and patients go through the process of IVF.</p>
<h2><strong>FYI, IVF</strong></h2>
<p>In vitro fertilization, or IVF, takes on average<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ivf-treatment-costs-guide.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20N.C.S.L.%2C%20the,Clinics%20define%20an%20I.V.F"> three to six</a> cycles to get pregnant, and each cycle can cost between $10,000 to $20,000 in the United States. Every woman who goes through the process has to be injected with hormones weekly or biweekly &#8211; and even then, success is varied. And beyond steep costs and a long process, anyone who goes through the IVF process often has to endure the emotional toll.</p>
<p>Alife Health could alleviate some uncertainty around the complex process if it succeeds.</p>
<p>Currently, there are startups that focus on disrupting IVF <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/fertility-startup-carrot-raises-3-6-million-to-make-ivf-and-egg-freezing-more-affordable/">from its cost </a>to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/mate-fertility-is-aiming-to-create-a-franchise-of-fertility-clinics-open-to-everyone/"> its accessibility</a>. Maeder-York thinks that there is no single point solution that can fix the process, so he wants to optimize each part, step by step, from education and awareness, and clinical workflows to the actual embryo selection.</p>
<p>While Alife Health’s long-term goal is to use AI in all aspects of the IVF process, at this point, the technology is only used in one step for Alife Health: the embryo selection process.</p>
<p>Alife Health plans to begin its AI-powered IVF solution through embryo selection. During IVF, future parents might create multiple embryos. It’s then on the doctor to look at that embryo image through a microscope and figure out which is most likely to survive, taking into account patient information.</p>
<p>Alife Health is inserting machine learning based on a massive set of historical data it has aggregated, into the embryo selection equation. Maeder-York said that they plan to use data to understand what the “optimal order of transfer is” and then improve chances of a pregnancy, so people don’t have to go through IVF for the third or fourth time.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s been trained on thousands and thousands of images, knowing that this image and this patient turned into a successful pregnancy, “he said. Once machine learning finds a pattern it can move forward with a recommendation and help future parents prioritize which embryos to transfer.</p>
<h2><strong>Pandemic baby</strong></h2>
<p>Alife Health is not alone. Two other startups,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/this-startup-says-its-ai-can-better-spot-a-healthy-embryo-and-improve-ivf-success/">Embryonic</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/fertility-startup-mojo-wants-to-take-the-trial-and-error-out-of-ivf/">Mojo</a>, claim they have the AI needed to spot a healthy embryo and improve IVF success.</p>
<p>Israel-based Embryonic is in the early stages of its business and has minimal efficacy proof at this point. Mojo uses microscopy hardware and AI software to focus on sperm counts and then better pick strong sperm for the IVF. Internally testing of Mojo Pro shows that the system is 97% accurate compared to manual sperm counting.</p>
<p>Alife Health is a hardware agnostic program so unlike Mojo, for example, a provider doesn’t need to use or buy a special microscope to use its product.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/deenashakir">Deena Shakir</a>, partner at Lux Capital, is joining Alife Health’s board as part of the translation. Shakir said she spent over a year meeting with the team and other IVF-focused startups to develop her thesis before eventually cutting a check. She pointed out a number of reasons that Alife Health stood out to her, primarily its focus on an end-to-end solution at the IVF process, but also its clinician-friendly approach.</p>
<p>“Other kludgey solutions require additional interfaces, hardware, [and] time,” she said. “Clinicians don&#8217;t have an appetite for that in their daily workflows. It needs to be intuitive.”</p>

<p>Along with being a software-only solution, Alife Health sees part of its competitive edge as its partnerships with clinics. It has spent years cultivating a network of IVF clinics &#8211; and their data on prior cases, treatments and outcomes &#8211; to get a representative set that could be used to help any person receiving IVF treatment, it says.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, women have been consistently underrepresented in research and minority women, black women have been incredibly underrepresented in research,” Maeder-York said. “The fact that our data set is so well stratified and representative of these groups means that when we [see] a patient of one off these minority groups, we’re going to be in a really unique position to give them answers and personalized care.”</p>
<p>Alife Health declined to release information about the efficacy of its AI, and it is still yet to get regulatory approval. Fittingly, millions of dollars should help it get to this next, and crucial phase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://bitso.com/">Bitso</a>, a regulated crypto exchange in Latin America, announced today it has raised $250 million in a Series C round of funding that values the company at $2.2 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tiger Global and Coatue co-led the round, which also included participation from Paradigm, BOND &amp; Valor Capital Group and existing backers QED, Pantera Capital and Kaszek.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The news caught our attention for several reasons. For one, it comes just four months after the startup raised $62 million in a Series B round. Secondly, the company believes the funding makes it the most valuable crypto platform in Latin America. And lastly, it also makes the company one of the most highly valued fintechs in the region.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Last year was a good one for Bitso, which says it processed more than $1.2 billion in international payments &#8212; including remittances and payments between companies &#8212; during 2020 alone. Bitso says it also has surpassed 2 million users. These two milestones, the company argues, is evidence of the growing use of crypto as an everyday financial tool in the region.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Demand for crypto assets and crypto-enabled financial products have soared in popularity both for individuals and businesses in the region, according to Bitso, which aims to be “the safest, most transparent, and only regulatory compliant platform” in Latin America. The company also says it’s the only player in the region to offer crypto-insurance for its client&#8217;s funds.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With investors expecting a Latin American cryptocurrency boom, Mexico&#8217;s Bitso raises $62 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/with-investors-expecting-a-latin-american-cryptocurrency-boom-mexicos-bitso-raises-62-million/embed/#?secret=chCpdGxxYu" data-secret="chCpdGxxYu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The growth of the crypto ecosystem this year has been remarkable. It took Bitso six years to get its first million clients. Now — less than 10 months later — we have reached the 2 million mark,” said Bitso co-founder and CEO Daniel Vogel. But the metrics he is most proud of are that Bitso has also more than doubled the assets on its platform in the last five months and that its transacting volume during the 2021 first quarter exceeded the transaction volume it did in all of 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitso was founded in January 2014 and acquired its first customer in April of that year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitso’s mission, put simply, is to build next-generation borderless financial services for consumers and businesses alike. “Cryptocurrencies are the future of finance and Bitso makes the future available today,” the company says.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Bitso offers products and services for individuals and businesses to use crypto in their everyday life,” Vogel said. “In some parts of the world, crypto is associated with speculation. Bitso’s customers rely on the technology for everyday uses from receiving remittances to engaging in international commerce.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Bitso says its “global-minded” product offerings fit the needs of local customers in Mexico, Argentina and now Brazil, where it just launched its retail operations. The company plans to use its new capital toward broadening its capabilities and product offering. It also plans to expand its operations in other Latin American countries in the coming months. In January, the Financial Superintendence of Colombia announced Bitso as one of the authorized companies in its Sandbox and crypto pilot program.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitso&#8217;s upcoming products include a crypto derivatives platform and interest bearing accounts for crypto.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is a pivotal moment for the future of finance in Latin America,” Vogel told TechCrunch. “We see a significant amount of traditional financial infrastructure in the region being replaced by crypto. We plan to use this funding to continue that trend by expanding our product offering for individuals and businesses.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Naturally, Bitso&#8217;s investors are bullish on the company’s potential.</p>
<p dir="ltr">QED Investors co-founder and managing partner Nigel Morris admits that in the past he was “a crypto denier.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“For the longest time, we didn&#8217;t see a way [that] crypto fit [into our portfolio]. It wasn&#8217;t clear until recently that the use cases for crypto expanded much beyond speculative trading. There are now a whole series of conventional banking products that we can wrap around it,” Morris told TechCrunch.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Bitso’s mission, he said, is to “make crypto useful” and QED believes the company is succeeding at doing just that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Daniel and the entire Bitso team is passionate about taking the mystique out of crypto. Crypto is not going away; it’s going to be here for the future,” Morris said. “By sitting at the intersection of crypto and traditional financial institutions, Bitso has a promise to provide lower-cost, friction-free financial services to entire populations of individuals who otherwise would be excluded &#8212; a laudable and unique mission indeed.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitso, he added, is learning from the crypto experience in the U.S. and around the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Not making the same mistakes and leaning into the emerging regulatory landscape has been a competitive advantage to Bitso&#8217;s success in Mexico,” Morris said. “As Bitso grows throughout the regions, they certainly have a leg up and might even leapfrog crypto adoption in the U.S.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Crypto is rapidly gaining adoption in Latin America,” said Tiger Global Partner Scott Shleifer, in a written statement. “We are excited to partner with Bitso and believe they have the right team and platform to increase share in this growing market.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Founded in 2014, Bitso has more than 300 employees across 25 different countries. That compares to 116 employees last year at this time. In particular, its growth in Brazil is increasing exponentially.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve gone from 1 to 26 Bitsonauts already based in Brazil, with many more working from abroad, and plan to 3X our number of hires in Brazil by the end of the year,” Vogel said, who acknowledged that the pandemic really impacted his company via the shift to remote work. “As we expand our reach into new territories, it has become a lot easier to meet staffing needs when the requirements are based on knowledge over geography.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitso’s leadership is mostly based in Mexico, but the company also has offices in Buenos Aires, São Paolo and Gibraltar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Halfway through my Monday afternoon workout last week, I got a message from a security researcher with a screenshot of my Peloton account data.</p>
<p>My Peloton profile is set to private and my friend&#8217;s list is deliberately zero, so nobody can view my profile, age, city, or workout history. But a bug allowed anyone to pull users&#8217; private account data directly from Peloton&#8217;s servers, even with their profile set to private.</p>
<p>Peloton, the at-home fitness brand synonymous with its indoor stationary bike and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-apologizes-agrees-to-treadmill-recall/">beleaguered treadmills</a>, has more than three million subscribers. Even President Biden is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/politics/biden-peloton.html">said to own one</a>. The exercise bike alone costs upwards of $1,800, but anyone can sign up for a monthly subscription to join a broad variety of classes.</p>
<p>As Biden was inaugurated (and his Peloton moved to the White House — <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/security/a35190713/joe-biden-peloton-white-house-security-risk/">assuming the Secret Service let him</a>), Jan Masters, a security researcher at Pen Test Partners, found he could make unauthenticated requests to Peloton&#8217;s API for user account data without it checking to make sure the person was allowed to request it. (An API allows two things to talk to each other over the internet, like a Peloton bike and the company&#8217;s servers storing user data.)</p>
<p>But the exposed API let him — and anyone else on the internet — access a Peloton user&#8217;s age, gender, city, weight, workout statistics, and if it was the user&#8217;s birthday, details that are hidden when users&#8217; profile pages are set to private.</p>
<p>Masters reported the leaky API to Peloton on January 20 with a 90-day deadline to fix the bug, the standard window time that security researchers give to companies to fix bugs before details are made public.</p>
<p>But that deadline came and went, the bug wasn&#8217;t fixed, and Masters hadn&#8217;t heard back from the company, aside from an initial email acknowledging receipt of the bug report. Instead, Peloton only restricted access to its API to its members. But that just meant anyone could sign up with a monthly membership and get access to the API again.</p>
<p>TechCrunch contacted Peloton after the deadline lapsed to ask why the vulnerability report had been ignored, and Peloton confirmed yesterday that it had fixed the vulnerability. (TechCrunch held this story until the bug was fixed in order to prevent misuse.)</p>
<p>Peloton spokesperson Amelise Lane provided the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s a priority for Peloton to keep our platform secure and we’re always looking to improve our approach and process for working with the external security community. Through our Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure program, a security researcher informed us that he was able to access our API and see information that’s available on a Peloton profile. We took action, and addressed the issues based on his initial submissions, but we were slow to update the researcher about our remediation efforts. Going forward, we will do better to work collaboratively with the security research community and respond more promptly when vulnerabilities are reported. We want to thank Ken Munro for submitting his reports through our CVD program and for being open to working with us to resolve these issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>Masters has since put up <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/tour-de-peloton-exposed-user-data/?=050420210000">a blog post</a> explaining the vulnerabilities in more detail.</p>
<p>Munro, who founded Pen Test Partners, told TechCrunch: &#8220;Peloton had a bit of a fail in responding to the vulnerability report, but after a nudge in the right direction, took appropriate action. A vulnerability disclosure program isn’t just a page on a website; it requires coordinated action across the organisation.&#8221;</p>
<p>But questions remain for Peloton. When asked repeatedly, the company declined to say why it had not responded to Masters&#8217; vulnerability report. It&#8217;s also not known if anyone maliciously exploited the vulnerabilities, such as mass-scraping account data.</p>
<p>Facebook, LinkedIn, and Clubhouse have all <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/tour-de-peloton-exposed-user-data/?=050420210000">fallen victim to scraping attacks</a> that abuse access to APIs to pull in data about users on their platforms. But Peloton declined to confirm if it had logs to rule out any malicious exploitation of its leaky API.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/zeta-global-acquires-commenting-service-disqus/">Disqus</a>, a commenting plugin that&#8217;s used by a number of news websites and which can share user data for ad targeting purposes, has got into hot water in Norway for tracking users without their consent.</p>
<p>The local data protection agency said today it has <a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/news/2021/intent-to-issue--25-million-fine-to-disqus-inc/">notified</a> the U.S.-based company of an intent to fine it €2.5 million (~$3M) for failures to comply with requirements in Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on accountability, lawfulness and transparency.</p>
<p>Disqus&#8217; parent, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/zeta-global-acquires-commenting-service-disqus/">Zeta Global</a>, has been contacted for comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Datatilsynet said it acted following a 2019 investigation in Norway&#8217;s national press &#8212; which found that default settings buried in the Disqus&#8217; plug-in opted sites into sharing user data on millions of users in markets including the U.S.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Uncovering the Disqus data machine: <a href="https://twitter.com/disqus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@disqus</a> shared the personal data of tens of millions of users without them or the websites knowing about it. thread &#8211; 1/13 <a href="https://t.co/bLW4Gl2Rhf">pic.twitter.com/bLW4Gl2Rhf</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Martin Gundersen (@martingund) <a href="https://twitter.com/martingund/status/1207327648093003777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>And while in most of Europe the company was found to have applied an opt-in to gather consent from users to be tracked &#8212; likely in order to avoid trouble with the GDPR &#8212; it appears to have been unaware that the regulation applies in Norway.</p>
<p>Norway is not a member of the European Union but is in the European Economic Area &#8212; which adopted the GDPR in July 2018, slightly after it came into force elsewhere in the EU. (Norway transposed the regulation into national law also in July 2018.)</p>
<p>The Norwegian DPA writes that Disqus&#8217; unlawful data-sharing has &#8220;predominantly been an issue in Norway&#8221; &#8212; and says that seven websites are affected: NRK.no/ytring, P3.no, tv.2.no/broom, khrono.no, adressa.no, rights.no and document.no.</p>
<p>&#8220;Disqus has argued that their practices could be based on the legitimate interest balancing test as a lawful basis, despite the company being unaware that the GDPR applied to data subjects in Norway,&#8221; the DPA&#8217;s director-general, Bjørn Erik Thon, goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on our investigation so far, we believe that Disqus could not rely on legitimate interest as a legal basis for tracking across websites, services or devices, profiling and disclosure of personal data for marketing purposes, and that this type of tracking would require consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our preliminary conclusion is that Disqus has processed personal data unlawfully. However, our investigation also discovered serious issues regarding transparency and accountability,&#8221; Thon added.</p>
<p>The DPA said the infringements are serious and have affected &#8220;several hundred thousands of individuals&#8221;, adding that the affected personal data &#8220;are highly private and may relate to minors or reveal political opinions&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tracking, profiling and disclosure of data was invasive and nontransparent,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>The DPA has given Disqus until May 31 to comment on the findings ahead of issuing a fine decision.</p>

<h3>Publishers reminded of their responsibility</h3>
<p>Datatilsynet has also fired a warning shot at local publishers who were using the Disqus platform &#8212; pointing out that website owners &#8220;are also responsible under the GDPR for which third parties they allow on their websites&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, in other words, even if you didn&#8217;t know about a default data-sharing setting that&#8217;s not an excuse because it&#8217;s your legal responsibility to know what any code you put on your website is doing with user data.</p>
<p>The DPA adds that &#8220;in the present case&#8221; it has focused the investigation on Disqus &#8212; providing publishers with an opportunity to get their houses in order ahead of any future checks it might make.</p>
<p>Norway&#8217;s DPA also has some admirably plain language to explain the &#8220;serious&#8221; problem of profiling people without their consent. &#8220;Hidden tracking and profiling is very invasive,&#8221; says Thon. &#8220;Without information that someone is using our personal data, we lose the opportunity to exercise our rights to access, and to object to the use of our personal data for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;An aggravating circumstance is that disclosure of personal data for programmatic advertising entails a high risk that individuals will lose control over who processes their personal data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zooming out, the issue of adtech industry tracking and GDPR compliance has become a major headache for DPAs across Europe &#8212; which have been repeatedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/">slammed for failing to enforce the law in this area</a> since GDPR came into application in May 2018.</p>
<p>In the UK, for example (which transposed the GDPR before Brexit so still has an equivalent data protection framework <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ac1cbaef-d8bf-49b4-b11d-1fcc96dde0e1">for now</a>), the ICO has been investigating GDPR complaints against real-time bidding&#8217;s (RTB) use of personal data to run behavioral ads for <em>years</em> &#8212; yet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">hasn&#8217;t issued a single fine or order</a>, despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/adtech-told-to-keep-calm-and-fix-its-lawfulness-problem/">warning the industry that it&#8217;s acting unlawfully</a>.</p>
<p>The regulator is now being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">sued</a> by complainants over its inaction.</p>
<p>Ireland&#8217;s DPC, meanwhile &#8212; which is the lead DPA for a swathe of adtech giants which site their regional HQ in the country &#8212; has a number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">open GDPR investigations</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/adtech-veteran-quantcast-is-latest-tech-giant-to-face-gdpr-privacy-probe/">into adtech</a> (including RTB). But has also failed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/irelands-data-watchdog-slammed-for-letting-adtech-carry-on-biggest-breach-of-all-time/">issue any decisions in this area</a> almost three years after the regulation begun being applied.</p>
<p>Its lack of action on adtech complaints has contributed significantly to <a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/max-schrems-and-helen-dixon-clash-over-irish-gdpr-enforcement-on-big-tech-40363344.html">rising domestic (and international) pressure</a> on its GDPR enforcement record more generally, including from the European Commission. (And it&#8217;s notable that the latter&#8217;s most recent legislative proposals in the digital arena include provisions that seek to avoid the risk of similar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">enforcement bottlenecks</a>.)</p>
<p>The story on adtech and the GDPR looks a little different in Belgium, though, where the DPA appears to be inching toward a major slap-down of current adtech practices.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">A preliminary report last year</a> by its investigatory division called into question the legal standard of the consents being gathered via a flagship industry framework, designed by the IAB Europe. This so-called &#8216;Transparency and Consent&#8217; framework (TCF) was found not to comply with the GDPR&#8217;s principles of transparency, fairness and accountability, or the lawfulness of processing.</p>
<p>A final decision is expected on that case this year &#8212; but if the DPA upholds the division&#8217;s findings it could deal a massive blow to the behavioral ad industry&#8217;s ability to track and target Europeans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With cybercrime on course to be a <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/annual-cybercrime-report-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6 trillion problem</a> this year, organizations are throwing ever more resources at the issue to avoid being a target. Now, a startup that&#8217;s built a platform to help them stress-test the investments that they have made into their security IT is announcing some funding on the back of strong demand from the market for its tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://cymulate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cymulate</a>, which lets organizations and their partners run machine-based attack simulations on their networks to determine vulnerabilities and then automatically receive guidance around how to fix what is not working well enough, has picked up $45 million, funding that the startup &#8212; co-headquartered in Israel and New York &#8212; will be using to continue investing in its platform and to ramp up its operations after doubling its revenues last year on the back of a customer list that now numbers 300 large enterprises and mid-market companies, including the Euronext stock exchange network as well as service providers such as NTT and Telit.</p>
<p>London-based One Peak Partners is leading this Series C, with previous investors Susquehanna Growth Equity (SGE), Vertex Ventures Israel, Vertex Growth and Dell Technologies Capital also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to Eyal Wachsman, the CEO and co-founder, Cymulate&#8217;s technology has been built not just to improve an organization&#8217;s security, but an automated, machine-learning-based system to better understand how to get the most out of the security investments that have already been made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision is to be the largest cybersecurity &#8216;consulting firm&#8217; without consultants,&#8221; he joked.</p>
<p>The valuation is not being disclosed but as some measure of what is going on, David Klein, managing partner at One Peak, said in an interview that that he expects Cymulate to hit a $1 billion valuation within two years at the rate it&#8217;s growing and bringing in revenue right now. The startup has now raised $71 million, so it&#8217;s likely the valuation is in the mid-hundreds of millions. (We&#8217;ll continue trying to get a better number to have a more specific data point here.)</p>
<p>Cymulate &#8212; pronounced &#8220;sigh-mulate&#8221;, like the &#8220;cy&#8221; in &#8220;cyber&#8221; and a pun of &#8220;simulate&#8221;) is cloud-based but works across both cloud and on-premises environments and the idea is that it complements work done by (human) security teams both inside and outside of an organization, as well as the security IT investments &#8212; in terms of software or hardware) that they have already made.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not replace &#8212; we bring back the power of the expert by validating security controls and checking whether everything is working correctly to optimize a company&#8217;s security posture,&#8221; Wachsman said. &#8220;Most of the time, we find our customers are using only 20% of the capabilities that they have. The main idea is that we have become a standard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s tools are based in part on the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework</a>, a knowledge base of threats, tactics and techniques used by a number of other cybersecurity services, including a number of others building continuous validation services that compete with Cymulate. These include the likes of FireEye, Palo Alto Networks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/randori-introduces-red-team-attack-platform-as-a-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Randori</a>, Khosla-backed <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2019/05/attackiq-raises-17-6m-in-series-b-financing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AttackIQ</a> and many more.</p>
<p>Although Cymulate is optimized to help customers better use the security tools they already have, it is not meant to replace other security apps, Wachsman noted, even if the by-product might become buying less of those apps in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe my message every day when talking with security experts is to stop buying more security products,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;They won’t help defend you from the next attack. You can use what you&#8217;ve already purchased as long as you configure it well.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his words, Cymulate acts as a &#8220;black box&#8221; on the network, where it integrates with security and other software (it can also work without integrating but integrations allow for a deeper analysis). After running its simulations, it produces a map of the network and its threat profile, an executive summary of the situation that can be presented to management and a more technical rundown, which includes recommendations for mitigations and remediations.</p>
<p>Alongside validating and optimising existing security apps and identifying vulnerabilities in the network, Cymulate also has built special tools to fit different kinds of use cases that are particularly relevant to how businesses are operation today. They include evaluating remote working deployments, the state of a network following an M&amp;A process, the security landscape of an organization that links up with third parties in supply chain arrangements, how well an organization&#8217;s security architecture is meeting (or potentially conflicting) with privacy and other kinds of regulatory compliance requirements, and it has built a &#8220;purple team&#8221; deployment, where in cases where security teams do not have the resources for running separate &#8220;red teams&#8221; to stress test something, blue teams at the organization can use Cymulate to build a machine learning-based &#8220;team&#8221; to do this.</p>
<p>The fact that Cymulate has built the infrastructure to run all of these processes speaks to a lot of potential of what more it could build, especially as our threat landscape, and how we do business, both continue to evolve. Even as it is, though, opportunity today is a massive one, with Gartner <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3889055" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimating</a> that some $170 billion will be spent on information security by enterprises in 2022. That&#8217;s one reason why investors are here, too.</p>
<p>“The increasing pace of global cyber security attacks has resulted in a crisis of trust in the security posture of enterprises and a realization that security testing needs to be continuous as opposed to periodic, particularly in the context of an ever-changing IT infrastructure and rapidly evolving threats. Companies understand that implementing security solutions is not enough to guarantee protection against cyber threats and need to regain control,” said Klein, in a statement. &#8220;We expect Cymulate to grow very fast,&#8221; he told me more directly.</p>
