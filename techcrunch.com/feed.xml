										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix added 4 million net new subscribers in the first quarter of 2021, bringing its total subscriber base to 207.6 million, according to <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/FINAL-Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">its latest earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>Any year-over-year comparison was inevitably going to make this latest quarter seem disappointing, since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/neflix-q1-earnings/">Netflix grew by an unprecedented rate</a> (15.77 million net new subscribers) during the same period last year, when the pandemic first trapped global audiences at home. But these new numbers also fall short of the 210 million subscribers that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/netflix-q4-earnings-4/">Netflix had been predicting</a>.</p>
<p>While the streaming market has certainly become more competitive (with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320332/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-marvel-star-wars-wandavision">Disney+ recently passing 100 million subscribers</a>), Netflix suggested that its lackluster growth had less to do with &#8220;competitive intensity&#8221; and more with the simple fact that it released fewer original shows and movies, thanks to pandemic-related production delays.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big COVID-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to COVID-19 production delays,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;We continue to anticipate a strong second half with the return of new seasons of some of our biggest hits and an exciting film lineup. In the short term, there is some uncertainty from COVID-19; in the long term, the rise of streaming to replace linear TV around the world is the clear trend in entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Netflix noted that retention was &#8220;in line with our expectations,&#8221; and that the main issue was new user acquisition. It also said that &#8220;in early Q1, with the benefit of &#8216;Bridgerton,&#8217; &#8216;Lupin&#8217; and &#8216;Cobra Kai,&#8217; we were following a growth trajectory similar to recent years,&#8221; before growth dipped in March.</p>
<p>Pandemic-related delays will also affect the release schedule in Q2, so Netflix is only projecting 1 million net new subscribers. The release of high-profile titles should pick up again in the second half of the year, the company said, with production having resumed &#8220;in every major market, with the exception of Brazil and India.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the company&#8217;s finances, revenue grew 24% year over year to $7.2 billion (in line with the forecast), with diluted earnings per share of $3.75. (Analysts had been <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/analysis?p=NFLX">predicting EPS of $2.97</a>.) Netflix shares were down more than 11% in after-hours trading, as of 4:33 p.m. EDT.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.blablacar.com">BlaBlaCar</a> has raised a new $115 million funding round (€97 million). While the company is better known for its long distance carpooling marketplace, BlaBlaCar has also added a bus marketplace with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/12/blablacar-to-acquire-ouibus-and-offer-bus-service/">acquisition of Ouibus</a> and an online bus ticketing platform with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/blablacar-to-acquire-online-bus-ticketing-platform-busfor/">acquisition of Busfor</a>.</p>
<p>Existing investor VNV Global is leading the round. Two new investors are also participating — Otiva J/F AB and FMZ Ventures. Otiva J/F AB is a fund created by Avito founders Jonas Nordlander and Filip Engelbert. If you’re not familiar with Avito, they specialize in classified ads for the Russian market. Classified giant and global tech investor <a href="https://www.naspers.com">Naspers</a> acquired Avito. As for FMZ Ventures, it’s a growth fund created by Michael Zeisser, who previously led investments for Alibaba and was a board member at Lyft and Tripadvisor.</p>
<p>It’s a convertible note, which means that the valuation will depend on the next financial event, such as another fundraising round or an initial public offering. But BlaBlaCar co-founder and CEO Nicolas Brusson consider it as a “pre-IPO convertible” round as BlaBlaCar still has a ton of cash on its bank account.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We already had a lot of cash before this round and we still have more than €200 million in cash following this funding round,” Brusson told me.</p>
<p>Even if BlaBlaCar doesn’t go public right away (or doesn’t raise), there’s a clause with a time frame. After a while, those $115 million will convert into BlaBlaCar shares at a $2 billion valuation in case there’s no financial event.</p>
<p>BlaBlaCar’s strategy and goal with today’s funding round could be summed up with three pillars — carpooling, buses and aggregation.</p>
<p>Let’s start with carpooling, BlaBlaCar’s core business. The company started 15 years ago with a simple goal — matching empty car seats with passengers going in the same direction. While last year’s lockdown has impacted carpooling, it shouldn’t be compared with trains or flights.</p>
<p>“With our carpooling network, there’s no fixed costs,” Brusson said. So BlaBlaCar isn’t paying to put empty cars on the road as everything is community-powered. But, of course, as BlaBlaCar takes a cut from each transaction, revenue took a hit during last year’s lockdown.</p>
<p>Activity bounced back last summer and it’s been up and down ever since depending on current restrictions. “Car is and will be the universal connector that doesn’t rely on train stations or bus stops,” Brusson said.</p>
<p>The carpooling marketplace will always remain a strong revenue generator. In 2020 alone, BlaBlaCar had 50 million passengers across 22 markets overall. In other words, never bet against carpooling.</p>
<p>For the past few years, BlaBlaCar’s second pillar has been buses. In particular, buses represent a huge opportunity in emerging markets and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>There are already a ton of buses on the road, you simply can’t buy tickets online. BlaBlaCar’s total addressable market in this category is huge and the company is mostly focused on moving offline supply to its online marketplace.</p>
<p>That’s why the company is also acquiring Octobus, a Ukrainian company working on an inventory management system for bus supply. “It consolidates our tech stack in the region,” Brusson said.</p>
<p>Finally, BlaBlaCar’s third pillar is all about creating loyal users that keep coming back to the platform. The company wants to build a multimodal app where you can find all shared travel — carpooling, buses and soon trains.</p>
<p>The startup will add train operators on its marketplace by the end of 2021 or early 2022. I asked Brusson whether he wanted to build an <a href="https://www.omio.com">Omio</a> competitor. Formerly known as GoEuro, Omio lets you book train tickets, bus tickets and flights on a single platform.</p>
<p>BlaBlaCar wants to follow a different strategy. It wants to focus first on a handful of countries so that it can sell everything a local would expect.</p>
<p>Eventually, you could imagine opening the BlaBlaCar app to find the best way to go from A to B. It could involve a train ticket followed by a carpooling ride to reach a tiny town. Or it could mix carpooling with bus rides. Thanks to BlaBlaCar’s reach, the French startup is uniquely positioned to connect two small cities through shared transportation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A month after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/microsoft-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-discord-for-more-than-10b">reports</a> that Microsoft sought to buy the hot voice chat app Discord surfaced, those talks are off, a source familiar with the deal confirmed to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Discord is considering plans to stay independent, possibly charting a path to its own IPO in the not-too-distant future. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/discord-ends-deal-talks-with-microsoft-11618938806?st=566xw655qf2bo0d&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share">The Wall Street Journal</a> first reported news that the deal was off.</p>
<p>The two companies were deep in acquisition talks that valued Discord at around $10 billion before Discord walked away. According to the WSJ, three companies were exploring the possible acquisition, though only Microsoft was named.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Discord&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/discord-now-has-a-3-5b-valuation-and-100m-for-a-sales-pitch-lighter-on-the-gaming/">valuation doubled in less than six months last year</a> and its stock is only looking hotter in 2021. A well-loved voice chat app originally built for gamers, Discord was in the right place well ahead of the current voice chat trend that Clubhouse ignited. As companies from Facebook to Twitter scramble to build voice-based community tools, Discord rolled out its own support for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">curated audio events last month</a>.</p>
<p>Discord&#8217;s decision to veer away from a sale makes sense for a company keen to keep its unique DNA rather than being rolled into an existing product at a bigger company. The choice could also keep the company distant from a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">protracted antitrust headache</a>, as lawmakers mull legislation that could block big tech deals to prevent further consolidation in the industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After visits by unnamed masked intruders and the cancellation of its lease, <a href="https://imaguru.by/">Imaguru</a> — the country’s key startup hub, event and co-working space in Minsk — has effectively been shut down by the Lukashenko regime, which has led a brutal crackdown on its own people in recent months. But the company behind the space says it will defy the authorities and continue its activities online.</p>
<p>Since 2013, Imaguru had become known as being the birthplace of a large number of startups from Belarus, including MSQRD, acquired by Facebook in 2017 — as well as a landing pad for international investors visiting the country. Startups that have emerged from the space have attracted over $100 million in investments in recent years.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Imaguru Startup HUB&#8221; leased the space from &#8220;Horizon Holding&#8221; in 2013, when it took over a dilapidated building from a state-owned company. But on April 16, 2021, Horizon told Imaguru it was unilaterally terminating its lease and the startup space has been given until April 30 to vacate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Imaguru says there has been no reason given for the lease termination, despite Horizon calling Imaguru a “flagship” leasehold for its property business.</p>
<p>To outside observers, it looks like Horizon has come under pressure because of Imaguru&#8217;s active support of the pro-democracy protests inside the country.</p>
<p>In early March, unidentified men wearing masks broke into the office, &#8220;blocked the exit, put young event attendees against the wall, and brought them to the police station” said the company.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://help.imaguru.by/en?fbclid=IwAR3yUYfDt_aCKrFCsS77oLSUx6WtnqMeoJ6h0qCrb-ZnVyetIlrx8925okk">statement</a>, Imaguru said it is &#8220;not silent about lawlessness, repressions and persecution against civilians who defend their rights to an honest and fair choice … Not silent about the regime shutting down the business, investment and startup environment … Not silent about the massive relocation of startups from Belarus, about the catastrophe of this for the country and the role of the HTP in this process.”</p>
<p>Named after the phrase “I’m a guru,&#8221; and transcribed literately by Belarusian entrepreneurs, Imaguru held countless conferences, events, startup pitches and courses. It also organised <a href="https://venturedayminsk.com/">Venture Day Minsk</a> (which will still be run online on April 29).</p>
<p>Since 2013 Imaguru says it has helped over 300 Belarusian startups, including Splitmetrics, MSQRD, PingFin, DEIP and TrackDuck; created 250+ jobs; educated over 12,000 people; held over 3,500 events; organised study tours to the U.S., U.K., Finland, Spain and, most recently, launched the TechMinsk accelerator program.</p>
<p>In recent months, the startup hub came out in solidarity with the protests inside the country following last year’s tainted elections, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/belarus-tech-industry-rallies-around-arrested-pandadoc-colleagues-in-new-video/">recorded videos</a> of solidarity with PandaDoc, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/05/pandadoc-employees-arrested-in-belarus-after-founders-protest-against-lukashenko-regime/">who’s employees have been jailed,</a> and supported the general strike on October 26, 2020.</p>
<p>The Global Entrepreneurship Week Belarus, which was organized by the Imaguru team, was opened by the Belarusian leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.</p>
<p>Imaguru was founded by Belarusian businesswoman Tania Marinich (<a href="https://twitter.com/taniamarinich">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taniamarinich/?originalSubdomain=by">Linkedin</a>, <a href="http://t.me/tmarinich">Telegram</a>) whose husband died in jail after standing at elections in opposition to the Lukashenko regime.</p>
<p>The below is a statement by Marinich on the closure of the Imaguru space:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/LQfD39hc4gs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Privacy isn&#8217;t dead, as many would have you believe. New regulations, stricter cross-border data transfer rules and increasing calls for data sovereignty have helped the privacy startup space grow thanks to an uptick in investor support.</p>
<p>This is how we got here, and where investors are spending.</p>
<h2><b>The rise of privacy tech</b></h2>
<p>With strict privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA already listing big-ticket penalties — and a growing number of countries following suit — businesses have little option but to comply. It&#8217;s not just bigger, established businesses offering privacy and compliance tech; brand-new startups are filling in the gaps in this emerging and growing space.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the last decade, privacy tech was trumpeted as one of the next &#8216;big things&#8217; for investors, but never delivered. Startup business models were too academic, complex and did not appeal to VCs, or crucially, consumers were used to getting free web services,&#8221; Gilbert Hill, chief executive at Tapmydata, told Extra Crunch.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Some privacy companies — including privacy hardware companies — are chasing profits and less focused on hustling for outside investment.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Today, privacy is big business. Crunchbase lists <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/privacy-startups">207 privacy startups</a> (as of April 2021) that have together raised more than $3.5 billion over hundreds of individual rounds of funding. The number of privacy companies rockets if you take into account enterprise privacy players. Crunchbase currently has 809 listed <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/privacy-companies">under the wider &#8220;privacy&#8221; category</a>.</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/2021TechVendorReport.pdf">Privacy Tech Vendor Report 2021</a> names 356 companies exclusively dealing in enterprise privacy technology solutions, up from 304 companies a year earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since 2017, the privacy landscape underwent a metamorphosis,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;The emergence of the California Consumer Privacy Act, Brazilian General Data Protection Law and other privacy laws around the world have forced organizations to adhere to a new array of compliance requirements, and in response, the demand for privacy tech grew exponentially.&#8221;</p>
<p>That also presents an opportunity for investors.</p>
<h2><b>Increasing investments</b></h2>
<p>Privacy tech was catching the attention of investors even before the recent wave of new privacy laws came into effect. The sector amassed nearly $10 billion in investment in 2019, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/almost-10b-invested-in-privacy-and-security-companies-in-2019/">according to Crunchbase,</a> compared to just $1.7 billion in 2010. Investments remained active in 2020, despite the pandemic.</p>
<p>Case in point: In December, enterprise privacy and compliance firm OneTrust <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/onetrust-nabs-300m-series-c-on-5-1b-valuation-to-expand-privacy-platform/?tpcc=ECTW2020">announced</a> a $300 million Series C funding. The deal valued the 4-year-old privacy tech firm at $5.1 billion, making it one of the first modern privacy unicorns. Three months later, <a href="https://www.onetrust.com/company/news/press-releases/onetrust-extends-series-c-softbank-franklin-templeton/">it extended its Series C funding</a>, with SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Franklin Templeton pumping in another $210 million.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Now that Apple&#8217;s lost item finder AirTag has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-introduces-airtag/">officially been introduced</a>, competitor Tile is going on record ahead of its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/senate-to-call-spotify-match-at-apple-google-antitrust-hearing?sref=gni836kR">testimony</a> in front of Congress tomorrow about how it perceives Apple&#8217;s latest product. The company says it will be asking Congress on Wednesday to take a closer look into Apple&#8217;s business practices, and specifically its entry in this lost item tracking category.</p>
<p>Tile has been a strong Apple critic since it learned that Apple would soon launch its own device to take on Tile&#8217;s leading lost item finder beacons. Tile had successfully carved out a market for its Bluetooth-powered keychain dongles that allow consumers to find the lost items Tile attaches to &#8212; like purses, luggage, keys, bikes, wallets and more. It also introduced the idea of a &#8220;finding network,&#8221; where everyone with the Tile app installed on their phone could help to locate someone else&#8217;s Tile, in the case that a lost item was out of Bluetooth range of its owner.</p>
<p>With AirTag, Apple is reproducing these capabilities, while also adding support for more precise ultra-wideband technology, integrating AirTag into its first-party &#8220;Find My&#8221; app, and leveraging its larger iPhone install base to help find missing items. This presents significant competition to Tile, which is not only expected to face off with Apple&#8217;s AirTag across Apple&#8217;s own devices, but also share a portion of its subscription revenues from in-app purchases with Apple thanks to App Store policies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ahead of AirTag&#8217;s launch, Apple moved to head off any sort of anti-competitive claims by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/e-bikes-and-earbuds-among-the-first-third-party-hardware-to-support-apples-find-my-tracking/">opening up access to its &#8220;Find My&#8221; app to third parties</a>. It even partnered with a Tile competitor, the Chipolo ONE Spot, to serve as proof that it&#8217;s giving other lost item finders that compete with AirTag equal footing on its iPhone platform. But Tile&#8217;s argument to date has been that it doesn&#8217;t want to give up the direct relationship it has with customers via its own iOS app to instead support Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Find My&#8221; users, and that Apple&#8217;s mere decision to enter this market with its own item-locating tracker will allow it to easily dominate because of its first-party advantage and ecosystem power.</p>
<p>Tile had <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/meeting/house/110386/witnesses/HHRG-116-JU05-Wstate-DaruK-20200117.pdf">previously testified</a> before Congress about Apple&#8217;s alleged anti-competitive behavior back in 2020 and will now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/senate-to-call-spotify-match-at-apple-google-antitrust-hearing?sref=gni836kR">do so again on Wednesday</a> alongside other Apple critics, including Match and Spotify.</p>
<p>The companies are arguing against Apple&#8217;s in-app commissions, the so-called &#8220;Apple tax,&#8221; which Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">recently reduced</a> for smaller businesses. Many larger companies do not want to pay Apple at all &#8212; they want to process their own payments directly to retain all the revenue collected. They also want a more direct relationship with customers, not one where Apple is the middleman. And in some cases like Tile and Spotify, the companies don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s fair that they&#8217;re paying money to Apple when Apple directly competes with their business through its own first-party apps.</p>
<p>In addition, Tile intended to compete with AirTag via its own ultra-wideband powered device, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">announced earlier this year</a>. But it has yet to receive access to Apple&#8217;s U1 chip to make such a device work, we&#8217;re hearing.</p>
<p>In a statement released today following Apple&#8217;s event, Tile CEO CJ Prober again publicly criticized Apple&#8217;s move into a market Tile created, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our mission is to solve the everyday pain point of finding lost and misplaced things and we are flattered to see Apple, one of the most valuable companies in the world, enter and validate the category Tile pioneered.</p>
<p>The reason so many people turn to Tile to locate their lost or misplaced items is because of the differentiated value we offer our consumers. In addition to providing an industry leading set of features via our app that works with iOS and Android devices, our service is seamlessly integrated with all major voice assistants, including Alexa and Google. And with form factors for every use case and many different styles at affordable prices, there is a Tile for everyone.</p>
<p>Tile has also successfully partnered with top brands like HP, Intel, Skullcandy and fitbit to enable our finding technology in mass market consumer categories like laptops, earbuds and wearables. With over 30 partners, we look forward to extending the benefits of Tile to millions of customers and enabling an experience that helps you keep track of all your important belongings.</p>
<p>We welcome competition, as long as it is fair competition. Unfortunately, given Apple’s well-documented history of using its platform advantage to unfairly limit competition for its products, we’re skeptical. And given our prior history with Apple, we think it is entirely appropriate for Congress to take a closer look at Apple’s business practices specific to its entry into this category. We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues further in front of Congress tomorrow.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple, in response, points out that its Find My network pre-dates Tile&#8217;s founding, and that Tile is able to use Find My if it chooses. It also notes Tile has 90% market share and Apple will need to sell a lot of AirTags to catch up with that lead.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s statement reads, as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have worked from the very beginning of iPhone to help protect the privacy of users&#8217; location data, giving them transparency and control over how all apps may access and share their location. Apple created Find My over a decade ago to help users locate and manage lost devices in a private and secure way. Since then, we have expanded Find My to help users keep tabs on the other important things in their life — from sharing location with friends and family members, to locating third-party products like Van Moof bikes and Chipolo item finders. We have always embraced competition as the best way to drive great experiences for our customers, and we have worked hard to build a platform in iOS that enables third-party developers to thrive.</p></blockquote>

<p>From tweaks to the Apple Card to all new iMacs and iPads, Apple crammed this one-hour event with news. Don&#8217;t have time to sit down and click through every last announcement? We&#8217;ve slimmed it down to just the key points for maximum skimmability. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Apple Card</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1864387" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1864387" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1864387" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?w=680" alt="Apple Card" width="680" height="424" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png 1119w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?resize=768,478 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?resize=680,424 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1864387" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Apple kicked things off with a quick but key mention outlining a shift <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-announces-apple-card-family-for-spouses-to-build-credit-together-and-over-13s-to-use-it-too/">in how Apple Card works</a>. &#8220;Apple Card Family&#8221; will allow you to share your card with anyone in your family over the age of 13, with customizable spending limits for each added user. You&#8217;ll also now be able to &#8220;co-own&#8221; an Apple card with another adult, with both owners building up their credit equally.</p>
<h2>Apple Podcasts</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2141036" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141036" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2141036" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/podcasts.jpg?w=680" alt="apple podcasts 2021" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/podcasts.jpg 1878w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/podcasts.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/podcasts.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/podcasts.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/podcasts.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/podcasts.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/podcasts.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141036" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Apple will launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">a redesigned Podcast app</a>, including an option for paid subscriptions (monthly or annual) to individual podcasts.</p>
<h2>Purple iPhones</h2>

<p>No new iPhone this time (those come later in the year, generally), but the existing iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-adds-a-new-purple-color-option-to-its-iphone-12-and-iphone-12-mini-lineup/">getting a new color option: purple</a>. They used a song from Willy Wonka to announce it, because … well, purple.</p>
<h2>AirTag</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2141048" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141048" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2141048" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?w=680" alt="apple airtag $99 4 pack" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg 1894w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141048" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>After literal <em>years</em> of rumors and leaks, Apple has at long last officially announced its accessory for tracking things like keys, wallets and bags through the same &#8220;Find My&#8221; app you use to find your various Apple devices when you lose them in the couch.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-officially-unveils-its-lost-item-finder-airtag/">Called &#8220;AirTag&#8221;</a> (curiously, not &#8220;AirTags&#8221;), Apple says they&#8217;ll cost $29 each or $99 for a four pack, and launch on April 30. They&#8217;ll have user-replaceable batteries but, oddly, no built-in attachment loop; if you want to attach it to something like a keyring, you&#8217;ll need to add a case. Which, of course, they&#8217;ll be making and selling.</p>

<p>Apple announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/the-new-apple-tv-4k-comes-with-a-new-siri-remote/">big refresh to the Apple TV 4K</a> it first launched back in 2017. Here&#8217;s the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Powered by Apple&#8217;s A12 Bionic chip.</li>
<li>You can use an iPhone to calibrate the picture. Start the calibration process, put your iPhone&#8217;s front-facing camera near the TV, and Apple TV 4K will automatically optimize its own color/contrast output accordingly.</li>
<li>They&#8217;ve redesigned the remote! They&#8217;ve moved away from the much lamented touchpad remote, building this new remote around a five-way clickpad complete with iPod-esque scroll wheel. There&#8217;s a Siri button on the side, in case you feel like talking to your TV instead of pushing buttons. Word is (via <a href="https://twitter.com/JoannaStern/status/1384565971193585664">WSJ&#8217;s Joanna Stern</a>) they&#8217;ll also be selling this remote separately for $59 for use with the previous-gen Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD.</li>
<li>$179 for 32 GB model or $199 for 64 GB.</li>

<p>Time for the iMac to shift over to M1! Apple announced a new lineup of iMacs — and in a throwback to the iMacs of yesteryear, these new ones <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-introduces-a-colorful-new-imac/">will come in an array of fancy colors</a>. Here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built around the absurdly zippy M1 chipset Apple first introduced into its laptops last year.</li>
<li>24-inch &#8220;4.5K&#8221; display.</li>
<li>At last, a decent webcam! These new iMacs will ship with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apples-new-imac-finally-gets-an-actually-good-webcam/">1080p FaceTime camera.</a></li>
<li>Pre-orders start April 20, shipping in late May.</li>
<li>$1,299 gets you an 8-core CPU/7-core GPU setup, while $1,499 will bump it up to 8-core CPU/8-core GPU.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll come in seven colors: green, yellow, pink, orange, blue, purple and silver. Some colors will only be available in the more expensive model.</li>
<li>Both models come with a 256 GB SSD, and two Thunderbolt ports. The $1,499 model adds two USB 3 ports.</li>
<li>Apple will ship a new version of its Bluetooth Magic Keyboard, now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-brings-touch-id-to-the-magic-keyboard/">complete with a Touch ID fingerprint sensor</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-introduces-a-colorful-new-imac/">announced the new iMac</a> powered by Apple&#8217;s own M1 silicon. Among the numerous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-brings-touch-id-to-the-magic-keyboard/">updates</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apples-new-imac-finally-gets-an-actually-good-webcam/">upgrades</a> is a new power brick that sports something special to Apple&#8217;s lineup: an Ethernet port. On the surface, this seems like a silly placement of a critical I/O port, but there&#8217;s a good chance this feature could hit future Apple laptops where it makes much more sense.</p>
<p>The M1 iMac sports a new design that&#8217;s much thinner than the last generation and Apple likely didn&#8217;t want to make room for the Ethernet port. The only I/O ports appear to be a 3.5mm jack and several USB-C ports. The power adapter itself has a new magnetic connector and doesn&#8217;t use one of the computer&#8217;s USB-C ports. The Ethernet port was relegated to the power supply.</p>
<p>There are several advantages for this placement. It reduces clutter on the back of the computer and streamlines connectivity &#8212; items that are even more critical in a portable computer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple famously shares components and accessories across its product line, making it very likely this power brick will come to other products. Apple started removing the magnetic MagSafe power connector when its laptops adopted USB-C in 2016, and it would be fantastic to see a similar product return to the product line. Apple removed the Ethernet port on the MacBook Pro in 2012.</p>
<p>Several companies offer add-ons for Apple power adapters. These, like the Twelve South PlugBug Duo, add  USB ports to the adapters, but none have yet to offer Ethernet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The big news from today&#8217;s Spring Loaded event is, as anticipated, a new version of Apple&#8217;s high-end tablet. The new iPad Pro is the first in the line to adopt the M1 chip introduced on the company&#8217;s Mac line. The new chip sports an 8-core CPU, with performance up to 50% faster than the A12Z Bionic found on the previous generation. There&#8217;s also an 8-core GPU, which it claims is up to 40% faster. The system can be decked out to up to 16 GB of RAM and 2 TB of storage.</p>
<p>The device further blurs the line between the company&#8217;s tablet and desktop offerings, as well as improved battery life now listed as &#8220;all day.&#8221; The Pro also adds Thunderbolt support to the USB-C, which allows for a number of new features including external display support and wired transfers up to 40 Gbps.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141210" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141210" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141210 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_ipad-pro-spring21_m1-luma-fusion_04202021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="819" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_ipad-pro-spring21_m1-luma-fusion_04202021.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_ipad-pro-spring21_m1-luma-fusion_04202021.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_ipad-pro-spring21_m1-luma-fusion_04202021.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_ipad-pro-spring21_m1-luma-fusion_04202021.jpg?resize=768,614 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_ipad-pro-spring21_m1-luma-fusion_04202021.jpg?resize=680,544 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_ipad-pro-spring21_m1-luma-fusion_04202021.jpg?resize=1536,1229 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_ipad-pro-spring21_m1-luma-fusion_04202021.jpg?resize=2048,1638 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_ipad-pro-spring21_m1-luma-fusion_04202021.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141210" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Pro also joins the iPhone line with the addition of 5G connectivity. Like the new iMac, the Pro features improved imaging, courtesy of the new ISP aboard the Apple silicon. That&#8217;s coupled with a new ultrawide camera. That should allow for improved teleconferencing ability, with a 120-degree field of view and the new “Center Stage” feature, which follows the users around, similar to tech we&#8217;ve seen on some smart displays. The company describes the experience thusly,</p>
<blockquote><p>As users move around, Center Stage automatically pans to keep them in the shot. When others join in, the camera detects them too, and smoothly zooms out to fit everyone into the view and make sure they are part of the conversation.

<p>As reported, the new tablet (12.9-inch only for now) features an improved display &#8212; Liquid Retina XDR, according to Apple&#8217;s marketing terms. Among other things that brings much improved high dynamic range. The display is powered by 10,000 micro-LED. That allows for a hugely improved contrast ratio and 1,000 nits of brightness, without hammering the battery life.</p>
<p>The 11-inch version starts at $799 and the 12.9-inch, which adds the Liquid Retina display, starts at $1,099. Pre-orders on the tablets starts April 30 and the product is set to start shipping in the second half of May &#8212; along with a number of other products introduced at today&#8217;s show.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has unveiled a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-introduces-a-colorful-new-imac/">new, colorful iMac</a> today with an Apple-designed M1 chip. But that was just part of the story as the company used that opportunity to release new Mac accessories. In addition to a Magic Trackpad and a Magic Mouse with multiple color options, Apple is bringing Touch ID to desktop Macs with a new Magic Keyboard.</p>
<p>Touch ID on desktop works as expected. There’s a fingerprint sensor located at the top right of the keyboard. It replaces the ‘Eject’ key that you can find on existing Apple keyboards. It lets you unlock your computer, pay with Apple Pay, unlock a password manager and more.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Touch ID works wirelessly, which means that you don’t have to connect your keyboard to your Mac with a Lightning cable. There’s a dedicated security component built in the keyboard. It communicates directly with the Secure Enclave in the M1, which means that it only works with modern Mac computers with an M1 chip. It&#8217;s going to be interesting to see the security implementation of this new take on Touch ID.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Customers can choose between three keyboard models when they buy a new iMac. Some iMac models probably don’t come with Touch ID by default. You may be able to buy the keyboard separately, but we’ll have to wait for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-spring-hardware-event-2021">the event</a> to end to find out how much the new keyboard costs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple announced a new Apple TV 4K today, which will come with a new Siri Remote.</p>
<p>In addition to the existing Siri support, this new aluminum remote features a redesigned clickpad that allows for circular gestures in the outer ring, which viewers can use to quickly find the scene they&#8217;re looking for. And to eliminate the need to reach for another remote, it also includes a mute button and a power button for your actual TV.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-unveils-the-next-generation-of-apple-tv-4k/"> new Apple TV 4K</a> is built with Apple&#8217;s A12 Bionic chip, which the company says will allow it to support higher-quality video, specifically high frame rate HDR and Dolby Vision at 60 frames per second.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, picture quality also depends on the TV itself. But Apple announced a new feature to address the situation, and it&#8217;s not limited to people who purchase the new device. To improve the color balance on their TV, any Apple TV owner should be able to use the light sensor in their iPhone to measure their current balance, and the output from their Apple TV will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>The new Apple TV 4K will be available for $179 for 32 gigabytes (or $199 if you want to double the storage capacity), with orders starting on April 30 and availability in the second half of May. You&#8217;ll also be able to buy an Apple TV HD with the new Siri Remote for $149, or the remote alone for $59.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the A12 Bionic and the all-new Siri Remote, Apple TV 4K lets customers enjoy their favorite shows, movies, and more in the highest quality, with simple and intuitive controls,&#8221; said Apple Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Bob Borchers in a statement. &#8220;And of course, Apple TV 4K offers easy access to Apple services, along with thousands of apps on the App Store for even more entertainment options.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple introduced new iMacs at its event on Tuesday, outfitted with its M1 processor and redesigned inside and out from the ground up. The hardware is impressive, but one of the biggest improvements for everyone&#8217;s Zoom-heavy life might be the webcam. Apple said it&#8217;s the &#8220;best camera ever in a Mac,&#8221; which honestly wouldn&#8217;t take much, but its specs suggest it actually is a big upgrade.</p>
<p>The camera finally achieves 1080p video capabilities, and Apple has also equipped it with a larger sensor that should provide greatly improved low-light performance. The M1 chip has better image signal processing capabilities, and uses computational video powers to correct and improve the image on the fly, which has brought benefits to the image quality even on existing MacBook Air and MacBook Pro hardware with the same old, bad webcam equipment.</p>
<p>That should mean this iMac actually has really good image quality — or at least not image quality you need to be embarrassed about. The on-board machine learning processor in the M1, which Apple calls the Neural Engine, will be working in real-time to optimize lighting and do noise reduction, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On top of the camera, Apple touts new beam forming mics in a three-mic array that will optimize audio, focusing on your voice and eliminating background noise. All told, this should finally be a Mac that provides a videoconferencing experience that doesn&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s stuck in the early 2000s.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Research papers come out far too frequently for anyone to read them all. That&#8217;s especially true in the field of machine learning, which now affects (and produces papers in) practically every industry and company. This column aims to collect some of the most relevant recent discoveries and papers — particularly in, but not limited to, artificial intelligence — and explain why they matter.</p>
<p>It takes an emotionally mature AI to admit its own mistakes, and that&#8217;s exactly what this project from the Technical University of Munich aims to create. Maybe not the emotion, exactly, but recognizing and learning from mistakes, specifically in self-driving cars. The researchers <a href="https://www.tum.de/nc/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/details/36509/">propose a system</a> in which the car would look at all the times in the past when it has had to relinquish control to a human driver and thereby learn its own limitations — <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9310689">what they call &#8220;introspective failure prediction.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>For instance, if there are a lot of cars ahead, the autonomous vehicle&#8217;s brain could use its sensors and logic to make a decision <em>de novo</em> about whether an approach would work or whether none will. But the TUM team says that by simply comparing new situations to old ones, it can reach a decision much faster on whether it will need to disengage. Saving six or seven seconds here could make all the difference for a safe handover.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important for robots and autonomous vehicles of all types to be able to make decisions without phoning home, especially in combat, where decisive and concise movements are necessary. The Army Research Lab is <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/244778/army_researchers_work_to_make_robots_self_sufficient">looking into ways</a> in which ground and air vehicles can interact autonomously, allowing, for instance, a mobile landing pad that drones can land on without needing to coordinate, ask permission or rely on precise GPS signals.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WzF8mHlZds4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Their solution, at least for the purposes of testing, is actually rather low tech. The ground vehicle has a landing area on top painted with an enormous QR code, which the drone can see from a fairly long way off. The drone can track the exact location of the pad totally independently. In the future, the QR code could be done away with and the drone could identify the shape of the vehicle instead, presumably using some best-guess logic to determine whether it&#8217;s the one it wants.</p>

<p>In the medical world, AI is being put to work not on tasks that are not much difficult but are rather tedious for people to do. A good example of this is tracking the activity of individual cells in microscopy images. It&#8217;s not a superhuman task to look at a few hundred frames spanning several depths of a petri dish and track the movements of cells, but that doesn&#8217;t mean grad students like doing it.</p>
<p>This software from<a href="https://www.nagoya-cu.ac.jp/english/research-news/03291709/"> researchers at Nagoya City University</a> in Japan does it automatically using image analysis and the capability (much improved in recent years) of understanding objects over a period of time rather than just in individual frames. <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59187">Read the paper here</a>, and check out the extremely cute illustration showing off the tech at right … more research organizations should hire professional artists.</p>
<p>This process is similar to that of tracking moles and other skin features on people at risk for melanoma. While they might see a dermatologist every year or so to find out whether a given spot seems sketchy, the rest of the time they must track their own moles and freckles in other ways. That&#8217;s hard when they&#8217;re in places like one&#8217;s back.</p>

Today during Apple&#8217;s spring event, the company <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-introduces-apple-card-family-enabling-people-to-share-apple-card-and-build-credit-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the newest chapter in that story: the launch of Apple Card Family, which will let partners/spouses build joint credit and give family members over 13-years-old access to using Apple Card, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://apple.com/apple-card" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Card Family</a> will launch first in the U.S. in May after users update to the latest version of iOS, Apple said today.</p>
<p>The timing of the announcement is interesting. Last month, Apple and partner Goldman Sachs were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/new-yorks-department-of-financial-services-says-apple-card-program-didnt-violate-fair-lending-laws/">cleared of any gender bias in how they build credit scoring in the Apple Card</a>, a long simmering investigation that had been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50365609">going for nearly as long as the Apple Card itself</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the time of the ruling, even as Apple was cleared, the regulator noted that what the case did highlight was the more endemic gender and other disparities in the credit scoring system, particularly as they pertain to spouses and partners.</p>
<p>In light of that, some might say the announcement today is not coming as a surprise, and others might say it is long overdue.</p>
<p>This service announcement feels like it&#8217;s the company&#8217;s effort to seal the deal and draw a line under that story, and more formally lay out its intentions to be equitable even if regulations have yet to catch up.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that became apparent to us in the beginning [of launching Apple Card] was a lack of fairness in the way the industry calculated credit scores when there were two holders of a credit card,&#8221; said CEO Tim Cook today. &#8220;One of you got the benefit of building a good credit history, and the other did not. We want to reinvent the way this works.&#8221;</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s also not a surprise on another level: developer previews of iOS 14.5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/apple-card-multi-user-support-ios-14-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Apple was building in multiuser support for Apple Cards, laying the groundwork for joint accounts for adults and wider family usage.)</p>
<p>As Cook described it, spouses and partners will be allowed to share and merge their credit lines have equal rights on their account, in order to &#8220;build credit equally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This solution helps deliver financial equity, and it&#8217;s a game-changer,&#8221; he said. Indeed, in cases where either one partner has outstanding debts, or has defaulted on some of that debt, or doesn&#8217;t have the same earning power, this move is a way to confer the stronger spending power of one partner on another, in cases where partners are actually combining their finances anyway. It makes sense and frankly is long overdue.</p>
<p>The ability to give Apple Card access to over-13s, meanwhile, will come with spending limits if you want to put them in, along with other controls in terms of how it can be used.</p>
<p>This is also smart, an extension of how Apple has built a role for itself as the &#8220;responsible&#8221; technology company with privacy controls for all users, and parental controls for devices, and now it&#8217;s adding on a new angle, becoming an educative tool.</p>
<p>Many parents are turning to technology and apps to build more financial nous among their children, and so it makes sense for Apple to position itself as a partner in this effort.</p>
<p>While letting families run their finances in a more equitable way, there is of course another, more business-minded strategy here: It&#8217;s clearly giving Apple a much, much bigger pool of potential consumers using its Apple Card, using services like Daily Cash (which gives up to 3% of every purchase as cash on users’ Apple Cash card each day) and access to using the secure titanium Apple Card that comes without a visible card number, CVV security code, expiration date or signature.</p>
<p>On that subject, we don&#8217;t quite know how many people are using that Apple Card today. Cook simply called Apple Card, which was estimated to be used by over 3.1 million people as of March 2020, &#8220;the most successful credit card launch ever.&#8221;</p>

Naturally, the latest version of the 24-inch all-in-one desktop is built around the company&#8217;s new proprietary M1 chips.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple&#8217;s new iMac finally gets an actually good webcam&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apples-new-imac-finally-gets-an-actually-good-webcam/embed/#?secret=zIzvqK40Ek" data-secret="zIzvqK40Ek" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The screen sports a 4.5K Retina Display, coupled with a 1080p camera &#8212; a first for the Mac line, and a sign the company is taking both audio and video more seriously as these products are serving as a kind of life line for the work from home crowd. True Tone is, naturally, on board for better color balance, and sound have been improved with six-speaker setup. The display features 11.3 million pixels, a P3 color gamut and 500 nits of brightness. Like the most recent iMac models, it features an anti-reflective coating to reduce screen glare.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2141097" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-04.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="581" /></p>
<p>The new devices are significantly thinner &#8212; with overall volume reduced by half, according to the company. The rear is also flat, instead of curved. In addition to allowing for a much thinner design, the new chip allows for far faster performance than previous models &#8212; a huge performance bump we&#8217;ve seen in our own testing of the most recent generation of Macs. All told, the company says it&#8217;s up to 85% faster than the last model, coupled with a GPU that&#8217;s up to twice as fast and 3x the machine learning.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2141184" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_new-imac-spring21_hero_04202021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_new-imac-spring21_hero_04202021.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_new-imac-spring21_hero_04202021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_new-imac-spring21_hero_04202021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_new-imac-spring21_hero_04202021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_new-imac-spring21_hero_04202021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_new-imac-spring21_hero_04202021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_new-imac-spring21_hero_04202021.jpg?resize=2048,1153 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple_new-imac-spring21_hero_04202021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some numbers direct from the company:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pagebody-copy">
<ul>
<li>Up to 85 percent faster CPU performance, so users can export their favorite video project in iMovie faster than ever, easily work with massive 100-megapixel photos in Lightroom, and compile new apps in Xcode in a fraction of the time.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="pagebody-copy">
<ul>
<li>Up to 2x faster GPU performance for certain apps like Affinity Photo and Photoshop, and up to 50 percent faster than the most powerful discrete graphics in the fastest 21.5-inch iMac, allowing users to render edits in real time or add complex filters to their photos in a snap.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="pagebody-copy">
<ul>
<li>The ability to edit up to five streams of 4K footage, or one stream of 8K footage, without dropping a frame in Final Cut Pro.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="pagebody-copy">
<ul>
<li>Up to 3x faster machine learning in apps that leverage the 16-core Neural Engine in M1</li>
</ul>

<p>Around back are up to four USB-C ports, including two Thunderbolts, for faster speed (say &#8220;goodbye to USB-A) and a new magnetic power adapter that also delivers 1Gbps Ethernet, which, at very least, should declutter the back of the device a bit. The system comes in seven colors. It starts at $1,299. That includes a 7-core GPU, 8-core CPU, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. That&#8217;s available in green, pink, blue and silver. At $1,499, you get the 8-core GPU, two additional ports and the addition of the yellow and orange colors.</p>

<p>There are some new accessories for the system, as well, including a colorful new Magic Keyboard that sports built-in TouchID. The new iMac goes up for pre-order April 30 and starts shipping in the second half of May.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Class, an edtech startup that integrates exclusively with Zoom to make remote teaching more elegant, has raised $12.25 million<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/class-announces-12m-investment-from-salesforce-ventures-and-seven-time-super-bowl-champion-tom-brady-301271967.html"> in new financing</a>. The round brings Salesforce Ventures, Sound Ventures and Super Bowl champion Tom Brady onto its capital table.</p>
<p>CEO and founder Michael Chasen said that Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, approached the company about investing in Class. Salesforce Ventures launched a $100 million Impact Fund in October 2020, a month after Class launched, to back edtech companies and cloud enterprises businesses with an impact lens.</p>
<p>As for Tom Brady entering the edtech world, Chasen said that the famous football player has made tech investments in the past and, “as the father of three is passionate about helping people through education.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Tom Brady and I are both fathers to three kids and like all parents, we get the need to add teaching and learning tools to Zoom,” Chasen added.</p>
<p>Class has now raised $58 million in less than a year, with a $30 million Series A in February 2021 and a $16 million seed round in September 2020. Today’s raise is less than its Series A round, which signals it was likely more done strategically to bring on investors than out of necessity.</p>
<p>The money will be used to help roll out Class to K-12 and higher-ed institutions across the world. The startup’s software publicly launched on the Mac a few months ago, and will exit beta for Windows, iPhone, Android and Chromebook in the next few weeks, Chasen said. The larger public launch will help scale the some 7,500 schools that have shown interest in adopting Class.</p>
<p>The big hurdle for Class, and any startup selling e-learning solutions to institutions, is post-pandemic utility. While institutions have traditionally been slow to adopt software due to red tape, Chasen says that both of Class’ customers, higher ed and K-12, are actively allocating budget for these tools. The price for Class ranges between $10,000 to $65,000 annually, depending on the number of students in the classes.</p>

<p>“We have not run into a budgeting problem in a single school,” Chasen said in February. “Higher ed has already been taking this step towards online learning, and they’re now taking the next step, whereas K-12, this is the first step they’re taking.” So far, Class has more than 125 paying clients with even-split between K-12 and higher ed, and 10% of customers using it for corporate teams.</p>

<p>It’s not the only startup that is trying to reinvent Zoom University. A number of companies are trying to serve the same market of students and teachers who are fatigued by current video conferencing solutions which — at best — often look like a gallery view with a chat bar. Three companies that are gaining traction include Engageli, Top Hat and InSpace.</p>
<p>While each startup has its own unique strategy and product, the founders behind them all need to answer the same question: Can they make digital learning a preferred mode of pedagogy and comprehension — and not merely a backup — after the pandemic is over?</p>
<p>As that question continues to get explored, today’s news shows that Class isn’t having any trouble recruiting people to believe the answer is yes. In just nine months, the company has gone from two to more than 150 employees and contractors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has added a new color option to the iPhone 12 lineup — a rare mid-cycle facelift for the company&#8217;s flagship product. The new color is purple, and looks like a lavender-ish pastel hue, which is in keeping with the tones on the rest of the color options on the 12 lineup, which include a mint green and a red that leans towards the pink end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>The purple iPhone 12 is going on sale starting this Friday, April 23, and will begin shipping out to customers on April 30. It&#8217;s available for iPhone 12 and 12 mini, but the iPhone 12 Pro isn&#8217;t getting any new color options to match.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a small thing, but not a bad way for Apple to jazz up their hardware mid-cycle in a bid to excite general consumers. Also, it suggests Apple is leaning in even more to a multicolor aesthetic for its hardware, which is a refreshing change after a mostly monochrome approach in recent years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today officially <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-introduces-airtag/">unveiled</a> AirTag, its location tracking beacons that can help Apple device owners find lost items through Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Find My&#8221; application. The AirTags themselves are small, rounded tracking devices that can be attached to personal items, like purses, bags or keys. Pre-orders start April 23rd and are $29 USD for one AirTag or $99 for a pack of four.</p>
<p>The tags are small, polished stainless steel and white, and circular in shape, and have the Apple logo printed on the front. They also come with a various case options and keychain dongles, allowing you to add an AirTag to your keys, for example, or a handbag or duffle, and so on. Further customization exists, including emoji symbols.</p>
<p>The item tracking uses the company&#8217;s proprietary U1 ultra-wideband chip for what it calls &#8220;Precision Finding.&#8221; This will work with Apple&#8217;s newer iPhones (iPhone 11, 11 Pro and the newer iPhones 12 devices) using the U1 chip and ultra-wideband, as well as other input from the camera, ARKit, accelerator, and gyroscope. This way, the Find My app can guide users to a lost AirTag using a combination of sound, haptics and visual feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The device also uses Bluetooth LE (low-energy) and is able to get a year of battery life, according to the company. When the battery is out of juice, it&#8217;s user replaceable. Apple says the AirTag is <a href="https://www.l-com.com/frequently-asked-questions/i-need-to-get-waterproof-cable-connectors-or-adapters-what-does-ip67-mean">IP67</a> water- and dust-resistant, which means you could probably drop one in a toilet and it would be okay, but shouldn&#8217;t expect iPhone-like <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/06/iphone-11-reunited-with-owner-after-spending-6-months-in-a-lake">miracles</a>.</p>
<p>A built-in speaker will play sounds to locate the AirTag when the item it&#8217;s attached to goes missing. If the AirTag is farther afield than under your couch cushion, for example, users can place the device into a &#8220;Lost Mode&#8221; that will leverage Apple&#8217;s Find My network across everyone&#8217;s devices.</p>
<p>To ensure privacy, AirTags&#8217; location data and location history is physically stored inside the device. Communication across the Find My network, meanwhile, is end-to-end encrypted.</p>
<p>And if you come across someone&#8217;s lost AirTag, you can tap it with your iPhone or other NFC devices to be taken to a website where you can contact the owner by phone.</p>
<p>At launch, Apple is offering a range of accessories including the Polyurethane Loop in white, navy, yellow and orange ($29), Leather Loop in brown and red ($39), and Leather Key Ring in brown, red and blue ($35). Apple and Hermès teamed up to create the AirTag Hermès, which include a custom-engraved AirTag, and assortment of leather accessories including the Bag Charm, Key Ring, Travel Tag, and Luggage Tag.</p>

<p>“We’re excited to bring this incredible new capability to iPhone users with the introduction of AirTag, leveraging the vast Find My network, to help them keep track of and find the important items in their lives,” said Kaiann Drance, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing, in a statement. “With its design, unparalleled finding experience, and built-in privacy and security features, AirTag will provide customers with another way to leverage the power of the Apple ecosystem and enhance the versatility of iPhone.”</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">assets</a> found in Apple&#8217;s code referencing the new product last year and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/apple-accidentally-confirms-the-existence-of-an-unreleased-product-airtags/">a mistake in an official Apple YouTube video</a>, AirTags had also been brought up as an example of Apple&#8217;s anticompetitive behavior before U.S. regulators.</p>

<p>Last year, Tile <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-apple-tile/tile-says-apples-behavior-is-anticompetitive-and-has-gotten-worse-not-better-idUSKBN21J72V?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtechnologyNews+%28Reuters+Technology+News%29">spoke about AirTags before a panel</a> of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, saying that Apple&#8217;s decision to launch its own version of the lost-item finder gave Apple&#8217;s new product a first-party advantage over its competitors. Apple&#8217;s devices, Tile explained, would be able operate in the background without having to continually popping up requests asking users to agree to background tracking, like Tile&#8217;s app has to do. Apple&#8217;s devices would also be integrated with &#8220;Find My,&#8221; but other tags would not be.</p>
<p>Following the regulatory scrutiny, Apple at its developer conference WWDC in June said<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"> it would extend &#8220;Find My&#8221;</a> to third-party companies. However, a report by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/24/apple-find-my-competition/">The Washington Post</a> indicated that olive branch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/25/this-week-in-apps-apple-argues-for-commissions-find-my-nda-alexa-to-open-apps/">may not have been what it seemed</a> &#8212; companies would have to sign an NDA and said Apple customers would be barred from using competing devices simultaneously.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141065" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141065" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2141065" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-finding-screen_042021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1463" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-finding-screen_042021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-finding-screen_042021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=105,150 105w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-finding-screen_042021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=210,300 210w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-finding-screen_042021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=768,1097 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-finding-screen_042021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=476,680 476w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-finding-screen_042021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=1075,1536 1075w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-finding-screen_042021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=35,50 35w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141065" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Ahead of today&#8217;s event, Apple announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/e-bikes-and-earbuds-among-the-first-third-party-hardware-to-support-apples-find-my-tracking/">the launch of its Find My Network Accessory program</a>, which officially opened the doors to third-party manufacturers who wanted access to the Find My app. Early adopters included VanMoof’s S3 and X3 e-bikes, Belkin’s SOUNDFORM Freedom True Wireless Earbuds, and an AirTags competitor, the Chipolo ONE Spot &#8212; but not Tile. We understand Tile doesn&#8217;t want to participate in Find My because it has a direct relationship with customers through its own iOS app that it doesn&#8217;t want to give up.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s entry in this &#8220;lost item finder&#8221; space means competitors, like Tile, will have more serious competition even with the concessions Apple has made with the opening up of &#8220;Find My.&#8221; Tile so far has responded to Apple&#8217;s plans by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">pre-announcing its plans to launch its own UWB-powered tracker</a>, arriving this year. Apple&#8217;s tight hold over its ecosystem benefits its launch of new products, like AirTags, forcing Tile to focus on touting its advantages, like its wider variety of form factors and cross-platform support.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Apple says customers can pre-order AirTag beginning at 5 a.m. PDT on Friday, April 23. The Apple Store app, Apple Stores locations, Apple Authorized Resellers and select carriers will stock AirTags and other accessories as of Friday, April 30.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After years of increased competition from Spotify, Apple today announced its own expansion into podcast subscriptions. At the company&#8217;s spring event this afternoon, Apple unveiled its plans for a podcasts subscription service which would allow listeners to unlock &#8220;additional benefits,&#8221; like ad-free listening, early access to episodes and the ability to support favorite creators. The service will be available as part of Apple&#8217;s newly updated Podcasts app where free podcasts are also found.</p>
<p>The announcement of the new service, Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, follows shortly after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spotify-podcast-listeners-to-top-apples-for-the-first-time-in-2021-forecast-claims/">an industry report suggested</a> that Spotify&#8217;s podcast listeners would top Apple&#8217;s for the first time in 2021.</p>
<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook briefly introduced the subscription at the launch of today&#8217;s event, noting that this was &#8220;the biggest change to Apple Podcasts since its debut.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cook also noted the Apple Podcasts app had been updated, with newly redesigned show and episode pages that make it easier to listen, follow and share podcasts. The app will also include a new &#8220;Channels&#8221; feature that lets you find shows from favorite creators and get recommendations. This area will include both free channels and paid channels, which feature benefits for paid subscribers.</p>
<p>The channels themselves are groups of shows curated by creators, with &#8220;unique titles, descriptions, and artwork,&#8221; Apple says.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2141045" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="362" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg 2702w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg?resize=768,409 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg?resize=1536,819 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1091 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The app will also include a &#8220;Smart Play&#8221; button that helps listeners automatically start episodic shows from the latest episode and serialized shows from the beginning of each series, Apple says. Other new features let users save individual episodes for offline playback, an enhanced Search tab for quick access to Top Charts, and an updated <a href="https://podcastsconnect.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-analytics-exit-link="">Apple Podcasts Connect</a> dashboard for podcasters. The dashboard allows creators to edit their shows&#8217; metadata, schedule and manage show availability, organize shows into channels, manage multiple users and roles, and track how well their shows are doing via new performance metrics and visualization tools.</p>
<p>Apple said the new service will be available in May to listeners in more than 170 countries and regions.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-leads-the-next-chapter-of-podcasting-with-apple-podcasts-subscriptions/">press release</a>, Apple said the first premium subscriptions would come from both &#8220;independent voices and premier studios,&#8221; including Tenderfoot TV, Pushkin Industries, Radiotopia from PRX, and QCODE, as well as larger brands like NPR, the Los Angeles Times, The Athletic, Sony Music Entertainment, and others.</p>
<p>“Fifteen years ago, Apple took podcasts mainstream, offering creators a premier, open platform to inform, entertain, and inspire hundreds of millions of listeners around the world,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, in a statement. “Today, Apple Podcasts is the best place for listeners to discover and enjoy millions of great shows, and we are proud to lead the next chapter of podcasting with Apple Podcasts Subscriptions. We’re excited to introduce this powerful new platform to creators around the world, and we can’t wait to hear what they make with it.”</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s plans for a podcast subscription service was previously scooped by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-spring-event-expected-to-reveal-latest-ipad-pro-subscription-podcasts-11618911002?page=1">The Wall St. Journal</a>, which said the company was preparing to add a paid subscription option to its product, as well as by Vox Media’s <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;jsonp=vglnk_161893061758410&amp;key=c1c7d488bb2df8a8b659d5d41634d304&amp;libId=knq4nliq010023dg000DL3p0gc3luw2cs&amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2021%2F04%2F19%2Freport-premium-podcasts-subscription-service-to-be-announced-at-the-apple-event%2F&amp;v=1&amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fpkafka%2Fstatus%2F1383878437119479811&amp;title=Report%3A%20Premium%20podcasts%20subscription%20service%20to%20be%20announced%20at%20the%20Apple%20event%20-%209to5Mac&amp;txt=podcast%20subscription%20service">Peter Kafka</a>, who said he believed Apple would introduce a paywalled podcast subscription product at today&#8217;s event. There were also hints found in the iOS 14.5 beta, which showed a redesigned Podcasts app featuring an account button on the Listen Now tab. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/19/apple-may-announce-podcasts-service-at-event/">MacRumors</a> had reported that show notifications had been relocated here, and suggested that managing paid subscriptions may also be found in this new area in the future.</p>
<p>The move to enter the subscription podcast space follows years of significant investment by the Apple Podcasts and Apple Music competitor, Spotify, also a chief Apple critic.</p>
<p>Spotify in February noted it had <a href="https://www.axios.com/spotify-podcasts-number-6c06a71f-6548-4f03-b7e1-5c9e71814f62.html">tripled</a> the number of podcasts on its platform, year-over-year, to 2.2 million. It has also forged a variety of exclusive deals over the years with big names like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/spotify-signs-the-joe-rogan-experience-to-an-exclusive-multi-year-deal/">Joe Rogan</a>, Kim Kardashian, DC Comics, Michelle Obama and The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, among others. And it has acquired podcast startups, ad tech and studios, including hosting and ad company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">Megaphone</a>, creation tools from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/">Anchor</a>, content producers like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/">Gimlet</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/spotify-is-buying-the-ringer-to-boost-its-sports-podcast-content/">The Ringer,</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/spotify-acquires-true-crime-studio-parcast-to-expand-its-original-podcast-content/">Parcast.</a></p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/spotify-signs-the-joe-rogan-experience-to-an-exclusive-multi-year-deal/">Spotify announced plans for its own podcast subscriptions</a> via an Anchor feature and invested in live audio through its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spotify-is-getting-into-live-audio-because-of-course-it-is/">acquisition of live chat app Locker Room</a> by Betty Labs. Spotify had said it would share subscription revenue with podcast creators, who would keep the majority of their earnings.</p>
<h2>What podcast creators need to know:</h2>
<ul>
<li>We understand from people familiar with Apple&#8217;s Podcasts Subscriptions product that Apple will not dictate the terms podcast creators offer as part of their subscription. It&#8217;s an open marketplace where they can choose whether a subscription offers ad-free listening, bonus episodes, access to archival content or anything else.</li>
<li>Shows can be fully free, paid or &#8220;freemium&#8221; where there&#8217;s a mix of free content anyone can access, with the ability to upgrade to a paid subscription.</li>
<li>Pricing starts at around $0.49 per month in the U.S. (This is no App Store, apparently!) But creators can set their own pricing.</li>
<li>Apple takes 30% of the revenue in year one, then drops its cut to 15% in year two &#8212; just like it does for streaming services and other subscription products.</li>
<li>Podcasters can distribute their shows anywhere, they don&#8217;t have to be exclusive to Apple Podcasts. Presumably, this means podcasters could offer their paid content on other platforms, like Spotify, to increase their earnings.</li>
<li>Apple is not selling ads for podcasters at this time. Creators keep 100% of the ad revenue.</li>
<li>Creators will not have access to listeners&#8217; personal data, like Apple IDs and their associated emails. The podcasts analytics offer anonymized, aggregated insights.</li>
<li>They will, however, be able to track new metrics like &#8220;most engaged listeners&#8221; and &#8220;top cities,&#8221; which could help them to tailor their podcast to their biggest fans or plan their next live show.</li>
<li>Subscriptions can be for either individual shows or groups of shows, called Channels. For example, paid podcast subscription service Luminary is a &#8220;Channel.&#8221; Podcast networks can also be Channels, like Radiotopia.</li>
<li>Channels can also be free, paid or freemium, just like individual shows. And they can also define their country-by-country availability and local pricing.</li>
<li>Subscription content is uploaded via Apple Podcasts Connect, not RSS.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/as-crypto-comes-back-binance-backed-injective-protocol-launches-testnet-for-its-defi-trading-platform/">December</a> last year <a href="https://injectiveprotocol.com/">Injective Protocol</a>, launched the testnet for its DeFi protocols for cross-chain derivatives trading, with  backing from giant crypto exchange Binance. It has now raised $10 million in a “party&#8221; funding round. Participating in the round was Pantera Capital, BlockTower, Hashed, Cadenza Ventures (formerly BitMex Ventures), CMS, and QCP Capital. Billionaire NBA team owner and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban <a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1362427956107345924?s=21">has also</a> made a strategic investment into Injective, according to my sources.</p>
<p>Injective’s main competitors (centralized and decentralized exchanges) include CME Group, BitMEX, LedgerX and OKEx, among others. The advantage of the approach used by Injective (it says) combines the advantages of decentralized exchanges: resistance to front running, scams, and hacks, with the speed, low transaction fees, and no gas fees associated with centralized platforms. Developers can also create their own derivatives and markets to trade.</p>
<p>Eric Chen, CEO of Injective Protocol said in a statement: “Legacy institutions and practices create a number of artificial delays and middlemen that prevent innovation in the financial markets ecosystem. At Injective, our goal is to enable an unparalleled decentralized trading experience, whereby retail traders globally can for the first time access limitless markets without the typical predatory fees and slow transaction times”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The background to this is that Injective is essentially trying to build a decentralized competitor to Robinhood, because their platform allows the creation of synthetic tokens that represent stock in public companies like Apple and indices like S&amp;P 500. This means meaning trading can happen 24/7 with instant finalization, as DeFi promises.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do I invest in Injective: the whole stop out because of the capital requirements, Robinhood didn’t do it on purpose to hurt traders, they just didn’t have enough equity and they would have gone bankrupt because they had too many customers. But if you’re doing it in a decentralized manner every investor gets to see how much Injective has of all of this, there’s no hiding it and that creates an opportunity&#8221;, said Mark Cuban on his investment in Injective.</p>
<p>The potential here is that brokers wouldn’t be able to block trades on certain stocks, as they did with GameStop, as pointed out by Cuban above.</p>
<p>Injective’s team is drawn from Stanford University, came up with its project in 2018, and Chen was working at hedge funds and worked in cryptographic research at a blockchain-focused fund.</p>
