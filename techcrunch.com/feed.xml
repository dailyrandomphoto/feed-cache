					<description><![CDATA[Battery Ventures' State of the OpenCloud report provides a set of data points that pretty clearly outline the accelerated growth of cloud services in recent quarters. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.battery.com/">Battery Ventures</a> released its <a href="https://www.battery.com/opencloud-2021/">State of the OpenCloud</a> report today, providing a set of data points that pretty clearly outline the accelerated growth of cloud services in recent quarters.</p>
<p>The report helps explain <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">the race to invest capital</a> into startups that we’ve been observing over the past 18 months.</p>
<p>The pandemic pushed companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/saas-earnings-rise-as-pandemic-pushes-companies-more-rapidly-to-the-cloud/">to start using cloud services</a> — infrastructure, platform or SaaS — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/the-accelerating-digital-transformation-redux/">earlier and quicker than they might have otherwise</a>. That resulted in big investments, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">eye-popping IPOs</a>, and tremendous revenue growth for software companies of all stripes, especially those built atop open-source code.</p>
<p>Consider this tidbit from the report: &#8220;The average infrastructure-software IPO valuation has increased 10 times over the last 10 years, and there are more infrastructure-software companies valued at $10 billion or more than ever before.” What&#8217;s more, the data implies a healthy pipeline of major cloud IPOs.</p>
<p>Battery believes that the cloud market could eventually be worth $1 trillion. When you consider that the vast majority of work, development and computing will be done in the cloud at some point, the investment group’s round-number projection may prove modest.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			This report makes it clear that despite the tremendous growth numbers we have seen recently, we are still just scratching the surface of the cloud&#8217;s potential.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That’s our takeaway. While the digital transformation is evident and startling, this report makes it clear that despite the nigh-incredible growth numbers we have seen recently, we are still just scratching the surface of the cloud&#8217;s potential.</p>
<h2>Public cloud acceleration</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">Amazon’s AWS public cloud platform is big business</a>. Amazon breaks out its results on a quarterly basis, showing the world exactly how much cloud revenue it generates, as well as the resulting operating profit. Microsoft also breaks out growth for its Azure service, but with other services included in the reporting category, the exact number is harder to nail down.</p>
<p>Battery’s report gives us per-platform data. In Q2 2021, the venture capital firm reckons that AWS reached a $59 billion run rate, while Azure hit $37 billion and Google Cloud reached $19 billion — and this was before the companies reported Q3 results.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2227985" style="width: 2814px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227985" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2227985 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg" alt="Battery State of Cloud Report - Slide 5 - Cloud infrastructure market growth" width="2804" height="1576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg 2804w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2804px) 100vw, 2804px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227985" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Battery Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>Critically, Battery&#8217;s Q2 figures were up an aggregate 44% compared to a year earlier — the growth has accelerated from an early-pandemic low of 36% in Q2 of last year. Indeed, since the second quarter of 2020, public cloud growth has either held steady or risen.</p>
<p>Given the sheer amount of dollars involved in these figures, the acceleration of growth from 36% to 44% is incredibly material: The three cloud platforms closed Q2 2021 on a combined run rate of $115 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration has ordered nearly all federal agencies to patch hundreds of security bugs, some that were first found the best part of a decade ago.</p>
<p>The new binding operational directive, issued by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday, gives federal agencies six months to fix <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">more than 300 security vulnerabilities</a> that it has identified as carrying &#8220;significant risk&#8221; to their networks. Agencies have just two weeks to fix the more recent bugs from 2021, the directive said.</p>
<p>CISA said these security bugs, some of which date back to 2014 and 2015, are a &#8220;frequent attack vector&#8221; for cybercriminals targeting federal agencies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228380" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The directive, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-to-order-federal-agencies-to-fix-hundreds-of-cyber-flaws-11635937200?st=t65m61h2hompm75&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share">first reported</a> by The Wall Street Journal, applies to most civilian federal agencies, but carves out exceptions for networks run by the military and under the Defense Department or the intelligence community, which are managed separately.</p>
<p>Federal agencies are largely left to manage their cybersecurity efforts, like rolling out security patches. Since 2015, federal agencies were <a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/15-01/">first mandated</a> to fix &#8220;critical&#8221; security bugs within a month of public disclosure, and in 2019 that was <a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/19-02/">expanded to include</a> fixes for high-severity bugs as well.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/30/government-investigation-finds-federal-agencies-failing-at-cybersecurity-basics/">the government&#8217;s own watchdog</a> has said some federal agencies still struggle with the cybersecurity basics. According to the Journal, many of the bugs in the new directive weren&#8217;t previously covered, a tacit nod to how seemingly less-impactful bugs can still cause significant damage or disruption if exploited.</p>
<p>“The Directive lays out clear requirements for federal civilian agencies to take immediate action to improve their vulnerability management practices and dramatically reduce their exposure to cyber attacks,&#8221; said CISA Director Jen Easterly in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;While this Directive applies to federal civilian agencies, we know that organizations across the country, including critical infrastructure entities, are targeted using these same vulnerabilities. It is therefore critical that every organization adopt this Directive and prioritize mitigation of vulnerabilities listed in CISA’s public catalog,&#8221; said Easterly.</p>
<p>Rep. Jim Langevin, a member of the House Armed Services&#8217; subcommittee on cyber, said the CISA directive &#8220;will go a long way towards strengthening network security and improving our federal cyber hygiene.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Archive.ai founders believe the future of marketing will be a culture of “building with you” versus the “talking at you” approach they believe traditional digital marketing is doing now.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When marketers Paul Benigeri and Geoffrey Woo were at their former companies, in food tech and e-commerce infrastructure, respectively, they experienced how manual and repetitive digital marketing workflows were, especially as the number of disparate and unintegrated marketing tools grew.</p>
<p>With the goal of making their own lives easier, they formed <a href="http://archive.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archive.ai</a> in March to build technology that connects databases and distribution channels so they talk to each other and to address what they believe will be the future of marketing — “building with you” — versus the “talking at you” approach the founders believe traditional digital marketing is doing.</p>
<p>Its two initial products are Archive, a Shopify app that automatically detects, classifies and saves Instagram stories relating to a brand, and Archive Communities, which makes influencer marketing programmatic so that brands can more quickly scale their community-building efforts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227888" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228392" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228392" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228392" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg" alt="Archive.ai" width="1024" height="536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg 4800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=1536,804 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=2048,1072 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228392" class="wp-caption-text">Archive.ai dashboard</p></div></p>
<p>In fact, Woo, who is chairman of Archive.ai, said via email that the company is pioneering a new approach to digital marketing it calls &#8220;community marketing.&#8221;</p>
<p>“This takes ideas from influencer marketing, affiliate marketing, loyalty programs and community management,” he said. “Much of the existing services operate in silos and don&#8217;t inter-operate well. Also since Apple banned the Facebook tracking pixel with iOS 14 in recent months, a lot of the paid social media advertising has become exorbitantly inefficient for most e-commerce companies.”</p>
<p>Before incorporating, the company was a profitable project, according to Woo. Its list of enterprise customers includes Four Sigmatic, CEO Benigeri’s former company Health Via Modern Nutrition and some household names he was not ready to say yet. There are over 40 alpha testers on Archive App with more than 200 people on the waitlist. The company expects to go live with Archive App before the end of November.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, to “properly build a next-generation community marketing technology company,” as Woo put it, the company decided to go after some venture capital. Today, it announced $4.068 million in funding led by Stripe.</p>
<p>Also joining in on the round were Lux Capital, Sugar Capital and Anti Fund, as well as a group of individual investors that included Ramp CEO Eric Glyman and CTO Karim Atiyeh, Attentive CEO Brian Long and CPO Andrew Jones, Applied Intuition CEO Qasar Younis and Hugging Face CEO Clement Delangue.</p>
<p>With the new funding, the company tripled its headcount to 36 people, and its monthly recurring revenue grew 58% since April. The company also intends to triple the engineering team to focus on workflow automations and machine learning to assist and streamline marketing tasks and decisions.</p>
<p>In addition, plans include building out a marketing team. Kwan Kim recently joined Archive.ai as head of growth after being the first digital marketing hire for Recurly and scaling the company to its <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/accel-kkr-acquires-recurly--edf88647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition by Accel-KKR</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;Archive gives businesses an easy way to review and, more importantly, understand what their customers are actually saying — the north star for every smart company,” Chris Sperandio, corporate development lead at Stripe, said in a written statement. “We’re excited to invest in Archive and, in doing so, to help their users grow internet-enabled commerce.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kneron has launched its first automotive-grade chip — fueled by funds from Foxconn, Alibaba, Sequoia, Horizons Ventures, and Qualcomm — that it says could revolutionize the path to vehicle autonomy.</p>
<p>The chip industry has been dominated by legacy and tech companies like Intel, AMD and Qualcomm. Kneron – which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/delta-electronics-kneron/">raised over $100 million to date</a> – has quickly emerged as a startup that deserves attention. Its chips are already being used by Otus, which supplies aftermarket advanced driver assistance systems to Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi. With the new chip, the Kneron KL530, the startup is looking to take a greater share of the automotive market.</p>
<p>The Kneron KL530 has two major innovations, according to CEO Albert Liu: it supports Vision Transformers (ViT), as opposed to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); and it has a 4-bit data processor. Together, he says this results in more accurate image detection and decreased processing time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228007" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Both ViTs and CNNs are deep learning models, but up until this point transformers have been very difficult to implement in hardware, Liu said. “[The] transformer itself is a whole new class of architecture design, which can beat the accuracy and performance [of CNN chips] significantly,” he added. “Anything related to time-series judgment, for example, voice recognition or behavior recognition, the transformer can have much better performance.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228140" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228140" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228140" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg" alt="Kneron CEO Albert Liu" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg 7952w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228140" class="wp-caption-text">Kneron CEO Albert Liu</p></div></p>
<p>As opposed to CNNs, ViTs make inferences holistically, not just based on specific features but an amalgamation of all features in a space. Liu gave the example of a big white truck against a cloudy sky backdrop. A CNN might infer that the big white object must also be part of the sky – putting the vehicle at risk of hitting the truck – while a ViT would process not only the visual white area but also the things delineating it as a truck, like the wheels, and the boundary around it.</p>
<p>The KL530’s other major innovation is the 4 bit data processor, which can reduce data processing times compared to 32 bit and 8 bit processors. It can also process more frames per second, reducing processing time by up to 66%, without a commensurate increase in power consumption. It can detect more apertures within any given time, so things like facial recognition can be sped up by up to half a second.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“That means more safety in automotive applications,” Liu said, because decision-making can occur that much faster.</p>
<p>Overall, Kneron says the new chip has up to two times more TOPS/watt over its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/kneron-launches-its-new-ai-chip-to-challenge-google-and-others/">custom chip KL520</a>. The chip also has an image system processor, which enables a 1080P resolution, blind spot detection, classification, distance measuring, and hazard recognition.</p>
<p>The chip will be released in two versions, one for the aftermarket and one to be built directly into the vehicle. The chips will be used in the forthcoming vehicles that Foxconn is manufacturing under its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/foxconn-unveils-three-new-ev-prototypes/amp/">Foxtron brand in collaboration with Taiwan’s Yulon Motor</a>. Kneron is in the process of delivering sample orders to other customers, and anticipates entering mass production by the first quarter of next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Chevy Bolt recall was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/lg-will-cover-nearly-the-entire-cost-of-gms-chevy-bolt-ev-recall/">huge and expensive setback</a> for GM — and arguably the broader EV market.</p>
<p>The sheer number of vehicles — about 141,000 — highlighted the fact that neither battery cell supplier LG Chem nor GM could pinpoint exactly which batteries had defects. The companies only knew that problems within LG Chem&#8217;s battery cell manufacturing operations could increase the risk of fire in some, not all, cars.</p>
<p>One company, Voltaiq, is working to make sure that these types of &#8220;just replace all the batteries in all the cars&#8221; recalls don&#8217;t become commonplace.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226528" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s so-called Enterprise Battery Intelligence (EBI) platform doesn&#8217;t add more sensors to the battery, instead, it uses data already available from the pack and presents it to automakers, tech companies and battery manufacturers in a way that&#8217;s easy to understand and that can help them assess the health of the system.</p>
<p>It goes beyond what&#8217;s already out there on the road today and works down the supply chain with cell suppliers. Founded in 2012, Voltaiq helps make sense of all that data and presents it in a way that helps when things are about to go sideways. It can also signal to a company when something isn&#8217;t up to snuff at any point in time from the mines and R&amp;D to testing and installation in a device.</p>
<p>Voltaiq&#8217;s tech has already won over some automakers. The system is used by Mercedes-Benz, two of the Detroit Big Three automakers (although they would not share the names of those companies) and tech companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft.</p>
<p>&#8220;It all comes down to the fact that the battery is fundamentally different than any other component in our modern devices. Everything else is mechanical or semiconductor in nature,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Tal Sholklapper told TechCrunch. Sholklapper noted that batteries are almost like a living, breathing being, with complex, nuanced and unpredictable behavior over their entire life cycle. Understanding how these sometimes volatile components tick requires sorting through a lot of data, and that&#8217;s where Voltaiq comes in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Voltaiq says that the analytics software it provides reduces hundreds of hours of sorting through information and surfacing just the data that&#8217;s required by a company and its researchers. The system can also help do spot checks of batteries being delivered by suppliers. In some cases, its customers have noted that these checks have found formulation changes in battery chemistry that a cell supplier had implemented but not informed Voltaiq&#8217;s client.</p>
<p>One case Voltaiq shared was that before they were brought on by one automaker, the OEM had an issue that caused a massive delay. About a month before a vehicle was set to launch, the battery they were supplied failed qualification. In other words, it wasn&#8217;t going to work. By the time the company was able to secure a new battery supplier, it was 18 months after the initial launch date. The startup could have detected that issue before it was delivered and could have helped the supplier or alerted the OEM of the problem.</p>
<p>Voltaiq wouldn&#8217;t comment on the woes that GM and LG Chem are experiencing. The Voltaiq platform&#8217;s ability to spot issues before its installed in a vehicle, perform regular health checks and be able to identify which batch of batteries have the potential to experience a problem, could reduce the types of recalls GM is going through right now.</p>
<p>There are other companies out there doing what Voltaiq does. However, Voltaiq&#8217;s co-founders contend that competition mostly comes from its potential customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because this is engineering data, there&#8217;s still this desire for the OEMs to own it and do it in-house. So we see this, like, build versus buy behavior,&#8221; co-founder and CTO Eli Leland said.</p>
<p>Two customers that initially tried that approach were Microsoft and Google. Both figured they could tackle it themselves. Now they&#8217;re Volatiq customers.</p>
<p>Most companies don&#8217;t see themselves as battery companies. And yet, batteries are central to the devices they&#8217;re selling — and customers are buying. From voice-assistant powered speakers and the latest EVs to the energy storage facilities on the electric grid in places like Hawaii and Australia, the chemistry that keeps the lights on, the wheels rolling and the tunes pumping could do with some better understanding.</p>
<p>For all those applications and more, knowing what&#8217;s going on in the lithium-ion pack is becoming more important than ever. Just ask GM.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DoorDash is introducing SafeDash, a new in-app security toolkit aimed at helping its delivery providers feel safe while they work. SafeDash is rolling out in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Users on the delivery side of the platform across the U.S. will get access to SafeDash by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The company has partnered with ADT to launch two new features within the toolkit. The &#8216;safety reassurance call&#8217; feature lets users connect with an ADT agent through the Dasher app in instances where they may feel unsafe. The ADT agent will remain on the phone until the individual feels safe. If the incident escalates, and the person is unresponsive for a period of time, ADT will contact 911 to request an emergency response to their last known location, based on GPS from their smartphone.</p>
<p>DoorDash is also rolling out an &#8217;emergency assistance button&#8217; that allows users to seek help if needed. Once a delivery person clicks the button, an ADT agent will contact 911 and discreetly stay in contact with them via text messages. The agent will then pass along critical information, such as the person&#8217;s location, to 911 operators. The company notes that this feature allows users to get help from 911 without having to speak on the phone.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227905" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2227931" style="width: 217px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227931" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2227931" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/toolkit.gif" alt="" width="207" height="407" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227931" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: DoorDash</strong></p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;SafeDash was born out of feedback from Dashers, and our hope is that with access to these tools, we’re giving Dashers yet another resource to feel safe and secure on the road,&#8221; said Elizabeth Jarvis-Shean, DoorDash’s vice-president of communications and policy, in a statement.</p>
<p>DoorDash says it plans to develop more features for the toolkit and is looking to launch virtual  education resources, direct communications, educational materials, and in-app guidance in the future. It&#8217;s worth noting that DoorDash&#8217;s SafeDash toolkit is similar to Uber&#8217;s driver <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/emergencybutton/">Safety Toolkit</a>, which also includes an in-app emergency assistance button and several other features.</p>
<p>The launch of SafeDash follows DoorDash’s forecast of a potentially <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/280253921/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/DASH-Q2-2021-Letter-to-Shareholders_FINAL.pdf">weaker Q3</a>, citing the ongoing uncertainty around how consumer behavior related to the pandemic may continue to impact its business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.questdb.io/">QuestDB</a>, makers of the speedy open source time series database, announced $12 million Series A today from 468 Capital, Uncorrelated Ventures and a list of industry angels including Alexis Ohanian. The company has now raised a total of $14.3 million including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/questdb-nabs-2-3m-seed-to-build-open-source-time-series-database/">$2.3 million seed</a> announced last July.</p>
<p>Since that time, the startup, which was a member of the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/questdb">Y Combinator summer 2020</a> cohort, has been working hard to build a community around the open source project, while working on the enterprise version and an upcoming hosted version, which should be ready by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Customers can install the enterprise version on their cloud of choice and manage it themselves, but the company has been hearing requests from customers for something easier.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228133" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is something that a lot of companies have been asking us about. Essentially, most companies do not want to deal with the operational complexity of hosting on their own cloud. And they want the database provider to host that on their behalf,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Nicolas Hourcard told me.</p>
<p>The database is built for speed and is fast enough that companies using Quest can cut back on servers, which they often will use to make up for lost speed on the database side. As Hourcard told TechCrunch at the time of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/questdb-nabs-2-3m-seed-to-build-open-source-time-series-database/">the seed funding</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re building an open source database for time series data, and time series databases are a multi-billion-dollar market because they’re central for financial services, IoT and other enterprise applications. And we basically make it easy to handle explosive amounts of data, and to reduce infrastructure costs massively.<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>On the open source front, Quest has built a Slack community with over 900 developers and over 70 code contributors have helped out on the project. In addition, the founders started a group made up of Y Combinator alums who have built businesses on open source and have 100 members in that group. The group meets regularly to discuss issues related to their chosen business model and hear from successful open source company founders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the commercial side, they wouldn&#8217;t share the number of customers, but did cite Airbus and Yahoo (the parent company of this publication) as paying customers. The enterprise product has features like more flexibility around the deployment and making it easier to operate quickly at scale.</p>
<p>So far the company has 15 employees with plans to double that number in the next six months if things continue to go according to plan. Hourcard believes that as an open source and fully remote company, it should help to build a more diverse workforce.&#8221;We don&#8217;t pose limits in terms of where we&#8217;re going to hire or what sort of backgrounds, and we think that diversity ultimately would benefit the company&#8217;s culture, so we&#8217;re trying to do that the best we can,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He says that sometimes an employee can be an open source contributor first, who shows knowledge and enthusiasm for the product. &#8220;Open source is an amazing way of getting to meet developers from different areas, and it&#8217;s true that sometimes you see a contributor who [is making a big] contribution, and then there is the question, &#8216;okay, should we bring this person the team,'&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the number of people becoming independent workers rises, investors are taking notice of startups helping these workers build their businesses. <a href="https://www.honeybook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HoneyBook</a> is the latest to feel some love in this area, unveiling Wednesday that it raised $250 million in Series E funding, just six months after securing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/honeybook-raises-155m-at-1b-valuation-to-help-smbs-freelancers-manage-their-businesses/">$155 million of Series D</a> capital.</p>
<p>The new round propels the San Francisco-based company’s valuation to $2.4 billion, HoneyBook CEO Oz Alon told TechCrunch via email.</p>
<p>HoneyBook’s software enables business owners to organize their workflow, streamline their client list and manage cash flow. Tools include embedded financial services, like payments and the company’s recently launched capital product, which gives eligible members access to the funds for business growth. The new product integrates the repayment process transparently into existing transactions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228105" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>This time around, Tiger Global Management doubled down on its investment into the company to lead the round. Durable Capital Partners, which led the Series D, Norwest Venture Partners, Citi Ventures and OurCrowd also participated.</p>
<p>Referred to as the “Great Resignation,” nearly 20 million people quit their jobs between April and August 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/jolts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey</a>. At the same time, the Census also reported that over 4 million applications for new businesses were filed between January and September of this year.</p>
<p>“This has heightened demand for software to support the needs of independent business owners,” Alon said. “They’re looking for a platform to help them manage their client flow and cash flow, and that’s what HoneyBook does.”</p>
<p>In addition, attitudes toward the value of work are changing across the board as many businesses are now more willing to outsource work to independent contractors, he added.</p>
<p>Not only did that shift yield double HoneyBook’s annual recurring revenue since the beginning of 2021, the company also more than doubled its new subscribers in the last 12 months. Its members also achieved success, Alon noted, booking more than $1.8 billion on the platform in 2021, bringing total bookings to over $5 billion since the company launched in 2013.</p>

<p>HoneyBook did not plan to raise this quickly, but the existing investors saw that growth and more independent workers emerging and wanted to “deepen their partnership with us,” Alon said.</p>
<p>“They understood the opportunity in front of us and decided to double down on their investment in our mission to help independent businesses be successful,” he added. “We’re very lucky to be supported by a great community of investors who share our values and are aligned with our vision for the long-term.”</p>
<p>HoneyBook isn’t alone, joining several companies focused on independent workers that announced new rounds in the past several months. For example, Contra, a professional network for independent workers, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/independent-worker-network-contra-goes-commission-free-as-it-secures-new-nea-led-capital/">$30 million in Series B funding</a>, while Lean brought in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/former-head-of-mint-raises-4-5m-for-lean/">$4.5 million in seed funding</a> to support gig workers with financial products. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/all-day-kitchens-wants-to-expand-every-independent-restaurants-delivery-network/">All Day Kitchens</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/owner-com-serves-up-10-7m-so-that-independent-restaurants-can-get-cooking/">Owner.com</a> also raised money to do something similar, but for restaurants.</p>
<p>Going forward, HoneyBook has plans to provide more financial services and will use the new funding on that product development and to get additional new features to market quicker, Alon said.</p>
<p>“We know that cash flow is one of the biggest challenges independent businesses face,” he added. “To do that we also need to continue attracting great talent and we are hiring for a number of exciting roles across our teams in the U.S. and Israel. We have big goals for 2022 and beyond as we continue to support the independent business category.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo&#8217;s self-driving cars will make an appearance in New York City on Thursday, but don&#8217;t expect to hail a robotaxi in the Big Apple anytime soon — or ever.</p>
<p>The company is a long way from testing or launching its autonomous vehicles commercially in the city. Instead, Waymo announced plans to manually drive its vehicles to map areas of the densely populated city and then use all of that data to advance its technology.</p>
<p>Waymo will deploy up to five of its hybrid Chrysler Pacifica minivans on the streets of Manhattan, from the south side of Central Park all the way to the financial district and through the Lincoln Tunnel to a small section of New Jersey. By early next year, Waymo says it hopes to bring in several of its zero-emission Jaguar I-PACEs, which will also driven manually. Each vehicle will have two people, one to drive and another in the passenger seat to help direct the activity of the driver, monitor the software on the vehicle in real time, evaluate the performance and log comments, according to Waymo.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228125" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Even though Waymo won&#8217;t be operating in autonomous mode, all of the vehicles it deploys in NYC will be equipped with the <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2020/03/introducing-5th-generation-waymo-driver.html">fifth generation Waymo Driver</a>, which uses a combination of lidar, radar and cameras and is informed by 20 million self-driven miles on public roads and over 10 billion miles in simulation, according to Waymo.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mapping process is a critical part of our operations,&#8221; Nick Smith, a Waymo spokesperson, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Here&#8217;s how it works: First, we drive our Waymo vehicles on public roads and collect information with our sensor suite. Next, we take that information, clean it up and automatically or manually annotate it with features such as crosswalks, road edges, curb heights, boundary paint, intersections, etc. Then we put our newly-created map through quality control testing. This process is the same no matter where we go, and is also the same process we follow when updating our maps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because Waymo will be manually driving around the city, its cars will be able to drive in almost any weather condition, which the company says provides unique learning opportunities for the next generation of the Waymo Driver. New York City is known for heavy rainfall, and even hurricanes, in the summer and dense snowfall in the winter, conditions that autonomous systems haven&#8217;t yet figured out. Waymo says driving in NYC will allow the company to assess the way its sensors perform in wet, cold conditions in real life, rather than just in data augmentation and simulation testing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If Waymo does choose to one day test its AVs against the chaos of New York&#8217;s jaywalkers, rogue hot dog carts and daredevil cyclists, it&#8217;ll need to apply for <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/dmv/apply-autonomous-vehicle-technology-demonstration-testing-permit">New York State&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology testing permit</a>. In September, <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/03/dot-moves-to-allow-self-driving-car-tests-on-nyc-streets/">NYC Mayor de Blasio introduced legislation</a> that would see companies road testing self-driving cars on the streets to apply for additional $5,000-per-year permits from the NYC DOT.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">This summer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/intels-mobileye-takes-its-autonomous-vehicle-testing-program-to-new-york-city/">Intel&#8217;s Mobileye became the first to win a permit to test its autonomous vehicle technology in NYC</a>. Waymo says it doesn&#8217;t have any immediate plans to launch in the city because it&#8217;s more interested in training its self-driving system and applying the learnings across its fleet. In August, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/waymo-launches-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/">Waymo launched a limited, non-commercial robotaxi service in San Francisco</a> and began scaling up its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/waymo-via-is-scaling-up-autonomous-trucking-operations-in-texas-arizona-california/">autonomous trucking operations in Texas, California and Arizona</a>. The following month, the California Department of Motor Vehicles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/cruise-waymo-get-ok-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/">awarded Waymo a &#8220;drivered deployment permit,&#8221;</a> which is a step in the direction of launching a paid robotaxi service in the state.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">ZipCharge has launched a new type of charging product for EVs that might be able to convince people worried about range anxiety to switch from gas vehicles. The British startup has introduced a powerbank for EVs called <a href="https://www.zipcharge.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">ZipCharge Go</a> at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-climate-change-000051729.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">Cop26</a> climate summit. It&#8217;s about the size of a suitcase and weighs around 50 pounds — plus, it has wheels and a retractable handle, so users can put it in their trunk and easily take it out when they need to charge.</p>
<p>According to the company, the Go can provide up 20 miles of range after being plugged into the car for 30 minutes. A higher capacity version will be able to provide an EV up to 40 miles of range. The device works with any plug-in hybrid or EV with a Type 2 socket, and it can charge that vehicle to its full capacity between 30 minutes to an hour. Charging up the device itself is as easy as plugging it into any socket, and users will be able to control and monitor it through an app, where they can schedule future charges during off-peak hours for cheaper costs.</p>

<p>That said, the ZipCharge Go isn&#8217;t available yet. According to <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/545066/zipcharge-go-portable-ev-charger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><em>InsideEVs</em></a>, the startup plans to release a 4 kWh and an 8 kWh version, as well as to start deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2022. It can be leased for at least £49 (US$67) per month, though it will also be available for purchase to EV owners who don&#8217;t mind paying for one and to businesses like hotels that don&#8217;t have installed charging facilities. While ZipCharge has yet to reveal a price for it, <a href="https://www.driving.co.uk/news/business/zipcharge-portable-ev-charger-unveiled-cop26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><em>The Sunday Times Driving</em></a> section says the company aims to sell it for around the same cost as a 7.2kW home charging port installation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228367" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another big raise in the alternative protein space: <a href="https://futurefarm.io/en_GB/">Future Farm</a>, a Brazilian-based foodtech startup that touts plant-based meat substitutes with a &#8220;true&#8221; meat-like texture, has closed a $58 million Series C funding round, co-led by BTG, as it gears up for rapid growth in the US and Europe.</p>
<p>Other investors in the Series C include existing investors from its Series A and B, including Monashees, Go4It Capital, Turim MFO and Enfini Ventures, along with new investors XP Inc and Rage Capital (which co-led the round).</p>
<p>The 2019-founded startup has raised a total of $89M at this stage, and says its business<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> is now being valued at $400M+.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228337" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Series C funding will be used to get Future Farm&#8217;s range of plant-based meat substitutes into more retail outlets and human mouths.</p>
<p>It is also planning to grow its range to add plant-based milks and &#8216;dairy&#8217; (including a butter alternative) &#8212; to try to cut itself a larger slice of consumers&#8217; shopping budgets.</p>
<p>Future Farm&#8217;s current product range &#8212; which is pretty self-explanatory in branding terms, featuring the likes of &#8216;Future Mince&#8217;, &#8216;Future Burger&#8217; and &#8216;Future Sausage&#8217; &#8212; is available in 24 countries via<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> 10,000 points of sale but the LatAm startup is keen to step that up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It launched products into the UK market at the start of last year &#8212; and touts strong growth in Europe where it says its annual growth rate is 960%. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Overall, it flags that the plant-based meat replacement category is now being valued at $4.2BN globally. While, in the UK alone, the market is said to be worth $0.8BN &#8212; and growing 17% a year.</p>
<p>Global attention on the climate crisis (the <a href="https://ukcop26.org/">CO26 climate conference</a> is taking place in the UK right now) &#8212; and on the need for humanity to cut carbon emissions by taking actions like slashing meat consumption &#8212; is feeding demand for plant-based alternatives to traditional meat-based meals like hamburgers, bolognese and hot dogs.</p>
<p>Investors have responded to this pressure to change eating habits by feeding dollars to a wave of foodtech startups that promise to help meat-eaters effortlessly switch to a better-for-the-planet vegan lifestyle &#8212; &#8216;meatballs&#8217; and all (i.e. just without the actual meat bit).</p>
<p>The alternative protein space has thus become a hotbed of activity in recent years (although it&#8217;s worth noting that plant-based meat alternatives are nothing new, and products selling prepackaged veggie burgers etc date back decades; what&#8217;s new is pressure on consumers to switch and investor interest in the category), with food tech startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/beyond-meat-shares-rise-on-news-that-it-collaborated-with-mcdonalds-on-the-mcplant-options/">Beyond Meat</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/impossible-foods-gobbles-up-another-200-million/">Impossible Foods</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/i-cant-believe-its-not-meat/">Meati</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/mushroom-based-meat-alternative-startup-fable-food-raises-6-5m-aud-will-launch-in-the-u-s/">Fable Food</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/swiss-maker-of-meat-alternatives-planted-will-expand-and-diversify-with-18m-series-a/">Planted</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/heuras-plant-based-chicken-hits-uk-shops/">Heura</a> mushrooming forth, to name a few.</p>
<p>There are also a growing number of lab-grown meat startups trying to keep actual meat on the menu but change its environmental profile by culturing cells in vats as an alternative production process to the intensive farming of animals which is both terrible for the planet and horrible for animal welfare.</p>
<p>Whatever happens with lab-grown meat, the future of food will certainly need to involve everyone eating a lot more plants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Timing is everything in healthcare &#8212; yet too often diagnoses, treatments and procedures are held up by paperwork, administrative red tape between patients, clinicians, carers, bookkeepers, insurance companies and others in the chain of relationships that needs to be processed before steps can be taken. Today a startup called <a href="https://www.notablehealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notable</a>, which is building automation systems to help move that along, is announcing a growth round of $100 million as it finds a ready market for its technology among hundreds of customers, including large networks like Intermountain Healthcare and CommonSpirit Health to cut through the immense amount of what Pranay Kapadia, Notable&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, describes as &#8220;administrative overhead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The healthcare industry on average has $1.1 trillion in administrative spend, which is 8 times as many resources required per $1 billion of revenue as any other industry in the world,&#8221; he said of the annual budget given to all that work. &#8220;There are tens of thousands of workflows that can be automated.&#8221; He estimated that among Notable&#8217;s current customers, across some 350 locations, Notable&#8217;s systems are automating &#8220;millions&#8221; of tasks a year, &#8220;and growing exponentially.&#8221; The company is most active in the U.S. but has plans to take its tech to other markets and to segments adjacent to healthcare, such as health insurance, over time.</p>
<p>Iconiq Growth &#8212; the growth-stage arm of the San Francisco <a href="https://iconiqcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wealth management and investment firm</a> connected to Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Jack Dorsey and other high net-worth tech executives — is leading the Series B, with Greylock Ventures, Oak HC/ FT, and F-Prime also participating. Kapadia confirmed to me that the round values his startup at $600 million post-money. That&#8217;s a big jump for the company: previously it had raised just over $26 million and was last valued, earlier this year, at about $120 million, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/228399-67/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> estimates.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228327" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Notable&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/07/notable-launches-a-service-to-automatically-record-and-digitize-data-from-doctor-visits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sweet spot</a> has been using robotic process automation combined with API integrations and other technologies to speed up some of the administrative work that connects the dots in a healthcare regiment. This could involve the clinical notes that a doctor has to access or update when seeing a patient; the paperwork and billing details that payers need to receive to authorize a treatment or medication; a person registering for a service; or something else in the bigger mix of actions and levers that move when a person encounters a medical environment.</p>
<p>Kapadia tells me that Notable was built out as a concept in the U.S. &#8212; it&#8217;s based out of San Mateo &#8212; out of conversations that he had with family members who are physicians and were complaining about all the busywork they had to do: it didn&#8217;t feel like it used their expertise as such and took them away from having more time to do work they were trained to do. Kapadia &#8212; who had spent years building products at Intuit and then fintech Blend (where he met the other two co-founders of Notable, engineer Justin White and product designer Adam Ting) &#8212; said he saw this as, essentially, the same problem as the one he was building to solve in the back office and in financial services.</p>
<p>The turn to using RPA, meanwhile, for more specific use cases beyond general back-office tasks is a sign of how the concept and technology has been maturing, with innovative tech companies tapping into more specialized areas of knowledge and figuring out how to bring more efficiency to them (another example of that: last week&#8217;s story of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/gluware-raises-43m-for-rpa-tech-that-automatically-detects-and-fixes-anomalies-in-network-configurations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gluware</a>, which uses RPA processes in devops technology).</p>
<p>Notable really came into its own earlier this year, when the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/notable-health-seeks-to-improve-covid-19-vaccine-administration-through-intelligent-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped build a system to let people sign up for Covid-19 vaccination slots</a>: its system automated the process of finding locations and also triaging people based on their ages, health conditions and so on. Kapadia also said that as the pace of vaccinating has slowed, the company is finding a more sustained impact in terms of not just what patients but also providers are looking for in healthcare experiences.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The second order derivatives of the pandemic are that patients and consumers [now] expect touchless digital experiences,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s actually just absolutely crucial.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that the other interesting effect has been on the provider side, where tools like Notable&#8217;s are taking away some of the less satisfying parts of jobs and potentially making working more engaging for people, and in some cases are picking up the slack when there are staff shortages.</p>
<p>&#8220;People talk about the great resignation,&#8221; he said, referring to how so many have willingly pivoted careers during the pandemic. &#8220;Sure, but the reality is that only happens when people are doing jobs they don&#8217;t want to do. What&#8217;s more important in healthcare is it&#8217;s actually really hard to hire. There&#8217;s a staffing shortage at this moment in time. And so you&#8217;re the way that we&#8217;ve built out the platform, really understanding the data model that exists in healthcare, really understanding the tools that you actually need to build what we call flows.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kapadia said he doesn&#8217;t see companies like UiPath or other big players in RPA as potential competitors because of the specialized body of knowledge that Notable has built up in healthcare, which is what both helps the system execute tasks and learn how to do them more efficiently. On the other hand, he says that the company&#8217;s biggest challenge has been in the fact that so much up to now has been stuck in analogue processes, and the fact that healthcare as an industry has &#8212; ironically, given that on the clinical and research sides there have been so many technological innovations &#8212; not really been a technology-led one when it comes to administration.</p>
<p>&#8220;The road to purgatory in health tech is driven by integration, and the road to purgatory in deploying any technology is driven by timelines,&#8221; he said, adding that, often when organizations have focused on back office elements in the past, &#8220;What they&#8217;ve created is a faster hamster wheel.&#8221; In a wider healthcare system that doesn&#8217;t look like it will be changing fast &#8212; providers will continue to consolidate, payers will continue to exist, patients are continuing to live longer and have more problems as a result that can be identified and fixed &#8212; this means that, simply put, a new approach to speeding up connections has to come.</p>
<p class="p5">“Physicians today spend more time in front of their computer than in front of patients,” said Dr. S. Nicholas Desai, Chief Medical Information Officer at Houston Methodist, in a statement. “By automating all of the administrative tasks that clinicians are required to perform, Notable empowers us to practice at top of license and better serve patients in our communities.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[BrainCheck has several new initiatives in the works to close the loop with the patient journey that will be brought to market soon.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the world’s population ages, more is being learned about brain health as startups leverage technology to find a way to slow down cognitive impairment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.braincheck.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrainCheck</a>, a Houston- and Austin-based company developing cognitive healthcare software to aid physicians in detecting and managing this type of care, raised $10 million in Series B funding to expand its R&amp;D and go-to-market capabilities as it works on new digital therapeutics for Alzheimer’s and related dementias.</p>
<p>The round was led by Next Coast Ventures and S3 Ventures, which were joined by Nueterra Capital, Tensility Ventures and True Wealth Ventures. In addition, UPMC Enterprises and SelectQuote came on as strategic investors. The latest funding gives the company roughly $21 million in total funding raised to date, which includes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/braincheck-raises-3-million-for-app-to-monitor-brain-health/">$3 million seed round</a> in 2016 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/this-startup-just-raised-8-million-to-help-busy-doctors-assess-the-cognitive-health-of-50-million-seniors/">$8 million in Series A funding</a> from 2019.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227732" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;This startup just raised $8 million to help busy doctors assess the cognitive health of 50 million seniors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/this-startup-just-raised-8-million-to-help-busy-doctors-assess-the-cognitive-health-of-50-million-seniors/embed/#?secret=kAZlWi7q4O" data-secret="kAZlWi7q4O" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>BrainCheck’s technology acts as a bridge between patients and the limited number of neurologists, about 12,000, in the U.S. Through 10- to 15-minute tests, performed in-person or remote (via a smartphone, tablet or computer), cognitive function can be detected early and more accurately.</p>
<p>Based on the test, patients are assigned a Cognitive Quotient (CQ) score, which is then used to produce a personalized cognitive care plan within minutes. Over 400 neurology, primary care and geriatrics practices use the technology currently, including Mount Sinai clinicians, which are using it to track and manage cognitive impairment resulting from COVID-19.</p>
<p>The pandemic has changed everything across the healthcare ecosystem, Yael Katz, PhD, co-founder and CEO of BrainCheck, told TechCrunch via email.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company always had it in mind to raise another round two years after its Series A, but Katz said the global pandemic gave them pause to see how it would impact that decision. However, due to COVID shining a light on how people perceive healthcare and became more comfortable with remote care, they saw an opportunity to continue.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to continue to grow its team and invest in R&amp;D. It already has several new initiatives in the works to close the loop with the patient journey that will be brought to market soon, she added.</p>
<p>Over the last year, BrainCheck experienced year over year revenue growth increase three times, and Katz expects the same trajectory for next year. With the Series B, the goal remains the same as it was two years ago — double down on growth.</p>
<p>“From the shift to remote work and an increased prioritization of mental health, to investing in preventive medicine and supporting the aging population, all of these factors have come together to make the case that what we’re doing matters, and will continue to matter,” she said. “It’s never been more important for physicians to invest in a tool like BrainCheck and improve treatment across the patient journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market for food and grocery delivery across Africa and the Middle East is <a href="https://store.fitchsolutions.com/all-products/egypt-food-drink-report">worth nearly $1 trillion</a>. And Egypt, buoyed by a young and growing population, is a big market across both regions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are beginning to back their picks to capture a large chunk of the nascent but fast-growing sector, mirroring how things have played out in Europe and the U.S. this past year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, <a href="https://www.breadfast.com/">Breadfast</a>, an online grocery delivery company that wants to become a regional leader in the sector has raised $26 million in Series A financing from an impressive group of investors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They include lead investors <a href="https://www.vostoknewventures.com/">Vostok New Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.endurecap.com/">Endure Capital</a> and participating investors JAM Fund (led by Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen), YC Continuity Fund, a large unnamed Saudi-based fund, Shorooq Partners, 4DX Ventures and logistics giant Flexport.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228096" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment is coming two years after Breadfast raised a $2 million pre-Series A round. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, the Egyptian on-demand delivery company has secured more than $30 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story of Breadfast started in 2017 with bread and bakery when <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mostafaaminway">Mostafa Amin</a>, <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/muhammadhabib">Muhammad Habib</a> and <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/nofal">Abdallah Nofal</a> conceived the idea for an on-demand bakery service that delivers freshly made bread and pastries to customers. Now, the company has evolved into a full-on online grocery store with more than 2,500 SKUs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a call with TechCrunch, CEO Amin said the founders started with bread because it was the “most basic food unit in an Egyptian household</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They called it Breadfast Tomorrow and it was the company’s first model, delivering bread the next morning after customers made their orders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breadfast employed a mix of improved customer experience (from what customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from traditional players) and a native supply chain process to gain entry into the market, said Amin. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He noted that the company was one of the early adopters of operating a native supply chain globally </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">before the arrival of rapid online grocery delivery companies such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/">Gorillas</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/londons-jiffy-scoops-28m-for-speedy-grocery-delivery/">Jiffy</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/">Flink</a>. </span>In 2017 when Breadfast launched, the more prominent companies <span style="font-weight: 400;">either used marketplace or aggregator models: think Instacart and Postmates.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we started pitching to investors in 2017, they thought we were crazy and were like ‘We’re not going to invest in your company because you guys are doing an asset-heavy model. Why not do a marketplace model and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">go and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the bakery shops all over Cairo?” the CEO recounted.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228273" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228273" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228273" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Breadfast-supplies.jpg?w=680" alt="Breadfast" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Breadfast-supplies.jpg 1773w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Breadfast-supplies.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Breadfast-supplies.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Breadfast-supplies.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Breadfast-supplies.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Breadfast-supplies.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Breadfast-supplies.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228273" class="wp-caption-text">Breadfast supplies</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-forward four years and rapid on-demand delivery is one of the hottest startup sectors in the world. It has changed how people consume their daily essentials with companies using micro-fulfilment points and asset-heavy models to make quick deliveries under 10-30 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Breadfast, the journey to reach the point where it could facilitate fast deliveries took some meticulous planning. After providing next-day delivery for bread, the company began to add more products (supermarket items such as coffee, dairy, meat, fruits, vegetables, personal hygiene products and some electronics, turning into an online supermarket).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then upon graduating from Y Combinator’s summer batch in 2019, Breadfast finally built its micro-fulfilment points and switched its delivery time to 60 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Breadfast oversees every part of its supply chain. The company owns some of the products it distributes (like bread and coffee), sources other goods from FMCGs such as Unilever, Pepsi and Coca-Cola while distributing them across its web of dark stores and operates last-mile delivery to customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all it needs in place, Amin said the company is looking to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its delivery time to 20 minutes in a couple of months after the company upgrades its infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re trying to build Gopuff for Africa and the Middle East in a nutshell,” he remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breadfast currently serves 170,000 households in Egypt with more than 2,500 supermarket items</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It claims to have more than a 65% customer retention rate month-on-month; revenue has also grown 4x from 2019 to 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amin said the company is targeting to deliver 6 million orders in Egypt in the next 12 months. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of what will drive that is using the investment to expand across eight cities in Egypt, scale its technology and grow the team</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In a couple of months, the total number of dark stores Breadfast is going to operate will be between 40 and 50 in Egypt,” the chief executive continued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Amin, the more than 1,500-strong company (including riders) is also looking southward on the continent into sub-Saharan Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO said Breadfast might enter one of the region’s markets in the next two months; however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he didn’t mention which country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next year, though, the Egyptian company plans to go all out across Africa and the Middle East and is expecting to close a Series B round to that effect</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In two years, Amin projects that Breadfast will have almost 500 dark stores across both regions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reference to the company’s plan to expand its on-demand grocery delivery across Africa and the Middle East, the investment manager at VNV Global, Björn von Sivers said, “Over the past few years, Breadfast fueled its growth by offering something that’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> scarce in emerging markets; an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exceptionally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> good customer experience and solid operational excellence. We see Breadfast becoming one of the most successful companies to come out of Africa and the Middle East.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Breadfast is the most-funded local company in the sector, both in Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amin knows competition </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what markets such as the U.S. and Europe have will take place on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Already, local newcomers such as Appetito, GoodsMart, Rabbit are pulling their weight despite the presence of more established regional players like InstaShop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Egypt now is one of the hotspots for Africa and the Middle East, so everyone is taking a deep look into the market,” said the CEO. “But we’re very excited about the competition because, at the end of the day, it’s something good for the customers and also keeps all the companies trying to be innovative, competitive, and better every day.”</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company will use the latest funding to support illumigyn’s research and development, which focuses on turning illumigyn into a comprehensive solution for examining the lower genital tract. illumigyn also expands into the United States, United Arab Emirates, India, Singapore, and South Korea, starting this month. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The funding will be deployed to ramp up production and will enable illumigyn to execute distribution agreements and sign additional new global partnerships,” said CEO and Chairman of illumigyn Avi Ludomirski.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup developed a remote gynecological platform, the Gynescope System. The FDA-cleared gynecological platform digitally documents the cervix, vagina, and external genitalia. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The illumigyn Gynescope can be handled by a trained caregiver such as obstetrician-gynecologist, general practice, nurse practitioner, and physician assistant so that women of all individual sensitivities can be assessed in a safe space. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant solution automatically uploads and securely stores images to the cloud. It enables a doctor or specialist to view the images remotely and provides women access to their scans and doctors’ recommendations. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company said its high-quality resolution and magnification enhance details to enable more accurate smear tests than the traditional cervix exams. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“illumigyn is made available to medical professionals to serve women across the world better who do not have access to affordable, documented, and quality gynecological care,” said Ran Poliakine, founder of illumigyn, told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Women can be examined in the comfort of their home by a midwife or a trusted general practitioner at a clinic as long as a specialist can review the exam and make the diagnosis, Poliakine said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">illumigyn’s global target market is the worldwide population of women above the age of 15, Poliakine added. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Whether for religious, cultural, or historical reasons, women find cervical exams to be invasive and anxiety-inducing. Many women do not have access to obstetrician-gynecologists (OB/GYNs) due to their living in rural areas or the OB GYNs shortage,” said Poliakine. In the United States, there is a ratio of 1 OB/GYN for nearly every 3,000 women over 15, Poliakine noted. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We are proud to introduce to the world a cutting-edge innovation that will ensure that women all over the world will feel safe during gynecological exams and will have access to all of their medical information,” Ludomirski said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital healthcare continues to thrive globally following the effects of the pandemic last year, but venture capital inflows differ regionally with Africa lagging behind the rest of the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">owever, investors have paid attention to a few innovative health tech startups, putting over $77 million across 56 deals last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egypt is one of the continent’s bright spots and an integral contributor to health tech market value in MENA, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to <a href="https://www.global.vc/perspectives/healthtech-in-egypt-a-growing-opportunity-for-vc-investments">reach up to $2 billion</a> by 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As companies such as Vezeeta, Chefaa and Yodawy thrive while offering telemedicine, diagnostics and pharmaceutical products, newer companies are looking to make names for themselves in entirely different segments. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227723" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of such is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bypa-ss.com/home">Bypa-ss</a>, a healthtech company dealing with health information exchange</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, the company is announcing that it has raised $1 million in pre-seed funding from investors such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/magic-fund-raises-30m-to-scale-its-global-founders-backing-founders-fund/">Magic Fund</a>, Acuity Ventures, Launch Africa, Plug and Play, and other regional and foreign VCs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by chief executive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/andrew-saad-26480495"> Andrew Saad</a> in 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his days as a medical student, Saad met an older woman who was ill and needed treatment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hospitals would administer drugs after running some tests and referencing the patient’s medical history. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, neither the hospital nor the woman had her medical history at that point. Because of that, they were conflicted on whether to give her </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">medicine or not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saad told TechCrunch that he encountered similar situations with other patients as well. He went on to do some academic research </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">concerning</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> patients’ data and electronic health records, which formed the foundation for starting Bypa-ss.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228266" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228266" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228266" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20A0C878-BB75-40E6-BC63-D8DAF253A7A0.jpeg?w=680" alt="Bypa-ss" width="680" height="445" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20A0C878-BB75-40E6-BC63-D8DAF253A7A0.jpeg 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20A0C878-BB75-40E6-BC63-D8DAF253A7A0.jpeg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20A0C878-BB75-40E6-BC63-D8DAF253A7A0.jpeg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20A0C878-BB75-40E6-BC63-D8DAF253A7A0.jpeg?resize=768,503 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20A0C878-BB75-40E6-BC63-D8DAF253A7A0.jpeg?resize=680,445 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20A0C878-BB75-40E6-BC63-D8DAF253A7A0.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228266" class="wp-caption-text">Andrew Saad (CEO Bypa-ss)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company started in Shebin El Kom, Menofia, before scaling to five other cities across Egypt last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bypa-ss’ flagship product </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is called</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <a href="https://htag.health/en/home">HealthTag</a> and it services an ecosystem of hospitals, physicians and patients</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For hospitals and physicians, HealthTag provides an integrated system for clinic management to track patients’ cases stored by Bypa-ss after collating medical records from different healthcare providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For users, HealthTag works as a mobile application and physical card. With the app and card, patients have ownership of their health records in one place and pay for their medical services online. They can receive prescriptions, labs scans and access a 70% discount from healthcare providers in Egypt when paying out of pocket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are aggregating and giving patients ownership of their health records while giving doctors and healthcare providers visibility on the patient’s full history, allowing people-centric digital health information exchange as first of its kind in Egypt and North Africa,” the company said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pre-seed round equips Bypa-ss with an arsenal to expand its network of more than 3,000 healthcare providers. And also its customer base, which Saad says has increased by 150% since the start of the year. Also, while Bypa-ss started 2021 with six employees, the company has grown fivefold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this pre-seed round of $1 million, Bypa-ss raised $150,000 in an angel round, bringing the company’s total investment to $1.15 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We are beyond excited to invest in Bypa-ss! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are confident that Andrew and his team will build the future of health information infrastructure in Egypt, and we are glad to be part of it,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” Plug and Play said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bypa-ss will use the investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its growth in Egypt, the CEO says. “With this investment coming in, we will be able to avail more features to our customers while maintaining our service level and growth momentum. Additionally, the company intends to use the funds to fuel expansion, perfect a high-end tech mobile app for patients to engulf and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the information exchange between the  stakeholders from different levels and sizes and capitalize on the company’s rapid growth.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appetito wants to tackle the inefficiencies in the FMCG supply chain in Egypt, CEO <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/shehabmokhtar">Shehab Mokhtar</a> told TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227831" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Egypt, home to more than 100 million people, has a retail <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/za/Documents/consumer-business/Deloitte-African-powers-of-retailing-Feb16.pdf">FMCG market size</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of about $50 billion and, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to other African countries, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is highly fragmented</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and inefficient</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When products move from suppliers to distributors to wholesalers to retailers before the end consumer, a lot of value is missing in the supply chain, especially for the consumers and suppliers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re trying to provide customers not only with a convenient experience but also an affordable one by sourcing the products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the manufacturers and selling them </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to them,” Mokhtar said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we can provide a convenient and affordable experience as well solving the inefficiencies in the supply chain of the retail industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appetito’s first line of products when launching in 2017 was groceries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the company now offers non-food items such as personal care items, detergents and stationery products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mokhtar says Appetito sources all its products from top FMCG companies — Procter &amp; Gamble, Hankin, Reckitt, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Kellogg’s — strike deals with them and receives all their goods and products in its warehouses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goods are then shipped to the company’s dark stores, of which there are currently seven in Cairo, Egypt’s capital city</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose there is one takeaway this past year from the rise of rapid on-demand grocery and delivery startups globally, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/gopuff-confirms-new-1b-cash-injection-at-a-15b-valuation-to-expand-its-instant-grocery-delivery-service/">Gopuff</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/">Flink</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/">Gorillas</a> (apart from their fundraising spree), it is how they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prioritize</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> speed and convenience over quality and affordability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appetito doesn’t want to take that direction; instead, it is keen on providing quality and affordable items to its users. In the words of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the CEO, Appetito isn’t trying to become a copycat of those models because Egypt is a different market with a unique set of requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The variation in models can also be seen in their delivery times. While GoPuff and the likes ensure that deliveries </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are completed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in less than 10-20 minutes, Appetito’s deliveries can take up to an hour, the next day or weekly, if scheduled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re trying to mix between affordability and convenience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we’re going to go only for the convenience, which is 10 or 15 minutes, that’s going to be at the expense of affordability,” Mokhtar said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And this is something we do not seek or even try to get scale in Egypt or the countries that we are trying to penetrate going forward</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To drive home how it prioritizes quality, Appetito has some private-label products under its name, a move that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">affords the company some exclusivity in the eyes of customers and delivers higher margins</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Mokhtar sees it, alongside its newly launched meal kits option similar to Blue Apron’s model, as essential verticals for the company in the next couple of years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about how Appetito makes money, Mokhtar says the company gets discounts from suppliers and runs promotions for FMCG companies on its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any company wants to promote their brands; they can promote it through us because we have more than 100,000 downloads on our app on Google Store and Play Store. We have a wide consumer base and this is an opportunity for brands to market themselves on our platform,” the CEO remarked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about revenue, traction and plans, Mokhtar said the company, which has grown its revenue 6x since April, wants to expand its dark stores to 150 in the next three years. In a statement, the general partner at Jedar Capital, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/snessim">Sherif Nessim</a>, said the company’s orders grew 10x in the past year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Quick commerce and fast grocery delivery business model has been gaining grounds </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regionally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and globally and I look forward to Appetito’s next phase as they expand to cover more areas in Egypt and start planning for regional growth,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Appetito expands, it will face competition from companies offering comparable services such as Rabbit, GoodsMart and Breadfast. These startups, representing a fast-growing Egyptian grocery and convenience delivery space,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> collectively lead the way across Africa and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have raised more money than their counterparts in other countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should they keep raising money to accommodate the growing needs of consumers whose</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> habits and shopping patterns have evolved since last year, Egypt will continue to dominate this space in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just the way Nigerian</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> startups have been the most sought after when it comes to fintech across the continent.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the days immediately following revelations that Kenya’s president Uhuru Kenyatta held<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/14/biden-meets-kenyatta-as-pandora-papers-leak-swirls-around-world-leaders"> secret wealth in offshore tax havens</a>, Odanga Madung noticed something odd on Twitter. In spite of the damning information <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/kenya-uhuru-kenyatta-family-offshore-wealth/">implicating Kenyatta in a hypocritical tax shelter scheme</a>, the prevailing conversation on Kenyan Twitter focused on defending the country’s beleaguered leader.</p>
<p>The Kenyan president&#8217;s concealed accounts were just one secret revealed in the <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/">Pandora Papers</a>, a trove of nearly 12 million leaked files detailing the hidden fortunes of a number of global leaders, celebrities and billionaires all hoarding their wealth in places like Panama and the British Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://assets.mofoprod.net/network/documents/Pandora_Disinfo_Report_2__hcc.pdf">new research</a>, <a href="https://www.mozillapulse.org/profile/4178">Madung</a> and supporting researcher <a href="https://www.mozillapulse.org/profile/1427">Brian Obilo</a>, both Mozilla Tech and Society Fellows, reveal how online political propaganda filled the information vacuum in the country in the immediate wake of the Pandora Papers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228067" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“This is a very pervasive problem with Twitter&#8217;s platform here in Kenya,” Madung told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Using Twitter’s Firehose API, the researchers analyzed 8,331 tweets sent between October 3 and October 10 in the following the publication of the Pandora Papers. They discovered two hashtags, #offshoreaccountfacts and #phonyleaks — both seeking to undermine the legitimate revelations held in the leaked financial files — that vaulted into Kenya’s trending topics during the period.</p>
<p>“With the government and the president under pressure, due to soaring online outrage, a counternarrative operation was mounted — and found a strong ally in Twitter,” Madung wrote. “&#8230; As a result, a distorted perspective began to gain momentum — one where Kenyans appeared outraged not by the Pandora Paper’s damning findings, but by their implication that Uhuru Kenyatta is guilty of wrongdoing.”</p>
<p>From their analysis, those trends were far from organic. The researchers unearthed a number of accounts promoting related hashtags in repeated tweets and nothing else. The content specifically sought to exonerate Kenyatta, playing down revelations around his hidden wealth, arguing that the practice did not violate any laws and defending the offshore holdings as a savvy financial move.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By cross-referencing <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-in-kenya-influencers-are-hired-to-spread-disinformation/">previous research</a>, Madung also found that some accounts boosting the inauthentic content were previously identified spreading adjacent pro-government propaganda in Kenya.</p>
<p>“Of key importance here was that many of these narratives were not explicitly lies,” Madung wrote. “This was political astroturfing that used a mix of propaganda and mal-information. It was designed to fabricate consensus — specifically, the consensus that most Kenyans support Uhuru Kenyatta and distrust the Pandora Papers.”</p>
<p>The campaign’s methods weren’t sophisticated, but they were organized and efficient. While the accounts could be easily identified through their repeated imagery, wording and frequent use of celebrity names, their degree of coordination did enable them to break through the noise to reach Twitter’s high visibility collection of trending topics.</p>
<p>While much of the astroturfing campaign relied on bending the truth, its organizers weren&#8217;t afraid to outright fabricate information either. In one example, an image depicts Nairobi-based economist Reginald Kadzutu defending Kenyatta in an interview with the BBC, but the interview never happened — the image is fake.</p>
<p>After Madung alerted the company to the coordinated campaigns, Twitter took action against more than 230 accounts for violating its platform manipulation and spam policies.</p>
<p>“Twitter’s uniquely open nature empowers research such as this,” a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch, noting that the company relies on a blend of AI and human moderators to detect efforts to manipulate conversation on the platform.</p>
<p>According to Madung, Kenya’s information ecosystem suffers from a well-established disinformation industry that continues to game Twitter. &#8220;Disinformation is an industry like any other — it&#8217;s about money, it’s about clear outcomes,” Madung told TechCrunch. “In many ways&#8230; [these campaigns] are very much like any normal agency.”</p>
<p>Within that industry, there’s a well established formula that gets results, amplifying content all the way to Twitter’s trending module. In an interview, one Twitter user the team spoke to explained that he had been paid to push various kinds of content onto Twitter’s trends for the past five years, including talking points from Kenyan political parties.</p>
<p>Through interviews, Madung also learned that some of those campaigns recruited and paid verified users to promote their messaging, lending them an extra boost under Twitter’s trending algorithm.</p>
<p>Anyone looking for the work can find it in WhatsApp groups recruiting for various political campaigns in the country. Those groups serve as command centers for the disinformation efforts, communicating messaging and coordinating timing to make those messages as potent as possible.</p>
<p>“As one of the influencers we spoke to put it, ‘Twitter is easy.’&#8221; Madung wrote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Shares in Kakao Pay, the fintech unit of South Korea’s largest messaging app operator Kakao Corp, closed up 114% in its market debut on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/20/ant-financial-kakao-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Ant Financial-backed company</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> ended day one of trading at $163.3 (193,000 won), securing a market capitalization of $21.2 billion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Pay’s shares surged as high as $194.6 (230,000 won) on the KOSPI, up 155.6% from the issue price of $76.2 (90,000 won), the upper end of its IPO range. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228303" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Pay raised $1.3 billion (1.53 trillion won) at a $9.9 billion valuation, offering 17 million new shares in its initial public offering last week. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The gains for Kakao Bank came amid a crackdown on the country’s tech companies by South Korean regulators and politicians. In September, local lawmakers accused the country’s big tech companies, including Kakao Pay’s parent company Kakao Corp, of monopoly issues. The lawmakers also have expressed concerns regarding the growing power and valuation of tech companies in Korea. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Pay had to delay its listing twice this summer as the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) asked Kakao Pay to cut its share price and valuation. The company lowered about 6% of its targeted IPO to $1.3 billion from $1.63 billion in July. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Pay will use its IPO proceeds to speed up its global expansion, including in Southeast Asia, Europe and China, said CEO Alex Ryu at an online press conference last week. Southeast Asia and Middle East-based companies have been reaching out to the fintech company to seek strategic partnerships, Ryu mentioned. It will invest in AI, cloud, robo-advisors and blockchain-powered fintech companies in South Korea and overseas countries after the listing, Ryu added.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Kakao Pay is fundamentally a financial platform, and we seek to maintain symbiotic relationships of mutual growth with other financial institutions,” said Ryu. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company also plans to expand its offline payment infrastructure, operate a Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) service, set up a digital non-life insurance subsidiary, and launch a mobile trading system (MTS).  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Pay, founded in 2014, claims a total of 36.5 million users, with monthly active users at 20 million. The company&#8217;s total transaction volume recorded $72.4 billion for twelve months as of June, while its revenue increased more than 102% over the past two years during the pandemic. Kakao Pay recorded $6.9 million (8.2 billion won) in EBITDA in the first half of 2021. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Pay said one of its differentiators is creating synergies with its sister companies like Kakao messaging app, Kakao Bank, Kakao Mobility, and Kakao Games. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Mobility and Kako Entertainment are also set to go public in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Corp’s digital lender subsidiary Kakao Bank, which raised $2.3 billion via IPO in August, had a market cap of $23.9 billion (28 trillion won) as of today. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria’s lending startup</span><a href="https://payhippo.ng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Payhippo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised $3 million in a seed round, funding the company plans to use in sourcing the talent needed to optimize its technology as it ramps up effort to extend speedy credit to more small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the West African country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was led by an array of angel investors, including Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, the co-founders of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> African cross-border payments company</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/chipper-cash-gets-2b-valuation-with-150m-extension-round-led-by-ftx/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chipper Cash</span></a>;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Olugbenga Agboola of the San-Francisco based payments firm</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave</span></a>;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bolaji Balogun, the CEO of  investment banking firm Chapel Hill Denham; and Hakeem Belo-Osagie, the founder of Metis Capital Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the largest amount Payhippo has raised to date after receiving $1 million in pre-seed funding earlier this year.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228151" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s co-founder and chief operations officer, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/okotcha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chioma Okotcha</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said they are looking to hire more engineers and data scientists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We capture our data from the loans we issue, and more talent in the team would allow us to optimize our technology to serve our customers better,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payhippo says it disburses short-term loans in less than three hours, a record that remains unmatched by traditional banking institutions in the country, which often require borrowers to meet stringent </span><a href="https://nairametrics.com/2020/09/06/what-nigerian-banks-consider-before-granting-personal-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conditions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like regular account activity and the maintenance of minimum operating balances. A bank loan application also requires a visit to physical branches and extensive paperwork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really focus on keeping this under three hours, and making sure that businesses can get the money they need when they need it. Ours is also a product that works for the SMEs in terms of a flexible repayment structure,” Okotcha said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMEs are the <a href="https://www.pwc.com/ng/en/events/nigeria-sme-survey.html">force behind Nigeria’s economy</a> accounting for 96% of businesses and 84% of employment in the country. However, a lack of access to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> credit continues to hinder their growth and limit their contribution to the country’s GDP,</span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Benneth-Eze/publication/334050044_Bank_Loans_and_Small_Medium_Enterprises'_SMES_Performance_in_Lagos_Nigeria_52_BANK_LOANS_AND_SMALL_MEDIUM_ENTERPRISES'_SMES_PERFORMANCE_IN_LAGOS_NIGERIA/links/5d145ffca6fdcc2462a922f7/Bank-Loans-and-Small-Medium-Enterprises-SMES-Performance-in-Lagos-Nigeria-52-BANK-LOANS-AND-SMALL-MEDIUM-ENTERPRISES-SMES-PERFORMANCE-IN-LAGOS-NIGERIA.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to a study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about bank loans and SMEs in Nigeria, published by the Ilorin Journal of Human Resource Management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is this financing gap that Payhippo was designed to bridge since it was founded in August 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had seen that traditional banks and lenders wouldn&#8217;t loan small businesses mainly because there were no credit scores, or the collateral requirements were too high. We decided to come into the market and create an instant financing option, where we create a credit score that allows small businesses to get the liquidity they need to buy inventory for business continuity,” Okotcha </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">told TechCrunch.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We use data from historical records that borrowers have built with us, but we also check their banking history to see the actual performance of their businesses,” said Okotcha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payhippo applies its own credit scoring formula that uses different SME data to determine the value of loans to give out. The loans are disbursed through mobile phones. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average loan disbursed by Payhippo is about $1,300, with the minimum loan being about $200.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup, which is part of the 2021 Y Combinator summer cohort, was founded by</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/okotcha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Okotcha</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zbijesse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Zach Bijesse,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> chief executive officer, and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nnadi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uche Nnadi,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the chief technical officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payhippo says it is banking on its fast turnaround time for loan applications to grow its customer base within Nigeria before venturing to other countries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it has so far disbursed about 5,000 loans since inception, valued at $1 million and with a repayment rate of 97%, earning them $64,000 in revenues. It added that the demand for credit is high, fueling its current 25% month-on-month growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, the company targets to tap the credit needs of the nearly </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2021/03/08/deepening-access-to-capital-for-nigerian-msmes-during-a-pandemic/#:~:text=Over%2040%20million%20MSMEs%20exist,percent%20of%20the%20country's%20GDP." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40 million SMEs in Nigeria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to grow its business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that just 1% of the Nigerian market is about 40,000 businesses, and we want to be in a position where we disburse 40,000 loans in a day,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payhippo is one among many digital lenders in Nigeria offering short-term loans to SMEs. Others include Carbon and FairMoney. Last year, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/with-over-1-3-million-users-nigerian-based-fintech-fairmoney-wants-to-replicate-growth-in-india/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FairMoney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disbursed a total loan volume of $93 million, representing a 128 percentage point increase from 2019. Carbon also </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nigerian-digital-bank-carbon-hit-240m-in-payments-processed-last-year-up-89-from-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disclosed in an earlier interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it had hit 659,000 customers last year and had disbursed $63 million in loans, an increase of 9.1 percentage points from the 2019 financial year.</span></p>
