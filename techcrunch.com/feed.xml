										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The venture capital scene in the North African tech ecosystem will be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">absolutely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> buzzing right now with the announcement of two large VC funds in the space of two days</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="https://algebraventures.com/">Algebra Ventures</a>, an Egyptian VC firm, announced that it has launched its $90 million second fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years ago, Algebra Ventures closed its first fund of $54 million, and with this announcement, the firm has raised a total of $144 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means Algebra currently has the largest indigenous fund from North Africa and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arguably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the managing partners &#8212; <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/tassaad">Tarek Assaad</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karimhussein">Karim Hussein</a>, the first fund was an Egyptian-focused fund. Still, the firm made some selective investments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a few companies outside the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second fund will be similar &#8212; Egypt first, Egypt focused, but allocating investments in East and West Africa, North Africa and the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assaad and Hussein launched the firm in 2016 as one of Egypt&#8217;s first independent venture capital funds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It wasn&#8217;t easy to start one at the time, and it took the partners two years to close the first fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Raising a venture capital fund in Egypt in 2016, in all honesty, was a pain. There was no venture capital to speak of back then,&#8221; Assaad told TechCrunch. &#8220;The high-flying startups back then were raising between $1 million and $2 million. We decided to take the bull by the horn and raise from very established LPs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These LPs include Cisco, the European Commission, Egyptian-American Enterprise Fund (EAEF), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), International Finance Corporation (IFC) and private family offices</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the first fund, Algebra backed 21 startups in Egypt and MENA, and according to the firm, six of its most established companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are valued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at over $350 million and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generate more than $150 million in annual revenue</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rising African venture investment powers fintech, clean tech bets in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/embed/#?secret=lIum5oZvTX" data-secret="lIum5oZvTX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Algebra says it&#8217;s sector-agnostic but has a focus on fintech, logistics, health tech and agritech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the firm has invested in startups in seed and Series B stages, Algebra </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be an investor in startups looking to raise Series A investments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another appealing proposition from Algebra lies in the fact that it owns an in-house team focused on talent acquisition &#8212; in operations, marketing, finance, engineering, etc., for portfolio companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm&#8217;s ticket size remains unchanged from the first fund and will continue to cut checks ranging from $500,000 to $2 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some aspects </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how the firm handles operations might change according to the partners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the lessons learned in our first fund is that we see that there are more interesting opportunities and great entrepreneurs in the seed stage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And given that we&#8217;re more on the ground in Egypt, sometimes we wait for them to mature to Series A. But going forward, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we might</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need to build relationships with those we find </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exceptional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the seed level and also expand our participation on the Series B level, too,&#8221; Hussein said on how the firm will act going forward</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hussein adds that the company will also be doubling down on its talent acquisition network</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Algebra helps portfolio companies hire C-level executives, and while it plans to continue doing so, the firm might adopt a startup studio model &#8212; pairing some professionals to start a company that eventually gets Algebra&#8217;s backing and support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason behind this stems from the next set of companies Algebra will be looking to invest in. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Hussein, the partners at Algebra have studied successful businesses in other emerging markets for some time and want to identify parallels in North Africa where the firm can invest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In cases where the firm can&#8217;t find those opportunities, we may spur some of those in the network to start building those businesses and capture those opportunities,&#8221; he remarked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Algebra, Hussein has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been involved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with building some successful tech companies in the U.S. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an engineer after bagging both bachelors and doctorate degrees from Carnegie Mellon University and MIT, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he ventured into the world of startup investing and crazy valuations after working for a consulting company in the dot-com era</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He would go on to start Riskclick, a software company known for its commercial insurance applications</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The founders sold the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to Skywire before Oracle acquired the company to become part of its suite of insurance services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After some time at WebMD, Hussein returned to Egypt and began mentoring startups as an angel investor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside other angel investors, he started Cairo Angels, an angel investor network in Egypt, in 2013</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There was a massive gap in the market. We were putting in a bit of small angel money to these businesses but there were no VCs to take them to the next level. So I met up with Tarek and the rest is Algebra,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assaad is also an engineer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He obtained his bachelors in Egypt before switching careers by going to Stanford Graduate School of Business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He continued on that path working for some Bay Area companies before his return to Egypt. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On his return, he became a managing partner at Ideavelopers, a VC firm operating a $50 million fund since 2009</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The firm has had a couple of good success stories, the most notable being fintech startup Fawry. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now a publicly traded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> billion-dollar company, Assaad was responsible for the investment which realized a $100 million exit for Ideavelopers in 2015</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134336" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134336" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2134336" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg?w=680" alt="Algebra Ventures" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg 7360w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tarek-Assad.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134336" class="wp-caption-text">Tarek Assaad (Managing partner, Algebra Ventures)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Algebra, both partners are pioneering local investments in the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of its portfolio companies are the most well-known companies on the continent &#8212; health tech startup Vezeeta; social commerce platform Brimore; logistics startup Trello; ride-hailing and super app Halan; food discovery and ordering platform Elmenus; fintech startup, Khazna; and others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm&#8217;s latest raise and $144 million capital amount is one of the largest funds dedicated to African startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other large Africa-focused funds include the $71 million fund recently closed by another Egyptian firm, Sawari Ventures; Partech&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/partech-is-doubling-the-size-of-its-african-venture-fund-to-143-million/">$143 million fund</a>; Novastar Ventures&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/novastar-ventures-becomes-200m-african-vc-fund-after-108m-raise/">$200 million fund</a>; and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/tlcom-capital-closes-71m-africa-fund-with-plans-to-back-12-startups/">$71 million Tide Africa Fund</a> by TLcom Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These funds have been very pivotal to the growth of the African tech ecosystem </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funding. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, African startups raised almost $1.5 billion from both local and international investors, according to varying reports</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This number was j</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ust</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/23/the-rise-of-silicon-savannah-and-africas-tech-movement/"> half a billion dollars</a> six years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, regardless of the period &#8212; 2015 or 2021 &#8212; African VC investments have always been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dominated by foreign investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But VC firms like Algebra Ventures are showing that local investors can raise nine-figure funds, thereby providing more startups with more funds and paving the way for indigenous and local VCs to at least increase their participation to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> equal levels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two-year-old CRED has become the youngest Indian startup to be valued at $2 billion or higher.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based <a href="https://www.cred.club/">CRED</a> said on Tuesday it has raised $215 million in a new funding round &#8212; a Series D &#8212; that valued the Indian startup at $2.2 billion (post-money), up from about $800 million valuation in $81 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/india-cred-raises-81m-buys-back-1-2m-shares-from-employees/">Series C round in January this year</a>.</p>
<p>New investor Falcon Edge Capital and existing investor Coatue Management led the new round. Insight Partners and existing investors DST Global, RTP Global, Tiger Global, Greenoaks Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group, and Sofina also participated in the new round, which brings CRED&#8217;s total to-date raise to about $443 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/india-cred-in-talks-to-raise-200-million-at-2-billion-valuation/">reported</a> last month that CRED was in advanced stages of talks to raise about $200 million at a valuation of around $2 billion.</p>
<p>CRED operates an app that rewards customers for paying their credit card bills on time and gives them access to a range of additional services such as credit and a premium catalog of products from high-end brands.</p>
<p>An individual needs to have a credit score of at least 750 to be able to sign up for CRED. By keeping such a high bar, the startup says it is ensuring that people are incentivized to improve their financial behavior. (More on this later.)</p>
<p>CRED today serves more than 6 million customers, or about 22% of all credit card holders &#8212; and 35% of all premium credit card holders &#8212; in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Kunal Shah, founder and chief executive of CRED, told TechCrunch in an interview that the startup intends to become the platform for affluent customers in India and also not limit its offerings to financial services.</p>
<p>He said the startup’s e-commerce service, for instance, has been growing fast. He attributed the early success to customers enjoying the curation of items on CRED and merchants finding the platform appealing as ticket size of each transaction on CRED is higher.</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh funds to scale several of its revenue channels and engage in more experimentations, he said.</p>
<p>When asked whether CRED would like to serve all credit card users in India some day, Shah said the selection criteria limits the startup from doing so, but he said he was optimistic that more users will improve their scores in the future.</p>
<p>The startup, unlike most others in India, doesn’t focus on the usual TAM (addressable market) — hundreds of millions of users of the world’s second-most populated nation — and instead caters to some of the most premium audiences.</p>

<p>“India has 57 million credit cards (vs 830 million debit cards) [that] largely serves the high-end market. The credit card industry is largely concentrated with the top 4 banks (HDFC, SBI, ICICI and Axis) controlling about 70% of the total market. This space is extremely profitable for these banks – as evident from the SBI Cards IPO,” analysts at Bank of America wrote in a recent report to clients.</p>
<p>“Very few starts-ups like CRED are focusing on this high-end base and [have] taken a platform-based approach (acquire customers now and look for monetization later). Credit card in India remains an aspirational product. The under penetration would likely ensure continued strong growth in coming years. Overtime, the form-factor may evolve (i.e. move from plastic card to virtual card), but the inherent demand for credit is expected to grow,” they added.</p>
<p>CRED has become one of the most talked about startups in India, in part because of the pace at which it has raised money of late, its growing valuation, and the fact that it only caters to select customers.</p>
<p>Some users have also said that CRED no longer offers them the perks it used a year ago.</p>
<p>Shah said CRED is addressing those concerns. A recent feature, which allows customers to use CRED points at over a thousand merchants, for instance, has made the reward more appealing, he said, adding that the startup is slowly incorporating that into its own e-commerce store as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;What will soon happen is that customers will realize that these points are asset and not a liability. They will start to see benefits of the points in more places,&#8221; he said, adding that the pandemic derailed some of the things CRED had planned for in the real world.</p>
<p>The startup, which bought back shares worth $1.2 million from employees in January this year, told them in an email today that it will soon be buying back stocks worth $5 million. &#8220;As the funding helps CRED invest in its future, hopefully the buyback will help some of you do that too,&#8221; the email said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Used-goods marketplaces, an online staple since the beginning of the internet as we know it, have really come into their own during the Covid-19 pandemic: they&#8217;ve been a place for people clearing out their domestic spaces to list items that they have that are still in good shape, making some money in the process; and for buyers, they are a resource for finding items at a time when shopping in person and spending money in uncertain economic times have both fallen out of favor. Today, <a href="https://www.mpb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MPB</a> &#8212; a popular marketplace that specializes in used cameras and photographic equipment &#8212; is announcing significant funding to double down on the opportunity after seeing its platform &#8220;recirculate&#8221; some 300,000 items of kit globally each year and pass £100 million ($139 million) in revenues this year.</p>
<p>The Brighton, England-based startup has snapped up £49.8 million (about $69 million at current exchange rates). It plans to use the money both to expand into more markets &#8212; it currently has offices in Brooklyn and Berlin &#8212; and into more product areas, specifically, extending the marketplace concept to serve content creators.</p>
<p>The Series D is being led by Vitruvian Partners, with significant participation from Acton Capital, and Mobeus Equity Partners, Beringea and FJ Labs also participating. Vitruvian is a new backer for MPB; the rest were already invested in the startup, which has raised around $91 million since 2011.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MPB did not disclose its valuation in a statement on the fundraise; we have contacted the company to ask and will update if / when we learn more.</p>
<p>For some context, this is the biggest-ever round raised by a startup out of Brighton. Home to one university and right next to another, Brighton has had some tech world focus &#8212; Brandwatch made a splash in February when it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/brandwatch-is-acquired-by-cision-for-450m-creating-a-pr-marketing-and-social-listening-giant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Cision for $450 million</a>; and it is well known for gaming companies and talent &#8212; but has largely been off the fundraising radar, perhaps in part because it is so close to London and its own gravitational pull for entrepreneurs and VCs. <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/133204-42/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> put MPB&#8217;s valuation at $50.86 million in 2019; it&#8217;s likely to be significantly higher than this now.</p>
<p>“This funding round is a major milestone for MPB, culminating a decade of strong performance and a vision to make great kit accessible and affordable,&#8221; said Matt Barker, MPB&#8217;s founder and CEO, in a statement. &#8220;With the backing of Vitruvian Partners and those reinvesting in our business, we can accelerate our US and European growth strategy at scale, profitably. Photography and videography are intrinsic to societies and cultures all over the world, and at MPB we have created a circular model that offers everyone the chance to be visual storytellers and content creators in a way that’s good for the planet.”</p>
<p>Indeed, what&#8217;s interesting about MPB is how it touches on and addresses a number of themes that have been playing out across the world of e-commerce and wider digital society, and what&#8217;s probably made it successful has been its appeal to people on one or more of those fronts at the same time.</p>
<p>First, there is the platform it gives to people to sell and buy used camera equipment. The sale of used items gives owners an opportunity to make money off items they no longer need, and buyers a way to procure items at lower costs. And it has an obvious environmental angle to it, since circular economy operators encourage people to get more life out of electronics that might otherwise simply become part of landfill (or encourage more manufacturing of new goods in their place).</p>
<p>But on a more practical level, used-good sales also have often put people off in part because they are deprived of some of the guarantees that you would normally get on goods when buying from more established retailers.</p>
<p>MPB provides buying and seller security in its own way: by employing a team of people to vet and prepare items for sale, and providing a six-month guarantee on items sold over its platform. That has paid off for it even pre-pandemic: the company said that its compound growth rate over the last five years has been 53%.</p>
<p>(And more generally, used goods marketplaces are seeing some big attention from VCs at the moment in Europe: in February, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/spains-wallapop-raises-191m-at-an-840m-valuation-for-its-classifieds-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wallapop in Spain raised $191 million</a> for its more generalised used-goods marketplace, and in March <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/vestiaire-collective-raises-216-million-for-its-second-hand-fashion-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vestaire Collective raised $216 million</a>.)</p>
<p>Second, it touches on the bigger trend we&#8217;ve seen around the growth of communities focused on specific rather than general interests. It&#8217;s a clear way of conferring more authenticity, focus and signal in an otherwise very noisy world online, and in a specialized area like the sale of photography equipment, this can be especially critical and a unique selling point over more generic sales platforms like eBay: it means more attention paid by the platform to stock, as well as a more focused community of buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>Third, there is the focus of MPB in particular. We have most definitely seen the birth of a &#8220;creator economy&#8221; online, where people are making livings out of their own brands (ugh), or from their specific creative output, bypassing some of the more traditional middle-men in favor of newer ones (eg, network broadcasters no longer the sole gatekeepers for serialized video content and all of the work that goes into making it; YouTube conversely now makes a killing off it, and if Substack, Patreon and others like it play their cards right, they will soon, in their own areas of interest, too.)</p>
<p>What this might mean for companies like MPB is a surge of interest and attention on equipment for capturing those images, although it will be interesting to see how and if that can be leveraged on a wider scale, given how so much of that creation today is happening on smartphones, which themselves continue to get more sophisticated and eat into not just casual photographers&#8217; buying patterns, but more serious ones, too.</p>
<p>In the question of scaling, MPB will have an interesting partner in the form of Vitruvian Partners, which backs second-hand clothes marketplace Vestiaire Collective &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/vestiaire-collective-raises-216-million-for-its-second-hand-fashion-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $216 million last month</a>, another sign of the times and how they have boosted the opportunities for used-good sales &#8212; alongside other marketplaces like Carwow, Just Eat, Farfetch, Skyscanner and Trustpilot.</p>
<p>“MPB has developed a unique tech-enabled platform to meet a market need, transforming access to photography kit to become a global leader in its field, whilst building a product that genuinely has a positive impact on the world,&#8221; said Tom Studd, partner at Vitruvian Partners, said in a statement. &#8220;Matt and the team have achieved strong and profitable growth through recent launches in the US and Germany, and we’re delighted to partner with them for the next step of the journey. Vitruvian looks to back exceptional teams with unique products in large markets, and we believe Matt and the team fit those criteria perfectly.”</p>
<p>Sebastian Wossagk, managing partner at Acton Capital, added: “It’s always a privilege to watch companies like MPB grow and excel in their field. Matt and his team have already taken the first steps into internationalisation by opening locations in Brooklyn and Berlin, and we’re excited to support them as they pursue further expansion in both the US and Europe.”</p>
<p>Something notable about MPB is that Barker <a href="https://spectrumphoto.co.uk/5-questions-mpb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once said</a> that he founded it in part because he didn&#8217;t feel that the requirements of people in the photography community were being addressed well enough by more general sites like eBay or Gumtree. That may still be the case for those two sites (and countless other generic sales platforms), but it doesn&#8217;t mean that there are not a number of other players addressing the used-photography equipment market. They include the likes of <a href="https://www.worldwidecameraexchange.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldwide Camera Exchange</a>, <a href="https://www.parkcameras.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Park Cameras</a>, <a href="https://www.cameraworld.co.uk/used" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Camera World</a>, and many others with equally SEO-friendly names. That represents opportunities for consolidation, competitive threat, and hopefully innovation for better services, but also a sign that there is more to this market than might meet the eye.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://bobw.co">Bob W</a>, the self-described &#8220;tech-driven&#8221; hospitality provider that offers an alternative to traditional hotels and short-stay rentals, is disclosing €10 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round, which included a first tranche of €4 million last year, is byFounders VC and private equity firm Finnish Industry Investment (Tesi). Other European real estate and venture capitalist investors participating include Kaamos, Superangel, United Angels and NREP (via its anchor investment into the 2150 venture capital fund, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/2150-launches-with-281m-fund-to-reduce-the-carbon-footprint-of-the-worlds-growing-cities/">promises to back</a> sustainable urban technologies).</p>
<p>Founded in 2018 by Niko Karstikko and Sebastian Emberger, Bob W &#8212; which is a play on the phrase &#8220;best of both worlds&#8221; &#8212; is described as offering tech-powered short-stay apartments that combine hotel-like quality with the authenticity of individual rentals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its &#8220;full-stack&#8221; model sees it source and manage properties and provide an accompanying app for guests, with support for chat-based customer service and contactless online check-in. It also claims to have made the majority of its operations autonomous. &#8220;[This] not only minimises human error but also allows the company to craft the entire guest experience, from booking to check-out, at scale,&#8221; says the company.</p>
<p>Launched in a number of Nordics markets, and on the verge of opening properties in London, the startup seems to be weathering the pandemic, reaching occupancy rates as high as 90% at its existing properties in Estonia and Finland. Revenue is also said to have grown by 80% in 2020, with the company putting a lot of marketing toward claims behind being more hygienic than many hotels.</p>

<p>&#8220;A new generation of travellers have developed a refined taste when it comes to accommodation; they’re mixing business with pleasure and often staying for longer,&#8221; says Niko Karstikko co-founder and CEO of Bob W. &#8220;They want the reliable quality of a hotel and the authenticity and convenience of a private apartment. The problem is that many hotels feel generic and lack key amenities like kitchens, while booking a private rental feels like playing roulette&#8221;.</p>
<p>Despite this contradiction, Karstikko says the short-stay rental market has continued to grow over the past decade with millions of properties available, &#8220;demonstrating the demand for home-like settings where guests can live like a local&#8221;. And it&#8217;s this demand that was the inspiration behind Bob W.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134197" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134197" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2134197" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="408" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg?resize=1536,922 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg?resize=2048,1229 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Helsinki_CityCentre_2.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134197" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bob W</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Bob W guarantees the best short-stay apartment experience, which includes the amenities and local authenticity of a home combined with responsive host communication available 24/7, the best professional cleaning program in the industry, curated local service partners (gym, breakfast, etc.), dedicated business services and more&#8221;.</p>
<p>This means that guests can rely on &#8220;hotel-like consistency&#8221; across all of Bob W&#8217;s locations, without paying hotel prices and with &#8220;the flexibility to stay days, weeks or months&#8221;.</p>
<p>Karstikko says a typical Bob W guest is someone who &#8220;travels less but stays longer&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;They often mix business and pleasure and come for leisure, work, digital nomad-ery or just to get away and get a taste of living like a local,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;To do that, they seek out authentic places to stay which also have the amenities and consistent quality they expect, like a fully equipped kitchen and some elbow room. What they want is a home away from home&#8221;.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, direct competitors include the likes of Sonder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/cosi-raises-e20m/">Cosi Group</a>, Lime Home and, more broadly, the hotel and short-stay segments. To that end, Karstikko argues that Bob W is the &#8220;most local, authentic experience&#8221; on the market and offers the most consistent, yet customized experience. It also pitches itself on being more sustainable.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have put sustainability at the core of everything we do,&#8221; adds the Bob W CEO, &#8220;from powering our apartments with 100% renewable energy to recycling, minimising single-use plastic, sourcing furniture responsibly and [other] green initiatives throughout the business. We will also have massive news soon about how we’re taking sustainability to the next level, as all of us need to do more to combat the climate crisis&#8221;.</p>

<p>Led by Accel and HV Capital, the seed funding will be used by the company to scale and meet existing demand for its conversational commerce platform.</p>
<p>Launched in 2020 by Artjem Weissbeck and Andreas Tussing after the pair had run a year-long experiment running a store in WhatsApp, Charles enables businesses to sell products and services via WhatsApp and other chat apps in order to &#8220;increase conversion rate, customer loyalty and ultimately revenue&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The SaaS connects chat app APIs, such as WhatsApp and Messenger, with shop and CRM systems, like Shopify, SAP and HubSpot, all delivered through a user-friendly interface. The idea is to make it easier for businesses to meet their customers on the channels they already use and to bridge the gap between sales enquiries and support, and actual conversions.</p>

<p>&#8221; &#8216;Traffic&#8217; and with it &#8216;conversion&#8217; will exponentially move from the streets (retail) and the browser/native apps into chat apps,&#8221; says Weissbeck. &#8220;Thereby, conversational commerce will be the third big pillar of commerce, gluing together all channels and unlocking the full potential of personalization via the unique identification of customers via their phone number&#8221;.</p>
<p>This transition, argues the Charles founder, creates &#8220;tremendous challenges and opportunities&#8221; for companies in terms of customer journey design and the tech stack, which to date &#8212; Asia, aside &#8212; has been predominantly tailored around webshops and e-mail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately our technology provides the operating system for companies to master this challenge,&#8221; adds Tussing. &#8220;The core of our software integrates chat apps with shop/CRM backends in an intuitive interface that puts the human chat sales agent in the center, supported by chatbots and AI&#8221;.</p>
<p>Luca Bocchio, partner at Accel, says that conversational commerce is emerging as a &#8220;critical channel for brands,” and is a trend that will reshape the way brands interact with customers. [This is] paving the way for potential new category-defining tools to emerge,&#8221; he says, noting that Charles has the potential to be one of those tools.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we talk to potential clients it&#8217;s mostly existing customer service tools like Zendesk who are starting to add chat apps as an additional channel,&#8221; says Weissbeck, when asked to cite direct competitors. &#8220;These tools are usually built upon a &#8216;ticketing&#8217; logic, optimized to solve customer inquiries as quickly as possible and with a clear focus on service cases, not sales&#8221;.</p>
<p>In contrast, Weissbeck says Charles is built upon a &#8220;feed&#8221; logic, showing customer interaction as an ongoing conversation and end-to-end relationship &#8212; in the same way as the customer sees it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Further we deeply integrate into shop/CRM-backends to make it easy for agents to sell product and create carts or contracts &#8212; all in a very design-driven and intuitive interface, that is fun to use for the agent and puts her/him in the center,&#8221; says Tussing. &#8220;Supported by chatbots, not replaced&#8221;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the revenue model is simple enough: Businesses pay a monthly base fee to cover Charles&#8217; fixed costs and on top of this the startup earns money on conversions. &#8220;We take a small share of the net sales, ensuring we are co-incentivised,&#8221; explains Weissbeck.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egyptian-based VC firm <a href="https://sawariventures.com/">Sawari Ventures</a> has closed its $71 million fund for North Africa&#8217;s rapidly growing startup ecosystem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm first <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/sawari-ventures-35-million-fund/">announced its fund</a> in 2018, when it closed an initial $35 million (which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increased to $41 million) in hopes to close at $70 million, per Menabytes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investors in the first tranche included CDC (which <a href="https://www.cdcgroup.com/en/our-impact/fund/sawari-ventures-fund-i/">forked over $12 million</a>), European Investment Bank, Proparco and the Dutch Good Growth Fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having closed an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $30 million, Sawari Ventures&#8217; total raise is $1 million more than</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its original target</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it has added a range of new backers that includes Banque Misr, Banque du Caire, Ekuity, Misr Insurance Group, National Bank of Egypt and Suez Canal Bank</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-el-alfi-622a204b">Ahmed El Alfi</a>, <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/hany-al-sonbaty-12274322">Hany Al-Sonbaty</a> and <a href="https://www.itworx.com/company/board/wael-amin-board-director/">Wael Amin</a> launched Sawari Ventures in 2010. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before venturing into the world of venture capital, El Alfi and Al-Sonbaty were investment professionals in the Egyptian tech space for more than two decades</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amin, meanwhile, was a founder of a tech company called ITWorx that made notable acquisitions in the Egyptian tech ecosystem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Egypt, Sawari Ventures focuses on Morocco and Tunisia. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the firm, these three countries represent one of the best investment opportunities around given the mismatch between the capital available (amounts and variation at every stage) and the market opportunity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also share common traits such as language, culture, business, governance norms and market dynamics, making it easier for cross-border cooperation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching the firm over 10 years ago, Sawari claims to have invested in more than 30 companies, mostly in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these companies include ride-hailing service SWVL, software startup Instabug, and AI chat-based personal assistant Elves, but its</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sweet spots are the hardware, education, healthcare, cleantech and fintech sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We try to cast a wide net given that, in essence, this is a transformative moment in emerging markets tech with the rapid digitization of the underlying economy,&#8221; a company spokesperson told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So as expected, we’re seeing a great deal flow in the digitization of financial services, health care and education technologies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, given the engineering talent, there are unique opportunities in SaaS products, semiconductors and IoT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sawari Ventures invests in growth-stage companies, in particular. But it also</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> operates <a href="https://flat6labs.com/">Flat6Labs</a>, a seed VC firm akin to an accelerator that has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to perform its seed investments since establishing both Cairo and Tunis offices in 2011 and 2016</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sawari says 10% of the now-closed investments will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be earmarked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for seed-stage companies as investments through Flat6Labs Cairo and Tunis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flat6Labs Cairo will seed between 80 to 100 companies and offer follow-on investments to between 30 and 40</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Flat6Labs Tunisia will seed 60 to 70 companies and offer follow-on investments for 30 to 40. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining 90% will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to invest in 20 to 25 growth-stage companies across Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco, with a median investment range of $2 million to $3 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment range is a continuation of how Sawari </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cut checks for <a href="https://sawariventures.com/portfolio/">portfolio startups</a> since closing the first tranche three years ago</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm said it has invested between $1 million and $4 million in</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Elves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brantu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ExpandCart</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Almentor, SWVL and MoneyFellows, among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Egypt-based fund is a privately held fund regulated by the Financial Regulatory Authority of Egypt (FRA), which allowed us to attract capital from top-tier local financial institutions to co-invest with foreign capital from international development financial institutions, doubling our allocation to invest in Egyptian high-growth companies to $68 million,” El Alfi said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our aim is to create exceptional returns through investing in knowledge-driven companies, which have the potential of bringing transformational changes to the Egyptian economy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund will support local companies with dedicated capital, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to quality expertise from our seasoned and specialized team, and the value-add of our investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

<p>Founded in 2018, InfuseAI says the market for MLOps solutions is worth $30 million a year in Taiwan, with the global market expected to reach about $4 billion by 2025, <a href="https://www.cognilytica.com/2020/04/02/infographic-the-rapid-growth-of-mlops/">according to research firm Cognilytica</a>. Its clients include E.SUN, one of Taiwan’s largest banks, SinoPac Holdings and Chimei.</p>

<p>InfuseAI helps companies deploy and manage machine learning models with turnkey solutions like PrimeHub, a platform that includes a model training environment, cloud or on-premise cluster computing (including container orchestration with Kubernetes) and collaboration tools for teams. Another product, called PrimeHub Deploy, lets clients train, deploy, update and monitor AI models.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Hive Ventures founder and managing partner Yan Lee said, &#8220;As enterprises from manufacturing, healthcare, finance and other sectors seek to scale their AI operations and model deployments, they will require a platform like InfuseAI to allow seamless collaboration between developers and data scientists. InfuseAI fits perfectly into our investment thesis which is focused on platforms and software in the enterprise adoption cycle.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://glints.com/">Glints</a>, the Singapore-based career platform, announced today it has raised $22.5 million in Series C funding led by Japanese human resources management firm PERSOL Holdings. The new capital will be used on Glints’ expansion in Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam and Taiwan and hiring for its product and engineering teams.</p>
<p>Glints co-founder and chief executive officer Oswald Yeo said this is the largest funding round to date for a talent platform in Southeast Asia, and brings the startup’s total raised to $33 million. Other participants included returning investors Monk’s Hill Ventures, Fresco Capital, Mindworks Ventures, Wavemaker Partners, Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal and former Goldman Sachs TMT China head and partner Xiaoyin Zhang.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Glints says it has been used by more than 1.5 million professionals and 30,000 organizations, including Gojek, Tokopedia, Starbucks and Mediacorp. Most of its current users are from the tech and financial services sectors, but Glints has a &#8220;broad horizontal focus on young to mid-level professionals,&#8221; and its long-term goal is to be sector agnostic, Yeo told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>One of the ways Glints differentiates from other job platforms active in its markets, like LinkedIn, JobStreet and CakeResume, is by building a &#8220;full-stack&#8221; of services for people who want to advance their careers. In addition to its job marketplace, which the company says has more than 7,000 active listings and 4 million visitors each month, Glints also offers community features and skills education, like online classes.</p>
<p>One of Glints’ value propositions is helping companies, especially in tech, cope with the regional talent shortage, a topic it recently covered in <a href="https://www.monkshill.com/content-hub/the-southeast-asia-tech-talent-report-mhv">a comprehensive report</a> with Monk’s Hill Ventures.</p>
<p>One of the solutions the report highlighted is hiring teams based in different Southeast Asian countries to address talent crunches in specific markets, like Singapore. Glints says its cross-border remote work hub, TalentHub, doubled its business in 2020 as the pandemic also made employers more open to hiring remotely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">KKR has just closed $15 billion for its Asia-focused private equity fund, exceeding its original target size after receiving &#8220;strong support&#8221; from new and existing global investors, including those in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>The new close came nearly four years after KKR raised its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170601006750/en/KKR-Closes-US9.3-Billion-Asian-Fund-III">Asian Fund III of $9.3 billion</a> and marks the New York-based alternative asset management titan&#8217;s ongoing interest in Asia. It also makes KKR Asian Fund IV one of the largest private equity funds dedicated to the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>KKR itself will inject about $1.3 billion into Fund IV alongside investors through the firm and its employees&#8217; commitments. The new fund will be on the lookout for opportunities in consumption and urbanization trends, as well as corporate carve-outs, spin-offs, and consolidation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>KKR has been a prolific investor in Asia-Pacific since it entered the region 16 years ago with a multifaceted approach that spans private equity, infrastructure, real estate and credit. It currently has $30 billion in assets under management in the region.</p>
<p>The firm has been active during COVID-19 as well. On the one hand, the pandemic has accelerated the transition to online activities and singled out tech firms that proved resilient during the health crisis. Market disruption in the last year has also made valuations more attractive and pressured companies to seek new sources of capital. All in all, these forces provide &#8220;increasingly interesting opportunities for flexible capital providers like KKR,&#8221; the firm&#8217;s spokesperson Anita Davis told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Since the pandemic, KKR has deployed about $7 billion across multiple strategies in Asia.</p>
<p>While KKR looks for deals across Asia, each market provides different opportunities pertaining to the state of its economy. For deals in consumption upgrades, KKR seeks out companies in emerging markets like China, Southeast Asia and India, said Davis. In developed countries like Japan, Korea and Australia, KKR observed that continued governance reform, along with a focus on return on equity (ROE), has driven carve-outs from conglomerates and spin-offs from multinational corporations, Davis added.</p>
<p>Specifically, KKR&#8217;s private equity portfolio in Asia consists of about 60 companies across 11 countries. Some of its more notable deals include co-leading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/chinas-bytedance-leapfrogs-uber-to-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-startup/">ByteDance&#8217;s $3 billion raise in 2018</a> amid the TikTok parent&#8217;s rapid growth and bankrolling Reliance Jio <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/kkr-invests-1-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">with $1.5 billion</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;The opportunity for private equity investment across Asia-Pacific is phenomenal,&#8221; said Hiro Hirano, co-head of Asia Pacific Private Equity at KKR. &#8220;While each market is unique, the long-term fundamentals underpinning the region’s growth are consistent &#8212; the demand for consumption upgrades, a fast-growing middle class, rising urbanization, and technological disruption.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Asian Fund IV followed in the footsteps of KKR&#8217;s two other Asia-focused funds that closed in January, the <a href="https://media.kkr.com/news-details/?news_id=223def4b-2e42-4bea-ba85-c2cda7cbd79a">$3.9 billion Asia Pacific Infrastructure Investors Fund</a> and the<a href="https://media.kkr.com/news-details/?news_id=093ad462-7de2-4c5e-88e0-5d1f73f8aabc"> $1.7 billion Asia Real Estate Partners Fund</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hipmunk&#8217;s founders are building a successor to their now-defunct flight search service.</p>
<p>The startup was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/13/concur-buys-hipmunk-to-add-search-to-its-travel-and-expense-management-platform/">acquired by SAP-owned travel and expense platform Concur</a> in 2016, and its CEO Adam Goldstein departed in 2018. But Goldstein told me he and his co-founder Steve Huffman (also co-founder and CEO of Reddit) were still disappointed when Concur <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/four-years-after-being-acquired-hipmunk-is-shutting-down/">shut the service down</a> at the beginning of last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the years, there were millions and millions of people who used it and loved it,&#8221; Goldstein said. (I was one of those people — even before I knew what he was working on, I started out our call by telling Goldstein how much I miss Hipmunk.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So the pair seed funded a project called <a href="https://flightpenguin.com">Flight Penguin</a>, with Goldstein serving as the new company&#8217;s chairman. And he said the actual product was built by former Hipmunk developer Sheri Zada.</p>
<p>The Flight Penguin interface will be very familiar to old Hipmunk users, with a visual layout that makes it easy to see the timing of flights and length of layovers. And just as Hipmunk allowed users to organize results by &#8220;agony&#8221; (so that the top results aren&#8217;t just cheap flights with inconvenient timing or ridiculous layovers), Flight Penguin allows them to sort their flights by &#8220;pain.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134294" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134294" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2134294" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/33t687fbfzy4vdol.jpg?w=680" alt="Flight Penguin screenshot" width="680" height="295" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/33t687fbfzy4vdol.jpg 1166w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/33t687fbfzy4vdol.jpg?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/33t687fbfzy4vdol.jpg?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/33t687fbfzy4vdol.jpg?resize=768,333 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/33t687fbfzy4vdol.jpg?resize=680,295 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/33t687fbfzy4vdol.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134294" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flight Penguin</p></div></p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t just the old experience with a fresh coat of paint — it&#8217;s also meant to improve on Hipmunk in a few key ways. For one thing, it allows users to search by Chase Ultimate Rewards Points (as well as U.S. dollars, with the goal of adding more currencies and rewards programs in the future).</p>
<p>And the product itself is a Google Chrome extension, rather than a traditional flight search website. The extension actually presents a full, standalone web experience (rather than an overlay on another website), but Goldstein said this approach is still important, because it allows Flight Penguin to pull its data &#8220;through the frontend instead of the backend,&#8221; giving it the most up-to-date information. This helps to avoid situations where a flight or price shows up in search results but isn&#8217;t available on the airline&#8217;s or other seller&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>In addition, Goldstein said Flight Penguin will show &#8220;all the flights.&#8221; In other words, it won&#8217;t be making any deals with the airlines to hide certain flights or prices, and it will also show airlines that don&#8217;t normally make their flights available on other search platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are actually many, many flights available but consumers don&#8217;t see them because travel search sites work out these deals,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re choosing not to play that game.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Luxury air travel startup Aero raises $20M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/aero-series-a/embed/#?secret=udp1okaSPj" data-secret="udp1okaSPj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That has the obvious benefit of offering more comprehensive results, but also the disadvantage that Flight Penguin will not be able to collect affiliate fees for flight purchases. Instead, after a 30-day trial period, it will charge users $10 per month. (This is an introductory fee and will likely change in the future.)</p>
<p>Goldstein acknowledged that this is probably &#8220;not going to be a mainstream product that 50 million Americans use,&#8221; but he&#8217;s hoping that it can attract a significant subscriber base of frequent travelers who &#8220;value their time and care about the flight booking experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we learned from Hipmunk was [&#8230;] the way business has traditionally been done in online travel worked for consumers in an era with lots of competition between airlines and travel agencies,&#8221; he added. &#8220;In a world where there&#8217;s much less competition, you&#8217;re basically becoming an agent for the people you&#8217;re working with, and it&#8217;s hard to build a business model around providing a great user experience. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re saying that we&#8217;re going to opt out of this game and play by our own rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flight Penguin is currently accepting signups for its waitlist, but Goldstein said the company is simply using this to bring users on-board in a controlled fashion, and that it plans to move people off the wait list pretty quickly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse, a one-year-old social audio app <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/clubhouse-gets-investment-interest-at-1-billion-valuation?utm_source=ti_app">reportedly valued at $1 billion</a>, will now allow users to send money to their favorite creators &#8212; or speakers &#8212; on the platform. <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/introducing-payments">In a blog post, </a>the startup announced the new monetization feature, Clubhouse Payments, as the “the first of many features that allow creators to get paid directly on Clubhouse.”</p>
<p>Clubhouse declined to comment. Paul Davison, the co-founder of Clubhouse, mentioned in the company’s latest town hall that the startup wants to focus on direct monetization on creators, instead of advertisements.</p>
<p>Here’s how it will work: A user can send a payment in Clubhouse by going to the profile of the creator to whom they want to give money. If the creator has the feature enabled, the user will be able to tap “Send Money” and enter an amount. It’s like a virtual tip jar, or a Clubhouse-branded version of Venmo (although the payments feature doesn&#8217;t currently let the user send a personalized message along with the money).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“100% of the payment will go to the creator. The person sending the money will also be charged a small card processing fee, which will go directly to our payment processing partner, Stripe,” the post reads. “Clubhouse will take nothing.”</p>
<p>Stripe CEO Patrick Collison tweeted shortly after the blog post went up that “It&#8217;s cool to see a new social platform focus first on <em>participant</em> income rather than internalized monetization / advertising.”</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>When the startup raised a Series B led by Andreessen Horowitz in January, part of the reported $100 million funding was said to go to a creator grant program. The program would be used to “support emerging Clubhouse creators,” <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/welcoming-more-voices">according to a blog post.</a> It’s unclear how they define emerging, but cultivating influencers (and rewarding them with money) is one way the startup is promoting high-quality content on its platform.</p>
<p>The synergies here are obvious. A Clubhouse creator can now get tips for a great show, or raise money for a great cause, while also being rewarded by the platform itself for being a recurring host.</p>

<p>The fact that Clubhouse’s first attempt at monetization includes no percentage cut of its own is certainly noteworthy. Monetization, or Clubhouse’s lack thereof, has been a topic of discussion about the buzzy startup since it took off in the early pandemic months. While it currently relies on venture capital to keep the wheels churning, it will need to make money eventually in order to be a self-sustaining business.</p>
<p>Creator monetization, with a cut for the platform, has led to the growth of large businesses. Cameo, a startup that sends personalized messages from creators and celebrities, takes about a 25% cut of each video sold on its platform. The startup reached unicorn status last week with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/celebrity-video-request-site-cameo-reaches-unicorn-status-with-100m-raise/">$100 million raise. </a>OnlyFans, another platform that helps creators directly raise money from fans in exchange for paywalled contact, is <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/04/02/essex-born-onlyfans-founder-built-porn-empire-has-become-one/">projecting $1 billion in revenue for 2021. </a></p>
<p>Clubhouse’s payments feature will first be tested by a “small test group” starting today, but it is unclear who is in this group. Eventually, the payments feature will be rolled out to other users in waves.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: The Supreme Court sides with Google in Oracle suit</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court announced a couple of tech-related rulings today. In one, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-google-oracle-ruling/">overturned Oracle&#8217;s victory in its copyright battle with Google</a>, which would have otherwise required Google to pay Oracle $8 billion for incorporating pieces of Oracle&#8217;s Java software language into the Android mobile operating system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In reviewing that decision, we assume, for argument’s sake, that the material was copyrightable,&#8221; wrote Justice Stephen Breyer. &#8220;But we hold that the copying here at issue nonetheless constituted a fair use. Hence, Google’s copying did not violate the copyright law.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, the court <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-trump-clarence-thomas/">vacated a ruling</a> declaring that then-President Donald Trump had violated the First Amendment by clocking critics on Twitter. In his opinion on the case, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/clarence-thomas-plays-a-poor-devils-advocate-in-floating-first-amendment-limits-for-tech-companies/">Justice Clarence Thomas argued </a> that companies like Facebook and Google are &#8220;at bottom communications networks, and they ‘carry’ information from one user to another&#8221; and can therefore be regulated in the same way as telecom carriers.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It was time for LG to move on. Frankly, the only surprise was that it didn’t do so sooner.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For those who follow the space, LG will be remembered fondly as a smartphone trailblazer. For a decade-and-a-half, the company was a major player in the Android category and a driving force behind a number of innovations that have since become standard.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most notable story is that of the LG Prada. Announced a month before the first iPhone, the device helped pioneer the touchscreen form factor that has come to define virtually every smartphone since. At the time, the <a href="https://macdailynews.com/2007/02/13/lg_accuses_apple_iphone_of_being_a_copycat_of_prada_phone/">company openly accused</a> Apple of ripping off its design, noting, “We consider that Apple copycat Prada phone after the design was unveiled when it was presented in the iF Design Award and won the prize in September 2006.”</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

			This July, the company will stop selling phones beyond what remains of its existing inventory.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>LG has continued pushing envelopes — albeit to mixed effect. In the end, however, the company just couldn’t keep up. This week, the South Korean electronics giant announced it will be getting out of the “incredibly competitive” category, choosing instead to focus on its myriad other departments.</p>
<p>The news comes as little surprise following months of rumors that the company was actively looking for a buyer for the smartphone unit. In the end, it seems, none were forthcoming. This July, the company will stop selling phones beyond what remains of its existing inventory.</p>
<p>The smartphone category is, indeed, a competitive one. And frankly, LG’s numbers have pretty consistently fallen into the “Others” category of global smartphone market share figures ruled by names like Samsung, Apple, Huawei and Xiaomi. The other names clustered beneath the top five have been, more often than not, other Chinese manufacturers like Vivo.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple CEO Tim Cook dropped a few hints in an interview released Monday about the direction of the much-anticipated Apple car, including that autonomous vehicle technology will likely be a key feature.</p>
<p>&#8220;The autonomy itself is a core technology, in my view,&#8221; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html?">Cook told Kara Swisher in an interview on the &#8220;Sway&#8221; podcast</a>. &#8220;If you sort of step back, the car, in a lot of ways, is a robot. An autonomous car is a robot. And so there&#8217;s lots of things you can do with autonomy. And we&#8217;ll see what Apple does.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cook was careful not to reveal too much, declining to answer Swisher&#8217;s question outright if Apple is planning to produce a car itself or the tech within the car. What clues he did drop, suggests Project Titan is working on something in the middle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We love to integrate hardware, software and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that&#8217;s where the magic occurs,&#8221; said Cook. &#8220;And we love to own the primary technology that&#8217;s around that.&#8221;</p>
<p>To which Swisher responded: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go with car for that, if you don&#8217;t mind. I&#8217;m just going to jump to car.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are, too.</p>

<p>Many people in the micromobility industry like to say that e-scooters are basically iPhones on wheels, but it&#8217;s more likely that the Apple car will <em>actually</em> be the iPhone on wheels. Apple is generally known for owning all of its hardware and software, so it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to see Apple engineers working closely with a manufacturer to produce an Apple car, with the potential to one day cut out the middle man and become the manufacturer.</p>
<p>The so-called Project Titan appeared at risk of failing before a car was ever seen by the public with mass layoffs in 2019. However, more recent reports suggest that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/the-apple-car-chatter-is-back-with-new-reports-pointing-to-a-2024-launch-date/">project is alive</a> and well with plans to make a self-driving electric passenger vehicle by 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/apple-and-hyundai-kia-driving-towards-deal-on-apple-car.html">Earlier this year, CNBC reported that Apple was close to finalizing a deal with Hyundai-Kia</a> to build an Apple-branded self-driving car at the Kia assembly plant in West Point, Georgia. Sources familiar with Apple&#8217;s interest in Hyundai say the company wants to work with an automaker that will let Apple hold the reins on the software and hardware that will go into the car.</p>
<p>The two companies never reached a deal and talks fell apart in February, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/hyundai-kia-say-they-aren-t-in-ev-discussions-with-apple">according to multiple reports</a>. That hasn&#8217;t stopped the flow of rumors and reports about Apple and its plans, which have previously been linked to other suppliers, automakers such as Nissan and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev">even startups</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still unclear what the Apple car will look like, but as a passenger vehicle, rather than a robotaxi or delivery vehicle, it will be going up against the likes of Tesla.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve never spoken to Elon, although I have great admiration and respect for the company he’s built,&#8221; said Cook. &#8220;I think Tesla has done an unbelievable job of not only establishing the lead, but keeping the lead for such a long period of time in the EV space. So I have great appreciation for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Project Titan is being led by Doug Field, who was formerly senior vice president of engineering at Tesla and one of the key players behind the Model 3 launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas flaunted a dangerous ignorance regarding matters digital in an opinion published today. In attempting to explain the legal difficulties of social media platforms, particularly those arising from Twitter&#8217;s ban of Trump, he makes an ill-informed, bordering on bizarre, argument as to why such companies may need their First Amendment rights curtailed.</p>
<p>There are several points on which Thomas seems to willfully misconstrue or misunderstand the issues.</p>
<p>The first is in his characterization of Trump&#8217;s use of Twitter. You may remember that several people sued after being blocked by Trump, alleging that his use of the platform amounted to creating a &#8220;public forum&#8221; in a legal sense, meaning it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/23/its-unconstitutional-for-trump-to-block-people-on-twitter/">unlawful to exclude anyone from it for political reasons</a>. (The case, as it happens, was rendered moot after its appeal and dismissed by the court except as Thomas&#8217; temporary soapbox.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CqUw91dVcf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-trump-clarence-thomas/">Supreme Court tosses ruling that said Trump blocking Twitter critics was unconstitutional</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Supreme Court tosses ruling that said Trump blocking Twitter critics was unconstitutional&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-trump-clarence-thomas/embed/#?secret=CqUw91dVcf" data-secret="CqUw91dVcf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;But Mr. Trump, it turned out, had only limited control of the account; Twitter has permanently removed the account from the platform,&#8221; writes Thomas. &#8220;[I]t seems rather odd to say something is a government forum when a private company has unrestricted authority to do away with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does it? Does it seem odd? Because a few paragraphs later, he uses the example of a government agency using a conference room in a hotel to hold a public hearing. They can&#8217;t kick people out for voicing their political opinions, certainly, because the room is a <em>de facto</em> public forum. But if someone is loud and disruptive, they can ask hotel security to remove that person, because the room is <em>de jure</em> a privately owned space.</p>
<p>Yet the obvious third example, and the one clearly most relevant to the situation at hand, is skipped. What if it is the government representatives who are being loud and disruptive, to the point where the hotel must make the choice whether to remove them?</p>
<p>It says something that this scenario, so remarkably close a metaphor for what actually happened, is not considered. Perhaps it casts the ostensibly &#8220;odd&#8221; situation and actors in too clear a light, for Thomas&#8217; other arguments suggest he is not for clarity here but for muddying the waters ahead of a partisan knife fight over free speech.</p>
<p>In his best &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying, I&#8217;m just <em>saying</em>&#8221; tone, Thomas presents his reasoning why, if the problem is that these platforms have too much power over free speech, then historically there just happens to be some legal options to limit that power.</p>
<p>Thomas argues first, and worst, that platforms like Facebook and Google may amount to &#8220;common carriers,&#8221; a term that goes back centuries to actual carriers of cargo, but which is now a common legal concept that refers to services that act as simple distribution — &#8220;bound to serve all customers alike, without discrimination.&#8221; A telephone company is the most common example, in that it cannot and does not choose what connections it makes, nor what conversations happen over those connections — it moves electric signals from one phone to another.</p>
<p>But as he notes at the outset of his commentary, &#8220;applying old doctrines to new digital platforms is rarely straightforward.&#8221; And Thomas&#8217; method of doing so is spurious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though digital instead of physical, they are at bottom communications networks, and they &#8216;carry&#8217; information from one user to another,&#8221; he says, and equates telephone companies laying cable with companies like Google laying &#8220;information infrastructure that can be controlled in much the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, this is certainly wrong. So wrong in so many ways that it&#8217;s hard to know where to start and when to stop.</p>
<p>The idea that companies like Facebook and Google are equivalent to telephone lines is such a reach that it seems almost like a joke. These are companies that have built entire business empires by adding enormous amounts of storage, processing, analysis and other services on top of the element of pure communication. One might as easily suggest that because computers are just a simple piece of hardware that moves data around, that Apple is a common carrier as well. It&#8217;s really not so far a logical leap!</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no real need to get into the technical and legal reasons why this opinion is wrong, however, because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/30/commission-impossible-how-and-why-the-fcc-created-net-neutrality/">these grounds have been covered so extensively over the years</a>, particularly by the FCC — which the Supreme Court has deferred to as an expert agency on this matter. If Facebook were a common carrier (or telecommunications service), it would fall under the FCC&#8217;s jurisdiction — but it doesn&#8217;t, because it isn&#8217;t, and really, no one thinks it is. This has been supported over and over, by multiple FCCs and administrations, and the deferral is itself a Supreme Court precedent that has become doctrine.</p>
<p>In fact, and this is really the cherry on top, Associate Justice Kavanaugh in a truly stupefying legal opinion a few years ago argued so far in the other direction that it became wrong in a totally different way! It was Kavanaugh&#8217;s considered opinion that the bar for qualifying as a common carrier was actually so high that even broadband providers don&#8217;t qualify for it. (This was all in service of taking down net neutrality, a saga we are in danger of resuming soon). As his erudite colleague Judge Srinivasan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-brutal-education-in-net-neutrality/">explained to him at the time</a>, this approach too is embarrassingly wrong.</p>

<p>Looking at these two opinions, of two sitting conservative Supreme Court justices, you may find the arguments strangely at odds, yet they are wrong after a common fashion.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh claims that broadband providers, the plainest form of digital common carrier conceivable, are in fact providing all kinds sophisticated services over and above their functionality as a pipe (they aren&#8217;t). Thomas claims that companies actually providing all kinds of sophisticated services are nothing more than pipes.</p>
<p>Simply stated, these men have no regard for the facts but have chosen the definition that best suits their political purposes: For Kavanaugh, thwarting a Democrat-led push for strong net neutrality rules; for Thomas, asserting control over social media companies perceived as having an anti-conservative bias.</p>
<p>The case Thomas uses for his sounding board on these topics was rightly rendered moot — Trump is no longer president and the account no longer exists — but he makes it clear that he regrets this extremely.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Twitter made clear, the right to cut off speech lies most powerfully in the hands of private digital platforms,&#8221; he concludes. &#8220;The extent to which that power matters for purposes of the First Amendment and the extent to which that power could lawfully be modified raise interesting and important questions. This petition, unfortunately, affords us no opportunity to confront them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Between the common carrier argument and questioning the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-trump-clarence-thomas/">form of Section 230</a>, Thomas&#8217;s hypotheticals break the seals on several legal avenues to restrict First Amendment rights of digital platforms, as well as legitimizing those (largely on one side of the political spectrum) who claim a grievance along these lines. (Slate legal commentator Mark Joseph Stern, who spotted the opinion early, goes further, calling Thomas&#8217;s argument <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/04/clarence-thomas-social-media-first-amendment-censorship.html">a &#8220;paranoid Marxist delusion&#8221;</a> and providing some other interesting context.)</p>
<p>This is not to say that social media and tech do not deserve scrutiny on any number of fronts — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/who-regulates-social-media/">they exist in an alarming global vacuum of regulatory powers</a>, and hardly anyone would suggest they have been entirely responsible with this freedom. But the arguments of Thomas and Kavanaugh stink of cynical partisan sophistry. This endorsement by Thomas accomplishes nothing legally, but will provide valuable fuel for the bitter fires of contention — though they hardly needed it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, Amazon fired Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa. The pair of employees had been among the company’s most outspoken critics on staff, openly taking Amazon to task for environmental and labor issues.</p>
<p>This week, the National Labor Relations Board determined that the pair’s firing was an illegal form of retaliation. Speaking with The New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/technology/amazon-nlrb-activist-workers.html">Cunningham noted</a> that the board would issue a more public criticism of Amazon’s action if the company does not take steps to address the issue.</p>
<p>Amazon tells TechCrunch that the decision was not a direct result of the pair’s criticism, but rather a product of other, unstated polices. “We support every employee’s right to criticize their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies,&#8221; a spokesperson says. &#8220;We terminated these employees for repeatedly violating internal policies.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon fires two more employees who were openly critical of working conditions during pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/amazon-fires-two-more-employees-who-were-openly-critical-of-working-conditions-during-pandemic/embed/#?secret=hnL7SI8Jfh" data-secret="hnL7SI8Jfh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Cunningham, meanwhile, called the decision a “moral victory.”</p>
<p>The news came amid widescale ramp-ups as Amazon was declared an essential service while COVID-19 bore down on the U.S. in April. Two weeks prior, the company opened a massive fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama, which has become the focal point of yet another labor battle for the online retail giant.</p>
<p>The warehouse is currently ground zero for the largest unionizing effort in the company’s history. The National Labor Relations Board is tasked with ballot counting, which kicked off on Tuesday of last week. In the final days of voting, the company made an aggressive social media push against union allies, though it has since walked it back some, including a soft apology for comments surrounding reports that employees regularly pee in bottles to meet stringent quotas.</p>
<p>In addition to its rulings on Cunningham and Costa, the NLRB has also found for Amazonians United co-founder, Jonathan Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The company provided TechCrunch an additional statement, “We disagree with these preliminary findings. We support every employee’s right to criticize their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against our internal policies, all of which are lawful. We terminated these employees not for the reasons cited in the preliminary finding, but because they repeatedly violated internal policies.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A grand jury has indicted a California resident accused of stealing Shopify customer data on over a hundred merchants, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20580321-us-grand-jury-indictment-tassilo-heinrich">indictment</a> charges Tassilo Heinrich with aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to commit wire fraud by allegedly working with two Shopify customer support agents to steal merchant and customer data from Shopify customers to gain a competitive edge and &#8220;take business away from those merchants,&#8221; the indictment reads. The indictment also accuses Heinrich, believed to be around 18 years old at the time of the alleged scheme, of selling the data to other co-conspirators to commit fraud.</p>
<p>A person with direct knowledge of the security breach confirmed Shopify was the unnamed victim company referenced <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20580321-us-grand-jury-indictment-tassilo-heinrich">in the indictment</a>.</p>
<p>Last September, Shopify, an online e-commerce platform for small businesses, revealed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/shopify-data-merchant-breach/">a data breach</a> perpetrated by two &#8220;rogue members&#8221; of its third-party customer support team that targeted &#8220;less than 200 merchants.&#8221; Shopify said it fired the two contractors for engaging &#8220;in a scheme to obtain customer transactional records of certain merchants.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shopify said the contractors <a href="https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Discussion/Incident-Update/m-p/888971/highlight/true#M197487">stole customer data</a>, including names, postal addresses and order details, like which products and services were purchased. One merchant who received the data breach notice from Shopify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/shopify-data-merchant-breach/">said</a> the last four digits of affected customers&#8217; payment cards were also taken, which the indictment confirms.</p>
<p>Another one of the victims was Kylie Jenner&#8217;s cosmetics and make-up company, Kylie Cosmetics, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54354526">the BBC reported</a>.</p>
<p>The indictment accuses Heinrich of paying an employee of a third-party customer support company in the Philippines to access parts of Shopify&#8217;s internal network by either taking screenshots or uploading the data to Google Drive in exchange for kickbacks. Heinrich paid the employee in thousands of dollars&#8217; worth of cryptocurrency, and also fake positive reviews claiming to be from merchants to whom the employee had provided customer service but had not left feedback. The indictment alleges that Heinrich received a year&#8217;s worth of some merchants&#8217; data.</p>
<p>Heinrich allegedly spent at least a year siphoning off incrementing amounts of data from Shopify&#8217;s internal network, at one point asking if he could &#8220;remotely access&#8221; the customer support employee&#8217;s computer while they were asleep.</p>
<p>In a brief statement, Shopify spokesperson Rebecca Feigelsohn said: &#8220;Shopify has cooperated with the FBI to investigate an incident involving the data of a small number of our merchants in September 2020. As previously stated, the perpetrators involved no longer work with Shopify. Because there is an active criminal investigation, we are unable to provide further comment at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heinrich was arrested by the FBI at Los Angeles International Airport in February and is currently detained in federal custody pending trial, set to begin on September 7. Heinrich has pleaded not guilty.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As consumers build their wealth, assets are typically tangible: cash, investments, property, cars, jewelry, art. But increasingly we’re adding a new type of asset to the mix: digital assets, whether in the form of cryptocurrency or a new asset class, NFTs.</p>
<p>We’re going through the biggest wealth transfer in history right now, with an estimated $16 trillion <a href="https://www.wealthx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WealthX_NFP_FamilyWealthTransfersReport-2014.pdf">expected to change hands</a> in the coming decades. While it’s easy to hand over the reins of a physical asset in the event of an emergency or death, it’s not as simple with digital assets.</p>
<p>A new Angus Reid study commissioned by Canadian online will platform <a href="https://www.willful.co/">Willful</a> finds that only one in four consumers have someone in their life who knows all of their passwords and account details, which begs the question: Will consumers be prepared to pass on digital assets, or will billions in virtual goods be stuck in the digital ether?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			While it’s easy to hand over the reins of a physical asset in the event of an emergency or death, it’s not as simple with digital assets.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Digital assets have been dominating the news cycle in 2021. While cryptocurrency isn’t new, it’s attracted a lot of attention in the past year because of its skyrocketing value, promotion from prominent figures like billionaire Elon Musk, and bitcoin offerings from traditional financial firms like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/bitcoin-morgan-stanley-is-the-first-big-us-bank-to-offer-wealthy-clients-access-to-bitcoin-funds.html">Morgan Stanley</a>. If you hold any type of cryptocurrency, the only way to access it is via a private key &#8212; typically a 64-digit passcode. No private key, no access to the virtual currency.</p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html">many stories reported</a> about people who purchased bitcoin and would be millionaires today if they hadn’t thrown out their hard drive or lost track of their key. One high-profile case is that of Gerald Cotten, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/the-strange-tale-of-quadriga-gerald-cotten">Quadriga</a>. When Cotten died in 2018, he took with him the private keys to over $250 million in client assets.</p>
<p>Consumers have also been inundated with stories about NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, which are digital assets hosted on the same blockchain that makes cryptocurrency possible. To most, it seems absurd that artist Beeple could <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million">sell a $69 million piece of art </a>through a Christie’s auction, or that a virtual home in Toronto could <a href="https://www.blogto.com/tech/2021/03/toronto-digital-house-nft-600k/">sell for over $600,000</a>, or that people would spend over $200 million <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html">trading virtual NBA highlights</a> like we used to trade baseball cards. But this new asset class is proving that digital assets can be as valuable if not more valuable than physical assets &#8212; and similar to cryptocurrency, they likely require a private key to access them.</p>
<p>When someone dies, they either have a will that dictates how their assets will be distributed, or, if they die without a will, a government formula outlines how their assets will be divided. While a will outlines who should receive what, it typically doesn’t have an up-to-date asset list, nor does it contain passwords or access keys. There’s an estimated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/your-money/unclaimed-assets.html">tens of billions in unclaimed assets</a> sitting in banks today as a result of a family or executor not knowing about those accounts following an individual’s death.</p>
<p>But an executor can do due diligence by calling financial institutions to double-check whether the person held accounts and get access to those funds, which typically requires providing copies of the will and/or death certificate. With digital assets, it’s not as simple as calling the bank and finding out a relative had a valuable NFT. There’s no directory or central body that governs NFTs or cryptocurrency &#8212; it’s purposely decentralized, which is great for privacy but less than ideal for family members who want to figure out if someone held valuable digital assets.</p>
<p>And it’s not just about knowing digital assets exist &#8212; it’s about knowing how to access them. A recent study from the Angus Reid Forum, commissioned by Willful, showed that consumers under 35 are way less likely to have shared account access with loved ones (19% of those under 35 have shared account info, compared with 32% of those over 55). This makes sense, since the younger you are, the less likely you are to think about passing on assets after you die. But this tech-savvy younger demographic may leave their families in the lurch if something happens.</p>
<p>So what can consumers do to ensure their digital assets are protected? First, consider using a password manager like 1Password &#8212; which can store all of your account information, logins, private keys to digital assets and any other key information &#8212; and share the master access password with your executor or store it with your will.</p>
<p>While this can ensure easy access to your accounts in an emergency, Lee Poskanzer, the founder of <a href="https://www.directivecommunications.com/">Directive Communication Systems</a>, says it can also put your family or executors at risk, highlighting that in many cases, website and app owners explicitly prohibit password sharing in their terms of service, and privacy laws in some jurisdictions prohibit account holder impersonation (in the U.S., that’s covered by the Stored Communications and Electronic Communications Privacy Act). Not to mention, accounts increasingly require two-factor authentication, which may not be easy to confirm if executors don’t have access to the person’s smartphone.</p>
<p>Directive Communication Systems’ platform helps manage the transfer of digital assets upon death, and Poskanzer says they don’t collect passwords for this reason. Instead, they work with the estate to provide content providers (Google, social media platforms, etc.) with required documentation, which can include a death certificate, obituary, ID or other documents. Upon meeting those requirements, which vary by company, content providers provide a data dump of an account’s contents, making them available via the cloud.</p>
<p>Second, consider using a digital wallet or exchange to store your digital assets &#8212; if your family has access to that, it may also include access to your private keys, depending on the wallet&#8217;s features, or the exchange itself may have a death-management process.</p>
<p>For example, Coinbase <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/managing-my-account/other/how-do-i-gain-access-to-a-deceased-family-members-coinbase-account">clearly outlines </a>what an executor or family member can do to retrieve digital assets in case of the death of the account holder. As a backup, you can store your private key on a physical piece of paper and ensure it’s stored in a safe deposit box, fireproof safe or other safe place your executor can access in the event of your passing.</p>
<p>Third, create an up-to-date list of your assets that your <a href="https://www.willful.co/learn/what-is-an-executor-and-how-do-i-choose-one">executor</a> and/or key family members have access to &#8212; this should include physical and digital assets, and should be reviewed and updated either annually or when you acquire a new asset or change financial institutions. Finally, <a href="https://www.willful.co/">create a will</a> that clearly outlines how you want your assets to be distributed and provide specific instructions on how you want digital assets to be distributed.</p>
<p>Not only is this best practice to protect your assets of any kind and to appoint key roles like guardians for minor children, it will also likely be required in order to release any account contents (for example, Coinbase requires a copy of the will as part of its process to release funds to an estate).</p>
<p>As we go through this major wealth transfer between generations, it’s likely that banks, fintechs, crypto exchanges, social media platforms and other content providers will create clear death-management processes that make it easier to alert people about digital assets before you die and provide easy access instructions. But until that happens, following these steps means you can ensure your assets go to the people or organizations you want them to &#8212; and that they won’t be stuck in digital purgatory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The highest court in the land has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-trump-clarence-thomas/">lot to say about tech this week</a>. The Supreme Court weighed in on Google&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/oracle-v-google/">long legal battle with Oracle</a> on Monday, overturning a prior victory for the latter company that could have resulted in an $8 billion award.</p>
<p>In a 6-2 decision, the court ruled that Google didn&#8217;t break copyright laws when it incorporated pieces of Oracle&#8217;s Java software language into its own mobile operating system. Google copied Oracle&#8217;s code for Java APIs for Android, and the case kicked off a yearslong debate over the reuse of established APIs and copyright.</p>
<p>In 2018, a federal appeals court ruled that Google did in fact violate copyright law by using the APIs and that its implementation didn&#8217;t fall under fair use.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;In reviewing that decision, we assume, for argument’s sake, that the material was copyrightable. But we hold that the copying here at issue nonetheless constituted a fair use. Hence, Google’s copying did not violate the copyright law,&#8221; Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the decision, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/oracle-wins-appeal-against-google-in-copyright-case/">reverses Oracle&#8217;s previous win</a>. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google’s copying of the Java SE API, which included only those lines of code that were needed to allow programmers to put their accrued talents to work in a new and transformative program, was a fair use of that material as a matter of law,&#8221; Breyer wrote.</p>
<p>Google SVP of Global Affairs Kent Walker called the ruling, embedded below, a &#8220;big win for innovation, interoperability &amp; computing.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Houseparty, the social video app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/fortnite-maker-epic-acquires-social-video-app-houseparty/">acquired by</a> Fortnite maker Epic Games in 2019, has just <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/stream-your-fortnite-gameplay-to-friends-inside-houseparty">announced</a> a major new step in terms of integrating these two properties: the company says it will now allow gamers to livestream their Fortnite gameplay directly into Houseparty. The feature works to allow users to share their gameplay with up to nine other friends in a Houseparty room.</p>
<p>The addition follows Houseparty&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/houseparty-adds-fortnite-mode-bringing-video-chat-to-the-popular-game/">launch of a &#8220;Fortnite Mode&#8221;</a> last November, which added a video chat feature to Fortnite where players could see live feeds from their friends while gaming, powered by Houseparty. Today&#8217;s launch is something of a reverse of that, as it lets players stream the game to friends, which is viewable inside Houseparty itself. This allows the users&#8217; friends &#8212; including those who may not be Fortnite gamers themselves &#8212; to watch and and interact with the player.</p>
<p>To use the new feature, the Fortnite player will need to have enabled Fortnite Mode Streaming and be connected to Houseparty. When they begin to stream their gameplay, their friends on Houseparty will be notified that their game feeds are now available to watch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Fortnite player can then see who is watching their stream via a graphic overlaid on their screen which shows their &#8220;watcher count.&#8221; This is represented by a little eye icon in the middle-left of the screen for the gamer, while Houseparty users will see the eye icon in the top-left of their video screen.</p>
<p>During the livestream, the player and their friends can watch and chat, as usual.</p>
<p>If the Fortnite player doesn&#8217;t want to livestream their gameplay, they can change this at any time from a setting inside Fortnite without losing their ability to use the video chat feature. Parents and guardians can also turn on and off Fortnite Mode and other privacy features inside Fortnite&#8217;s settings. The company notes that personal info will be blocked from streams, including payments information. However, The Lobby, your menus and your gameplay can all be streamed when Fortnite Mode is enabled.</p>
<p>Houseparty first gained traction as a way for friends to virtually &#8220;hang out&#8221; online through video chat, but ultimately sold to Epic Games shortly after the gaming giant raised a massive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/epic-games-the-creator-of-fortnite-raises-1-25-billion/">$1.25 billion round</a>. So far, Houseparty hasn&#8217;t given up on its other social features, even as it has become more closely integrated with Fortnite. The launch of the new feature creates potential for Houseparty to capture some of the more casual livestreaming that today takes place on other platforms, like Twitch, Facebook or YouTube, where users aren&#8217;t necessarily streaming for fans, but rather for friends.</p>
<p>The company says the new feature won&#8217;t offer a record function for later exporting these livestreams for publishing elsewhere, but notes that Fortnite already allows the ability to save replays.</p>
<p>At launch, Fortnite gameplay integration with Houseparty is available across PC and PlayStation only (PS4 and PS5). Epic Games didn&#8217;t say if or when other platforms would be supported. Houseparty users on iOS, Android and Chrome will be able to watch the livestreams.</p>
<p>The previously launched video chat feature in Fortnite was also supported on PCs and PlayStations.</p>
