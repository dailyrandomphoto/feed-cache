		Oren Ezer is CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.electreon.com/">ElectReon</a>, a shared energy platform that provides wireless charging for electric vehicles.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">President Joe Biden&#8217;s plan for electric vehicles (EVs) to comprise <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-steps-to-drive-american-leadership-forward-on-clean-cars-and-trucks/">roughly half of U.S. sales by 2030</a> is a clear indication that the U.S. is making strides in decarbonizing its transportation systems, which currently account for nearly half of total U.S. emissions.</p>
<p>Though this kind of federal support is critical in accelerating the mass adoption of EVs, we must face the impending need to rehabilitate the ailing U.S. electric infrastructure that millions currently rely on, namely the capabilities of the power grid.</p>
<p>As society converts to an all-electric future and demand rises for EVs, a challenge our modern world will face is how to charge the increasing number of vehicles without overstressing the grid past its capacity. While <a href="https://www.virta.global/blog/myth-buster-electric-vehicles-will-overload-the-power-grid">some predict</a> EVs will overload the power grid, others have found methods that support our energy infrastructure, including solutions such as wireless charging, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration or more efficient methods of utilizing renewable energy sources, to name a few.</p>
<p>Amid warranted concerns about the unstable grid, there is an urgent need to find solutions that can reinforce this critical infrastructure to avoid pushing the grid to its limits.</p>
<h2>The current challenges facing the grid</h2>
<p>According to the recent <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/">IPCC climate change</a> report, extreme heat waves that previously only struck once every 50 years are now expected to happen once per decade or more frequently due to global warming and anthropogenic emissions. While this has already been seen in this past year through record-breaking heat waves and extreme fires <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/08/09/pacific-northwest-heatwave-fires-california/">in the Pacific Northwest</a>, utilities, operators and industry experts continue to express concern about whether current energy systems will be able to withstand increasing temperatures from climate change.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just heat: In February, a cold snap in Texas crippled energy infrastructure and left millions without power. These numbers will only continue to increase as temperatures rise and the grid overworks itself to meet electricity needs.</p>
<p>In addition to fluctuating temperatures impacting the grid, many are also concerned about its ability to support the increasing number of EVs expected to hit the market in the coming years. With reports indicating that transportation electrification will likely require a <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/72330.pdf">doubling of U.S. generation capacity by 2050</a>, there is a need for flexible EV charging options that can increase flexibility and load times during peak charging hours. However, as it currently stands, the U.S. power grid is only capable of supporting 24 million EVs until 2028 一 well under the required number of EVs needed to successfully curb road transport emissions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite these challenges, one thing that industry experts have pointed out is that EVs have the potential to play a massive role in managing demand as well as aid in stabilizing the grid when necessary. However, as EVs are more widely adopted across the U.S., utilities need to ask themselves critical questions such as when people will likely charge their vehicles, how many users are charging their vehicles and when, what types of chargers are in use, and what types of vehicles are charging (such as passenger vehicles or medium- to heavy-duty fleets) to determine the additional demand for electricity and how they must upgrade their grids.</p>
<h2>EV charging solutions will become an asset, not a liability</h2>
<p>With long lead times for grid infrastructure upgrades paired with an increasing number of individuals and companies looking to electrify their vehicles, municipalities across the U.S. are desperately searching for methods to implement the necessary charging infrastructure to stay ahead of the rising EV tide while simultaneously ensuring the grid’s stability. However, a recent <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/biden-wants-more-evs-charging-stations/">analysis</a> by the ICCT estimates that with the current number of U.S. EV chargers at 216,000, the country will need 2.4 million public and workplace chargers by 2030 if it wants to meet its goals.</p>
<p>To address this concerning lack of charging infrastructure, cities have begun to explore charging options outside of the traditional, stationary station to not only speed up the adoption of the necessary charging infrastructure, but to protect the grid as well. One of these options is dynamic charging, otherwise known as wireless or in-motion charging.</p>
<p>On one hand, some argue wireless electric vehicle charging will pose an additional strain on existing grid infrastructure by increasing demand variability due to fragmented charging duration caused by charging lane layouts and traffic. On the other hand, many argue that wireless charging actually decreases the demand on the power grid due to the fact that energy demand is spread over time and space throughout the day, rather than being confined to stationary chargers&#8217; charging period between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m., which enables a reduction in required grid connections and upgrades.</p>
<p>Additionally, wireless charging can be deployed in locations where conductive (plug-in) charging solutions cannot &#8212; such as roads, directly under commercial facility loading docks, at exit and entry points to facilities, under taxi queues, at bus stations and terminals, etc., which means that wireless technology can charge EVs at regular intervals throughout the day with “top-up” charging.</p>
<p>This method also enables more efficient utilization of renewable solar energy, produced and utilized predominantly during daylight hours, meaning limited additional energy storage devices are required, unlike conductive EV charging stations, which can typically only be used in the evening and nighttime hours and require energy storage.</p>
<p>These benefits indicate that cities and utilities alike can capitalize on efficient energy utilization strategies such as wireless charging to spread energy demand over time and space &#8212; adding additional flexibility and protection to the grid. While this method can and should be applied to passenger EVs, using it to power medium- to heavy-duty fleet vehicles will allow for a much faster transition to electric in these challenging-to-electrify fleet segments.</p>
<h2>Can wireless charging assist the grid in supporting widespread adoption of EVs?</h2>
<p>While passenger EVs pose challenges of their own to the grid, large-scale fleet charging will be a monumental task if utilities don&#8217;t get ahead of the transition. Wireless charging offers a cost-effective solution to operators looking to transition to meet carbon reduction goals, with projected numbers of electric commercial and passenger fleets <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/charging-electric-vehicle-fleets-how-to-seize-the-emerging-opportunity">making up 10%-15% of all fleet vehicles by 2030</a>. Let’s take a closer look at an example comparison between plugging in large vehicles versus wireless charging and the impact both have on the grid:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conductive (plug-in):</strong> 100 e-buses with 240 kWh batteries using overnight conductive charging at a bus depot requires a minimum grid connection of 6 megawatts (MW) because the entire fleet charges at the end of daily operations, typically simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Inductive (wireless):</strong> 100 e-buses using wireless charging stationary charging technology at bus terminals, garages and stations located inside city centers enable the buses to be “topped-up” throughout the day at natural breaks in their operations. This charging strategy enables both massive battery capacity reduction (the exact amount depends on the fleet and vehicle energy requirements) and, because the bus fleet charging is spread throughout the day, the required grid connection(s) can be reduced by 66% to just 2 MW.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wireless electric roads accompanied by solar panel fences adjacent to the road may be the ultimate solution for decentralizing power generation and eliminating stress on the grid. According to industry calculations, approximately 0.6 miles of this electric fence solution could provide between 1.3-3.3 MW of power. This combination of solar generation coupled with wireless charging infrastructure embedded into the road can support anywhere between 1,300 to 3,300 buses per day independent of power grid supply (assuming an average speed of 50 mph and accounting for seasonal variations in solar radiation).</p>
<p>Furthermore, because wireless electric roads are a shared platform for all EVs, this same road would also charge trucks, vans and passenger vehicles without placing additional pressures on the grid.</p>
<h2>Innovative charging methods will play a critical role in modernizing and adapting our power grid</h2>
<p>Although wireless charging is still relatively new to the market, the benefits are beginning to become glaringly self-evident. Amid increasing concerns about outdated grid infrastructure in the face of widespread transport electrification efforts, rising temperatures and extreme weather conditions, innovative charging methods can provide an optimal solution.</p>
<p>From distributing EV charging throughout the day to avoid overloads to being able to support the energy capacity needs of both passenger vehicles and large fleets simultaneously, technologies such as wireless charging will become critical resources in adapting to an all-electric decarbonized future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-news-feeds-politics-b4a32c93-3dab-42cd-b761-039363ebdb7c.html">preparing to adjust its News Feed</a> to de-emphasize political posts and current events, but news reader Flipboard is instead rolling out an update that puts users in control of their own feeds. The company announced this morning the launch of a new controller on the cover of its own main newsfeed, aka the &#8220;For You&#8221; feed, which now allows users to select new topics to follow and deselect those they no longer want to hear about. The feature, which Flipboard dubs &#8220;an antidote to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/doomsurfing-doomscrolling-words-were-watching">doomscrolling</a>,&#8221; allows users to customize their For You feed to deliver a wider selection stories related to their various interests, instead of focusing their home page on breaking news and politics.</p>
<p>Given today&#8217;s current events &#8212; a pandemic that&#8217;s dragging on, climate change-induced wildfires and major storms, the fall of Afghanistan, and other disasters &#8212; it&#8217;s no wonder why people want to take a break from the daily news. But for Flipboard, that trend could mean reduced use of its news-reading app, as well.</p>
<p>But while Flipboard notes that millions do use its app to keep up with breaking stories and politics, a majority of its user base also spends their time engaging with other topics &#8212; like travel, food, photography, fitness, and parenting.</p>

<p>By introducing tools that allow users to customize their own feeds, the company believes users will not only see improved mental health, but will also spend a longer time in the Flipboard app. Already, this appears to be true, based on other recent changes Flipboard has made.</p>
<p>The company recently introduced<a href="https://about.flipboard.com/inside-flipboard/tune-your-topics-personalize-any-flipboard-topic-just-for-you/"> topic personalization features</a>, which allowed users to zero in on more niche interests &#8212; think, not just <em>cooking</em> but <em>keto</em> <em>cooking</em>; not just <em>health</em>, but <em>mindfulness</em> and <em>sleep</em>, for example. Users who customized their preferences spent between 9 and 12 minutes per day reading stories about these topics, on average, Flipboard found.</p>
<p>With the launch of For You newsfeed controls, Flipboard wants to bring a similar level of customization and control to users&#8217; own homepages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said the feature also addresses the number one request from users &#8212; they&#8217;ve been asking to have more control over the content selection in their For You feed.</p>
<p>To use the feature, you&#8217;ll look for the new filter toggles at the top of the main page. After tapping the icon, you&#8217;ll be launched into a window where you can tap and untap a range of topics. You can also use the search bar to discover other interests that may not be listed. When you&#8217;re finished customizing, you&#8217;ll just tap &#8220;Save&#8221; to exit back to your newly customized For You feed.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2196270" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GIF-Flipboard-For-You-personalization.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /></p>
<p>Flipboard hopes its customization capabilities will help it to stand out from other news reading experiences &#8212; whether that&#8217;s browsing news inside social media feeds or even in dedicated news reading apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;This level of content control is unique to Flipboard; just think about how hard it is to adjust your feed on any other platform,&#8221; noted Flipboard CEO Mike McCue, when introducing the update.  &#8220;A highly personalized feed empowers people to focus on the things that matter to them, without being distracted by doomscrolling, misinformation or browsing through other people’s lives. We build a platform that lets people take control of their media consumption rather than letting it control them,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’re in India, the Philippines, Russia, or Vietnam, Amazon Prime and Gorillas are probably not that much use to you. Comparable to DoorDash Drive or Lalamove (Malaysia), Dostavista is a “crowdsourced” same-day delivery service. Founded in Russia, the startup initially figured out a way to appeal to gig economy workers in countries such as the ones above by creating a game where players would be asked to deliver virtual items, before pivoting to the real thing. That left-of-field thinking has seen it expand to countries not typically touched by the bigger delivery startups.</p>
<p>Now the Amsterdam HQ-d startup is rebranding as “<a href="http://borzodelivery.com">Borzo</a>” to bring its operation in 10 different countries under one. At the same time, it’s raised $35 million in a Series C funding round led by UAE-based investor <a href="http://mubadala.com/">Mubadala</a>. Also participating were VNV Global, RDIF, Flashpoint Venture Capital, and others.</p>
<p>The demand for affordable, same-day delivery of goods was obviously accelerated by the pandemic, and no less so in developing countries as well as developed ones.</p>
<p>Borzo says its gig economy workforce enables delivery via any route, any transport, any weight or size. The startup says it has built algorithms to optimize numerous parallel delivery routes taking into account the geographical routes, packages’ contents, couriers, and other factors.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mike Alexandrovski, founder of Borzo, said: “With the new round closed we continue to move toward our goal of becoming one of the top courier delivery companies in every market we operate in. To achieve this goal we believe it’s important to ensure operational synchronicity and integrity of the company&#8217;s brand perception, and that’s why we rebranded it to Borzo.” </p>
<p>Founded in 2012, Borzo says it now has a customer base of 2 million users, 2.5M couriers and operates in 10 countries including Brazil, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia, Turkey, and Vietnam.  It claims to be fulfilling over 3M orders per month, while its annual gross revenue run rate approaches $150M, it says.</p>
<p>Faris Al Mazrui, Head of Russia &amp; CIS at Mubadala, said: “The true fundamental shift in eCommerce took place with the increasing reliability and convenience of on-demand delivery services. In Borzo, we find a team with a clear vision of the opportunity in the evolving on-demand delivery space. They have succeeded in going global; becoming competitive in 10 new international markets.”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last year we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/dostavista-series-b/">covered</a> Borzo’s $15 million Series B round led by Vostok New Ventures, with participation from existing investors Flashpoint and AddVenture.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company views its market as a new technology category. Databricks calls the technology a data “lakehouse,” a mashup of data lake and data warehouse.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://databricks.com/">Databricks</a> this morning confirmed earlier reports that it was raising new capital at a higher valuation. The data- and AI-focused company has secured a $1.6 billion round at<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/would-the-math-work-if-databricks-were-valued-at-38b/"> a $38 billion valuation</a>, it said. Bloomberg<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-18/databricks-funding-will-bring-valuation-to-38-billion"> first reported</a> last week that Databricks was pursuing new capital at that price.</p>
<p>The Series H was led by Counterpoint Global, a Morgan Stanley fund. Other new investors included Baillie Gifford, UC Investments and ClearBridge. A grip of prior investors also kicked in cash to the round.</p>
<p>The new funding brings Databricks’ total private funding raised to $3.5 billion. Notably, its latest raise comes just seven months after the late-stage startup<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/databricks-raises-1b-at-28b-valuation-as-it-reaches-425m-arr/"> raised $1 billion on a $28 billion valuation</a>. Its new valuation represents paper value creation in excess of $1 billion per month.</p>
<p>The company, which makes open source and commercial products for processing structured and unstructured data in one location, views its market as a new technology category. Databricks calls the technology a data “lakehouse,” a mashup of data lake and data warehouse.</p>
<p>Databricks CEO and co-founder<a href="https://twitter.com/alighodsi"> Ali Ghodsi</a> believes that its new capital will help his company secure market leadership.</p>
<p>For context, since the 1980s, large companies have stored massive amounts of structured data in data warehouses. More recently, companies like Snowflake and Databricks have provided a similar solution for <em>un</em>structured data called a data lake.</p>
<p>In Ghodsi’s view, combining structured and unstructured data in a single place with the ability for customers to execute data science <em>and</em> business-intelligence work without moving the underlying data is a critical change in the larger data market.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Data lakehouses are] a new category, and we think there&#8217;s going to be lots of vendors in this data category. So it&#8217;s a land grab. We want to quickly race to build it and complete the picture,&#8221; he said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rwGl72pNxX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/13/9-investors-discuss-challenges-opportunities-and-the-impact-of-cloud-vendors-in-enterprise-data-lakes/">9 investors discuss hurdles, opportunities and the impact of cloud vendors in enterprise data lakes</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;9 investors discuss hurdles, opportunities and the impact of cloud vendors in enterprise data lakes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/13/9-investors-discuss-challenges-opportunities-and-the-impact-of-cloud-vendors-in-enterprise-data-lakes/embed/#?secret=rwGl72pNxX" data-secret="rwGl72pNxX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ghodsi also pointed out that he is going up against well-capitalized competitors and that he wants the funds to compete hard with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you know, it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re up against some tiny startups that are getting seed funding to build this. It&#8217;s all kinds of [large, established] vendors,&#8221; he said. That includes Snowflake, Amazon, Google and others who want to secure a piece of the new market category that Databricks sees emerging.</p>
<p>The company’s performance indicates that it’s onto something.</p>
<h2><strong>Growth</strong></h2>
<p>Databricks has reached the $600 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) milestone, it disclosed as part of its funding announcement. It closed 2020 at $425 million ARR, to better illustrate how quickly it is growing at scale.</p>
<p>Per the company, its new ARR figure represents 75% growth, measured on a year-over-year basis.</p>
<p>That’s quick for a company of its size; per the Bessemer Cloud Index, top-quartile public software companies are growing at around 44% year over year. Those companies are worth around 22x their forward revenues.</p>
<p>At its new valuation, Databricks is worth 63x its current ARR. So Databricks isn’t cheap, but at its current pace should be able to grow to a size that makes its most recent private valuation easily tenable when it does go public, provided that it doesn’t set a new, higher bar for its future performance by raising again before going public.</p>
<p>Ghodsi declined to share timing around a possible IPO, and it isn’t clear whether the company will pursue a traditional IPO or if it will continue to raise private funds so that it can direct list when it chooses to float. Regardless, Databricks is now sufficiently valuable that it can only exit to one of a handful of mega-cap technology giants or go public.</p>
<p>Why hasn’t the company gone public? Ghodsi is enjoying a rare position in the startup market: He has access to unlimited capital. Databricks had to open another $100 million in its latest round, which was originally set to close at just $1.5 billion. It doesn’t lack for investor interest, allowing its CEO to bring aboard the sort of shareholder he wants for his company’s post-IPO life &#8212; while enjoying limited dilution.</p>
<p>This also enables him to hire aggressively, possibly buy some smaller companies to fill in holes in Databricks&#8217; product roadmap, and grow outside of the glare of Wall Street expectations from a position of capital advantage. It’s the startup equivalent of having one’s cake and eating it too.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8OqQ90VcF3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/would-the-math-work-if-databricks-were-valued-at-38b/">Would the math work if Databricks were valued at $38B?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Would the math work if Databricks were valued at $38B?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/would-the-math-work-if-databricks-were-valued-at-38b/embed/#?secret=8OqQ90VcF3" data-secret="8OqQ90VcF3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But staying private longer isn’t without risks. If the larger market for software companies was rapidly devalued, Databricks could find itself too expensive to go public at its final private valuation. However, given the long bull market that we’ve seen in recent years for software shares, and the confidence Ghodsi has in his potential market, that doesn’t seem likely.</p>
<p>There’s still much about Databricks&#8217; financial position that we don’t yet know &#8212; its gross margin profile, for example. TechCrunch is also incredibly curious what all its fundraising and ensuing spending have done to near-term Databricks operating cash flow results, as well as how long its gross-margin adjusted CAC payback has evolved since the onset of COVID-19. If we ever get an S-1, we might find out.</p>
<p>For now, winsome private markets are giving Ghodsi and crew space to operate an effectively public company without the annoyances that come with actually being public. Want the same thing for your company? Easy: Just reach $600 million ARR while growing 75% year over year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following a spate of leaks, Bose this morning <a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/quietcomfort-headphones-45.html#v=qc45_black">announced the latest addition</a> to its well-loved over ear headphones. The QuietComfort 45 (which replace the 35 II) sport improved noise cancellation and 24 hours of battery on a charge, per Bose’s metrics. The air travel mainstays run $330 – coming in $20 cheaper than the QC 35’s initial asking price.</p>
<p>The new headphones look similar to the last few generations, mostly receiving some tweaks to make them a bit more comfortable, lighter and more compact. The headphones have two primary modes: Quiet and Aware. The former uses improved noise canceling tech to respond to ambient noise (as opposed to Bose’s older one-size-fits-all ANC). Aware, meanwhile lets sound in with a transparency mode.</p>
<p>Where some have switched entirely to touch panels, Bose maintains physical buttons, with four on the left ear cup for volume, power and pairing and one on the right to switch between noise canceling modes. Voice has been improved to isolate sound while using the built-in microphone for conversations.</p>

<p>The battery is rated at 24 hours of music playback, which is recharged via USB C. It takes a full two hours to go from zero to full – or you can get three hours on 15 minutes, if you’re pressed for time.</p>
<p>The headphone category has evolved dramatically since Bose release the first generation QuietComfort way back in 2000, It finally went fully wireless in 2016 with the QC 35. More recently, the category has gotten even more crowded courtesy of some excellent entries from the likes of Sony and Apple, but Bose remains the most iconic name in over ear headphones, particular for frequent travels.</p>
<p>The QC 45 maintain the company’s approach to keeping things simple. They go up for sale September 23 – perhaps we’ll all be traveling on planes again by then.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech employees build amazing consumer-facing apps for the world. But for their internal communications, they are stuck using applications that don’t play well with one another.</p>
<p>This is a problem since most employees at a mid-sized or large-sized firm spend a fourth or third of their days on internal communication applications.</p>
<p>Now a San Francisco-headquartered startup is attempting to build a software that makes it much more convenient to engage with business services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gorattle.com">Rattle</a> is building a real-time and collaborative “connectivity tissue” to address the siloed nature of modern record-keeping and intelligence platforms, said Sahil Aggarwal, co-founder and chief executive of the eponymous startup, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“To use Salesforce, as an example, you are using it for two things: you’re writing data into Salesforce and you’re taking data out of it,” he explained. “What Rattle does is it enables you to send all the insights from Salesforce into a messaging platform and then lets you write data from within the messaging service back into Salesforce.”</p>

<p>Rattle’s use case extends to even more services. It can recognize phone calls and prompt individuals to log that and pursue that opportunity on Slack.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We started with integrating Slack and Salesforce, and now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">with their acquisition</a> the idea has definitely gotten validated. It’s extremely transformational for companies,” said Aggarwal, who got the idea about this startup at his previous venture when an application he built for the internal team received great feedback.</p>
<p>The startup, which launched its offering in March, is already seeing over 70% conversion rate among enterprises that have given it a try. Rattle has amassed over 50 customers including Terminus, Olive, Litmus, Imply and Parsely.</p>
<p>After implementing Rattle “[our] lead response time has gone down by 75% and key processes have sped up from days to minutes,” said Jeff Ronaldi, GTM Ops Manager at LogDNA.</p>
<p>The startup announced on Tuesday that it has raised a seed round of $2.8 million from Lightspeed and Sequoia Capital India. Amy Chang (EVP at Cisco &amp; Disney board member), Ellen Levy (early investor in Outreach), Jake Seid (early investor in Brex &amp; Carta), and Krish &amp; Raman (the founders of unicorn SaaS firm Chargebee) also participated in the round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Businesses worldwide are mired in processes &#8211; from sales to marketing, HR, IT, and more. With increased digitization and remote work, processes and adherence thereof are only going to diverge over time,” said Hemant Mohapatra, Partner at Lightspeed, in a statement. “The Rattle team impressed us by their unrelenting focus on the most important piece of this puzzle: the people caught in these processes. Rarely have we seen such intense customer love so early in a company&#8217;s life and are honored to go on this journey with Rattle together!&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup, which charges anywhere between $20 to $30 per user per month, plans to deploy the fresh funds to expand its product offerings including adding integration with more enterprise applications.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The voices on Amazon&#8217;s Alexa, Google Assistant and other AI assistants are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-09-in-pursuit-of-the-perfect-ai-voice.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">far ahead</a> of old-school GPS devices, but they still lack the rhythms, intonation and other qualities that make speech sound, well, human. NVIDIA has unveiled new research and tools that can capture those natural speech qualities by letting you train the AI system with your own voice, the company announced at the <a href="https://www.interspeech2021.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Interspeech 2021</a> conference.</p>
<p>To improve its AI voice synthesis, NVIDIA’s text-to-speech research team developed a model called RAD-TTS, a winning entry at an NAB broadcast convention competition to develop the most realistic avatar. The system allows an individual to train a text-to-speech model with their own voice, including the pacing, tonality, timbre and more.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RknIx6XmffA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Another RAD-TTS feature is voice conversion, which lets a user deliver one speaker&#8217;s words using another person&#8217;s voice. That interface gives fine, frame-level control over a synthesized voice’s pitch, duration and energy.</p>
<p>Using this technology, NVIDIA&#8217;s researchers created more conversational-sounding voice narration for its own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHnYvH1qtObE_PjzaAFqS_CpmumGx5cW" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">I Am AI video series</a> using synthesized rather than human voices. The aim was to get the narration to match the tone and style of the videos, something that hasn&#8217;t been done well in many AI narrated videos to date. The results are still a bit robotic, but better than any AI narration I&#8217;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this interface, our video producer could record himself reading the video script, and then use the AI model to convert his speech into the female narrator’s voice. Using this baseline narration, the producer could then direct the AI like a voice actor — tweaking the synthesized speech to emphasize specific words, and modifying the pacing of the narration to better express the video’s tone,&#8221; NVIDIA wrote.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is distributing some of this research — optimized to run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs, of course — to anyone who wants to try it via open source through the NVIDIA NeMo Python toolkit for GPU-accelerated conversational AI, available on the company&#8217;s NGC hub of containers and other software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Several of the models are trained with tens of thousands of hours of audio data on NVIDIA DGX systems. Developers can fine tune any model for their use cases, speeding up training using mixed-precision computing on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs,&#8221; the company wrote.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Octane, a metered SaaS billing system, helps vendors create a plan, monitor usage and charge in a similar way to Snowflake and AWS.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Software billing startup <a href="https://www.getoctane.io/">Octane</a> announced Tuesday that it raised $2 million on a post-money valuation of $10 million to advance its pay-as-you-go billing software.</p>
<p>Akash Khanolkar and his co-founders met a decade ago at Carnegie Mellon University and since then went off in different directions. In Khanolkar’s case, he ran a cloud consulting business and saw how fast companies like Datadog and Snowflake were coming to market and dealing with Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>He found that the commonality in all of those fast-growing companies was billing software using a pay-as-you-go business model versus the traditional flat-rate plans, Khanolkar told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>However, he explained that monitoring consumption means that billing becomes complicated: companies now have to track how customers are using the software per second in order to bill correctly each month.</p>
<p>Seeing the shift toward consumption-based billing, the co-founders came back together in June 2020 to create Octane, a metered billing system that helps vendors create a plan, monitor usage and charge in a similar way to Snowflake and AWS, Khanolkar said.</p>
<p>“We are API-driven, and you as a vendor will send us usage data, and on our end, we store it and then do real-time aggregations so at the end of the month, you can accordingly bill customers,” Khanolkar said. “We have seen contention between engineering and product. Engineers are there to create core plans, so we built a no-code experience for product teams to be able to create new price plans and then perform changes, like adding coupons.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Within the global cloud billing market, which is expected to reach $6.5 billion by 2025, there are a set of Octane competitors, like Chargebee and Zuora, that Khanolkar said are tackling the subscription management side and succeeding in the past several years. Now there is a usage and consumption-based world coming and a whole new set of software businesses, like Octane, coming in to succeed there.</p>
<p>The new round of funding was led by Basis Set Ventures and included Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi, Github CTO Jason Warner, Fortress CTO Assunta Gaglione, Scale AI CRO Chetan Chaudhary, former Twilio executive Evan Cummack, Esteban Reyes, Abstraction Capital and Script Capital.</p>
<p>“With the rise of product-led growth and usage-based pricing models, usage-based billing is a critical and foundational piece of infrastructure that has been simply missing,&#8221; said Chang Xu, partner at Basis Set Ventures, via email. &#8220;At the same time, it’s something that every department cares about as it’s your revenue. Many later-stage companies we talk to that have built this in-house talk about the ongoing maintenance costs and wishes that there is a vendor they can outsource it to.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are super impressed with the <span class="il">Octane</span> team with their dedication to building a best-in-class and robust usage-based billing solution. They’ve validated this opportunity by talking to lots of engineering teams so they can solve for all the edge cases, which is important in something as mission critical as billing. We are convinced that <span class="il">Octane</span> will become an inevitable part of the tech infrastructure.”</p>

<p>The new funding will go primarily toward hiring engineers, as well as product, marketing and sales staff. Octane currently has seven employees, and Khanolkar expects to be around 10 by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The company is working with a large range of companies, primarily focused on infrastructure and the depth gauge industries. Octane is also seeing some unique use cases emerge, like a construction company using the usage meter to track the hours an employee works and companies in electric charging using the meter for those purposes.</p>
<p>“We didn’t envision construction guys using it, but in theory, it could be used by any company that tracks time — even legal,” Khanolkar added.</p>
<p>He declined to speak about the company’s revenue, but did say it now had two to three years of runway.</p>
<p>Up next, the company plans to roll out new features like price experimentation based on usage to help customers better make decisions on how to price their software, another problem Khanolkar sees happening. It will build ways that customers can try different plans against usage data to validate which one works the best.</p>
<p>“We are still in the early innings of consumption-based models, but we see more end users opting to go with an enterprise that wants to let them try out the software and then pay as they go,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft offered a broad “Holiday 2021” release date when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/microsoft-announces-windows-11-generally-available-by-the-holidays/">announced Windows 11, back in June</a>. Of course, it didn’t specify precisely which holiday. Perhaps the company was aiming for World Teachers’ Day, a belated Sukkot or an extremely early Halloween. After strongly implying a late-October release a few months back (which some pointing to the 20th), the company this morning announced that the operating system is set to arrive October 5.</p>
<p>The date is, undoubtedly, on the early side of Microsoft’s release window. The first major release since 2015 will be available as a free upgrade to users with an eligible PC running Windows 10. October 5 will also see the availability of the first systems shipping with Windows 11 preloaded.</p>

<p>Frederic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/the-first-preview-of-windows-11-is-now-available/">wrote up the first preview build</a> when it became available through the Windows Insider Dev Channel. He noted at the time, “This is definitely more than just another bi-annual Windows 10 update with a few minor UI changes.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the company fittingly offers an <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=176111">11 point blog post</a> highlighting the major changes that will arrive in the October update. The first – and most immediately apparent – is one that has been around since that earliest preview build. The operating system’s design has been refreshed for a cleaner feel throughout.</p>
<p>That includes new Snap Layouts, Groups and Desktops designed to offer a more organized approach to multitasking. A number of the company’s online services have been more deeply integrated into the OS. Microsoft 365 is built into the Start menu, offering up access to recently viewed files, for more cross-platform integration. Teams, meanwhile, has been added to the taskbar (Microsoft <em>really</em> wants you to use Teams, folks). You’ll find Widgets there, as well, with quick access to information like news, weather, sports and stocks.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yb63YJe_Vyg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are a range of accessibility updates. In <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/07/01/whats-coming-in-windows-11-accessibility/">a lengthy post from July</a>, Microsoft highlights those updates, noting, “Accessible technology is a fundamental building block that can unlock opportunities in every part of society. A more accessible Windows experience has the power to help tackle the “disability divide” — to contribute to more education and employment opportunities for people with disabilities across the world.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Store get a design upgrade, as well, and the company has promised more access for independent developers to create new tools for the operating system. The new version of Windows continues to offer a focus on desktop gaming, with features like e DirectX12 Ultimate, DirectStorage and Auto HDR.</p>

<p>There’s been some confusion around what, precisely, all of this means for unsupported machines of late – as well, as, frankly, which <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/24/preparing-for-insider-preview-builds-of-windows-11/">machines qualify as supported</a>. It was <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/windows-11-wont-offer-windows-update-on-unsupported-devices">reported earlier this week</a> that those systems that don’t fall within Microsoft’s parameters won’t get Windows Update when the new operating system is installed manually. That’s obviously a massive bummer, given that the utility deliveries security patches and other updates.</p>
<p>“The free upgrade to Windows 11 starts on October 5 and will be phased and measured with a focus on quality,” the company writes in this morning’s post. “Following the tremendous learnings from Windows 10, we want to make sure we’re providing you with the best possible experience. That means new eligible devices will be offered the upgrade first. The upgrade will then roll out over time to in-market devices based on intelligence models that consider hardware eligibility, reliability metrics, age of device and other factors that impact the upgrade experience.”</p>
<p>The company says it expects all qualified machines will be offered the upgrade by some point in mid-2022.

					<description><![CDATA[Quip is focused on growth, innovation and community building among its over 7.5 million customers in 100 countries.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Quip is on a mission to be the go-to platform for both personal and professional oral care, and a new $100 million cash infusion is giving the New York-based company fuel to do it.</p>
<p>The new round from Cowen Sustainable Investments (CSI), labeled a Series B, follows the company reaching profitability in April 2020 and gives Quip more than $160 million in total funding since the company was founded in 2015. Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/27/quip-raises-another-40-million-for-dental-care-products-and-services/">last publicly announced raise was $40 million</a> in 2018. The company showcased its service at TechCrunch Disrupt NY’s Startup Alley in 2015.</p>
<p>At that time, Quip was best known as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/04/quips-subscription-based-toothbrush-replacement-service-yes-really-raises-seed-funding/">subscription-based toothbrush replacement service</a>, but over the years has steadily taken on more of the <a href="https://emag.medicalexpo.com/the-global-dental-services-market-expected-to-grow-to-435-billion-in-2021-report/">$435 billion global oral healthcare market</a> by adding other products like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/quip-wants-to-help-you-floss/">flossers</a>, mouthwash, gum, smart electric toothbrushes and, most recently, a virtual orthodontist-enabled clear aligner service launched in April.</p>

<p>Company co-founder and CEO Simon Enever told TechCrunch that its long-term vision is to “build a lasting global business in the oral care category, and it is important to keep the business on the right scale.” Quip is focused on growth, innovation and community building among its over 7.5 million customers in 100 countries.</p>
<p>“The timing of this round, and raising such a significant round, was deliberate and strategic,” he added. “We wanted to prove a couple of things: that we create a high-profile, profitable core business that people know today, aligning the first pieces of the pie on our oral care app and then services, such as the clear aligner that we launched a couple of months ago.”</p>
<p>When Quip first launched and received funding six years ago, there were very few oral care startups and not much funding going into the space, Enever said. In fact, that was what led him to start the company in the first place — a dental visit eight years ago where he learned how little investment was being made to improve the space. Since then, more startups are innovating dental care and there is investment in both the personal care side and professional, especially in sub areas like orthodontics and appointment bookings, which Quip is working on, he added.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to further scale its personal care platform, which already has over 7.5 million users, and continue to connect them with a network of more than 50,000 dental professionals. It will also go into new verticals, expand its global footprint and roll out new features to its oral care companion mobile app.</p>
<p>Quip expects to reach over 1 million app users in 2022, Enever said. New features will complement the company’s mission to track oral habits, coaching and health monitoring. Members can then earn points by improving their habits and health and redeem them for products and discounts from Quip and other partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Enever also plans to double Quip’s 200-person team (located in New York and Salt Lake City) by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>“We had an amazing lean and driven team that has gotten us to the point where we are at now, and we are excited to scale that and have more support to take things to the next level,” he added. “It is incredible to watch the team. In the past few years, they hit their goals and launched four brand new personal care product lines, rolled out in Walmart and helped us become profitable. It has been amazing to watch the team despite the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Retail sales are up more than 100% compared to last year, according to the company. In addition to going into Walmart, the company’s products are also in Target, giving it over 10,000 retail locations.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Artem Mariychin, managing director at CSI, is joining the company’s board. CSI, an environmental sustainability focused growth investment strategy, looks for companies having a positive impact on the world’s environment, like addressing waste, which was one of the attractions to Quip, he said.</p>

<p>The company estimated over 100 million single-use plastic components were diverted from landfills through its paper packaging and refillable products recycling program. It aims to reach over 1 million pounds of plastic reduction or diversion in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Mariychin was also attracted to Quip’s growth versus other consumer companies and its ability to be capital efficient and also consumer-centric, something he said was unique in the oral care business.</p>
<p>“They aren’t expensive, but they are high-quality and solve consumer needs and pain points,” he said. “Simon’s origin was to improve brushing outcomes — only 50% of people brush twice a day now. However, with the brush built, they looked at what else they can do and expanded into the floss pick and mouthwash. What is impressive is that subscribers are now purchasing other products. Quip is now expanding into other parts of dental, like the liners, and that is atypical of others in e-commerce.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.walnut.io/">Walnut</a> raised $15 million in Series A funding, led by Eight Roads Ventures, to continue developing its sales experience platform.</p>
<p>Founders Yoav Vilner and Danni Friedland started the company in July 2020. Vilner told TechCrunch that while at a previous company, he was building a category called technology marketing in Israel. He realized that company sales people often ran into problems when it was time to demonstrate their product — the product would break, or they would have to ask another department to open something or add a feature, none of which happened instantaneously, Vilner added.</p>
<p>He and Friedland’s answer to that problem is a no-code platform for teams to create customized product demonstrations quickly, be able to integrate them into their sales and marketing processes and then generate insights from the demos.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195751" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195751" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2195751" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mock-engage.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="352" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mock-engage.jpg 1980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mock-engage.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mock-engage.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mock-engage.jpg?resize=768,397 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mock-engage.jpg?resize=680,352 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mock-engage.jpg?resize=1536,794 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mock-engage.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195751" class="wp-caption-text">Walnut engagement example. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walnut</p></div></p>
<p>“We let the sales and marketing teams replicate the SaaS product in our cloud environment, which is disconnected from the back end,” Vilner explained. &#8220;They can create a storyline to fit their customer and the demonstration, and then following the demo, sales leaders can get insight on what was good or bad. It encourages the sharing of knowledge and what story worked best for which kind of company.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company’s latest round gives it $21 million raised to date, and follows a $6 million seed round that included NFX, A Capital, Liquid2 Ventures and Graph Ventures, Vilner said.</p>
<p>Walnut serves over 60 business-to-business clients, including Adobe, NetApp, Varonis and People AI. In addition to Tel Aviv, the company has offices in New York and London.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vilner intends to use the new funding to grow the team across the U.S, Europe and Israel and continue developing its technology and platform, including tools to embed demos into a website for product-led growth. He also expects to double the team of 25 over the next year.</p>
<p>Eyal Rabinovich, an investor at Eight Roads Ventures, said his brother is a Walnut customer, and the company fits with one of the firm’s theses around broad vertically integrated brands in SaaS and deep technology.</p>
<p>Rabinovich was tracking the sales enablement space for a while and said many companies claim to provide something unique, but it is usually workflow and processes. In Walnut’s case, it is solving something at the core of sales.</p>
<p>“They make everything measurable, and the ‘holy grail’ is conversion, and even just 1% conversion could mean millions of dollars,” he added. “Every company we spoke to wanted to use this product. Customers were telling us they closed the sales cycle within two weeks.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify today is officially <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-08-31/how-spotifys-newest-personalized-experience-blend-creates-a-playlist-for-you-and-your-bestie/">rolling out</a> its shared playlist feature called Blend to global users, with a few changes. Earlier this summer, Spotify had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/spotify-rolls-out-new-personalized-experiences-and-playlists-including-a-mid-year-review-and-a-blended-mix-with-a-friend/">first launched</a> the new shared playlist experience into beta testing. The feature, which allows two people to combine their favorite songs into one shared playlist, uses the same music mixing technology that powers other multi-person playlists like Spotify&#8217;s <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/family-mix/">Family Mix</a> and <a href="https://support.spotify.com/ie/article/duo-mix/">Duo Mix</a>. However, Blend allows any Spotify user, including both free users and paid subscribers, to merge their musical tastes, too.</p>
<p>The feature has been further developed since its beta release, Spotify says.</p>
<p>Now, users who create a Blend (aka their shared playlist) will get something called a &#8220;taste match score&#8221; that shows them how similar or different their listening preferences are, when compared with their friends. After the Blend is created for the first time, this taste match score is demonstrated as a percentage and will be accompanied by text that tells users which song brings them together.</p>
<p>Blends will also feature new cover art to help users find their playlists more easily.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2196202" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="260" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png 3841w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png?resize=150,57 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png?resize=300,115 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png?resize=768,293 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png?resize=680,260 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png?resize=1536,587 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png?resize=2048,782 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Premium subscribers will get an extra perk, as well. On their version of a Blend, listeners will be able to see which of the user&#8217;s preferences contributed to each song on the playlist.</p>
<p>Spotify says during tests of Blend, Olivia Rodrigo took the top spot for the most-streamed artist on Blend playlists, followed by others like Doja Cat, Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, and Lil Nas X.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The feature isn&#8217;t only meant to be serve a fun addition to Spotify. It&#8217;s also a user acquisition strategy. Since free users are able to create or join a Blend, the feature can serve as a way to entice someone to join Spotify for the first time &#8212; even if they currently don&#8217;t pay for music, or if they subscribe to a rival service. But once they&#8217;re in Spotify&#8217;s app, they may decide to stay, the thinking goes.</p>
<p>Blend was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/spotify-rolls-out-new-personalized-experiences-and-playlists-including-a-mid-year-review-and-a-blended-mix-with-a-friend/">announced in June alongside</a> a new in-app experience called Only You, which focuses on your favorite music and how you listen &#8212; sort of like a mid-year version of Spotify&#8217;s popular annual retrospective, Spotify Wrapped. Like Only You, Blend includes support for social sharing. Users will be able to share Blend&#8217;s &#8220;data stories&#8221; across their social channels. This is the screen that pops up immediately after a Blend is created, but can also be accessed from any time within the Blend playlist itself.</p>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s bigger message with features like this, which are released at a fairly steady cadence, is about conveying to users and competitors alike that&#8217;s it&#8217;s further ahead when it comes to personalization technology. Even though rivals now dupe Spotify&#8217;s ideas for playlists, the company tends to have something new to release shortly after, whether that&#8217;s Only You, or a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/spotify-launches-your-daily-drive-a-personalized-playlist-that-combines-music-and-podcasts/">playlist aimed at commuters</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/spotifys-latest-personalized-playlists-are-designed-for-your-workouts/">those for the gym</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spotify-adds-three-new-types-of-personalized-playlists-with-launch-of-spotify-mixes/">a collection of new mixes based on artists, genres and decades</a>.</p>
<p>You can access Blend from the Made for You hub on Spotify&#8217;s mobile app. To get started, you&#8217;ll click &#8220;Create Blend&#8221; then &#8220;invite&#8221; to select a friend to join your Blend. When the friend accepts, Spotify will create the cover art, tracklists and display your taste match score. You can then click &#8220;Share this Story&#8221; to post your data story to your social networks.</p>
<p>Blend will begin rolling out to all users worldwide, starting today. Large-scale rollouts can take time, so you don&#8217;t see it immediately, just check back later.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the broader crypto world enjoys a late summer surge in enthusiasm, more and more blockchain developers who have taken the plunge are bumping into the blaring scaling issues faced by decentralized apps on the Ethereum blockchain. The popular network has seen its popularity explode in the past year but its transaction volume has stayed frustratingly stable as the network continues to operate near its limits, leading to slower transaction speeds and hefty fees on the crowded chain.</p>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s core developers have been planning out significant upgrades to the blockchain to rectify these issues, but even in the crypto world&#8217;s early stages, transitioning the network is a daunting, lengthy task. That&#8217;s why developers are looking to so-called Layer 2 rollup scaling solutions, which sit on top of the Ethereum network and handle transactions separately in a cheaper, faster way, while still recording the transactions to the Ethereum blockchain, albeit in batches.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Layer 2 landscape is early, but crucial to the continued scalability of Ethereum. As a result, there&#8217;s been quite a bit of passionate chatter among blockchain developers regarding the early players in the space. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Offchain Labs has been developing one particularly hyped rollup network called Arbitrum One, which has built up notable support and momentum since it beta-launched to developers in May, with about 350 teams signing up for access, the company says. </span></p>
<p>They&#8217;ve attracted some high-profile partnerships including Uniswap and Chainlink who have promised early support for the solution. The company has also quickly piqued investor interest. The startup tells TechCrunch it raised a $20 million Series A in April of this year, quickly followed up by a $100 million Series B led by Lightspeed Venture Partners which closed this month and valued the company at $1.2 billion. Other new investors include Polychain Capital, Ribbit Capital, Redpoint Ventures, Pantera Capital, Alameda Research and Mark Cuban.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196045" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196045" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2196045" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg 5472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196045" class="wp-caption-text">Offchain Labs co-founders Felton, Goldfeder and Kalodner</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a fairly lengthy ride for the Arbitrum technology to public access. The tech was first developed at Princeton &#8212; you can find a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpzrLOk4Zy0">YouTube video</a> where the tech is first discussed in earnest back in early 2015.  Longtime Professor Ed Felton and his co-founders CEO Steven Goldfeder and CTO Harry Kalodner detailed a deeper underlying vision in a 2018 research paper before licensing the tech from Princeton and building out the company. Felton previously served as the deputy U.S. chief technology officer in the Obama White House, and &#8212; alongside Goldfeder &#8212; authored a top textbook on cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>After a lengthy period under wraps and a few months of limited access, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the startup is ready to launch the Arbitrum One mainnet publicly, they tell TechCrunch.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This team&#8217;s scaling solution has few direct competitors &#8212; a16z-backed Optimism is its most notable rival &#8212; but Arbitrum&#8217;s biggest advantage is likely the smooth compatibility it boasts with decentralized applications designed to run on Ethereum, compared with competitors that may require more heavy-lifting on the developer&#8217;s part to be full compatibility with their rollup solution. That selling point could be a big one as Arbitrum looks to court support across the Ethereum network and crypto exchanges for its product, though most Ethereum developers are well aware of what&#8217;s at stake broadly.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;There’s just so much more demand than there is supply on Ethereum,&#8221; Goldfeder tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Rollups give you the security derived from Ethereum but a much better experience in terms of costs.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As artificial intelligence continues to weave its way into more enterprise applications, a startup that has built a platform to help businesses, especially non-tech organizations, build more customized AI decision making tools for themselves has picked up some significant growth funding. <a href="https://peak.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peak AI</a>, a startup out of Manchester, England, that has built a &#8220;decision intelligence&#8221; platform, has raised $75 million, money that it will be using to continue building out its platform as well as to expand into new markets, and hire some 200 new people in the coming quarters.</p>
<p>The Series C is bringing a very big name investor on board. It is being led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, with previous backers Oxx, MMC Ventures, Praetura Ventures, and Arete also participating. That group participated in Peak&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/peak-ai-nabs-21m-for-a-platform-to-help-non-tech-companies-make-ai-based-decisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B of $21 million</a>, which only closed in February of this year. The company has now raised $119 million; it is not disclosing its valuation.</p>
<p>(This latest funding round was <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/softbank-vision-fund-takes-stake-in-uk-ai-start-up-peak-12389426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored last week</a>, although it was not confirmed at the time and the total amount was not accurate.)</p>
<p>Richard Potter, Peak&#8217;s CEO, said the rapid follow-on in funding was based on inbound interest, in part because of how the company has been doing.</p>
<p>Peak&#8217;s so-called Decision Intelligence platform is used by retailers, brands, manufacturers and others to help monitor stock levels, build personalized customer experiences, as well as other processes that can stand to have some degree of automation to work more efficiently, but also require sophistication to be able to measure different factors against each other to provide more intelligent insights. Its current customer list includes the likes of Nike, Pepsico, KFC, Molson Coors, Marshalls, Asos, and Speedy, and in the last 12 months revenues have more than doubled.</p>
<p>The opportunity that Peak is addressing goes a little like this: AI has become a cornerstone of many of the most advanced IT applications and business processes of our time, but if you are an organization &#8212; and specifically one not built around technology &#8212; your access to AI and how you might use it will come by way of applications built by others, not necessarily tailored to you, and the costs of building more tailored solutions can often be prohibitively high. Peak claims that those using its tools have seen revenues on average rise 5%; return on ad spend double; supply chain costs reduce by 5%; and inventory holdings (a big cost for companies) reduce by 12%.</p>
<p>Peak&#8217;s platform, I should point out, is not exactly a &#8220;no-code&#8221; approach to solving that problem &#8212; not yet at least: it&#8217;s aimed at data scientists and engineers at those organizations so that they can easily identify different processes in their operations where they might benefit from AI tools, and to build those out with relatively little heavy lifting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There have also been different market factors that have also played a role. Covid-19, for example, and the boost that we have seen both in increasing &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; in businesses, and making e-commerce processes more efficient to cater to rising consumer demand and more strained supply chains, have all led to businesses being more open to and keen to invest in more tools to improve their automation intelligently.</p>
<p>This, combined with Peak AI&#8217;s growing revenues, is part of what interested SoftBank. The investor has been long on AI for a while; but it also has been building out a section of its investment portfolio to provide strategic services to the kinds of businesses that it invests in.</p>
<p>Those include e-commerce and other consumer-facing businesses, which make up one of the main segments of Peak&#8217;s customer base.</p>
<p>Notably, one of its big, recent investments specifically in that space was made earlier this year <em>also</em> in Manchester, when it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-thg-raise-1-bln-softbank-unit-fund-large-portion-2021-05-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took a $730 million stake</a> (with potentially $1.6 billion more down the line) in The Hut Group, which builds software for and runs D2C businesses.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“In Peak we have a partner with a shared vision that the future enterprise will run on a centralized AI software platform capable of optimizing entire value chains,&#8221; Max Ohrstrand, senior investor for SoftBank Investment Advisers, said in a statement. &#8220;To realize this a new breed of platform is needed and we’re hugely impressed with what Richard and the excellent team have built at Peak. We’re delighted to be supporting them on their way to becoming the category-defining, global leader in Decision Intelligence.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not clear that SoftBank&#8217;s two Manchester interests will be working together, but it&#8217;s an interesting synergy if they do, and most of all highlights one of the firm&#8217;s areas of interest.</p>
<p>Longer term, it will be interesting to see how and if Peak evolves to be extend its platform to a wider set of users at the organizations that are already its customers.</p>
<p>Potter said he believes that &#8220;those with technical predispositions&#8221; will be the most likely users of its products in the near and medium term. You might assume that would cut out, for example, marketing managers, although the general trend in a lot of software tools has precisely been to build versions of the same tools used by data scientists for these less technical people to engage in the process of building what it is that they want to use.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think it’s important to democratize the ability to stream data pipelines, and to be able to optimize those to work in applications,&#8221; Potter added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://kevala.com/">Kevala</a>, the startup that collects and analyzes energy grid infrastructure data for utility companies, renewable energy providers, EV charging companies, regulators and other energy industry stakeholders, has raised $21 million in a Series A round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it will use the funds to grow its team from 60 employees to around 100 by the end of 2021 and increase the deployment of its grid analytics tools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevala’s Assessor Platform, its interactive cloud-based grid analytics toolbox, allows a range of energy industry stakeholders to leverage massive quantities of data the company has collected from public sources, as well as from its clients, in order to predict and plan for things like “extreme weather events, renewable energy adoption and increasing demand from vehicle, building and industry electrification,” according to a statement released by the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, there is a greater range of energy sources and receptors than ever before. There&#8217;s also more extreme weather conditions, with the <a href="https://www.wwno.org/news/2021-08-29/mass-power-outages-reported-in-louisiana-hurricane-ida-could-leave-residents-in-dark-for-weeks">latest power outages in New Orleans due to Hurricane Ida</a> being a prime example of ways the current grid system falls short. Visualization software that uses AI to cross reference not only demand on the grid but also other relevant information, like demographics of a specific location, maps of electrical wires and locations of solar panels, is going to be essential for managing it all. Google’s moonshot arm, X, is starting to move into this space via a recent partnership with AES, an electricity distributor. The two will work together to </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aes-collaborates-with-x-the-moonshot-factory-on-new-grid-virtualization-technologies-to-accelerate-a-cleaner-energy-future-301346632.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">simulate and virtualize AES’s distribution grids in Indiana and Ohio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While Google has big business muscle behind it, Kevala has been working in this space since 2014 and is potentially poised to become an industry leader. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kevala has first mover advantage in providing comprehensive big data analytics on grid infrastructure,” said Zulfe Ali, managing partner at C5 Capital, in a statement. C5 Capital’s fund focused on data-driven technologies transforming critical infrastructure, C5 Impact Partners LP, led the Series A round alongside Thin Line Capital. Senior energy sector executives Tom Werner, current chairman and former CEO of SunPower Corp., and Mark Ferron, former California Public Utilities Commissioner, also participated in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re incredibly excited to partner with the company as it expands into new markets such as cybersecurity and national security, as well as new geographies outside of the United States,” continued Ali. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevala already has nearly the entire country mapped in terms of above-ground distribution infrastructure, and is working on expanding its coverage internationally. The company’s data set, which Kevala founder and CEO Aram Shumavon says is in the terabytes range, is largely sourced from publicly available data. That can mean data that’s observable from satellite imagery or found in building permits that allow the company to see things like where wind turbines are located or where rooftop photovoltaic (PV), or solar powered, systems are. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can take all the houses in a localized area, check it against the weather, and see what the energy consumption will be, what do we think the PV production would be for all of the PVs on those rooftops, and you can start to see how investments in different technologies will affect the overall loading and utilization of the grid and begin to better understand how resources could be utilized to drive cost savings, or alternatively, might increase the cost of that infrastructure as a whole,” Shumavon told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a walkthrough of Kevala’s dashboard, Shumavon explained how energy industry stakeholders might be able to, say, predict which neighborhood might see an increase in EV ownership based on household income and other demographics data. From there, visualizing the ratio of electricity to rooftop PVs to other renewable energy is helpful in predicting power usage, but Shumavon took it a step further by playing out a scenario of placing a battery in that location. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Automotive startup Upstream raises $62M Series C to scale cloud-based security&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/automotive-cybersecurity-startup-upstream-raises-62m-series-c-to-scale-cloud-based-security/embed/#?secret=XPgUDfmSQp" data-secret="XPgUDfmSQp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Could I reduce the cost of the grid in this area by limiting the need for building out new infrastructure in the form of wires, and instead shifting that load to another period of time?” said Shumavon. “And that savings can be also calculated for any investment that might be able to provide a similar service, whether it&#8217;s a battery or an investment in an energy efficiency measure, or potentially a rooftop PV system or a demand response program where you agree to not charge your car during peak hours.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s just one example of the types of analyses Kevala is performing everyday. The startup also hopes to increase its cybersecurity services to help protect grid infrastructure. Shumavon said one area Kevala is particularly interested in is third-party devices that have the ability to be compromised and potentially used to destabilize the grid. For example, someone with malicious intent might hack into thousands of IoT-connected washing machines and suddenly turn on all of the heating coils in the machine, creating a drastically increased load that can affect both the supply and demand of electricity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitoring a situation like this is usually outside the control of traditional utility control systems, but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shumavon says through overseeing energy use data, Kevala is able to observe anomalies and mitigate them when they happen, as well as plan for attacks on the horizon so stakeholders are ready with an appropriate response. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevala is also focusing on data privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing increasingly large amounts of information about end-use customers become potentially available when they use electricity and how advanced metering infrastructure, like smart meters, can contain very detailed information about when people consume electricity and how much,&#8221; said Shumavon. &#8220;Being able to make sure if those data need to be used by third parties that they&#8217;re not revealing information that would be considered personally identifiable is another area where we provide service, which is a strong corollary to cybersecurity work. We really see cybersecurity and privacy as two sides of the same coin.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a loved one with specialized care needs is incredibly challenging, but not something that people who have never had to deal with the issue would necessarily quite understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For anyone who has had to help care for someone with special needs, the lack of options out there to navigate finding access to care providers is almost shocking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twin sisters Melanie Fountaine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Melissa Danielsen know the problem firsthand, having</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helped take care of their brother, who had a developmental disability and severe epilepsy, for years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw the struggle for our family to find reliable care,” Danielsen told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After he passed away 12 years ago at the age of 29, the siblings decided they wanted to dedicate their careers to making disability care accessible to families with complex care needs. They founded Josh’s Place, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a company that provided group home accommodations and other services to adults across Minnesota, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which ended up being acquired by REM Minnesota in early 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair then came up with the concept behind </span><a href="https://joshin.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joshin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a digital care platform that aims to connect care providers to families with specialized care needs. (Both companies were named after the sisters’ brother, who was named Josh). And today, that startup is announcing it has closed on a $3 million seed round of funding co-led by Anthemis Group and The Autism Impact Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joshin started out as an app that creates a care plan that helps it match families to a “carefully vetted” trained caregiver. It has evolved to also include a corporate benefits program that involves Joshin partnering with companies who want to offer an inclusive care benefit to their employees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated one in five families have complex health needs, ranging from children with neurodivergence to dependent adults with developmental and physical disabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has only highlighted the need for support, making it even more difficult to find necessary care. As such, many people (most of which are women) are finding they have to leave jobs to become full-time caregivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For too long, people with special health needs and their families have been underserved and had fragmented access to disability care providers,” said CEO Danielsen.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As ADA turns 30, tech is just getting started helping people with disabilities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/as-ada-turns-30-tech-is-just-getting-started-helping-people-with-disabilities/embed/#?secret=DZJ5TBT0Z8" data-secret="DZJ5TBT0Z8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COO Fountaine says that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">historically the care economy has focused on children under 12, or adults over 65 &#8212; childcare and eldercare, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Joshin really is positioned to be the leader in that huge age gap that&#8217;s out there,” she said. “We work with people at all stages of life, and I think it’s unfortunate that until now, that’s been missing from the conversation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital in part to grow its network of care providers. It also aims to expand its corporate benefits program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re continuing to scale our technology to lessen the burden of caregiving responsibilities for employees and their families,” added Danielsen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past 12 months, Joshin’s community of members and caregivers has grown 200%. With the new funding, the startup plans to expand its services to Los Angeles and Seattle. It is currently operational in its home base of Minneapolis, Minn., Chicago and New York City.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joshin will be soft launching in 8 new markets over the next few weeks and hopes &#8220;to be national very soon,” Fountaine said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup is starting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with employers, and building up the data that it derives from that effort. Over the next year, it intends to partner with managed Medicaid organizations, and with both private and public insurance companies so that it &#8220;can get families access to this care, quickly,” said Danielsen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to make this to make quality care free for families who need it,” she told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Male, co-founder of the Autism Impact Fund, said his organization backs companies that are addressing unmet needs of the autism community. Finding, retaining, and coordinating care are three of the biggest hurdles that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their families face, according to Male.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Joshin has a proven ability to provide a reliable means to source caregivers with diverse skill sets and potential to serve as a platform for streamlining access to a variety of critical yet highly fragmented services for the special needs community,” he said. “Given the current insurance payer landscape and employer emphasis on DEI, Joshin is not only generating strong impact for a large disability market, but is a monetizable opportunity as both a reimbursable service and as a benefit to employees.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By partnering with employers, Male added, Joshin will help provide an environment of support that will allow “employees to quickly and easily access key resources and thus minimize downtime. “</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Jones, managing director at Anthemis, said his firm doubled down on its investment in the startup because it saw in its founders “one of the strongest examples of founder-market fit out there.” (Anthemis also led the company’s $1.6 million funding round in July of 2020).</span></p>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The progress that they have made since our last investment &#8211; coupled with the insights that they have collected &#8211; led us to believe that doubling down in this round was a no-brainer,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the complexity that comes with building technology in the space &#8220;makes the barriers to entry very high,” Jones added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The team&#8217;s grit, combined with their understanding of the problems and opportunities associated with disability-related care, set Joshin apart,&#8221; he wrote via email. &#8220;No other platform comes close in terms of having such specialized leaders at the helm, so it&#8217;s no surprise that corporates are lining up to add Joshin to their roster of employee benefits.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://humcapital.com/">Hum Capital</a> CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/blair-silverberg-4133775/">Blair Silverberg</a> thinks that the future of fundraising requires a return to old school Wall Street &#8211; sans the fraud.</p>
<p>Back in the day, he explained, people would go to Wall Street and request funding for different projects, such as a rail line from New Jersey to St. Louis or a new store. A banker would chat through all the financing options, analyze different tradeoffs, and eventually help business owners pick the best capital option for their goals.</p>
<p>“It was very, ‘let&#8217;s think about the problem we&#8217;re trying to solve, and then let’s make the financing fit,’” Silverberg said. “Today, we do the opposite.” Even with ample capital in the market, startup check-writing is still a game dictated by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/lunchclub-raises-4m-from-a16z-for-its-ai-warm-intro-service/">warm intros</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/dont-send-vc-a-cold-deck-ever-again-start-sending-video-pitches/">cold pitches, </a>and oftentimes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/the-story-behind-rent-the-runways-first-check/">sheer luck that the founder bugged the right person</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/how-to-fundraise-over-zoom-more-effectively/">the right way</a> at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/craft-your-pitch-deck-around-that-one-thing-that-can-really-hook-an-investor/">the right time.</a></p>
<p>Silverberg said the current climate forces founders and investors to do a “crazy adversarial dance” when it comes to partnerships, which feels “backwards.” He wants his startup, Hum Capital, to bring optionality back into the mix.</p>
<p>“The dream scenario is that any company in the world uses Hum to articulate what they’re trying to do with their mission, and then gets all the relevant forms of financing just sitting right there waiting for them to pick the one that makes the most sense,” he said. No term-sheets for term-sheets sake, but instead, Hum Capital can be a clear way to visualize and compare different financing options for a company’s goal.</p>
<p>The nod to nostalgia has helped the startup land fresh capitalization for the future. Hum Capital announced today that it has raised $9 million in a Series A round led by Steve Jurvetson’s Future Ventures. Jurveston was an early investor in SpaceX, Tesla and Memphis Meats, which Silverberg thinks symbolizes that “[Hum Capital is] an equally world changing company.”</p>
<p>At this stage, Hum Capital’s product is easy to explain: it uses artificial intelligence and data to connect businesses to the some available funders on the platform. The startup connects with a capital-hungry startup, ingests financial data from over 100 SaaS systems including Quickbooks, Netsuite and Google Analytics, and then translates them to the some 250 institutional investors on its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s a navigation engine for startups that aren’t sure whether they should go for venture debt, traditional VC, revenue-share financing options, or others. The average deal size is $6.4 million, but Hum can help founders access checks up to $50 million for their businesses.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196018" style="width: 947px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196018" loading="lazy" class="breakout  wp-image-2196018" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hum-digital.gif" alt="" width="937" height="527" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196018" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hum</p></div></p>
<p>Hum is free for startups and investors to use for data-sharing purposes and eventual connections. The startup makes money by charging a 2% marketplace fee on capital raised whenever a deal is closed through its platform.</p>
<p>Founders could theoretically use Hum to meet investors and then close the deal offline to avoid the 2% fee. Silverberg said that most users to-date don’t do this because they want to be repeat customers during future fundraises.</p>
<p>Hum’s biggest challenge is that it isn’t human. In venture, especially at the earliest stages, most check-writing comes down to an investor believing in a person’s ambition (and maybe their pitch deck). Hum leans heavily on data as a determinant of success, and while numbers don’t lie, it could mean early ideas with big ambition are left without options.</p>
<p>Silverberg argued that Hum isn’t meant to replace chemistry, but can work to make sure that the business makes financial sense for an investor. Meetings still matter, but with Hum, he thinks a founder and investor can spend the 30 minute meeting talking about mission and vision, and skip other basics of the business.</p>
<p>Fair rebuttal aside, Hum could be limited in the sorts of startups that it funds long-term. It doesn’t need to find ways to fit into traditional VC &#8211; since most businesses aren’t venture-bacable, but it will need to find a way to make sure high-quality investors consistently use the platform for deal flow. Today, much of the investment on the platform is classified as venture debt.</p>
<p>Early adoption suggests some early trends. Companies from 46 states have uploaded data to its Intelligent Capital Market (ICM) platform, and nearly half of all companies on the platform come outside of California and New York.</p>
<p>To date, the platform has helped facilitate more than $400 million in capital transactions across 150 fee agreements. The majority of that money moved between March and now, with customers including SecurityScorecard, Evolv AI and Flaviar.</p>
<p>Hum Capital’s raise is announced in a time where traditional financing feels challenged: Carta <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/carta-says-it-just-used-its-own-product-to-establish-a-new-and-far-higher-valuation-for-itself/'">just raised money off of a valuation it set for itself</a>, Brex launched <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/brex-launches-150-million-venture-debt-business">a $150 million venture debt business, </a>and Clearco, an alternative to VC, raised money from VCs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/">at an over a $2 billion valuation. </a></p>
<p>“[Resource allocation] as important as making the world multiplanetary, or global problems like climate change,” Silverberg said. “&#8230;We’re at the book sales stage of Amazon.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Owner.com provides a free online ordering, delivery and marketing platform for independent restaurants that puts them on a similar playing fields with large restaurant chains.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Independent restaurants don’t typically have the luxury to create their own online food ordering and delivery capabilities or negotiate for lower rates from legacy ordering platforms like the large restaurant chains do.</p>
<p>Here’s where <a href="http://www.owner.com/">Owner.com</a> comes in. The Beverly Hills-based company provides a free online ordering, delivery and marketing platform for independent restaurants that puts them on similar playing fields with the big guys. And unlike the legacy food delivery services, Owner.com restaurants own their customer data and can automate marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Adam Guild is the company’s 21-year-old co-founder and CEO, a high school dropout and a Thiel Fellow, who originally started by assisting his mother’s dog grooming business that was having difficulties attracting customers. After stepping in with some online marketing methods, her business grew, and later expanded into multiple locations. Guild then wanted to work with a bigger group of people and stumbled across restaurants while helping some clients create online landing pages.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Starship Technologies is bringing food delivery robots to four more US college campuses this year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/starship-technologies-is-bringing-food-delivery-robots-to-four-more-us-college-campuses-this-year/embed/#?secret=7m7nQXFI69" data-secret="7m7nQXFI69" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With consumer demand shifting to primarily online ordering and delivery over the past 18 months, <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-food-delivery/worldwide">online ordering revenue</a> is expected to double from $248 billion in 2020 to $449 billion by 2025. Ordering platforms like Doordash, Uber Eats and Grubhub <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/01/food-delivery-apps-calorie-labeling/">control 80% of orders</a> and typically charge between 20% and 30% per order to restaurants and additional fees to consumers.</p>
<p>In contrast, Owner.com is free for restaurants and charges customers a flat $4 fee when they order from the website. Guild explained that larger restaurant chains have the buying power to negotiate lower rates, while independent restaurants do not. With the inability to keep up, some <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/26/restaurants-bars-closed-2020-jobs-lost-how-many-have-closed-us-covid-pandemic-stimulus-unemployment/">110,000 restaurants in the U.S. closed in 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Guild initially bootstrapped his company, working with large restaurant chains, like P.F. Chang’s, drive online orders. Then the global pandemic hit. He ended up losing all of his revenue and had to let all of his employees go but one. To add to his bad luck, he was then rejected from Y Combinator and other accelerator programs.</p>
<p>“For the first three days, I was depressed,” Guild told TechCrunch. “I had spent two years building a company and now it was dead. In the same way we were disrupted, I began to think there was no better position to be in than a scrappy startup. I didn’t know what the next business would look like, so I started cold-calling restaurant owners, asking how I can be helpful and what type of technology they were looking for. Many of them told me that online ordering sucked, but if they didn’t solve it soon, they would go out of business.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One pivot and a year later with co-founder Dean Bloembergen, Owner.com closed on $10.7 million in seed funding led by SaaStr Fund, with participation from Redpoint Ventures and Day One Ventures, as well as a group of individual investors including Naval Ravikant, CNBC’s The Profit host Marcus Lemonis, The Kitchen Restaurant Group’s Kimbal Musk, DoNotPay founder Joshua Browder, Figma founder Dylan Field, The Chainsmokers and independent restaurant owners and customers of Owner.com.</p>
<p>Jason Lemkin, founder of SaaStr Fund, said restaurant SaaS was a space in which his firm was interested in investing, but thought it was a bit boring — there were already quite a few vendors in the space, like Toast and Grubhub, and most were just technology solutions. However, when he heard that Owner.com was a break-out company from the monotony, he said he had to take a look.</p>
<p>“The ability to own the customer relationship is that ultimate differentiation,” Lemkin said. “Their ultimate goal is to provide a robust technology platform to increase margins, have people order more and come back often.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Guild intends to use the new funding to continue product development and add new features like landing pages, the ability to make reservations and native apps for white-label service.</p>
<p>Since the launch last year, the company has reached a seven-figure run-rate and over 105% monthly revenue retention across over 700 restaurant locations, Guild said. To date, Owner.com has transacted over $18 million and helped its restaurant customers avoid paying $3 million to online order platform fees annually.</p>
<p>“It’s all about empowering the 40% of the restaurant industry that is run by people who started off in entry-level positions, and over the years, worked their way up to own the ‘American Dream,’ ” he added.</p>

<p>We had a few launches this week, including SpaceX&#8217;s first one after one of its longer recent pauses in activity. Astra hoped to have its first commercial payload mission go well, but instead it had one of the more visually interesting takeoff mishaps in private spaceflight.</p>
<h2>Astra&#8217;s launch drifts and then nearly recovers</h2>

<p>Astra&#8217;s launch from Kodiak, Alaska was its first attempt since it nearly reached orbit with a successful test last year. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/astras-first-commercial-launch-fails-to-reach-orbit/">engines all lit as planned, but almost as quickly, one of those went out and the result was a rocket that nearly toppled over,</a> before floating horizontally for a while, while the remaining engines redistributed power to ultimately start the vehicle climbing skyward.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s perhaps more impressive that the Astra rocket didn&#8217;t crash and burn right away, even if this was ultimately a failure. The rocket eventually climbed to an altitude of around 160,000 feet before Astra&#8217;s flight engineers issued an abort command and the vehicle returned safely to Earth after the engines cut off.</p>
<p>This was a disappointment because the mission was meant to be Astra&#8217;s first commercial flight, since it was carrying a simulated test payload on behalf of client the U.S. Space Force. But it also was still technically a test, and the company says it gathered a lot of valuable data from the roughly 2.5 minutes that the rocket was flying before the abort command was given.</p>
<p>While the newly public Astra&#8217;s share price took a hit on the news, I think the more instructive bit for the company&#8217;s long-term fortunes will be how long it takes to recover from this mishap and try again, and also what the result will be of that follow-up mission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>SpaceX breaks in its new landing barge</h2>

<p>SpaceX&#8217;s return to flight was another of the Commercial Resupply Services flights it performs for NASA to the International Space Station, and this one went smoothly as usual. The cargo included a new robotic arm for use on the station, as well as interesting experiments including live ants.</p>
<p>The launch also saw SpaceX use its new &#8216;A Shortfall of Gravitas&#8217; autonomous drone ocean landing ship for the first time. This is the third drone ship that SpaceX has in its fleet, and everything went smoothly with the landing for a successful recovery of the first stage booster used for the flight.</p>

<p>Blue Origin has launched its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/watch-blue-origin-launch-a-test-of-nasas-future-moon-landing-tech-live/"> 17th New Shepard reusable rocket mission</a>, though this one wasn&#8217;t as impressive as its last effort: No Jeff Bezos on board. Unlike that first human spaceflight, there weren&#8217;t any passengers in the capsule this go around, but there were a healthy collection of experiments.</p>
<p>One of those was a NASA experimental landing system component that&#8217;s going to be used eventually for the agency&#8217;s lunar landing vehicle. The interesting subtext here is that Blue Origin is actually suing the agency over its award process for the human lander contract, which selected SpaceX (and only SpaceX) as a lunar lander vehicle provider earlier this year.</p>

<p>Rocket Lab is now a public company, trading under the name RKLB on the NASDAQ after a SPAC merger. This is one of the largest private space companies yet to go public via any means, and our own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/peter-beck-on-rocket-labs-public-listing-debut-space-spacs-and-the-neutron-rocket/">Aria Alamalhodaei spoke to Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck</a> to get the low-down on the company and what it means to be a member of the public markets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ispace-unveils-bigger-moon-lander-capable-of-surviving-lunar-nights/">ispace is creating a larger lunar lander</a> that can make it through lunar nights. Its existing small lander design isn&#8217;t intended to last long in the dark, since its power reserves would deplete quickly and also the super low temperatures are not kind to most electronics.</p>
<h2>Join us at TC Sessions: Space in December</h2>
<p>Last year we held our first dedicated space event, and it went so well that we decided to host it again in 2021. This year, it&#8217;s happening December 14 and 15, and it&#8217;s once again going to be an entirely virtual conference, so people from all over the world will be able to join — and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">you can, too</a>.</p>
