										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A coalition of 35 consumer advocacy groups along with 64 experts in child development have co-signed a letter to Facebook asking the company to reconsider its plans to launch a<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13"> version of Instagram for children under the age of 13,</a> which Facebook has confirmed to be in development. In the letter, the groups and experts argue that social media is linked with several risk factors for younger children and adolescents, related to both their physical health and overall well-being.</p>
<p>The letter was written by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, an advocacy group that often leads campaigns against big tech and its targeting of children.</p>
<p>The group stresses how influential social media is on young people&#8217;s development, and the dangers such an app could bring:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;A growing body of research demonstrates that excessive use of digital devices and social media is harmful to adolescents. Instagram, in particular, exploits young people’s fear of missing out and desire for peer approval to encourage children and teens to constantly check their devices and share photos with their followers,&#8221; it states. &#8220;The platform’s relentless focus on appearance, self-presentation, and branding presents challenges to adolescents’ privacy and wellbeing. Younger children are even less developmentally equipped to deal with these challenges, as they are learning to navigate social interactions, friendships, and their inner sense of strengths and challenges during this crucial window of development,&#8221; the letter reads.</p>
<p>Citing public health research and other studies, the letter notes that excessive screen time and social media use can contribute to a variety of risks for kids including obesity, lower psychological well-being, decreased quality of sleep, increased risk of depression and suicide ideation, and other issues. Adolescent girls report feeling pressured to post sexualized selfies for attention from their peers, the letter said, and 59% of U.S. teens have reported being bullied in social media, as well.</p>
<p>Another concern the groups have is the use of the Instagram algorithm which could suggest what kids would see and click on next, noting that children are &#8220;highly persuadable.&#8221;</p>
<p>They also point out that Facebook knows there are already children under 13 who have lied about their age using the Instagram platform, and these users will be unlikely to migrate to what they&#8217;ll view as a more &#8220;babyish&#8221; version of the app than the one they&#8217;re already using. That means Facebook is really targeting an even younger age group who don&#8217;t yet have an Instagram account with this &#8220;kids version.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the concerns being raised, Instagram&#8217;s plans to compete for younger users will not likely be impacted by the outcry. Already, Instagram&#8217;s top competitor in social media today &#8212; TikTok &#8212; has developed an experience for kids under 13. In fact, it was forced to age-gate its app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/musical-ly-tiktok-fined-5-7m-by-ftc-for-violating-childrens-privacy-laws-will-update-app-with-age-gate/">as a result of its settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission</a>, which had <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/318207/musically-referred-to-ftc-for-allegedly-violating.html">investigated</a> Musical.ly (the app that became TikTok) for violations of the U.S. children’s privacy law <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule">COPPA</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook, too, could be in a similar situation where it has to age-gate Instagram in order to properly direct its <em>existing</em> underage users to a COPPA-compliant experience. At the very least, Facebook has grounds to argue that it shouldn&#8217;t have to boot the under-13 crowd off its app, since TikTok did not. And the FTC&#8217;s fines, even when historic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/ftc-sells-kids-privacy-cheap/">barely make a dent</a> in tech giants&#8217; revenues.</p>
<p>The advocacy groups&#8217; letter follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/markey-letter-instagram-kids/">a push from Democratic lawmakers,</a> who also this month penned a letter addressed to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to express concerns over Facebook&#8217;s ability to protect kids&#8217; privacy and their well-being. Their letter had specifically cited Messenger Kids, which was once<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20706250/facebook-messenger-kids-bug-chat-app-unauthorized-adults"> found to have a design flaw</a> that let kids chat with unauthorized users. The lawmakers gave Facebook until April 26 to respond to their questions.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/zuckerberg-confirms-instagram-for-kids-plans-at-congressional-hearing-on-misinformation/ar-BB1eYg9Y">confirmed Facebook&#8217;s plans</a> for an Instagram for kids at a Congressional hearing back in March, saying that the company was &#8220;early in our thinking&#8221; about how the app would work, but noted it would involve some sort of parental oversight and involvement. That&#8217;s similar to what Facebook offers today via Messenger Kids and TikTok does <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/tiktok-to-launch-parental-controls-globally-disable-direct-messaging-for-users-under-16/">via its Family Pairing parental controls</a>.</p>
<p>The market, in other words, is shifting towards acknowledging that kids are already on social media &#8212; with or without parents&#8217; permission. As a result, companies are building features and age gates to accommodate that reality. The downside to this plan, of course, is once you legitimize the creation of social apps for the under-13 demographic, companies are given the legal right to hook kids even younger on what are, arguably, risky experiences from a public health standpoint.</p>
<p>The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood also today launched a <a href="https://ccfc.salsalabs.org/noinstagramforkids/index.html">petition</a> which others can sign to push Facebook to cancel its plans for an Instagram for kids.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Is there less risk and more opportunities for VCs who are looking to back crypto and fintech startups?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinbase’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/coinbase-opens-at-381-per-share-valuing-the-crypto-exchange-at-nearly-100b/">direct listing</a> was a massive finance, startup and cryptocurrency event that impacted a host of public and private investors, early employees, and crypto-enthusiasts. Regardless of where one sits in the broader tech and venture world, Coinbase storming north of a $100 billion valuation during its first day of trading was the biggest startup happening of the year.</p>
<p>The transaction&#8217;s effects will be felt for some time in the public market, but also among the startups and capital that comprise the private market.</p>
<p>In the buildup to Coinbase’s flotation — and we’d argue especially after it released <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/inside-the-us-epic-first-quarter-venture-capital-results/">its blockbuster Q1 2021 results</a> — there was a general expectation that the unicorn’s direct listing would provide a halo effect for other startups in the space. Anthemis’ <a href="https://twitter.com/foxe_news">Ruth Foxe Blader</a> told The Exchange, for example, that “the Coinbase listing shows this great inflection point for crypto,” with another “wave” of startup work in the space coming up.</p>
<p>The widely held perspective raised two questions: Will the success of Coinbase’s direct listing bolster private investment in crypto-focused startups, and will that success help other areas of financially focused startup work garner more investor attention?</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Presuming that Coinbase’s listing will positively impact its niche and others around it is not a stretch. But to make sure we weren’t misreading sentiment, and to get deeper into the <em>why</em> of the concept, The Exchange reached out to venture capitalists who invest in the broader fintech world to get their take. We even roped in an analyst or two to round out our panel.</p>
<p>The answer is not a simple yes. There are several ways to approach investing in the cryptocurrency space &#8212; from buying coins themselves, to investing in mainstream-ish institutions like legal exchanges, to the more exotic, like supporting efforts on the forefront of the decentralized blockchain world. And while it is somewhat clear that most folks expect more capital to be available for crypto projects, it’s not clear where it may end up inside the market.</p>

<p>After yesterday&#8217;s examination of how blazingly hot the venture capital market looked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/expect-an-even-hotter-ai-venture-capital-market-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-nuance-deal/">in the first quarter</a>, we’re again trying to gauge the private market’s temperature. Let’s talk to some folks on the ground and hear what they are seeing.</p>
<h2>Are crypto startups less risky now?</h2>
<p>Coinbase’s direct listing floated a company that is worth more than all but two major blockchains, namely Ethereum and Bitcoin. Several other chains have aggregate coin values in the 11-figure range, but a 12-digit worth is still rare among crypto assets.</p>
<p>The scale of Coinbase’s valuation post-listing matters, according to <a href="https://markets.chainalysis.com/">Chainalysis</a> Chief Economist <a href="https://twitter.com/philip_gradwell">Phillip Gradwell</a>. Gradwell told The Exchange that “Coinbase’s $100 billion valuation today demonstrates that venture investors can make great returns from putting money into crypto companies, not just cryptocurrencies. That proof point is good for the entire ecosystem.”</p>
<p>More simply, it is now eminently reasonable to invest in the companies working in the crypto space instead of merely putting capital to work hard-buying coins themselves. The other way to consider the comment is to realize that Coinbase’s share price appreciation is steep enough since its 2012 founding to rival the returns of some coins over the same time frame.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cleocap.com/">Cleo Capital</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahKunst">Sarah Kunst</a> expanded on the point, telling The Exchange in an email that “it&#8217;s now credible to say you&#8217;re a crypto startup and plan to IPO [versus] having acquisition or ICO be the only proven exit paths in the U.S.”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://samurai-incubate-africa.asia/">Samurai Incubate</a>, a Tokyo-based venture capital firm, announced today it has closed its &#8220;Samurai Africa 2nd General Partnership&#8221; fund, totalling 2.026 billion yen (~$18.6 million)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the firm, the fund </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was oversubscribed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as it targeted 2 billion (~$18.4 million) and a total of 54 investors joined as LPs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One notable LP is the Toyota Tsusho Corporation, which has a diverse network across the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm founded <a href="https://www.mobility54.com/profile">Mobility 54</a>, a corporate venture capital (CVC) looking to invest $45 million into African mobility, logistics, and fintech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://il.linkedin.com/in/kentarosakakibara">Kentaro Sakakibara</a> founded Samurai Incubate,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and in 2018, the firm began investing in Africa by establishing a subsidiary called Leapfrog Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From August 2018, Samurai Incubate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invested $2.5 million in 20 African startups via the newly established firm. Then in June 2019, renamed itself Samurai Incubate Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Throughout our journey, we have focused on refining and optimizing our operating approach to maximize our value proposition to founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we might</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not always have been perfect. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the value we bring should go beyond capital and access to Japanese investors and corporations,&#8221; the firm said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sector-agnostic fund, Samurai Incubate Africa has already invested in 26 companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The six from this second fund include Eden Life, a tech-enabled home service startup; online loan marketplace Evolve Credit; energy startup Shyft Power Solutions; microfinance services for car lenders FMG; freight forwarding company Oneport; and online grocery platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pricepally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of Samurai&#8217;s companies are from three African countries &#8212; Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that will change going forward. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://jp.linkedin.com/in/rena-yoneyama-b27ba021">Rena Yoneyama</a>, the managing partner at the firm, Samurai Incubate Africa is joining Egypt to the list of countries it will target.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2018, Egypt has been witnessing outstanding ecosystem growth and is producing talent, startups and indigenous investors at a breathtaking pace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Samurai Incubate Africa, it&#8217;s only fair to tap into this growth because Egypt&#8217;s inclusion ensures the firm has startups in the Big Four &#8212; the continent&#8217;s top startup ecosystems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Egyptian startup ecosystem and its economy is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanding and we got to know that there are many talented founders and great investors in the country as well,&#8221; Yoneyama said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We already decided to make one investment into an Egyptian startup, and we know we&#8217;ll never regret it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Samurai first announced this fund back in January 2020, its ticket size was between $50,000 to $500,000. For pre-seed to seed rounds, startups got $200,000 or less. And for pre-Series A and Series A rounds, not more than $500,000. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> upon completing the fund, Samurai Incubate is extending the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">maximum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amount of investment to $800,000</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although sector-agnostic, the firm is particular about companies in fintech, insurtech, logistics, healthtech, consumer and commerce, energy, agritech, mobility and entertainment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese VC plans to invest in 30 to 40 new companies at the pre-seed and seed stage as well as follow-up pre-Series A and Series A investments in 7 to 10 existing portfolio companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Samurai Incubate is part of the growing list of Japanese VC firms like Kepple Africa and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/japans-uncovered-fund-launches-15m-fund-to-back-early-stage-startups-in-africa/">Uncovered Fund</a> targeting African startups.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If the eight person team behind the new startup <a href="https://hadrian.co/">Hadrian</a> has their way, they&#8217;ll have transformed the manufacturing industry within the next decade.</p>
<p>At least, that&#8217;s the goal for the new San Francisco-based startup, founded only last year, which has set its sights on building out a new model for advanced manufacturing to enable the satellite, space ship, and advanced energy technology companies to build the future they envision better and faster.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We view our job as to provide the world’s most efficient space and defense component factory,&#8221; said Hadrian founder, Chris Power.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Initially, the company is building factories to make the parts that go on rocket ships, according to Power, but the business has implications for any company that needs bespoke components to make their equipment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let me tell you how bad it is at the moment and what’s going to happen over the next 20 years. Right now everyone in space and defense, [including] SpaceX and Lockheed Martin, outsources their parts and manufacturing to small factories across the country. They’re super expensive, they’re unreliable and they’re completely invisible to the customers,&#8221; said Power. &#8220;This causes big problems with space and defense manufacturers in the design phase, because the lead time is so long and the iteration time is super long. Imagine running software and being able to iterate on your product once every 20 days? If you can imagine a Gantt chart of how to build a rocket, about 60% of that is buffer time… A lot of the delays in launches and stuff like that happen because parts got delivered three months ago. It’d be like running a McDonalds and realizing that your fries and burger providers could not tell you when the food would arrive.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to overstate the strategic importance of the parts suppliers to the operations of aerospace, defense, and advanced machining companies. As no less an authority on manufacturing than Elon Musk noted in a tweet, &#8220;The factory is the product.&#8221; It&#8217;s also hard to overstate the geopolitical importance of re-establishing the U.S. as a center of manufacturing excellence, according to Hadrian&#8217;s investors Lux Capital, Founders Fund, and Construct Capital. Which is one reason why they&#8217;re investing $9.5 million into the very early stage business.</p>
<p>&#8220;America made massive strategic mistakes in the early 90s which have left our national manufacturing ecosystem completely dilapidated,&#8221; said Founders Fund principal Delian Asparouhov. &#8220;The only way to get out of this disaster is to re-invent the most basic input into our aerospace and defense supply chains, machining metal parts quickly and with high tolerance. Right now, America&#8217;s most innovative company, SpaceX, relies on a network of near-retired machinists to produce space-worthy metal parts, and no one in technology is. focused on solving this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The factory is the product</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1348716679774265344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Power got to understand the problem at his previous company, Ento, which sold workforce management software to blue collar customers. It was there he realized the issue of. the aging workforce and the need for manufacturers to upgrade almost every aspect of their own technology stack. &#8220;I realized that the right way to bring technology to the industrial space is not to sell software to these companies, it&#8217;s to build an industrial business from scratch with software.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, Hadrian is focusing all of its efforts on the space industry, where the component manufacturing problem is especially acute, but the manufacturing capabilities the company is building out have broad relevance across any industry that requires highly engineered components.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The demand for manufacturing from both the large SpaceX and Blue Origin all the way to this growing long tail of companies from Anduril to Relativity to Varda,&#8221; said Lux Capital co-founder Josh Wolfe. &#8220;Most of these guys are using mom and pop machine shops… [and] those shops are horribly inefficient. They’re not consistent, and they’re not reliable. Between the software automation, the hardware, you can cut down on inefficiency every step of the process… I like to think of value creation as waste reduction… so mundane things like quoting, scheduling, bidding, and planning all the way to the programming of the manufacturing… every one of those things takes hours to tens of hours to days and weeks, so if you can do that in minutes, it’s just a no-brainer. [Hadrian] will be the cutting edge choice for all of the new and explicitly dedicated and focused aerospace and defense companies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Power envisions a network of manufacturing facilities that can initially cover roughly 65% of all space and defense components, and will eventually take that number up to 95% of components. Already several of the biggest launch vehicle and satellite manufacturers are in talks with the company to produce hundreds of units for them, Power said. Some of those companies just happen to be in the Construct, Lux, and Founders Fund portfolio.</p>
<p>And the company&#8217;s founder sees this as a new way to revitalize American manufacturing jobs as well. &#8220;Manufacturing jobs in space and defense can easily be as high paying as a software engineering job at Google,&#8221; he said. In an ideal world, Hadrian would like to offer an onramp to high paying manufacturing careers in the 21st century in the same way that automakers provided good union jobs in the twentieth.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We haven&#8217;t built any of this. If you look at the sheer number of people that we need to train and hire on our new technology and new systems, that people problem and that training problem is part of growing our business.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The race among mobility startups to become profitable by controlling market share has produced a string of bad results for cities and the people living in the them.</p>
<p>City officials and agencies learned from those early deployments of ride-hailing and shared scooter services and have since pushed back with new rules and tighter control over which companies can operate. This correction has prompted established companies to change how they do business and fueled a new crop of startups, all promising a different approach.</p>
<p>But can mobility be accessible, equitable and profitable? And how?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=tamika&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=tamika&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>, a virtual event scheduled for June 9, aims to dig into those questions. Luckily, we have three guests who are at the center of cities, equity and shared mobility: community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer <strong>Tamika L. Butler</strong>, Remix co-founder and CEO <strong>Tiffany Chu</strong> and Revel co-founder and CEO <strong>Frank Reig</strong>.</p>
<p>Butler, a lawyer and founder and principal of her own consulting company, is well known for work in diversity and inclusion, equity, the built environment, community organizing and leading nonprofits. She was most recently the director of planning in California and the director of equity and inclusion at Toole Design. She previously served as the executive director of the Los Angeles Neighborhood Land Trust and was the executive director of the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition. Butler also sits on the board of Lacuna Technologies.</p>
<p>Chu is the CEO and co-founder of Remix, a startup that developed mapping software used by cities for transportation planning and street design. Remix was recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/via-buys-mapping-startup-remix-for-100-million/">acquired by Via for $100 million</a> and will continue to operate as a subsidiary of the company. Remix, which was backed by Sequoia Capital, Energy Impact Partners, Y Combinator, and Elemental Excelerator has been recognized as both a 2020 World Economic Forum Tech Pioneer and BloombergNEF Pioneer for its work in empowering cities to make transportation decisions with sustainability and equity at the forefront. Chu currently serves as Commissioner of the San Francisco Department of the Environment, and sits on the city’s Congestion Pricing Policy Advisory Committee. Previously, Tiffany was a Fellow at Code for America, the first UX hire at Zipcar and is an alum of Y Combinator. Tiffany has a background in architecture and urban planning from MIT.</p>

<p>Reig is the co-founder and CEO of Revel, a transportation company that got its start launching a shared electric moped service in Brooklyn. The company, which launched in 2018, has since expanded its moped service to Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, Washington, D.C., Miami, Oakland, Berkeley, and San Francisco. The company has since expanded its focus beyond moped and has started to build fast-charging EV Superhubs across New York City and launched an eBike subscription service in four NYC boroughs. Prior to Revel, Reig held senior roles in the energy and corporate sustainability sectors.</p>
<p>The trio will join other speakers TechCrunch has announced, a list that so far includes Joby Aviation founder and CEO <strong>JonBen Bevirt</strong>, investor and Linked founder <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong>, whose special purpose acquisition company just merged with Joby, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/investors-clara-brenner-quin-garcia-and-rachel-holt-are-coming-to-tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">investors</a> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/clara-brenner" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Clara Brenner</strong></a> of Urban Innovation Fund, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/quin-garcia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Quin Garcia</strong></a> of Autotech Ventures and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/rachel-holt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Rachel Holt</strong></a> of Construct Capital and Starship Technologies co-founder and CEO/CTO Ahti Heinla.

<p>Xwing has scored another win two months after it completed its first gate-to-gate autonomous demonstration flight of a commercial cargo aircraft. The company said Thursday it has raised $40 million at a post-money valuation of $400 million.</p>
<p>The company is setting its sights on expansion – not only tripling its engineering team, but eventually running regular fully unmanned commercial cargo flights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Xwing has been developing a technology stack to convert aircraft, including a widely used Cessna Grand Caravan 208B, to function autonomously. But it’s had to solve a few problems first: “the perception problem, the planning problem and the control problem,” Xwing founder Marc Piette explained to TechCrunch. The company has come up with a whole suite of solutions to solve for these problems, including integrating lidar, radar and cameras on the plane; retrofitting the servomotors that control the rudder, braking and other functions; and ensuring all of these are communicating properly so the plane understands where it is in space and can execute its flight.</p>
<p>The company has already performed close to 200 missions with its AutoFlight system. For all these flights, there’s been a safety pilot on board. In addition, a ground control operator sits in a control center and acts as a go-between from the autonomous aircraft to the human air traffic control operator.</p>
<p>“We don’t anticipate automating [communication with air traffic control], trying to do natural language processing and having a computer make the response to the air traffic controller,” Piette said. “For safety critical applications, we don’t view that as a useful path. . .but what we do, though, is we have a ground operator in our control room that just talks to air traffic control on behalf of the aircraft. So for the air traffic controller, it’s seamless. As far as they&#8217;re concerned, they are just talking to a pilot onboard the aircraft.”</p>

<p>For its autonomous flight activities, the company has authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly under an experimental airworthiness certificate for research and development that was expanded in August of last year to include a special flight permit for optionally piloted aircraft (OPA).</p>
<p>The company is looking to eventually remove the safety pilot, but only once full safety redundancies are in place, Piette added. That includes redundancies across all sensors and computer systems. Fortunately for all of us that fly, commercial aviation safety levels are extremely high. It means a high airworthiness standard for aviation startups. Smaller Class III aircraft like the ones Xwing is targeting must demonstrate a risk of one catastrophic failure per hundred million flight hours.</p>
<p>Xwing’s activities have garnered attention from investors. This most recent funding round was led by Blackhorn Ventures, with participation from ACME Capital, Loup Ventures, R7 Partners, Eniac Ventures, Alven Capital and Array Ventures. Including this round, the company has raised $55 million in total capital.</p>
<p>The autonomous flights are only one part of Xwing’s business activities. It’s also been flying manned commercial cargo operations under a contract with a large logistics company signed December 1.</p>
<p>“We set up what’s effectively an airline,” Piette said. By modifying these aircraft with sensors to collect data, Xwing is able to feed this valuable flight time into a training algorithm, and collect other useful data, such as how often the pilots communicate with air traffic controllers and the types of directions the craft receives.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company will be significantly scaling its workforce over the next 12 months, in addition to increasing its commercial operations in parallel. On the technology side, Xwing is looking to fly autonomous commercial cargo flights, with a safety pilot onboard, under an experimental ticket and exemption from the FAA. The company will likely reach this milestone also within the next twelve months, Piette said. After that, it would look to remove the safety pilot from the aircraft. Even then, the company would still need to get its systems certified to completely remove any constraints on its movements in airspace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tecton.ai/">Tecton</a>, the company that pioneered the notion of <a href="https://www.tecton.ai/blog/what-is-a-feature-store/">the machine learning feature store</a>, has teamed up with the founder of the open source feature store project called <a href="https://feast.dev/">Feast</a>. Today the company announced the release of version 0.10 of the open source tool.</p>
<p>The feature store is a concept that the Tecton founders came up with when they were engineers at Uber. Shortly thereafter an engineer named Willem Pienaar read the founder&#8217;s Uber blog posts on building a feature store and went to work building Feast as an open source version of the concept.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea of Tecton [involved bringing] feature stores to the industry, so we build basically the best in class, enterprise feature store. [&#8230;] Feast is something that Willem created, which I think was inspired by some of the early designs that we published at Uber. And he built Feast and it evolved as kind of like the standard for open source feature stores, and it&#8217;s now part of the Linux Foundation,&#8221; Tecton co-founder and CEO Mike Del Balso explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tecton later hired Pienaar, who is today an engineer at the company where he leads their open source team. While the company did not originally start off with a plan to build an open source product, the two products are closely aligned, and it made sense to bring Pienaar on board.</p>
<p>&#8220;The products are very similar in a lot of ways. So I think there&#8217;s a similarity there that makes this somewhat symbiotic, and there is no explicit convergence necessary. The Tecton product is a superset of what Feast has. So it&#8217;s an enterprise version with a lot more advanced functionality, but at Feast we have a battle-tested feature store that&#8217;s open source,&#8221; Pienaar said.</p>
<p>As we wrote in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/tecton-ai-nabs-35m-series-b-as-it-releases-machine-learning-feature-store/">a December 2020 story</a> on the company&#8217;s $35 million Series B, it describes a feature store as &#8220;an end-to-end machine learning management system that includes the pipelines to transform the data into what are called feature values, then it stores and manages all of that feature data and finally it serves a consistent set of data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Del Balso says that from a business perspective, contributing to the open source feature store exposes his company to a different group of users, and the commercial and open source products can feed off one another as they build the two products.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we really like, and what we feel is very powerful here, is that we&#8217;re deeply in the Feast community and get to learn from all of the interesting use cases [&#8230;] to improve the Tecton product. And similarly, we can use the feedback that we&#8217;re hearing from our enterprise customers to improve the open source project. That&#8217;s the kind of cross learning, and ideally that feedback loop involved there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The plan is for Tecton to continue being a primary contributor with a team inside Tecton dedicated to working on Feast. Today, the company is releasing version 0.10 of the project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.casa-blanca.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casa Blanca</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to develop a “Bumble-like app” for finding a home, has raised $2.6 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CEO Hannah Bomze got her real estate license at the age of 18 and worked at Compass and  Douglas Elliman Real Estate before launching Casa Blanca last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She launched the app last October with the goal of matching home buyers and renters with homes using an in-app matchmaking algorithm combined with “expert agents.” Buyers get up to 1% of home purchases back at closing. Similar to dating apps, Casa Blanca’s app is powered by a simple swipe left or right.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samuel Ben-Avraham, a partner and early investor of Kith and an early investor in WeWork, led the round for Casa Blanca, bringing its total raise to date to $4.1 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York-based startup recently launched in the Colorado market and has seen some impressive traction in a short amount of time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching the app in October, Casa Blance has “made more than $100M in sales” and is projected to reach $280 million this year between New York and its Denver launch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bomze said the app experience will be customized for each city with the goal of creating a personalized experience for each user. Casa Blanca claims to streamline and sort listings based on user preferences and lifestyle priorities.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139196" style="width: 178px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139196" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2139196" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17.png?w=168" alt="" width="168" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17.png 1116w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17.png?resize=168,300 168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17.png?resize=768,1374 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17.png?resize=380,680 380w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17.png?resize=859,1536 859w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139196" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Casa Blanca</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People love that there is one place to book, manage feedback, schedule and communicate with a branded agent for one cohesive experience,” Bomze said. “We have a breadth of users from first time buyers to people using our platform for $15 million listings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike competitors, Casa Blanca applies to a direct-to-consumer model, she pointed out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While our agents are an integral part of the company, they are not responsible for bringing in business and have more organizational support, which allows them to focus on the individual more and creates a better end-to-end experience for the consumer,” Bomze said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casa Blanca currently has over 38 agents in NYC and Colorado, compared to about 15 at this time last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are in a growth phase and finding a unique opportunity in this climate, in particular, because there are many women exploring new, more flexible job opportunities,” Bomze noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to continue expanding into new markets, nationally and globally; enhancingits technology and scaling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we continue to grow in new markets, the app experience will be curated to each city &#8211; for example, in Colorado you can edit your preferences based on access to ski areas &#8211; to make sure we’re offering a personalized experience for each user,” Bomze said.</span></p>

Existing investors Base10 Partners and Gradient Ventures (Google’s AI-focused VC) also participated. This brings the company’s total financing to $54 million. The company will use the capital raised to accelerate product development. The previous $18M A round was led by Base10 and Google&#8217;s Gradient Ventures 9 months ago.</p>

<p>Launched in 2016, Chili Piper’s software for B2B revenue teams is designed to convert leads into attended meetings. Sales teams can also use it to book demos, increase inbound conversion rates, eliminate manual lead routing, and streamline critical processes around meetings. It&#8217;s used by Intuit, Twilio, Forrester, Spotify, and Gong.</p>
<p>Chili Piper has a number of different tools for businesses to schedule and calendar accountments, but its key USP is in its use by ‘inbound SDR Sales Development Representatives (SDR)’, who are responsible for qualifying inbound sales leads. It’s particularly useful in scheduling calls when customers hit websites ask for a salesperson to call them back.</p>
<p>Nicolas Vandenberghe, CEO, and co-founder of Chili Piper said: “When we started we sold the house and decided to grow the company ourselves. So all the way until 2019 we bootstrapped. Tiger gave us a valuation that we expected to get at the end of this year, which will help us accelerate things much faster, so we couldn&#8217;t refuse it.”</p>
<p>Alina Vandenberghe, CPO, and Co-founder said: “We’re proud to have so many customers scheduling meetings and optimizing their calendars with Chili Piper’s Instant Booker.&#8221;</p>
<p>The husband-and-wife founded company has was fully remote from day one, with 93 employees in 81 cities and 21 countries, long before the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>John Curtius, Partner at Tiger Global said: “When we met Nicolas and Alina, we were fired up by their product vision and focus on customer happiness.”</p>
<p>TJ Nahigian, Managing Partner at Base10 Partners, added: “We originally invested in Chili Piper because we knew customers needed ways to add fire to how they connected with inbound leads. We’ve been absolutely blown away with the progress over the past year, 2020 has been a step-change for this company as business went remote.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce is booming, but among the biggest challenges for entrepreneurs of online businesses are finding a place to store the items they are selling and dealing with the logistics of operating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyler Scriven, Maxwell Bonnie and Paul D’Arrigo co-founded </span><a href="https://www.saltbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an effort to solve that problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio came up with a unique “co-warehousing” model that provides space for small businesses and e-commerce merchants to operate as well as store and ship goods, all under one roof. Beyond the physical offering, Saltbox offers integrated logistics services as well as amenities such as the rental of equipment and packing stations and access to items such as forklifts. There are no leases and tenants have the flexibility to scale up or down based on their needs.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re in that sweet spot between co-working and raw warehouse space,” said CEO Scriven, a former Palantir executive and Techstars managing director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltbox opened its first facility &#8212; a 27,000-square-foot location &#8212; in its home base of Atlanta in late 2019, filling it within two months. It recently opened its second facility, a 66,000-square-foot location, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area that is currently about 40% occupied. The company plans to end 2021 with eight locations, in particular eyeing the Denver, Seattle and Los Angeles markets. Saltbox has locations slated to come online as large as 110,000 square feet, according to Scriven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup was founded on the premise that the need for “co-warehousing and SMB-centric logistics enablement solutions” has become a major problem for many new businesses that rely on online retail platforms to sell their goods, noted Scriven. Many of those companies are limited to self-storage and mini-warehouse facilities for storing their inventory, which can be expensive and inconvenient. </span></p>
<p>Scriven personally met with challenges when starting his own e-commerce business, True Glory Brands, a retailer of multicultural hair and beauty products.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We became aware of the lack of physical workspace for SMBs engaged in commerce,” Scriven told TechCrunch. “If you are in the market looking for 10,000 square feet of industrial warehouse space, you are effectively pushed to the fringes of the real estate ecosystem and then the entrepreneurial ecosystem at large. This is costing companies in significant but untold ways.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Saltbox has completed a $10.6 million Series A round of financing led by Palo Alto-based Playground Global that included participation from XYZ Venture Capital and proptech-focused Wilshire Lane Partners in addition to existing backers Village Global and MetaProp. The company plans to use its new capital primarily to expand into new markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s customers are typically SMB e-commerce merchants “generating anywhere from $50,000 to $10 million a year in revenue,” according to Scriven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He emphasizes that the company’s value prop is “quite different” from a traditional flex office/co-working space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our members are reliant upon us to support critical workflows,” Scriven said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides e-commerce occupants, many service-based businesses are users of Saltbox’s offering, he said, such as those providing janitorial services or that need space for physical equipment. The company offers all-inclusive pricing models that include access to loading docks and a photography studio, for example, in addition to utilities and Wi-Fi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company secures its properties with a mix of buying and leasing by partnering with institutional real estate investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These partners are acquiring assets and in most cases, are funding the entirety of capital improvements by entering into management or revenue share agreements to operate those properties,” Scriven said. He said the model is intentionally different from that of “notable flex space operators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have obviously followed those stories very closely and done our best to learn from their experiences,” he added. </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Everyone warns you not to build on top of someone else’s platform.</p>
<p>When I first started in VC more than 10 years ago, I was told never to invest in a company building on top of another company’s platform. Dependence on a platform makes you susceptible to failure and caps the return on your investment because you have no control over API access, pricing changes and end-customer data, among other legitimate concerns.</p>
<p>I am sure many of you recall Facebook shutting down its API access back in 2015, or the uproar Apple caused when it decided to change the commission it was charging app developers in 2020.</p>
<p>Put simply, founders can no longer avoid the decision around platform dependency.</p>
<p>Salesforce in many ways paved the way for large enterprise platform companies, being the first dedicated SaaS company to surpass $10 billion in annual revenue supported by its open application development marketplace. Salesforce’s success has given rise to dominant platforms in other verticals, and for founders starting companies, there is no avoiding that platform decision these days.</p>
<p>Some points to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 4,000 fintech companies, including several unicorns, have <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2021/01/plaid-raising-at-15bn-as-employees-pitched-1200-per-share/">built</a> their platforms on top of Plaid.</li>
<li>Recruiters may complain about the cost, but <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/articles/2017-05-05/how-headhunters-use-linkedin-to-find-talented-candidates">95%</a> still utilize LinkedIn.</li>
<li>More than 20,000 companies trust <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a> to be their system of record for customer data.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> powers over 1 million businesses across the globe.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.epic.com/">Epic</a> has the medical records of <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/epic/why_epic/">nearly 50%</a> of the U.S. population.</li>
</ul>
<p>What does this mean for founders who decide to build on top of another platform?</p>
<h2>Increase speed to market</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.postscript.io/">PostScript</a>, an SMS/MMS marketing platform for commerce brands, built its platform on Shopify, giving it immediate access to over 1 million brands and a direct customer acquisition funnel. That has allowed PostScript to capture 3,500 of its own customers and successfully close a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/postscript-raises-35m-to-give-shopify-stores-sms-superpowers/">$35 million Series B</a> in March 2021.</p>
<h2>Ability to focus on core functionality</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.varomoney.com/">Varo</a>, one of the fastest-growing neobanks, started in 2015 with the principle that a bank could put customers’ interests first and be profitable. But in order to deliver on its mission, it needed to understand where its customers were spending their money. By partnering with Plaid, Varo <a href="https://plaid.com/documents/varo-case-study.pdf">enabled</a> more than 176,000 of its users to connect their Varo account to outside apps and services, allowing Varo to focus on its core mission to provide more relevant financial products and services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the seemingly unending debate around <a href="https://substack.com">Substack</a> has focused on well-known writers with a national profile, the newsletter platform just announced that it will be supporting local (presumably non-famous) journalists through a new program.</p>
<p>The startup described <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/introducing-substack-local-for-a">Substack Local</a> as a $1 million initiative that will fund independent writers creating local news publications. Similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/substack-backlash/">the Substack Pro program</a>, the company will offer cash advances of up to $100,000, as well as mentorship and &#8220;subsidized access&#8221; to health insurance and design services. In exchange, Substack will take 85% of subscription revenue for a year (its cut goes back to the standard 10% after that).</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0KKTcoM5meemtYYmcPnnXXHk__cDB-2PTDc9VRid_MblpdA/viewform">Applications</a> are due by April 29, with participants selected by a panel of judges with their own Substack publications — Zeynep Tufekci of Insight, Anne Helen Petersen of Culture Study, Dick Tofel of Second Rough Draft and Rachel Larimore, managing editor of The Dispatch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Substack said that through this initiative, it&#8217;s also partnering with New Zealand-based <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz">Stuff</a> to launch two new publications covering under-served regions in the country.</p>

<p>A Substack skeptic might suggest that programs like this are an easy way to drum up positive publicity. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/facebook-local-news-2/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/google-announces-a-journalism-emergency-relief-fund-for-local-newsrooms/">Google</a> have also announced programs to support local news.) In Substack&#8217;s case, this comes after the platform has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/substack-backlash/">criticized for bankrolling transphobic writers</a> with big advances — just a few days ago, the company revealed that it has recently signed lucrative contracts with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/business/media/substack-newsletter-competition.html">transgender writers including Daniel Lavery</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of motivation, the need for more local journalism is real, with news deserts created by <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2018/about-1300-u-s-communities-have-totally-lost-news-coverage-unc-news-desert-study-finds/">the shutdowns and struggles of many local newspapers</a>. If there&#8217;s going to be any hope, it seems more likely to come from new, digitally-focused publications and independent journalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a grants program, nor is it inspired by philanthropic intent,&#8221; the company wrote in <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/introducing-substack-local-for-a">a blog post</a>. &#8220;Our goal is to foster an effective business model for independent local news that provides ample room for growth.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced this morning it will begin testing a new experience for discovering businesses in its News Feed in the U.S. When live, users to tap on topics they&#8217;re interested in underneath posts and ads in their News Feed in order to explore related content from businesses. The change comes at a time when Facebook has been arguing how Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency">App Tracking Transparency</a> update will impact its <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-facebook-clash-over-ads-small-businesses-fear-theyll-be-impacted-11618009627">small business customers</a> &#8212; a claim many <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/facebooks-misleading-campaign-against-apples-privacy-policy">have</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sorry-facebook-ios-changes-not-bad-for-small-businesses/">dismissed</a> as misleading, but nevertheless led some <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-facebook-clash-over-ads-small-businesses-fear-theyll-be-impacted-11618009627">mom and pop shops to express concern</a> about the impacts to their ad targeting capabilities, as a result. This new test is an example of how easily Facebook can tweak its News Feed to build out more data on its users, if needed.</p>
<p>The company suggests users may see the change under posts and ads from businesses selling beauty products, fitness or clothing, among other things.</p>
<p>The idea here is that Facebook would direct users to related businesses through a News Feed feature, when they take a specific action to discover related content. This, in turn, could help Facebook create a new set of data on its users, in terms of which users clicked to see more, and what sort of businesses they engaged with, among other things. Over time, it could turn this feature into an ad unit, if desired, where businesses could pay for higher placement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;People already discover businesses while scrolling through News Feed, and this will make it easier to discover and consider new businesses they might not have found on their own,&#8221; the company noted in a brief <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/new-facebook-tools-for-online-marketing">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook didn&#8217;t detail its further plans with the test, but said as it learned from how users interacted with the feature, it will expand the experience to more people and businesses.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139153" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139153" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2139153" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="579" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg 2360w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=300,255 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=768,653 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=680,579 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=1536,1307 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1743 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139153" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Along with news of the test, Facebook said it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/new-facebook-business-suite-features-including-stories">will roll out more tools</a> for business owners this month, including the ability to create, publish and schedule Stories to both Facebook and Instagram; make changes and edits to Scheduled Posts; and soon, create and manage Facebook Photos and Albums from Facebook&#8217;s Business Suite. It will also soon add the ability to create and save Facebook and Instagram posts as drafts from the Business Suite mobile app.</p>
<p>Related to the businesses updates, Facebook updated features across ad products focused on connecting businesses with customer leads, including Lead Ads, Call Ads, and Click to Messenger Lead Generations.</p>
<p>Facebook earlier this year announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-redesigns-pages-with-a-more-simplified-layout-and-no-like-button/">a new Facebook Page experience</a> that gave businesses the ability to engage on the social network with their business profile for things like posting, commenting and liking, and access to their own, dedicated News Feed. And it had removed the Like button in favor of focusing on Followers.</p>
<p>It is not a coincidence that Facebook is touting its tools for small businesses at a time when there&#8217;s concern &#8212; much of it loudly shouted by Facebook itself &#8212; that its platform could be less useful to small business owners in the near future, when ad targeting capabilities becomes less precise as users vote &#8216;no&#8217; when Facebook&#8217;s iOS app asks if it can track them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When I&#8217;ve written about <a href="https://www.stationhead.com">Stationhead</a> in the past, I&#8217;ve focused on how the startup aims to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/23/stationhead-on-demand/">bring the personality and interactivity of a live radio broadcast</a> to streaming music. But CEO Ryan Star said his ambitions are broader now: &#8220;We&#8217;re going to be the largest social audio platform in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup says it&#8217;s growing quickly, with 100,000 monthly active users — a number that&#8217;s increasing by 65% each month — and 500,000 total users. There are 6,300 hosts on the platform, and they created nearly 2 million live and recorded streams in the first three months of the year.</p>
<p>COO Murray Levison told me that the pandemic has brought more artists to the platform as they look for new ways to reach their fans. For example, Cardi B <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9542786/cardi-b-billion-dollar-woman-aspirations-rihanna/">joined the fan show Bardigangradio last month</a>, prompting 132,000 paid streams of her new single on Apple Music and Spotify during the broadcast. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/stationhead/">Stationhead integrates with both music streaming services</a> — when a DJ cues up a song, it&#8217;s actually playing through your account.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the same time, both Star (who co-founded the company due to his own frustrations as an independent musician) and Levison suggested that playing music is not quite as central to their vision as it used to be. Instead, they said Stationhead is all about live audio broadcasting, with or without music.</p>
<p>From a product perspective, Levison said they&#8217;re trying to build &#8220;the best broadcasting tools for creators and everyday people to use.&#8221; At the same time, he added, &#8220;Music is still at the core of what we’ve built. Just like games are to Twitch, music is our social glue.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1885415" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1885415" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1885415" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ryan-Star-CEO-Photo-credit_-Shervin-Lainez.jpg?w=680" alt="Ryan Star CEO Photo credit Shervin Lainez" width="680" height="489" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ryan-Star-CEO-Photo-credit_-Shervin-Lainez.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ryan-Star-CEO-Photo-credit_-Shervin-Lainez.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ryan-Star-CEO-Photo-credit_-Shervin-Lainez.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ryan-Star-CEO-Photo-credit_-Shervin-Lainez.jpg?resize=768,552 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ryan-Star-CEO-Photo-credit_-Shervin-Lainez.jpg?resize=680,489 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ryan-Star-CEO-Photo-credit_-Shervin-Lainez.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1885415" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shervin Lainez / Stationhead</p></div></p>
<p>While the company emphasizes the live experience (which Levison described as &#8220;the core value prop&#8221;), Stationhead also supports recording shows for listening later, and apparently 50% of users are listening to both live and recorded shows. It has also been beta testing a tipping feature that will allow broadcasters to monetize their shows.</p>
<p>Of course, you can&#8217;t talk about social audio without talking about Clubhouse, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/report-social-audio-app-clubhouse-has-topped-8-million-global-downloads/">attracting 2 million active users each week</a> in January, according to CEO Paul Davison. Levison suggested that the buzz around Clubhouse has also benefited Stationhead as potential acquirers and investors get more excited about social audio. And Star argued that the companies are taking very different approaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s in the name Clubhouse, it&#8217;s exclusive,&#8221; Star said. &#8220;It’s about social climbing and getting closer to the stage. [Stationhead is] living in the world where Cardi B was excited to meet her fans. We are for the 99 percent.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.feels-app.com">Feels</a>, a new French startup that wants to change how dating apps work. According to the company, scrolling through photos and reading descriptions tend to be a boring experience. Feels want to improve profiles so that navigating the app feels more like watching TikTok videos or browsing stories.</p>
<p>“For the past 10 years, there’s been little innovation in the industry,” co-founder and CEO Daniel Cheaib told me. “The reason why many people uninstall dating apps is that it’s boring. Profiles all look the same and we feel like we’re browsing a catalog.”</p>
<p>In that case, Cheaib is thinking about Tinder, but also other dating apps that feel like Tinder but aren’t exactly Tinder, such as Bumble, Happn, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Feels’ founding team has spent two years iterating on the app to find out what works and what doesn’t. Now that retention metrics are where they’re supposed to be, the company is now ready to launch more widely.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139135" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139135" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BRAND-feels-goodb.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the app Feels" width="1024" height="576" class="size-full wp-image-2139135" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BRAND-feels-goodb.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BRAND-feels-goodb.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BRAND-feels-goodb.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BRAND-feels-goodb.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BRAND-feels-goodb.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BRAND-feels-goodb.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BRAND-feels-goodb.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139135" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Feels</p></div></p>
<p>If you want to show interesting content to your users in a dating app, you have to rethink profiles. Arguably, this has been the most difficult part of the development phase. When you install the app, it takes around 15 minutes to create your profile.</p>
<p>At first, only 30% of new users finished the onboarding process. Now, around 75% of new users reach the end of the signup flow.</p>
<p>So what makes a profile on Feels different? In many ways, a profile looks more like a story, or TikTok posts. Users can record videos, add text and stickers, share photos, answer questions and more.</p>
<p>“When you’re done with the onboarding process, you have consistent profiles with people sharing content about them,” Cheaib said.</p>
<p>Like other dating apps, there are many options when it comes to gender identity — you’re not limited to woman or man. You can then say that you want to see all profiles or just some profiles based on various criteria.</p>
<p>After that, you can look at other profiles. Once again, Feels tries to change the basic interaction of dating apps. Most dating apps require you to swipe left or right, or give a thumbs up or a thumbs down. When you think about it, it’s a binary choice that requires a ton of micro decisions.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you don’t have any strong feelings about someone. Or maybe you just want to go to the next profile. And the fact that you have to triage profiles like this leads to a lot negativity, whether it’s conscious or subconscious —&nbsp;you keep rejecting people, after all.</p>
<p>When you’re looking at a profile on Feels, it fills up your entire screen. Videos start playing, you can see what the person likes and who they are in front of a camera. You can react on some content or you can simply move on by swiping up. There’s no heart or like button.</p>
<p>When the startup thought they finally were going somewhere, they raised a $1.3 million funding round (€1.1 million) from a long list of business angels, such as somebody in Atomico’s business angel program, Blaise Matuidi, Eric Besson, René Ricol, Ricardo Pereira , Yohan Benalouane, Nampalys Mendy, Julien Radic and Jean Michel Chami.</p>
<p>Now, Feels plans to attract new users with organic TikTok posts, some TV ads and more. The company wants to reach one million users by the end of the year with a big focus on France for now. There are 100,000 users right now.</p>
<p>When it comes to monetization, Feels started offering a premium subscription to unlock more features. The company is still iterating on that part.</p>
<p>Feels is just getting started in a crowded and competitive industry. Unlike other companies, Feels has invested heavily in its own product before working on user acquisition and paid installs. It’s an ambitious strategy but it has a lot of potential as it could lead to a truly different dating app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Graphic designer Paul Rand once famously said that the public was more familiar with bad design than good design. While he was referring to most of the design in the world being &#8220;bad&#8221;, these days that phrase might take on a second meaning: people typically only notice and talk about (and usually complain about) design when it is ugly, or works badly. Conversely, if it&#8217;s good, and it works, you don&#8217;t hear much.</p>
<p>Today a startup called <a href="https://www.userzoom.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UserZoom</a> that has built a platform used by companies like Google, Microsoft, PayPal, Salesforce and many others stay off the bad design radar &#8212; with tools to evaluate their design and identify where and when it doesn&#8217;t work, and how to link it up better with bigger customer experience strategies &#8212; is announcing some significant funding to expand its business.</p>
<p>The company has raised $100 million &#8212; money that CEO and co-founder Alfonso de la Nuez said will be used to continue building its tools and mission to make design as critical to a company&#8217;s mission as sales might be to an e-commerce company. Alongside this, it has made an acquisition, of another experience insights company called EnjoyHQ, to expand its research operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We feel companies are only scratching the surface of what they could be doing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We think experience management could become the third system of record, similar to ERP or CRM.&#8221;</p>
<p>This funding is being led by Owl Rock, with other unnamed investors participating. Prior to this, UserZoom raised some $34 million. It is not disclosing valuation, but de la Nuez notes that this latest investment represents a minority stake UserZoom, that the startup is profitable and grew revenues by 40% last year, and that it&#8217;s currently on an annual run rate of $80 million.</p>
<p>De la Nuez and UserZoom are currently based out of Los Gatos in the South Bay Area, but the company actually got its start in Barcelona, Spain, where de la Nuez and his co-founder Xavier Mestres originally ran a more old-school user experience design consulting company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had physical labs, testing sites, were we ran focus groups,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;It was tedious and manual.&#8221;</p>
<p>Years of working like that, and he and Mestres and a third co-founder who has since left the company, Javier Darriba, decided to see how and if they could retool the concept as a piece of software.</p>
<p>Their timing was perfect: It was 2007, the year of the iPhone debut, and the smaller screen of that device, and Apple&#8217;s prowess in nailing design and user experience, suddenly got the tech world (and the rest of the world) thinking about how they, too, could rethink their own digital experiences. You might think of it as an earlier iteration of the kind of digital transformation that people talk about today.</p>
<p>The company was growing in Spain at a time when it was much harder for startups to raise substantial rounds (I wonder if that would still be the case today, with companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glovo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/spains-wallapop-raises-191m-at-an-840m-valuation-for-its-classifieds-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wallapop</a> raising huge rounds in recent weeks). so UserZoom made the decision move to California, but Mestres, who is the CTO, still runs the startup&#8217;s engineering, design and customer support teams (100 out of 300 staff in all) out of Barcelona. The cost base of employing tech people in Spain are completely different from the Bay Area, &#8220;and it&#8217;s helped us become profitable,&#8221; de la Nuez said.</p>
<p class="p4">The core of the company&#8217;s product is a platform that runs what it refers to as &#8220;XIM&#8221; (Experience Insights Management), which lets customers test out any digital experience &#8212; be it something on the web, or a phone, or a smartwatch or an interactive voice service, and soon, other interfaces such as automotive. (And it&#8217;s a list that is likely to grow as more hardware and services are built.) It can recruit testers to evaluate design, product interaction, marketing decisions that the company is trying out, and so on.</p>
<p>That testing interface is essentially started as product development begins, the idea being that customers can apply the principle of &#8220;agile development&#8221; as they continue to work on the product, rather than leave all of that to be tested after a product is technically already completed.</p>
<p>As a company users UserZoom, the results of tests can be shared among different stakeholders who can make notes on how product development would work (or wouldn&#8217;t work) with how they are envisioning, say, a new sales strategy or engagement goal. It also helps develop KPIs for customers to determine how and if a design is meeting KPIs.</p>
<p>These can cover not just basic goals like &#8220;more conversions&#8221; or &#8220;less shopping cart abandonment&#8221; or &#8220;opting in to cookies&#8221; but also whether a design is meeting accessibility goals. (As seen with the <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/design/ravelry-rebranding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent controversy around Ravelry</a>, this is indeed a growing issue and one that de la Nuez said will be getting more attention at UserZoom.)</p>
<p>The space of UX and testing to improve it is a pretty crowded and well-funded one, with others in it including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/logrocket-lands-15m-series-b-announces-new-tool-to-track-customer-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LogRocket</a>, <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/about-us/press/press-releases/usertesting-announces-100m-funding-round" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UserTesting</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/contentsquare-series-d/">ContentSquare</a>, companies focusing on specific verticals, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/ab-tasty-raises-40-million-to-optimize-e-commerce-user-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AB Tasty</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/maze-raises-another-15-million-for-its-user-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many others</a>. What&#8217;s giving UserZoom an edge, it seems, is not just its extensive and impressive customer base, but its focus on trying to provide an end-to-end concept of design and experience and how it might fit in with a bigger business strategy.</p>
<p>“In today’s digital economy, the quality of the customer and user experience is the driving factor that helps businesses retain customers and generate increased revenue,” said Pravin Vazirani, managing director at Owl Rock, in a statement. “Despite this, many organizations are still unable to properly extract and manage the potential insights that lie within a customer journey. UserZoom enables companies to harness these insights and drive improved digital experiences.” Andy Lefkarites, an investor at Owl Rock said in a statement, “We see a tremendous market opportunity for UserZoom, which enables companies of all sizes and industries to continually enhance and prioritize their digital experience strategy. We are pleased to be able to support UserZoom with growth capital to enable them to seize that opportunity.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.olist.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace integrator, has raised $23 million in a Series D round extension led by new investor Goldman Sachs Asset Management that brings its total Series D financing to $80 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backer <a href="https://rpev.com.br">Redpoint eventures</a>, which first put money in Olist in 2015, also participated in the latest round. With this latest infusion, Olist has now raised over $126 million since its 2015 inception. This round is reportedly its last before the company plans to go public, according to Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank led the first tranch of Olist’s Series D in November as well as the company’s $46 million Series C in 2019. Valor Capital, Velt Partners, FJ Labs, Península and angel Kevin Efrusy had previously invested in the first tranche of the Series D. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olist connects small businesses to larger product marketplaces to help entrepreneurs sell their products to a larger customer base. The company was founded with the mission of helping small merchants gain market share across the country through a SaaS licensing model to small brick and mortar businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of October 2019, Olist had more than 7,000 customers and used a drop-shipping model to send products directly from stores to clients around the country, allowing them to grow with a capital-light model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Olist says its platform provides tools that support “all the stages of an e-commerce operation” with the goal of helping merchants see “rapid increases in sales volume.” It currently has about 25,000 merchants on its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup is no doubt benefiting from the pandemic-fueled e-commerce boom taking place all over the world as more people have turned to online shopping. Latin America, in general, has been home to increased e-commerce adoption. The region&#8217;s $85 billion e-commerce market is growing rapidly with projections of it <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/445860/retail-e-commerce-sales-latam/">reaching $116.2 billion in 2023</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As evidence of that, Olist says its revenue tripled to a record number in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the previous year, although it did not provide hard figures. It also reportedly doubled revenue in 2020, according to Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olist Store, the company’s flagship product, gives merchants a way to manage product listings, logistics and store payments. It also offers “a unique sales experience” through channels such as Mercado Livre, B2W and Via Varejo. The product saw a record GMV in the first half of the year, which was up 2.5 times over the same period in the prior year, the company said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Olist launched a new product, Olist Shops, giving users the ability to create a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">virtual showcase “in less than 3 minutes” that also offers payment checkout tools and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">integration with logistics operators. Shops has interfaces in Portuguese, English, and Spanish, and since its launch, it has attracted more than 200,000 users in 180 countries, according to Olist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pandemic has accelerated digitalizing business processes around the world, thus </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">spurring e-commerce growth in a surprising way,” said Tiago Dalvi, Olist’s founder and CEO, in a written statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to invest in technology and products, pursuing new mergers and acquisitions and boosting its internationalization process. This is on top of two acquisitions Olist made last year — Clickspace and Pax Logistica, which gave Olist entry into the heated logistics space with more than 4,000 registered drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, CFO Eduardo Ferraz said the company is in preliminary discussions with ERPs, retailers, and companies with complementary solutions to its own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is why we also decided to expand the investment in our Series D and bring Goldman Sachs as another relevant investor to our cap table,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Castelblanco, managing director and head of Latin America Corporate and Growth Equity Investing for the Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said his firm was impressed with how Olist empowers SMBs to generate more revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tiago and the Olist team are incredibly customer oriented and have created an innovative technological solution for their e-commerce clients,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olist is operating in an increasingly crowded space. In March, we covered </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">São Paulo-based </span><a href="https://www.nuvemshop.com.br/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/nuvemshop-latams-answer-to-shopify-raises-90m-in-accel-led-series-d/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$90 million raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was led by Silicon Valley venture firm Accel. That company has developed an e-commerce platform that aims to allow SMBs and merchants to connect more directly with their consumers. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you or a loved one has ever undergone a tumor removal as part of cancer treatment, you’re likely familiar with the period of uncertainty and fear that follows. Will the cancer return, and if so, will the doctors catch it at an early enough stage? <a href="https://c2i-genomics.com/">C2i Genomics</a> has developed software that’s 100x more sensitive in detecting residual disease, and investors are pouncing on the potential. Today, C2i announced a $100 million Series B led by Casdin Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The biggest question in cancer treatment is, ‘Is it working?’ Some patients are getting treatment they don’t benefit from and they are suffering the side effects while other patients are not getting the treatment they need,” said Asaf Zviran, co-founder and CEO of C2i Genomics in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, the main approach to cancer detection post-surgery has been through the use of MRI or X-ray, but neither of those methods gets super accurate until the cancer progresses to a certain point. As a result, a patient’s cancer may return, but it may be a while before doctors are able to catch it. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using C2i’s technology, doctors can order a liquid biopsy, which is essentially a blood draw that looks for DNA. From there they can sequence the entire genome and upload it to the C2i platform. The software then looks at the sequence and identifies faint patterns that indicate the presence of cancer, and can inform if it&#8217;s growing or shrinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“C2i is basically providing the software that allows the detection and monitoring of cancer to a global scale. Every lab with a sequencing machine can process samples, upload to the C2i platform and provide detection and monitoring to the patient,” Zviran told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C2i Genomics’ solution is based on research performed at the New York Genome Center (NYGC) and Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) by Dr. Zviran, along with Dr. Dan Landau, faculty member at the NYGC and assistant professor of medicine at WCM, who serves as scientific co-founder and member of C2i’s scientific advisory board. The research and findings have been published in the medical journal, </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0915-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Medicine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the product is not FDA-approved yet, it’s already being used in clinical research and drug development research at NYU Langone Health, the National Cancer Center of Singapore, Aarhus University Hospital and Lausanne University Hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When and if approved, New York-based C2i has the potential to drastically change cancer treatment, including in the areas of organ preservation. For example, some people have functional organs, such as the bladder or rectum, removed to prevent cancer from returning, leaving them disabled. But what if the unnecessary surgeries could be avoided? That’s one goal that Zviran and his team have their minds set on achieving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Zviran, this story is personal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I started my career very far from cancer and biology, and at the age of 28 I was diagnosed with cancer and I went for surgery and radiation. My father and then both of my in-laws were also diagnosed, and they didn’t survive,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zviran, who today has a PhD in molecular biology, was previously an engineer with the Israeli Defense Force and some private companies. “As an engineer, looking into this experience, it was very alarming to me about the uncertainty on both the patients’ and physicians’ side,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round of funding will be used to accelerate clinical development and commercialization of the company’s C2-Intelligence Platform. Other investors that participated in the round include NFX, Duquesne Family Office, Section 32 (Singapore), iGlobe Partners and Driehaus Capital.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some weeks are slim pickings when it comes to pulling together interesting robotics stories. This is, decidedly, not one of those weeks. In fact, it’s been a bit tough keeping up with the deluge of robotics activity over the past seven days. I’m going to take that very small sample size as purely anecdotal evidence that investment interest in the category is still white hot.</p>
<p>This is another one of those weeks where investment activity really spanned the entire range of robotics. Surgical, fulfilment and agriculture companies all received funding, along with some key partnerships in groceries and food delivery. All of that, plus underwater snake robots! What’s not to like?</p>

<p>We’ll start with this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/memic-raises-96m-for-its-robot-assisted-surgery-platform/">big Series D from Memic</a>. Following its recent FDA authorization (a huge step for any medical robotics company), the surgical robotics company announced a $96 million raise led by Peregrine Ventures and Ceros. The round more than triples the company’s existing funding of $31.8 million. The Hominis platform is currently designed for transvaginal procedures, though the company is looking to expand to additional surgeries.</p>
<p>A much smaller round for a much newer company, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210412005591/en/Interventional-Robotics-Startup-Moray-Medical-Boosts-Seed-Financing-to-5.7-Million">Moray Media just announced</a> a $5.7 million seed – a $3 million increase in the round it had reported earlier this year. The company’s Coral system is being designed for transcatheter mitral valve repair. Like many of these systems, the end goal is increasing the efficacy of procedures across a broad range of different operator skill sets.</p>
<p>Per co-founder and CEO Mark Barrish:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our Coral platform is designed to empower interventionalists at all skill levels not only to carry out these procedures but also to do so in a cost-efficient manner, with the goal of making certain that millions of additional sick patients who cannot be currently treated will get the life-saving intervention they need.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2138544" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2138544" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2138544" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PICKLE_teamphoto_01_front.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PICKLE_teamphoto_01_front.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PICKLE_teamphoto_01_front.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PICKLE_teamphoto_01_front.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PICKLE_teamphoto_01_front.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PICKLE_teamphoto_01_front.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PICKLE_teamphoto_01_front.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PICKLE_teamphoto_01_front.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PICKLE_teamphoto_01_front.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2138544" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pickle</p></div></p>
<p>On the warehouse/fulfillment side, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/mit-startup-pickle-raises-5-75m-for-its-package-picking-robot/">MIT startup Pickle</a> came out of stealth this week, telling TechCrunch that it raised $5.75 million. Silly pun name aside (not to mention a robot called “Dill”), the company says its tech is capable of 1,600 box picks per hour, an impressive number it claims is “double the speed of any competitors.”</p>
<p>As the seed round suggests, we’re still in quite early stages here. Still, it all seems to have come together quite quickly for the company. It’s opening up preorders on its picking system in June and expects to start shipping in early 2022.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gj92BsqF5Vo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Speaking of picking systems, RightHand Robotics <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/12/2208314/0/en/RightHand-Robotics-Introduces-Next-Generation-RightPick-3-Item-handling-Robot-System-at-ProMatDX.html">announced its third-gen robot</a>. The autonomous system is designed to be faster and pick a wider range of products than its predecessor. The former is certainly a high bar. Speed has long been one of the company’s standouts. The increase is due, in part, to a faster GPU capable of processing data at 6x the speed.</p>

<p>Two stories worth highlighting this week about robotics reaching a wider audience through service partnerships. On Monday, pizza giant Domino’s announced that it would be rolling out (so to speak) robotic delivery via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/dominos-nuro-to-begin-autonomous-pizza-deliveries-in-houston/">a partnership with Nuro</a>. Customers in Houston can get a pie delivered by the company’s R2 robot. Those buying pizza from the chain’s Woodland Heights location can actually specially request the &#8216;bot.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2138621" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2138621" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2138621 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2138621" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Kroger</p></div></p>
<p>Supermarket chain Kroger, meanwhile, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/kroger-launches-its-first-ocado-powered-shed-a-massive-robot-filled-fulfillment-center-in-ohio/?tpcc=ECTW2020">finally delivering on a deal with Ocado</a>, opening a massive warehouse just outside of Cincinnati. The company says the 375,000-square-foot space will employ 1,000 robots alongside 400 human workers. The location will service around 20 brick-and-mortar stores in the area.</p>
<p>On the acquisitions side, indoor farming company AppHarvest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/appharvest-buys-ag-robotics-firm-root-ai/">announced its intent to buy Root AI</a>. The $60 million deal finds AppHarvest picking up the Boston-based robotics startup with the intention of gaining access to the data gathering functionality of its crop harvesting tech.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="29zYPvWkAl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/appharvest-buys-ag-robotics-firm-root-ai/">AppHarvest buys ag-robotics firm, Root AI</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“Farming as we’ve known it is broken because of the increasing number of variables such as extreme weather, droughts, fire and contamination by animals that make our food system unreliable,” AppHarvest founder and CEO Jonathan Webb said. &#8220;Indoor farming solves for many of those challenges, and the data gathered can exponentially deliver more insights that help us predict and control crop quality and yield.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seattle-based Carbon Robotics this week <a href="https://carbonrobotics.com/">announced a massive weeding robot</a>. The Autonomous Weeder uses computer vision and lasers to get rid of some 100,000 weeds an hour. That certainly seems to fall under the “dull” distinction, and probably a nice win for farmers looking to eliminate undesired plants without the use of herbicides.</p>

<p>On the research side, it’s always fun to see when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/cmu-teaches-its-snake-robot-to-swim/">CMU figures out new uses</a> for its long-standing snake robot. Seems like each time I visit the campus, they’ve cooked up something new, but I’m a little sad not to have seen the project’s newfangled swimming abilities in person. The team is looking to deploy the tech for inspections on hard to reach underwater surfaces like submarines and the bottoms of boats.</p>
