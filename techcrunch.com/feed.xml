										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to engineering talent in the world of tech, demand continues to outpace supply, a predicament so acute that by 2030, that disparity will balloon to 85 million positions being unfilled, according to <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2019/03/global-competition-for-technology-workers-costa.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research from Korn Ferry</a>. Today, a startup that believes it can stem that tide with a more inclusive, global approach to sourcing, hiring and managing talent is announcing a big fundraise to continue building out its platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.turing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing</a> &#8212; which uses AI to source, evaluate, hire, onboard and then manage engineers remotely (including the HR and compliance aspects) in a bigger platform that it calls the &#8220;Talent Cloud&#8221; &#8212;  has raised $87 million, a Series D round of financing that values the startup at $1.1 billion. WestBridge Capital is leading the round, with previous backer Foundation Capital; new investor StepStone Group; and AltaIR Capital, strategic backer HR Tech Investments LLC (an affiliate of Indeed), Brainstorm Ventures, Frontier Ventures, Modern Venture Partners, and Plug and Play Scale Fund all also participating. The round was oversubscribed and so the company also opened up a <a href="https://www.contractscounsel.com/t/us/safe-note" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAFE note</a> at a $4 billion valuation, which is now also oversubscribed.</p>
<p>The funding comes on the back of strong growth for Turing. Demand from engineers in far-flung parts of the world who could not or did not want to relocate to work ramped up. Jonathan Siddharth, the founder and CEO, told me in an. interview that the total pool of candidates has grown 9x to 1 million engineers and developers from 140 countries in the last year, with that pool either looking for projects or already engaged in them. (Note: last year when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/turing-nabs-32m-more-for-an-ai-based-platform-to-source-and-manage-engineers-remotely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced $32 million in funding</a>, it told me it had 180,000 developers on the platform.) It covers some 100 technologies and 15 job titles currently, ranging from entry-level roles all the way up to engineering directors and CTO candidates, he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249823" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Popular requests are for full-stack engineers, those who specialize in front-end or back-end languages, and site reliability engineers. In the near future, Turing will expand into adjacent areas like project management, paving the way for an upcoming product where companies can engage entire teams on Turing, rather than individuals that are then potentially managed as teams.</p>
<p>Demand is also scaling on the platform. Customers span from technology companies through to non-tech companies that still need engineers to help run and build different aspects of their businesses. They include Johnson &amp; Johnson, Coinbase, Rivian, Dell, Disney, Plume, and VillageMD.</p>
<p>&#8220;We now live in a remote-first world and everyone is racing to reap the value of that,&#8221; Siddharth said.</p>
<p>Turing was founded on some basic premises about hiring and remote work that have borne out in the current market climate, shifted and altered perhaps permanently by Covid-19. Before the pandemic, working remotely was occasionally accepted but in many situations businesses actually built infrastructure not just to enable people to work together in office environments, but to encourage them to stay there for as many hours as possible, with free and excellent food at all hours, pool tables and other diversions, and even nap pods for when you did need a short kip.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This not only played out in entrenched ideas about office culture, but also impacted recruitment and hiring overall: you relocated for your job, and the company and you had to go through a major visa process to do so. And more often than not you were required to relocate to specific tech hubs like the Bay Area. This meant major strain on regional infrastructure, rent and bigger social make-up of cities and towns.</p>
<p>Now with Covid-19 totally changing the game, we&#8217;re collectively asking ourselves if all that was really necessary, in order to do work, and do it well.</p>
<p>Turing plays on all of that with a platform that effectively is providing a resounding &#8220;no&#8221; to those questions.</p>
<p class="p7">&#8220;Twitter, LinkedIn, Siemens, they are all going remote and the reasons are obvious,&#8221; he said. (Note: those are not named customers, just examples of companies going remote.) &#8220;You can now tap into a planetary pool of engineers, and smart people are looking where others are not. Also now we have more proven success of distributed teams.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not to say that remote management is easy: you need to build pipelines of engineers, you need to figure out how to evaluate them, and you need to stay communicated with them. Turing&#8217;s platform has been built, therefore, not just for sourcing but helping those at the company these other hard and soft skills. Most people come on board for fixed-term projects, Siddharth said, but some follow the path to taking on more extended, even permanent, roles at organizations. It&#8217;s not the only company addressing the talent gap.</p>
<p>Fiverr, Upwork, LinkedIn, and many others are also making it easier to find engineers wherever they might be, although what Turing has built covers more of the specialized end-to-end needs that arise around engaging them. (In that regard, it&#8217;s a little like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/superside-nabs-30m-to-connect-and-manage-freelance-creatives-working-with-in-house-marketing-and-design-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superside</a>, which raised money for its designer and creative talent hiring and management platform last week.)</p>
<p class="p3">“Turing’s ambitious vision of enabling fantastic opportunities for developers across the globe is inspiring,” said John Avirett, partner at StepStone Group, in a statement. “The Intelligent Talent Cloud truly is a remarkable way to democratize access and make lasting connections beyond inking the contract; they’re cultivating the process into long term career planning for the individual and the companies who use them.”</p>
<p class="p3">“Turing is productizing every leg of a massive industry and has forever changed its face and perception going forward,” added Ashu Garg of Foundation Capital.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today, we'll dig into Justworks' business, its economic performance and what it might be worth. Let's have a little IPO fun one last time this year!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The early 2022 IPO cohort is beginning to take shape. Recall that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/a-few-questions-about-the-impending-reddit-ipo/">Reddit recently filed to go public</a>, albeit privately. That&#8217;s going to be a huge debut.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/samsara-could-become-a-decacorn-in-upcoming-iot-themed-ipo/">Samsara closing out 2021</a> and Reddit set to ensure fireworks, we might be content. But there are more offerings coming, including Justworks: The HR software company <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001623414/000162828021025176/justworkss-1.htm">filed late last week</a>, so we&#8217;re going to tear into its S-1 to see just what the company has built.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TechCrunch has covered Justworks several times during its startup life, including when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/06/justworks-raises-40m-to-build-a-simpler-business-operations-suite/">raised a $40 million round back in 2018</a>. The former startup also <a href="https://justworks.com/about/press/archive/justworks-raises-50-million-series-e">closed a $50 million round</a> as 2020 kicked off, bringing its total known capital raised to just over $140 million. In addition, Justworks CEO Isaac Oates sat down with one of his investors and TechCrunch earlier this year to go over that 2018 Series B pitch deck.

At the time, our own Ingrid Lunden noted that HR software aimed at non-tech companies was having a moment.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;ll dig into Justworks&#8217; business, its economic performance and what it might be worth. Let&#8217;s have a little IPO fun one last time this year!</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s a &#8216;Justworks&#8217;?</h2>
<p>Justworks&#8217; software helps small businesses keep things running. What&#8217;s on offer? Things like payroll, vendor payments, payroll tax filings, unemployment insurance, accounting software and e-signature support.</p>
<p>A grab bag of tooling that, even at lower price tiers, allows SMBs to actually do the core work of being in business. The tech company also has more expensive plans that include access to health insurance products.</p>
<p>All told, Justworks sells its software on a per-employee, per-month basis, with set costs for companies up to 175 employees; past that, the company wants you to call them.</p>
<p>So, SMB-focused, HR-themed SaaS. That classification of Justworks helps us know what questions to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is Justworks a pure software company, or does its product require more human inputs that lower its gross-margin profile? (In simpler terms, how high-quality is its revenue?)</li>
<li>Does the company have churn under control? (In simpler terms, are SMB customers as churn-heavy as we&#8217;ve been historically warned by venture capitalists?)</li>
<li>Finally, does Justworks have attractive net retention metrics? (In simpler terms, how far can you upsell customers with limited employee footprints if you charge per worker?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore.</p>
<h2>Is it a good business?</h2>
<p>Yes? It&#8217;s certainly not a traditional software IPO, however.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s revenue mix contains software income <em>and</em> a huge chunk of low-margin insurance and benefits coverage. And Justworks has a history of profitability that we don&#8217;t see often.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon says it has fixed an issue with its Amazon Appstore that was causing issues with app launches for customers who had upgraded to Android 12 on their mobile devices. Earlier this month, reports began to circulate that Amazon&#8217;s Appstore was still not functional on Android 12 following its fall release. Users reported that not only did the Appstore itself not work, the apps and games they had installed from the Appstore also no longer worked.</p>
<p>The company had been responding to customer <a href="https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D56Q000087E2wvSAC/amazon-appstore-not-working-after-android-12-update">complaints</a> in Amazon&#8217;s digital and device forums, only to say that its technical team was still investigating the issue. But things came to a head when an article by <a href="https://liliputing.com/2021/11/android-12-launched-a-month-ago-and-amazon-appstore-still-wont-run-on-it.html">Liliputing.com</a> detailing the problems got traction and was picked up by a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-app-store-broken-android-12-173131316.html">wider</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811710/amazon-android-12-appstore-drm-issues">range</a> of news <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/19/amazon-appstore-is-broken-on-android-12/">sites</a>, forcing Amazon to publicly comment on the matter. It then said it was working on a fix that impacted &#8220;app performance and launches&#8221; that had affected the &#8220;small number of Amazon Appstore users that have upgraded to Android 12.&#8221; The company noted at the time the issue didn&#8217;t impact Amazon Fire TV devices or Amazon Fire tablets.</p>
<p>On Friday, Amazon said a fix has gone live, but did not detail what had gone wrong or how the issues had been addressed, more specifically.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249845" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have released a fix for an issue impacting app launches for Amazon Appstore customers that have upgraded to Android 12 on their mobile devices,&#8221; a company spokesperson said, in a statement shared with media. &#8220;We are contacting customers with steps to update their Appstore experience. We are sorry for any disruption this has caused,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>There had been some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811710/amazon-android-12-appstore-drm-issues">speculation</a> that the issues with the Appstore had been related to its built-in DRM and Android 12, given that one of the workarounds a user discovered involved decompiling the Android app APK file then commenting out the lines related to the DRM, among other technical steps. (Clearly, this was not a fix mainstream users could take advantage of, however.)</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s failure to address this issue for multiple weeks highlights how little traction its Appstore has on Android devices, where few users see any need to buy apps outside of Google Play, as well as how slow the Android upgrade cycle can be. It simply was not a priority for Amazon to address the issues with any sense of urgency, it seemed.</p>
<p>These days, Amazon&#8217;s focus with its Appstore is instead on how it can be used to deliver apps to Windows 11 users. Microsoft and Amazon this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/android-apps-are-coming-to-windows-11-through-the-amazon-appstore/">agreed</a> to partner on a new initiative that would allow Amazon to offer its third-party app store on the Microsoft Store, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/26/this-week-in-apps-android-apps-on-windows-11-app-store-search-ads-hit-china-apple-argues-against-sideloading/">allowing</a> Windows users to download Android apps to their PCs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">To be effective, each element of your brand’s ethos must be authentic. Your values must be aligned with your identity, your mission must match your purpose and your vision must be a moonshot that resonates with your team, your customers and, perhaps most importantly, with you as the founder.</p>
<p>A true ethos can’t be prescribed or copied. It must be extracted from the people building your company (sounds painful, I know). That’s where the visioning workshop comes in. A visioning workshop sequesters key players on your team in a room to dig deep into your collective motivations, inspirations and ambitions. It’s a collaborative, generative experience that surfaces the concepts that matter most to your brand and company.</p>
<p>Here’s how to do it:</p>
<p>Let the founder or CEO drive this process to signal the importance of the work. An outside facilitator could help you keep things on track, but the whole workshop can be DIY’d if budget is a concern.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Skipping ethos work is a costly mistake that produces a disjointed and rudderless brand, directly and negatively impacting the growth potential of the company.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>You should select five to six stakeholders for the working team, ensuring a cross section of perspectives in the room. Most early-stage companies will find it practical to include department leads and members of the founding team. This team will do most of the heavy lifting and is responsible for bringing insights from their respective areas.</p>
<p>Then, gather the team (preferably off-site to limit distractions) for at least a four-hour session to participate in a series of exercises, both individually and as a group. Make liberal use of a whiteboard (take pictures of the board as you go) and encourage note-taking. You might even consider making an audio recording of the session to reference later.</p>
<p>These exercises should be generative in nature, and you’ll use the results to prompt discussions and identify patterns.</p>

<hr />
<p>Here are three of the most effective ones for early-stage companies:</p>
<h2>Exercise #1: Is and will</h2>
<p>Deceivingly difficult, this one is great to start with, as it tends to inspire productive conversation. Give each team member 10 minutes to complete the two sentences below. Responses should be short, ideally less than ten words total. Then share the responses and discuss as a group for 20-30 minutes.</p>
<blockquote><p>“My company is…”</p>
<p>“My company will…”</p></blockquote>
<p>The intent of this exercise is twofold: The first phrase helps derive your company’s mission, which is your team’s daily focus. The second phrase helps derive your company’s vision, which is your direction and purpose.</p>
<h2>Exercise #2: Desired end state<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Who says the holiday week is a slow news week? Oracle was kind enough to help tech journalists weary from working on year-end stories with some big news today: The database giant announced it was buying electronic healthcare records company Cerner in a deal valued at $28.3 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oracle Corporation and Cerner Corporation today jointly announced an agreement for Oracle to acquire Cerner through an all-cash tender offer for $95.00 per share, or approximately $28.3 billion in equity value,&#8221; the company said in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oracle-buys-cerner-301448252.html">a press release</a>.</p>
<p>With this deal, Oracle moves in a major way into the healthcare vertical, a growing market, and one that should help bolster Oracle&#8217;s fledgling cloud infrastructure business, which is languishing in the single digits, <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/amazon-microsoft-google-grab-the-big-numbers-but-rest-of-cloud-market-still-grows-by-27">according to Synergy Research</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249842" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, said it&#8217;s the biggest deal in Oracle history, a company that has a long record of being acquisitive.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a smart move by Oracle. It cements Oracle technology even deeper into healthcare, and brings a lot of current and especially future work load to Oracle Cloud. Not to mention that Oracle is buying into the largest and fastest-growing vertical industry,&#8221; Mueller told me.</p>
<p>That growth potential certainly didn&#8217;t escape Oracle CEO Safra Catz. &#8220;Cerner will be a huge additional revenue growth engine for years to come as we expand its business into many more countries throughout the world. That&#8217;s exactly the growth strategy we adopted when we bought NetSuite—except the Cerner revenue opportunity is even larger,&#8221; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, however, that as Catz talks of international expansion, Microsoft made a similar play into healthcare earlier this year, when it announced it was acquiring Nuance Communications in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">a deal valued at $19.7 billion</a>. But that is facing headwinds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/cma-microsoft-nuance/">from regulators in the U.K</a>. It will be interesting to see if this deal runs into similar regulatory scrutiny as it advances next year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for Cerner, David Feinberg, president and CEO, who<a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/cerner-names-dr-david-feinberg-president-and-ceo"> just took over in the role</a> in October, saw an opportunity for shareholders and grabbed it. Of course, he frames the deal in the way most CEOs do &#8212; as a way to expand its markets in a way that wouldn&#8217;t be possible as a stand-alone company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joining Oracle as a dedicated Industry Business Unit provides an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate our work modernizing electronic health records (EHR), improving the caregiver experience, and enabling more connected, high-quality and efficient patient care,&#8221; Feinberg said in a statement.</p>
<p>Oracle stock was down 2.68% this morning on the news, while Cerner was up slightly at 0.92%.</p>
<p>For now, this announcement is the first in a series of steps, including an official filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Whether it makes it all the way to close in the current regulatory climate remains to be seen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/youtube-tv-warns-customers-they-may-lose-access-to-18-disney-owned-channels-by-weeks-end/">warned customers</a> they may lose access to Disney-owned channels on its YouTube TV streaming service by the end of the week if the two companies couldn&#8217;t come to a new carriage agreement. As of Friday, negotiations fell through and YouTube TV alerted customers it would have to drop Disney channels from its service and would lower its pricing for customers. But over the weekend, things turned around. On Sunday, YouTube <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-disney-programming-update/">announced</a> a new agreement had been reached, but it will still offer customers a $15 credit for the disruption.</p>
<p>YouTube updated <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-disney-programming-update/">its blog post</a> where it had been keeping customers informed about its contract dispute to say that it had reached a new agreement that will allow Disney to continue to stream its content on YouTube TV. That means the pricing for YouTube TV customers won&#8217;t drop down to the lower rate, as had been warranted when it looked like the channels would be removed. Instead, YouTube TV will continue at the usual rate of $64.99 per month.</p>
<p>The new deal will include Disney&#8217;s networks, like ESPN and FX, as well as Disney&#8217;s on-demand and live content, as before. Customers with recordings from Disney properties in their YouTube TV Library will also see those restored. And YouTube TV noted that users would see their local ABC stations return to the service by the end of the day on Sunday.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249837" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Had an agreement not been reached, YouTube TV customers would have lost access to a large number of streaming channels and on-demand content offerings. In total, 18 Disney-owned channels were impacted, including users&#8217; local ABC station, ABC News Live, The Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, Freeform, FX, FXX, FXM, National Geographic, National Geographic Wild, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3, ESPNU, ESPNews, SEC Network, and ACC Network.</p>
<p>YouTube had also <a href="https://tv.youtube.com/learn/disney2021-update/">promised</a> its members a $15 discount while Disney content remained off its platform, as a result of the contractual dispute. Even though Disney&#8217;s programming had only been removed for a day, YouTube announced on Sunday it will still honor a one-time credit for all impacted members.</p>
<p>Members who haven&#8217;t already received their $15 discount on their monthly bill will see it applied to their next bill. No action will be needed on members&#8217; parts to receive the credit. In addition, if customers had opted to cancel due to the failed negotiations, YouTube says they&#8217;ll be able to return by visiting the website (tv.youtube.com/membership), then clicking &#8220;add&#8221; to return the Base plan to their membership. Members who had paused their membership will receive the credit one month after their first charge, the company noted. Members who are in a paused state will receive this credit one month after their first charge. (More details are on <a href="https://tv.youtube.com/learn/disney2021-update/">a dedicated website.) </a></p>
<p>Only weeks ago, YouTube had been on the other side of the negotiations table in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/roku-and-google-reach-a-deal-for-the-continued-distribution-of-youtube-and-youtube-tv-on-roku-devices/">a contract dispute with Roku</a> over its YouTube and YouTube TV apps. This one was later resolved without either company sharing deals as to how they settled what had been serious allegations on Roku&#8217;s part about Google&#8217;s increased demands to use data and anticompetitive behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of Roblox hitting it big with its platform for user-created gaming content, another startup has landed a major round of funding to build out its own user-generated platform aimed at immersive experiences. <a href="https://rec.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rec Room</a>, a free to download and play cross-platform social gaming company, has raised $145 million, funding that it will use to continue building out its tools and audience of gamers using them to create their own experiences across mobile devices, game consoles, PC and VR headsets (operating systems/platforms supported include iOS, Xbox, PlayStation, Oculus, Steam and as of August Android).</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Coatue Management, with participation from existing investors Sequoia Capital, Index Ventures and Madrona Venture Group, and it is coming in at a $3.5 billion valuation.</p>
<p>This is a significant hike on its valuation earlier this year, in March, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/rec-room-raises-at-1-25b-valuation-from-sequoia-and-index-as-vcs-push-to-find-another-roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $100 million led by Sequoia at a $1.25 billion valuation</a>. In that period it has seen some very impressive growth. It noted 2 million people playing and creating content in March; now, it said it has 37 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249824" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The funding is coming on the back of very significant growth and scale for the Rec Room, amid a wider climate where suddenly a lot more attention is being focused on VR and immersive experiences, and specifically companies that are building content (or vehicles for content) that engage users in those mediums. (To be sure, one of the major sticking points up to now has been that there hasn&#8217;t really been enough compelling content to merit investment and use of clunky VR headsets and other bleeding-edge technology.)</p>
<p>Rec Room is a &#8220;social gaming&#8221; company in a couple of regards: the key to its growth, interestingly, has been not just the ability to create games and play those created by others and to join in rooms to play together (which is perhaps the most obvious &#8220;social&#8221; aspect), but the ability to provide a well-used, virtual social space for users to hang out in beyond gameplay.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other social gaming companies &#8212; which relied on other platforms like Facebook to carry out the social aspect of their gaming experiences &#8212; Rec Room says it&#8217;s already been used for virtual weddings, business meetings and more casual meetups, all activities that have most likely been given an extra virtual boost as a result the Covid-19 pandemic and the dampener that it has had on in-person social meetings and travel. That Rec Room provides a variety of experiences catering both to novices and more experience gamers gives it and its &#8220;Rec Life&#8221; concept a very low barrier to entry with both demographics of users.</p>
<p>Rec Room has been around for just five years (launched in 2016 in Seattle), and it has &#8212; at least for now &#8212; avoided the fast-rise/precipitous fall that has characterized so many other social gaming hits. It has now racked up 37 million users who build and play games in &#8220;rooms&#8221; where they virtually hang out with other users. There are some 12 million rooms on the platform already, Rec Room said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not clear how many active users there are out of that 37 million figure, Rec Room said that monthly user count has grown by almost 450% in the last year (since November 2020), and that mobile users are driving some of that growth, up tenfold in that period.</p>
<p>“It’s been amazing to watch Rec Room grow from a tiny collection of mini-games into a global platform with millions of experiences built by the community. The platform has become a place where people can come together to form meaningful connections, build communities, and share their creativity,” said Rec Room co-founder and CEO Nick Fajt, in a statement. “There’s still so much more we want to do, and as we head into 2022, we’re excited to build more experiences, expand to new platforms, invest in best in class trust and safety systems, and continue to expand our creator tools.”</p>
<p>The company is not disclosing any revenue figures today but back in March it said it was paying out some $1 million to games creators on its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We love the world Rec Room has created for friends to build and play together,” said Matt Mazzeo of Coatue Management in a statement. “From phones to VR, millions of players are hanging out in Rec Room, and we&#8217;re excited to partner with the team as they make the digital world more fun and immersive.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the pandemic forced remote work, school, and research to the forefront, decentralized clinical trials were probably on the horizon. Now, they’re here in earnest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, precision psychiatry startup Alto Neuroscience and Cerebral, an online mental health provider, announced that they’ve joined forces for a decentralized <a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05157945?term=Alto+Neuroscience&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=3">Phase 2 clinical trial</a> for Alto Neuroscience’s depression drug candidate – ALTO-300. The study will largely take place in patients’ homes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the project will recruit an estimated 200 volunteers from the Cerebral platform who are currently struggling with depression, and have seen no benefit from existing treatments. Alto Neuroscience, aside from providing the new drug, will also look to validate its approach to drug development: using patient biomarkers to predict what drugs patients will (or will not) respond to. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249444" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The idea that you would do deep phenotyping on a patient population and find out which subgroups of patients really benefit from the drug before you end up spending a billion dollars in clinical trials made all the sense in the world, but no one was doing it,” David Mou, the chief medical officer at Cerebral told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In a way it was a match made in heaven. We had what they needed, and I trust that their vision is going to be what’s most workable.” </span></p>
<h3><b>What’s interesting about decentralized clinical trials? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitions of a “decentralized clinical trial” </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrea-Coravos/publication/332599045_Decentralized_Trials_in_the_Age_of_Real-World_Evidence_and_Inclusivity_in_Clinical_Investigations/links/5f2748c992851cd302d57189/Decentralized-Trials-in-the-Age-of-Real-World-Evidence-and-Inclusivity-in-Clinical-Investigations.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vary slightly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but in essence, it means that care is brought to the patient in some form, either virtually or thanks to mobile clinicians. Data is also typically collected where patients are, rather than through regular visits to a study center.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bringing clinical trials to patients does have the potential to solve major problems currently facing clinical trials by making the process less cumbersome for patients. Nearly </span><a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2019/08/virtual-clinical-trials-a-new-model-for-patient-engagement#:~:text=Nearly%2070%20percent%20of%20potential,visits%20is%20not%20an%20option."><span style="font-weight: 400;">70 percent of clinical trial participants </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">live more than two hours away from a study center, for instance.

Finally, experts have suggested that bringing trials to patients </span><a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2019/08/virtual-clinical-trials-a-new-model-for-patient-engagement#:~:text=Nearly%2070%20percent%20of%20potential,visits%20is%20not%20an%20option."><span style="font-weight: 400;">might help</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> improve the diversity and accessibility of drug research. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This trial is far from the first decentralized clinical trial ever, but it does come during an inflection point for the field. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the pandemic only 38 percent of pharma and contract research organizations (CROs) </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/no-place-like-home-stepping-up-the-decentralization-of-clinical-trials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told McKinsey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that decentralized clinical trials would be a major part of their portfolios. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When McKinsey surveyed those same organizations again in 2020, 100 percent expected decentralized trials to play a large role. </span></p>
<h3><b>What this trial can tell us:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This trial has the potential to reveal a lot about the strength of data collected at-home, the FDA’s attitude towards that data, and whether decentralized clinical trials really solve problems site-based trials have faced for years in real life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collecting in-depth data is especially important for Alto Neuroscience’s drug development strategy. That’s because the company is based on developing unique, biomarker driven portraits of patients with mental health diagnoses, from EEG measurements to mood and emotion questionnaires. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re developing new drugs for various psychiatric disorders, with a focus on identifying who the right patient would be using brain tests or brain biomarkers,” Amit Etkin, founder and CEO of Alto Neuroscience told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What that means in this case, is that a core part of everything we do is try to make sure that our biomarkers identify, in the most generalizable way, the patients who will respond to our drugs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cerebral became an attractive partner for Alto Neuroscience’s upcoming trial for a few reasons. The first was that the company was able to quickly find a population that fit the specifics for the clinical trial: “We pulled out those 200 patients within an hour,” Mou said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the key piece was that Cerebral had already compiled a huge amount of data on patients and their clinicians – suggesting that they had capacity to collect the high quality of data that Alto Neuroscience needs. That includes data on patients who suffer from severe forms of depression (a category who are often not served by apps that fall into wellness categories). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Cerebral patients already regularly fill out questionnaires on symptoms and mood. The company also has data on physician prescribing patterns, which could provide insight into what’s working and what isn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because we&#8217;ve focused so much on high quality care, it forced us to create a data infrastructure on the back end to know much more about our patients and our clinicians than any other mental health provider in existence right now,” said Mou. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One lingering question is how the FDA will view data collected in a decentralized, even remote, way. That’s process is in development. I</span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/oncology-center-excellence/advancing-oncology-decentralized-trials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">n April</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for instance, the agency required oncology decentralized trials to label their datasets to distinguish which data was collected in-person, and what was collected remotely, for instance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This trial may offer a good point of comparison. Alto Neuroscience is actually currently running </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">two </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar clinical trials on ALTO-300: </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05157945?term=Alto+Neuroscience&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one with Cerebral</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05118750?term=Alto+Neuroscience&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another in the traditional site-based format</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strategy there, says Etkin, isn’t just to evaluate the effectiveness of ALTO-300. It tests the whole concept of a decentralized precision psychiatry clinical trial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Part of what we&#8217;re trying to do is also validate our approach for FDA so that we can show that what we&#8217;re getting in a decentralized approach is equivalent to what we&#8217;re getting in a site based approach,” said Etkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, there’s some evidence that this trial overcomes barriers associated with traditional clinical trials – like enrollment issues. But it’s not perfect. The patients in the Cerebral trial, for example, are still based in New York, Dallas or Atlanta, not exactly populations that live hours away from major medical centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Does it solve the problem of representation? Not completely,” notes Mou. “But I would say it&#8217;s a higher fidelity group: the chances they have true depression is much higher than going out there in the classic way and recruiting patients through brick and mortar clinics.” </span></p>
<p><b>From trial to commercialization:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both founders noted that decentralized trials could also pave the way for drug commercialization. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Mou notes that Cerebral could easily help deploy a drug to the patients who might benefit from it post approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Alto Neuroscience’s perspective Cerebral could be a conduit to helping bring mental health biomarkers into clinical practice – a longstanding issue when it comes to diagnosing mental health conditions. (Historically, mental health diagnoses have been made through observing behavioral symptoms, rather than medical tests. Though some researchers, and commercial companies like Alto Neuroscience have been seeking to </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/mental-disorders-precision-psychiatry-ddd2f6b2-9f93-4854-9ef7-f52bf82e6068.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">turn the field</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> towards diagnosis based on validated biomarkers.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A partner like Cerebral would be ideal for bringing our biomarkers, once approved, for medication into clinical practice, because their clinical care is so structured and well-tracked.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for this current trial, the companies expect to get a first readout by the end of 2022. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Users of Searchlight saw a 45% improvement in retention, 40% faster hire time and employees hired stayed on average 72% longer than when hired through other approaches.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Someone’s education and work history can be similar to other resumes in a pile, but <a href="https://www.searchlight.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Searchlight</a> aims to improve how companies measure a person’s soft skills to provide not only a differentiator, but also a better indicate of how well that person will ultimately fit into the organization.</p>
<p>Kerry Wang and her twin sister, Anna Wang, saw this problem firsthand when they tried to distinguish themselves when they applied for the same job. Kerry Wang told TechCrunch that she felt some interview processes didn’t enable enough time for them to fully demonstrate how they were different.</p>
<p>“Nearly half of all hires fail within 18 months, so we were inspired to change the current talent software that labeled us as the same person,” Kerry Wang said. “Right now, given ‘The Great Resignation,’ you can’t just hire fast, but you have to hire well to win the talent war. This is difficult when there is a gap in measuring the quality of hires.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249438" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>They started Searchlight in 2018 to develop technology that uses behavioral reference data and prescriptive analytics to give employers a more 360-degree view of a potential candidate’s strengths and weaknesses that might not appear on a resume or come out during an interview.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0TKkWzueR9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/how-my-company-is-winning-the-war-for-engineering-talent/">How my company is winning the war for engineering talent</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How my company is winning the war for engineering talent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/how-my-company-is-winning-the-war-for-engineering-talent/embed/#?secret=0TKkWzueR9" data-secret="0TKkWzueR9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Armed with this data before any interviews happen, companies using Searchlight’s new features in beta form in the last 12 months hired thousands of candidates, often with a faster process, less bias and better retention. In fact, users saw a 45% improvement in retention, 40% faster hire time and employees hired stayed on average 72% longer than when hired through other approaches, Wang said.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $17 million in Series A funding to expand their offerings to include one-click reference and candidate assessments that take less than 15 minutes, a quality of hire dashboard for greater visibility into how to improve future hiring and a “people science engine” that connects behavioral data collected pre-hire to employee outcomes as a way to show best practices for recruiting and highlight the profiles of high performers.</p>
<p>The latest round of funding was led by Founders Fund with participation from Accel, Shasta, Kapor Capital, Operator Collective and a group of angel investors including executives at companies like Coda, Confluent and Plaid. It gives the company total funding to date of $20 million, which includes a <a href="https://www.searchlight.ai/blog/seed-round-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.5 million seed round</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>Talent comes in all shapes and sizes, and Searchlight is the latest to see its approach backed by venture capital. Other recruitment technology companies recently announcing funding include fractional worker marketplace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/continuum-unveils-its-on-demand-access-marketplace-for-top-tier-executive-talent/">Continuum</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/hr-tech-startup-sense-valued-at-500-million-in-softbank-vision-fund-2-led-funding/">Sense</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/karat-raises-110m-on-a-1-1b-valuation-to-grow-its-technical-interviewing-as-a-service-platform/">Karat</a>.</p>

<p>Wang says her company is unique in the level of data and insights given to users as well as better recommendations. It is also able to show companies characteristics that they should be looking for in candidates and even disproves assumptions that companies have of their workforce makeup.</p>
<p>“You have to recognize what leads to success, and typically that is relying on your gut,” she added. “We create success profiles on what leads to retention based on soft skills.”</p>
<p>The company now works with moe than 60 companies, including Udemy, Talkdesk and Zapier, and has 15 employees, up from four last year. It’s customer base also more than tripled in the past year. Wang also shared that after using Searchlight, many of its customers are doubling down on their investment in the product.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to make additional hires to double the size of the team next year, and invest in product development and its go-to marketing strategy.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Founders Fund general partner Keith Rabois has joined Searchlight’s board.</p>
<p>Rabois said over his 20-year career of founding, funding and leading technology companies, the common denominator was the need for good people, saying, “The team you build is the company you build.”</p>
<p>“Searchlight resonated with me,” he added. “I have been on more than 15 boards, and every company talks about retention and what to do to improve retention. Constantly replacing talent can’t build a good company. I was always looking to improve myself and have the data and tools for me to get better. Searchlight offers the best data to make those hiring decisions.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The digital healthcare revolution has already begun, and it will gain further momentum in 2022 as providers and patients look for new and better ways to improve care. Companies with strong offerings, management teams and balance sheets are poised to capture tremendous value.</p>
<p>Healthcare deals were hot in the first nine months in 2021. They brought in a total of $21.3 billion in venture funding across 541 deals, dwarfing the previous record of $14.6 billion set in 2020, according to Rock Health.</p>
<p>But startups will continue to lead the way in innovation with the use of AI, IoT and data analytics, especially with data becoming the central currency of healthcare.</p>
<p>Given this environment, here are six emerging trends that we’re watching closely in 2022.</p>
<h2>Telemedicine will change how chronic conditions are treated</h2>
<p>The pandemic showed how telemedicine could change how we think about care interactions, with virtual visits increasing almost 40 times, according to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data from McKinsey</a>. Most of these interactions were centered around acute care. But for telemedicine to achieve its full potential, it will need to engage patients more frequently, especially for certain chronic conditions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The companies that succeed will be the ones that change the way patients interact with the healthcare system by building their entire operation around the patient experience.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Costs around chronic care are poised to rise as baby boomers age and put greater strain on the healthcare system. One chronic condition where telemedicine will play a larger role is diabetes. That’s why Teladoc Health, a leader in the space, acquired Livongo last year for $18.5 billion.</p>
<p>In 2022, entrepreneurs and investors are likely to expand telemedicine into more chronic care spaces like cardiology. Today, someone in the U.S. suffers a heart attack every 40 seconds, and heart disease costs the country about $219 billion a year. Telehealth offers a convenient, cost-effective way to diagnose and treat cardiovascular disease. For instance, with telehealth, even patients in remote or rural areas can gain access to cardiologists to get treatment without traveling far.</p>
<p>Overall, expect telehealth players to build their offerings across the chronic care landscape in a meaningful way in 2022.</p>
<h2>Digital therapeutics will rewrite the future of healthcare</h2>
<p>Digital therapeutics is perhaps the most innovative development in healthcare today and has the potential to dramatically change how care is delivered. More than any other area, this is the space where I believe we’ll see the most entrepreneurial and investment activity in the coming year.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Copywriting isn’t just about combining the right words to sell your product — it’s how your messaging connects with users. By improving a few words, your copy can better convince people to become customers.</p>
<p>At Demand Curve, we’ve helped thousands of startups get traction with their first customers and scale their growth. Along the way, we’ve noticed several common conversion mistakes on landing pages, ads, emails and elsewhere that make your copy less persuasive.</p>
<p>For better results, here are 10 common copywriting mistakes to avoid, plus, how to fix them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246462" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Writing in passive voice</h2>
<p>Whenever possible, write in the active voice. It emphasizes the subject of a sentence and generally makes your copy shorter and easier to follow.</p>
<p>Consider the difference between these two sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resolve all of your urgent issues with our product. (Active)</li>
<li>All of your urgent issues can be resolved with our product. (Passive)</li>
</ul>
<p>In marketing copy, active voice is especially important for describing your product benefits. Write them as action statements with your customer as the main character. Framing them in this way, rather than as things or experiences they receive, makes your product benefits easier to visualize.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Netflix: Watch anywhere. Cancel anytime. (Not “Content can be watched anywhere. Your subscription can be canceled anytime.”)</li>
<li>Goodreads: Meet your next favorite book. (Not “Your next favorite book is waiting to be discovered.”)</li>
<li>Mint: Put an end to late fees. (Not “Late fees will end.”)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more impact, use vivid and descriptive verbs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Generic wording</h2>
<p>Writer and literary critic F. L. Lucas famously suggested “writing to serve people rather than impress them.” Yet many copywriters use generic phrases like “#1 software,” “the best platform,” and so on to impress readers without actually providing helpful information.</p>
<p>As Lucas says, your copy should serve readers. This is best done by adding specificity. Avoid using generic wording, like hyperbolic claims, and instead speak to your readers’ exact needs.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Here are a few ways to add more specificity to your copy:</p>
<h3>Address the objection most relevant to your target persona</h3>
<p>Anticipate and then respond to how prospects might push back against your offer. Example: Audible promises “A friendly email reminder before your trial ends” — offering peace of mind to people wary of unexpected subscription charges.</p>
<h3>Use the second-person point of view</h3>
<p>Relate products directly to your audience. Example: “We’re always talking to couples like you,” the wedding planning company Zola’s <a href="https://www.zola.com/about/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about page</a> says. “You two are the heart of everything we do.” This makes Zola’s copy feel more like a personal conversation than if it were to refer more broadly to brides and grooms in the third person.</p>
<h3>Incorporate examples</h3>
<p>Think of scenarios where your product might be used, or how real customers benefited from your product. Examples help your prospect understand how your product fits into their world — notice how the examples in the last two bullet points provide a detailed point of reference for how to apply our tips.</p>
<h2>No defined goal or outcome</h2>
<p>Complex products often have a long sales cycle because there’s so much information prospects need to digest. This can result in copy that lacks clear next steps.</p>
<p>Effective copywriting moves people toward action. After all, it’s written for the sake of persuading. If there&#8217;s no outcome, it&#8217;s not copy; it&#8217;s literature.</p>
<p>To avoid this trap, work backward from your desired outcome: What you’d like your audience to do after reading your content. Make each sentence move the prospect closer to taking action.</p>
<p>The HR software company <a href="https://gusto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gusto</a> provides a good example here, using copy like:</p>
<p>“Our plans were built to fit your unique needs. Let’s start with a few quick questions.” — Two CTA buttons appear below this copy. One kickstarts a questionnaire; the other (“Learn More”) directs users to a detailed product page.</p>
<p>“Let’s find the right plan for your business.” — Under this text, users are prompted with a “Talk to sales” button.</p>
<p>“Step 1: Pick a plan that works for your business and budget.” — Gusto links to its pricing page, which includes a comparison table of its products.</p>
<h2>Misaligned motivation</h2>
<p>We like to think of ourselves as rational creatures, but the reality is we’re not. This is especially apparent in our consumption habits: We often buy with emotion but justify our purchases with logic.</p>
<p>What does this mean for your copywriting? You should build your copy around your prospects’ underlying desires and emotional motivations.</p>
<p>For example, take a look at the headlines used on Wix and Squarespace’s homepages.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246480" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246480" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2246480" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/11.png" alt="Screenshot of Wix's homepage" width="1024" height="614" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/11.png 1412w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/11.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/11.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/11.png?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/11.png?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/11.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246480" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>Wix’s headline, “Create a website you’re proud of,” taps into users’ desire for not just a website but a website that looks good.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246482" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246482" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2246482" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/22.png" alt="Screenshot of squarespace's homepage" width="1024" height="589" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/22.png 1411w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/22.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/22.png?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/22.png?resize=768,441 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/22.png?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/22.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246482" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>By comparison, Squarespace’s headline, “Everything to sell anything,” feels a lot less emotionally aligned with users’ goals. It’s trying to make the point that it offers a full suite of tools to sell any product or service (an example of using logical reasoning to persuade prospects).</p>
<p>But unless they own multiple businesses or sell a wide range of products, a lot of prospects might not actually need all those tools. Their bigger priority is creating an aesthetically pleasing site, which Wix immediately makes a case for with its headline.</p>
<h2>Complicated wording and jargon</h2>
<p>Readability describes how easy it is for someone to understand a piece of written text. When an article has low readability, it’s hard to understand and vice versa.</p>
<p>Why does this matter? Research shows that the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18811992/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average American best comprehends content</a> written at the seventh-grade reading level — the level of the average 12- or 13-year-old. Text that crosses over into anything higher becomes less understandable.</p>
<p>Your copy should never confuse readers or make them feel dumb. No one wants to spend time trying to read something, after all.</p>
<p>Consider how analytics tool Hotjar communicates what its software does on its <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/tour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product page</a>. It uses phrases like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how users really experience your site.</li>
<li>Visualize user behavior.</li>
<li>See where users click, move and scroll.</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of language is simple and easy to understand. It’s much more effective than phrases like “heatmapping and conversion funnel technology” or “website visualization software” — terms that can be overwhelming to readers new to analytics tools.</p>
<p>So write with the same vocabulary you’d use when talking with a 12-year-old. Use <a href="https://hemingwayapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hemingway App</a>,<a href="https://app.grammarly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Grammarly</a> or a similar tool to judge the readability of your copy.</p>
<h2>Long sentences</h2>
<p>This relates to our earlier point about readability. Compared to long sentences, short ones are easier to understand. They also don&#8217;t take a lot of commitment to finish.</p>
<p>The fix here is to present one idea per sentence, and remove redundant words.</p>
<p>Take a look at these examples of short and punchy copy from around the web:</p>
<ul>
<li>Morning Brew: Stay informed and entertained, for free.</li>
<li>HubSpot: Create delightful customer experiences. Have a delightful time doing it.</li>
<li>Tuft and Needle: See, feel and sleep on the difference.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Not speaking your audience’s language</h2>
<p>Good copy communicates information, but great copy leaves a lasting impression. One way to make your copy resonate more with your target audience is to use their vocabulary.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of this is canine-centered subscription service BarkBox. It uses vocab like “zoomies” and “doggos” to speak to its target audience of enthusiastic dog owners.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246483" style="width: 705px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246483" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2246483" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/33.png" alt="Barkbox uses vocabulary widely used by its target audience of dog owners" width="695" height="327" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/33.png 695w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/33.png?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/33.png?resize=300,141 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/33.png?resize=680,320 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/33.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246483" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>Similarly, sports equipment retailer Brooks Running incorporates running lingo into its product copy. It highlights shoes best suited for “overpronation,” “neutral running gaits” and more terms specific to those in the running community, its target audience.</p>
<p>To learn your ideal customer&#8217;s vocabulary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out Facebook groups, subreddits and other communities where your audience hangs out.</li>
<li>Look at sales calls, customer reviews and service tickets.</li>
<li>Interview prospects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make note of the unique words and phrases commonly used, and then incorporate them into your copy.</p>
<h2>Weak headlines</h2>
<p>Strong headlines invite people to keep reading. There are two defining traits that separate strong headlines from the weak:</p>
<ul>
<li>They pique readers’ curiosity.</li>
<li>They promise some kind of value.</li>
</ul>
<p>This applies not just to landing page headlines but also to email subject lines, blog post headers and more.</p>
<p>To write a more eye-catching headline, try one of the following tactics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a sense of fear or urgency: “10 things you didn’t know could hurt your credit.”</li>
<li>Simplify a complicated or intimidating topic: “The minimalist’s guide to Bitcoin.”</li>
<li>Make its value obvious: “The best travel hacks that save you time, space and money.”</li>
<li>Acknowledge a common objection: “How to speak like a pro even with stage fright.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>No social proof</h2>
<p>Readers can spot a sales pitch from a mile away, and they don’t like them. That’s because overt sales pitches often come off as one-sided or pushy. People are also skeptical that they may exaggerate or stretch the truth.</p>
<p>Adding social proof — evidence that other people value your product — prevents people from thinking your copy is pushy or fake. It lets others do the selling for you.</p>
<p>There are several other ways to incorporate social proof into your copy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use snappy lines from customer reviews as headers.</li>
<li>Mention how many customers you serve.</li>
<li>Quantify your results or benefits.</li>
<li>Call out the names of well-known customers that use your product, like influencers or major brands.</li>
<li>Mention any awards or top rankings your company or product has received.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wise: “We move over $7 billion every month and save people and businesses $3 million in hidden fees every day.”</li>
<li>Mailchimp: “Mailchimp was recently named one of the best global software companies of 2021 by G2.”</li>
<li>Headspace: “Join millions getting more mindful with Headspace. 4.9-star average rating. 611.9k ratings on iOS and Google Play. 70M downloads across all platforms.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Emphasizing features</h2>
<p>Some copywriters tend to focus on flashy product features, especially when a product involves revolutionary technology. These features are certainly important, but they don&#8217;t answer your prospect&#8217;s most important question: What&#8217;s in it for me?</p>
<p>So rather than emphasizing your product features, focus your copy on the benefit your customers will get.</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://venmo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venmo&#8217;s</a> website highlights all of the app’s unique benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Settle up with Venmo friends for any shared activity, from road trips to picnics to takeout.&#8221; — Feature: mobile money transfer with your contacts.</li>
<li>&#8220;Always pay the right person. There are a lot of John Smiths out there. Find the right one fast. No guesswork involved.&#8221; Feature: personal QR codes.</li>
<li>&#8220;Add personality to your payment notes with animated stickers, Bitmoji, and custom emojis.&#8221; — Feature: social feed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To frame a feature as a benefit, try applying it to a real-life situation your customer might face. It’s not just about what provides value; it’s about how it provides value.</p>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>Pinpointing these common mistakes in your copy is the first step to improving your conversion rates. The next step is making the changes.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick recap of our recommended fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write with active voice.</li>
<li>Get specific with examples and use a second-person point of view.</li>
<li>Direct readers toward action.</li>
<li>Address your prospects’ underlying motivation.</li>
<li>Choose simple words over complicated ones.</li>
<li>Shorten your sentences.</li>
<li>Use your target audience’s vocabulary.</li>
<li>Write headlines that pique curiosity and promise value.</li>
<li>Leverage social proof.</li>
<li>Focus on product benefits rather than features.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether it’s your landing page, ad creative, email or something else, applying these fixes will help increase your conversion rates.</p>

The convoluted back [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In its latest (and last) pre-Christmas document reveal, European privacy advocacy group, <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/4th-advent-reading-facebook-fully-ignores-schrems-rulings-court-justice">noyb</a>, has published details of an 86-page internal assessment by Facebook of its (continued) transfers of European&#8217;s personal data to the US &#8212; and the resulting conclusion can be best summed up as &#8216;The Emperor, Mark Zuckerberg, Has No Clothes&#8217;.</p>
<p>The convoluted back story here is that Facebook&#8217;s transfers of EU users&#8217; data to the US remain ongoing &#8212; in spite of two rulings by the bloc&#8217;s top court finding the US is a risky jurisdiction for such data (aka <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/">Schrems I</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Schrems II</a>); <strong><em>and</em></strong> a preliminary order by Facebook&#8217;s lead EU DPA, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">over a year ago</a>, saying it must suspend EU-US transfers in the wake of the aforementioned Schrems II ruling.</p>
<p>And if that wasn&#8217;t enough, it&#8217;s <em>also</em> <em>almost a year</em> since Facebook&#8217;s lead EU DPA, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), settled a legal challenge from noyb &#8212; agreeing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">last January</a> to &#8220;swiftly&#8221; finalize the complaint in question.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249768" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Yet there&#8217;s <em>still</em> no final decision from Ireland on the legality of Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data transfers &#8212; some 8.5 years after the complaint was first filed by noyb founder and chair, Max Schrems. (noyb didn&#8217;t even exist when he filed this complaint!)</p>
<p>Asked whether a decision on Facebook&#8217;s data transfers will &#8212; at long, long last &#8212; be issued this year<em>,</em> the DPC&#8217;s deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told us the inquiry is &#8220;fairly well progressed at this stage&#8221; but he admitted it will not be finalized in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Asked if a decision will be issued in January, Doyle ducked specifying a timeframe &#8212; saying that the DPC is unsure &#8220;exactly when&#8221; the decision will be made.</p>
<p>So perhaps 2022 will &#8212; finally &#8212; be the year of reckoning for Facebook.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="H8AsQWwRKH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data transfers face their final countdown</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data transfers face their final countdown&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/embed/#?secret=H8AsQWwRKH" data-secret="H8AsQWwRKH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But, if not, 2022 may well be a year of substantial reckoning for the Irish DPC which is now facing intense scrutiny over the sedate pace and convoluted form of its enforcements in major cases against tech giants like Facebook.</p>
<p>The European Commission warned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/gdpr-centralized-enforcement/">earlier this month</a> that unless &#8220;effective&#8221; enforcement arrives soon it will step in and move the bloc toward a system of centralized oversight.</p>
<p>So the message from EU lawmakers to DPAs such as Ireland (and, really, <em>especially</em> to Ireland) is simple: Use your enforcement powers <em>soon</em> &#8212; or you&#8217;ll lose them.</p>
<p>Returning to Facebook, if an EU data transfer suspension order does ever actually get enforced, the tech giant faces having to make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/max-schrems-on-the-eu-court-ruling-that-could-cut-facebook-in-two/">drastic changes to its infrastructure</a> and/or its business model.</p>
<p>Or it could even shut down service in Europe &#8212; a possibility Facebook has floated in an earlier legal submission &#8212; although its chief spin doctor, Nick Clegg, quickly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">denied it would ever actually do that</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook and Clegg have preferred to resort to economic scare tactics to lobby the bloc&#8217;s lawmakers against enforcing the rule of law against the national-state-sized data-mining empire &#8212; suggesting that any suspension order against Facebook&#8217;s data flows would wreak economic damage against European SMEs that use its ad tools to target consumers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a classic big tech tactic to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy/">lobby against tighter regulation</a> of its own market power by claiming that limits on its operations will be far more damaging for the smaller businesses that rely on powerful platforms to reach potential buyers.</p>
<p>The adtech industry also likes to imply that you can either have privacy or competition, not both.</p>
<p>However, on that front, regional competition authorities are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their assessment of adtech platform power &#8212; including understanding how data abuse by tech giants can itself be a lever to lock in market power. (See, for example Germany&#8217;s Federal Cartel Office&#8217;s antitrust <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling/">case against Facebook&#8217;s consentless &#8216;superprofiling of users</a>.)</p>
<p>So how much runway such self-serving framing has left, as the bloc <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/meps-back-limits-on-big-techs-ability-to-set-self-serving-defaults/">hastens to pass ex ante rules to boss tech giants</a>, is up for debate.</p>
<p>Facebook has managed to use the courts to defer a final countdown on its data transfers issues for years. But its business model is now under attack on multiple fronts &#8212; with the European Parliament, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/meps-back-limits-on-big-techs-ability-to-set-self-serving-defaults/">pushing for tighter restrictions on behavioral ads and an outright ban on dark patterns</a> in the Digital Markets Act.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, noyb has also been shining more disinfecting sunlight onto the EU&#8217;s enforcement failures &#8212; where Facebook is concerned &#8212; by protesting at being removed from an ongoing procedure against it by the Irish DPC, after the regulator tried to get it to sign a gag order in exchange for remaining a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>The DPC has been accused of acting in Facebook&#8217;s interests in trying to keep procedural documents confidential without a valid legal basis for ordering third parties not to publish information related to ongoing procedures.</p>
<p>(And other pre-Christmas document-reveals by noyb have made <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/second-noyb-advent-reading-facebookdpc-documents">especial</a><a href="https://noyb.eu/en/second-noyb-advent-reading-facebookdpc-documents">ly awkward reading for the DPC</a> &#8212; which can be seen apparently trying to insert a notorious <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/irelands-draft-gdpr-decision-against-facebook-branded-a-joke/">Facebook GDPR consent bypass tactic</a> into European Data Protection Board (EDPB) guidance &#8212; by arguing for allowing T&amp;Cs to be laundered via contract clause &#8212; and getting roundly slapped back by other EU DPAs.)</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/facebooks-lead-eu-privacy-supervisor-hit-with-corruption-complaint/">Last month</a>, the not-for-profit also took the further step of filing a complaint of criminal corruption against the DPC &#8212; in another sign of how frustrated European privacy campaigners have gotten at inaction against rights-trampling tech giants.</p>

<p>As noted above, despite a complaint that dates back to the Snowden disclosures, two landmark CJEU rulings and countless court challenges, Facebook continues to pass Europeans&#8217; data to the US &#8212; as if the rule of law can&#8217;t touch it.</p>
<p>Yet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/facebook-loses-last-ditch-attempt-to-derail-dpc-decision-on-its-eu-us-data-flows/">back in May</a>, the company lost in the Irish High Court after trying (and failing) to challenge the DPC&#8217;s procedure; including by arguing the DPC was being too hasty and did not properly investigate before it sent the preliminary suspension order. (NB: The original complaint dates back to June 2013 so it&#8217;s fast approaching a decade old at this point.)</p>
<p>Details of Facebook&#8217;s Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA) revealed by noyb yesterday are long on claimed justifications for Facebook to ignore the CJEU &#8212; and short on substantive arguments to stand up Facebook&#8217;s claim that it&#8217;s totally not a problem for it to continue to take European&#8217;s data to the US for processing despite the CJEU ruling that there are huge legal implications if you do that.</p>
<p>The CJEU has &#8212; not once &#8212; but twice struck down flagship transfer agreements between the EU and the US on the grounds that US surveillance law is in fatal conflict with European privacy rights.</p>
<p>And while, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">back in July 2020</a>, the court did allow the possibility that data can be legally moved out of the EU to third countries, it made it clear that DPAs must step in and suspend data flows where they suspect people&#8217;s information is going somewhere where it&#8217;s at risk.</p>
<p>Given the court simultaneously struck down the EU-US Privacy Shield, the US was clearly identified as a problem third country.</p>
<p>Add to that, Facebook has the additional problem of its data processing being subject to US surveillance law (via NSA programs like PRISM). So there&#8217;s no easy fix for Facebook&#8217;s EU data transfers, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">we&#8217;ve said before</a>.</p>
<p>However having a friendly regulator that doesn&#8217;t rush to do anything about really obvious problems is sure to help, though&#8230;</p>

<p>In a statement accompanying its publication of details of Facebook&#8217;s TIA, Schrems said: &#8220;Facebook has been ignoring EU law for 8.5 years now. The newly released documents show that they simply take the view that the Court of Justice is wrong &#8212; and Facebook is right. It is an unbelievable ignorance of the rule of law, supported by the lack of enforcement action by the Irish DPC. No wonder that Facebook wants to keep this document confidential. However, it also shows that Facebook has no serious legal defence when continuing to ship European&#8217;s data to the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>noyb details the contents of the TIA via a number of videos &#8212; including several where Schrems summarizes the contents of the document in detail. (In some locations in Europe it also provides data from the TIA itself but notes that it is withholding this content from the UK and Ireland on account of the legal risk of Facebook and/or the DPC bringing baseless SLAPP suits against it to try to exhaust its limited resources.)</p>
<p>Per its analysis, one of Facebook&#8217;s tactics to try to deny/evade legal reality is to seize on newer developments, such as the Commission&#8217;s updated Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/uk-gets-data-flows-deal-from-eu-for-now/">adequacy decision recently granted to the UK</a> (despite that country&#8217;s own surveillance practices) &#8212; to claim as new evidence that the earlier CJEU ruling no longer applies.</p>
<p>That means Facebook has variously sought to argue that the DPC was too quick to come to a conclusion vis-a-vis the legality of its data flows; <em>and</em> that circumstances on the ground have changed in a way that means its flows are now totally fine anyway.</p>
<p>All of which serves to underline how delaying enforcement is itself a key strategy for Facebook to evade the application of EU law.</p>
<p>That, in turn, directly implicates its lead EU regulator &#8212; because, by taking such a painstakingly long time over investigations the regulator generates ample time and space for Facebook to come up with fresh lines to cynically reboot its arguments against any enforcement taking place.</p>
<p>In short, it allows for a perpetual game of regulatory whack-a-mole that gives Facebook a thumbs up to carry on with data-mining business as usual in the meanwhile. While EU people&#8217;s fundamental rights exist only on paper.</p>
<p>The DPC declined to comment on noyb&#8217;s fourth Advent Reading when we reached out.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s Schrems&#8217; assessment again: &#8220;The Irish DPC is extremely slow and is not in control of this procedures. Facebook constantly moves to another argument, while the DPC has not even decided on the decision from 2013. Facebook is dominating this procedure &#8212; instead of the DPC.&#8221;</p>
<p>Per noyb, Facebook&#8217;s TIA also details what it claims as &#8220;supplementary measures&#8221; to boost protection for the data &#8212; something the EDPB has said <em>may</em> be possible for data controllers to apply to transfers to risky third countries to make such flows achieve compliance with EU standards.</p>
<p>For example, robust, end-to-end encryption may, in theory, be applied to prevent access to data in a readable form when it&#8217;s in the US.</p>
<p>However Facebook&#8217;s business model is based on profiling users via its big data analysis of their information so it&#8217;s certainly not in a position to lock its own business out of people&#8217;s data. Not without a radical change of business model.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, then, noyb found the TIA&#8217;s section on claimed &#8220;supplementary measures&#8221; contained nothing more than a (long) list of industry standard policies and procedures. So no extra steps at all, then.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the documents we received, absolutely no new or relevant measures were taken by Facebook on foot of the CJEU judgment of 16.6.2020,&#8221; noyb notes.</p>
<p>We reached out to the EDPB for a view on the sorts of policies and procedures Facebook&#8217;s TIA lists as &#8220;supplementary measures&#8221; &#8212; and will update this post with any response.</p>
<p>Asked for its response to noyb&#8217;s assessment of its TIA, Facebook sent this statement &#8212; attributed to a Meta spokesperson:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Like other companies, we have followed the rules and relied on international transfer mechanisms to transfer data in a safe and secure way. Businesses need clear, global rules, underpinned by the strong rule of law, to protect transatlantic data flows over the long term.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://stenon.io/en/">Stenon</a>, an AgTech company that has a real-time soil-sensing solution, has raised a $20 million Series A funding round from Founders Fund, David Friedberg’s The Production Board, and existing investors including Cherry Ventures and Atlantic Labs.<br />
 <br />
Founded in 2018 in Potsdam, Germany, Stenon’s digital soil data is produced without the need for a laboratory, making it faster and more efficient, the company claims.  Stenon says farmers get data to make the best decision about cultivation, boosting yield, crop quality, and soil health, while saving significant amounts of time and money by not needing to use a soil testing laboratory.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO  Dominic Roth said: “Stenon’s mission is to become <em>the</em> soil data company in agriculture and get rid of the need for physical laboratories. Without soil data being available at scale, farmers will neither be able to work sustainably and profitably in the future. Additionally, the market is dynamically moving into the direction of regenerative ag or autonomous farming &#8211; all of these practices will require the data set that we are providing.”</p>
<p>Since half of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions come from current soil management practices, soil management systems like Stenon’s are becoming highly significant in the fight against climate change.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249800" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Stenon technology is patented, certified and live in 20 countries. The certification by the main European farmers association in collaboration with a panel of institutes like the Julius Kühn Institute in Germany.</p>
<p>Its main competitors are Agrocares, 360 Soilscan, ChrysaLabs (raised CA$1.4M).</p>
<p>David Friedberg of The Production Board, commented: “Stenon&#8217;s real-time soil readings provide critical data to farmers, revolutionizing the current costly and time-consuming soil analysis process.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cross-border remittances &#8212; when people living and working abroad send money back home to friends and family &#8212; continues to be a huge part of how those living in developing countries, off the global financial grid, can be helped. The World Bank <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2021/11/17/remittance-flows-register-robust-7-3-percent-growth-in-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a> that some $589 billion will be sent this way 2021, according to research from the World Bank, up 7.3% on 2020, as parts of the global economy started to claw back growth after a tough 2020 due to Covid-19.</p>
<p>In one development of that theme, today, <a href="https://www.taptapsend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taptap Send</a> &#8212; one of the startups building tools to manage these money transfers &#8212; is announcing $65 million in growth funding as it continues its mission to enable remittances specifically to the most overlooked countries.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s hook is that it charges no fee for the transfer (it makes its cut via foreign exchange rates), and believes that its service is the easiest on the market to use, and it integrates with whatever mobile money wallets are already being used locally, meaning recipients do not have to add anything extra to their devices, or learn any new techniques, to be able to receive money via the service. At a time when the global economy has been under pressure, Taptap Send saw business grow eight-fold, the company said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249786" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Series B is being led by Spark Capital, with participation also from Unbound, Reid Hoffman and Canaan Partners (both of which led its previous round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/taptap-send-gets-13-4m-for-a-no-fee-money-transfer-service-aimed-at-price-conscious-emerging-market-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$13.4 million Series A</a> earlier this year), Slow Ventures, Breyer Capital, Wamda Capital, Flourish Ventures, and additional unnamed investors from the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America. The company has now raised more than $80 million, and while it is not disclosing its valuation, <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/277209-37/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> data notes that it is $715 million as of this round (which appears to have closed earlier in the year).</p>
<p>There are dozens, maybe even hundreds, of companies playing in the cross-border remittances field, from incumbents like Western Union through a myriad of tech players, some of which have <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RELY?p=RELY&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gone public</a> and some of which remain privately held. Taptap Send believes that its unique place in the market is that it has built not just the easiest, but the most reliable system to initiate, manage and receive those transfers.</p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;It&#8217;s quite easy to say remittances are crowded, but you could have said that for social networking or videoconferencing before TikTok or Zoom came along,&#8221; said Michael Faye, the CEO who co-founded the company with Paul Niehaus. &#8220;Remittances are a deceptively simple product on the surface, with an exceedingly complicated execution under the hood. There are 1,000 parts to get right and when you do you can deliver more value to users via price, speed and reliability.&#8221; He notes that a lot of the remittance services have been less than reliable, another area to improve for those looking to be more competitive.</p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;Remittances is one of the most sensitive things a person buys. It&#8217;s not like a shirt that you can touch and feel,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In remittances you are entering payment information and waiting and hoping that the money is getting to someone who likely needs it quite urgently. You need to have the utmost trust to take that money and send to someone else.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The founders have arrived at their understanding of the market based on a long history in the field, having previously founded <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GiveDirectly</a> (for charitable cross-border transfers) and <a href="https://www.thesegovia.com/">Segovia</a> (focused on B2B transfers). Segovia was acquired by <a href="https://www.heliosinvestment.com/news/crown-agents-bank-acquires-segovia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crown Agents Bank</a> in 2019, and theoretically the product of Taptap Send was spun out from that ahead of the deal.</p>
<p class="p4">Taptap Send has been steadily growing and adding more countries to its list of served markets. It currently covers some 20 countries for receiving money, some of the very poorest and/or least developed places in the world including Bangladesh, Cameroon, DRC, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Morocco, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Republic of the Congo, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Côte d&#8217;Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Senegal and Zambia.</p>
<p>Its growth, as with many other remittance providers, has been predicated on the rapid rise of mobile technology, and the fact that even in the poorest communities, people will have handsets that can be used to initiate transfers and act as proxy-bank accounts, even if they are not smartphones.</p>
<p>&#8220;The change has been profound, and the number of countries where these domestic wallets are popping up around the world is shifting dramatically,&#8221; Faye said.</p>
<p class="p4">The company was attractive to investors in part because of its growth during what has been a challenging time for the industry, and in part because of the team and its ethos of bringing financial inclusion tools to as wide a swathe of the developing world as possible.</p>
<p class="p4">We’ve looked at a lot of fintech companies in the space, and think Taptap’s team and community-led approach are best in class,&#8221; said investor James Kuklinski of Spark Capital in a statement. &#8220;We couldn’t be more excited to be joining them on our mission to bring low-cost, accessible, cross-border financial products to underserved diaspora populations around the world.”</p>
<p class="p4">“I invest for scaled global impact and team, and Taptap is among the best combinations I’ve seen, &#8221; added Reid Hoffman.</p>

<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>A few items before jumping in. Policy corner is going on hiatus for a bit. A message from reporter Aria Alamalhodaei:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249664" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;For the time being, your favorite mini-roundup of transportation policy news will be taking an extended hiatus. I hope to be back with you in the second quarter of 2022! If you have tips or policy news you want to share, send it over to Kirsten or Rebecca. See you next year!”&#8221;</p>
<p>Secondly, I (that&#8217;s me Kirsten) am taking a bit of holiday time and will see you next year! Wishing all my readers a happy holiday and good health in the coming year.</p>
<p>Tthe transportation world lost one of its leaders this week. <strong>Ryan Popple</strong>, a former active duty Army officer and early member of Tesla&#8217;s finance team who rose through the ranks before leaving to become a partner at Kleiner Perkins and CEO of electric bus manufacturer Proterra, died unexpectedly at 44 years old. He is survived by a wife and three children. Popple had recently left Proterra and had joined G2 Venture Partners.</p>
<p class="">As G2 Venture Partners wrote in its remembrance of Popple: &#8220;Ryan embodied entrepreneurial spirit and devoted his life to creating a better future. His leadership at Proterra was first and foremost about increasing access to affordable, sustainable solutions and shaping a zero-emission transportation future for the benefit of our planet and the health of our communities. His work as a partner at  and Kleiner Perkins was dedicated to leading the sustainable transformation of industries. A former active duty officer in the U.S. Army, Ryan put country before self in uniform, and in civilian life.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I first interviewed Ryan back in 2016. During that interview and the few times we spoke since then, I was always struck with the particular combination of passion and practicality that he brought to every conversation. Ryan, you will be missed.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Hazel Chapman</strong>, the co-founder of Lotus Cars and former British racing driver, <a href="https://jalopnik.com/hazel-chapman-co-founder-of-lotus-cars-dies-age-94-1848214166">died earlier this week</a> at the age of 94.</p>

<p>Welcome folks, let&#8217;s get right to it.</p>
<p><strong>Tier</strong>, a Berlin-based micromobilty operator that just keeps growing, has acquired <strong>Wind Mobility&#8217;s</strong> Italian operations. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/e-scooter-company-tier-acquires-wind-mobilitys-italian-subsidiary/">Terms of the deal were not disclosed</a>, but this is Tier&#8217;s second company purchase of late, and Wind&#8217;s second sale, as well. Wind also sold off its Israeli operations to Yandex, the Russian tech giant, a few months ago.</p>
<p>By the way, Tier also just released some stats about its London trial. Since the trial started in June, Tier scooters have seen more than 218,000 miles of trips on the road..</p>
<p><strong>Zoomo</strong>, the Australian e-bike subscription platform for enterprise and gig economy delivery workers, has come out with a new utility e-bike, the Zoomo One, that it&#8217;s hoping will take the place of the humble moped. It can handle payloads of 88 lbs in the back and 40 lbs in the front, and can handle deliveries no matter the weather or terrain, according to the company.</p>
<p><strong>Unagi</strong>, the e-scooter manufacturer, has announced the nationwide expansion of its all-access subscription plan, which allows subscribers to pay-as-you-go on a monthly plan for about $50 a month, or pay for an annual plan of $39 per month. No commitments, no cancel fees, no worries.</p>
<p><strong>Gogoro</strong> launched a new urban battery swapping initiative that uses Gogoro-powered smart parking meters, co-developed with Shengming Technology. The company says the meters will provide cities with smart city tech that fast track the deployment of wireless connectivity and off-grid power for a range of users including parking management. The meters are currently being deployed in New Taipei City, Taiwan, and will be operational in early 2022, with an additional 6,000 meters rolling out across the country by the end of the year.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Harley-Davidson</strong> announced that its taking electric motorcycle division LiveWire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/harley-davidsons-ev-motorcycle-unit-livewire-to-go-public-via-spac/">public through a merger</a> with a blank check company sponsored by executives of AEA Investors and Bridges Fund Management.</p>
<p>First the details: the agreement is with special purpose acquisition company AEA-Bridges Impact Corp (ABIC). The deal is funded by $400 million that ABIC is holding in trust, a $100 million investment from Harley-Davidson and $100 million from Kymco. Harley-Davidson will own about 74% of the newly combined company. The SPAC shareholders will have a 17% ownership, with the remaining 4% being held by SPAC founders and Kymco. The combined company is expected to have an enterprise value of about $1.77 billion and post-money equity value of about $2.31 billion at closing. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2022.</p>
<p>What does this all mean? The deal will preserve much of Harley-Davidson’s ownership while giving LiveWire access to the capital that the public markets can provide and fold in Kymco as a key partner.</p>
<p>My prediction: if 2020 and 2021 were the years of the SPAC, 2022 will be the year of the public spin out. Watch for more legacy companies to follow Harley-Davidson&#8217;s LiveWire spin out strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230; </strong></p>
<p><strong>Apex.ai</strong>, mobility software startup founded by Bosch veterans and automated systems engineers Jan Becker and Dejan Pangercic, raised a Series B<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/mobility-software-startup-apex-ai-lands-supplier-giants-continental-zf-as-investors/"> $56.5 million round</a> led by Orillion. AGCO, Canaan, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Airbus Ventures, Jaguar Land Rover&#8217;s InMotion Ventures, Continental and ZF also participated.. Apex has raised a total of $74 million to date, a figure that includes previously announced investments from Volvo Group Venture Capital, Toyota Ventures and HELLA Ventures. ZF is taking a 5% stake in Apex.</p>
<p><strong> Gopuff</strong> is in the process of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/gopuff-the-instant-grocery-startup-is-raising-up-to-1-5b-at-up-to-a-40b-valuation-ahead-of-going-public-as-soon-as-mid-2022/">raising $1.5 billion</a>, with a valuation of up to $40 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Solvento</strong>, a platform that provides trucking companies with immediate access to capital, raised $4.5 million in funding led by Dynamo Ventures with participation from Wollef Ventures and Zenda Capital. The funding includes a $3 million debt facility from Marco Financial.</p>
<p><strong>Vay</strong>, a company that is trying to get self-driving car services to market faster by pursuing a teledriven approach, has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/vay-raises-95m-to-bring-teledriven-self-driving-transportation-service-to-hamburg-in-2022/"> raised a $95 million Series B round</a> to help it launch its first commercial service in Hamburg, Germany sometime in 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Aerospace</strong>, an aerospace and technology company, started trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker EVTL.</p>
<p><strong>Voly</strong>, a five-month-old Sydney-based startup that offers thousands of SKUs and promises deliveries in 15 minutes at a flat fee of A$2.99 ($2.14), has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/voly-raises-13m-led-by-sequoia-to-deliver-instant-groceries-in-australia/">raised A$18 million</a> (just under $13 million at today&#8217;s rates) in a seed round of funding that it will be using to expand its business to cities and towns across the country.</p>
<p><strong>WeRide</strong>, the Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company, received a strategic investment from Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC Group). The companies did not disclose the terms.</p>

<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p>It was a crazy week in the world of autonomous vehicles!</p>
<p><strong>Aurora&#8217;s</strong> self-driving trucks are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/aurora-self-driving-trucks-are-using-uber-freight-to-haul-goods-for-customers/">hauling goods for Uber Freight</a> customers in Texas as part of a multiphase commercial pilot that aims to more closely integrate the two companies. Aurora is using the Uber Freight brokerage platform, which connects truck drivers with shippers that need cargo delivered, to haul freight for customers between Dallas and Houston. Aurora said it will expand routes as it adds more terminals.</p>
<p><strong>Einride</strong>, an electric and autonomous freight company from Sweden, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2021/12/14/einride-goes-crypto-with-first-nft-auction/?sh=3fc1cd891f87">launched its debut NFT</a>, the first-ever sketch of its autonomous Pod, as its first foray into the crypto space. It will be the first in a series of NFTs to be released by the company, it says, and will be the catalyst for Einride to tap into the web 3.0 world. Because every freight company needs a space in the metaverse.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong> issued a terse and unexpected statement this week that Cruise CEO Dan Ammann was leaving the company. There was no shortage of tips, rumors and speculation sent my way in the few hours after the announcement about why Ammann left. I have not confirmed any of them. I did speak with a few folks who had direct knowledge of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/longtime-gm-exec-dan-ammann-is-out-as-cruise-ceo/">how it played at over at Cruise HQ</a>. The most common words were &#8220;chaotic,&#8221; &#8220;hasty&#8221; and a &#8220;surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Separately, Lucas Watson, Cruise&#8217;s senior vice president of go-to-market, left the company last week. I&#8217;m told this is unrelated. However, it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that two key people focused on the bu BVsiness strategy at Cruise are now gone.</p>
<p><strong>Mobileye</strong> said it has added Paris to its autonomous vehicle testing program. The company said it will be working with French public transport provider RATP to provide an AV on-demand service for employees of the shopping center Galleries Lafayette Paris Hausmann.</p>
<p><strong>Motional</strong> is partnering with Uber to launch an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/motional-and-uber-partner-to-launch-autonomous-delivery-pilot-in-santa-monica-in-2022/">autonomous delivery pilot</a> in Santa Monica. Uber Eats customers will be able to order restaurant meal kits to be delivered to them via one of Motional&#8217;s retrofitted all-electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 robotaxis by early next year.</p>
<p><strong>Pony.ai,</strong> a Chinese autonomous driving startup with an office in the U.S., has paused its driverless pilot fleet in California six months after it was approved by local regulators to test autonomous vehicles without a human safety driver. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates AVs in the state, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/pony-ai-suspension-driverless-pilot-california/">suspended Pony&#8217;s driverless testing permit</a> following a reported collision in Fremont on October 28, the DMV told TechCrunch in a statement.</p>
<p><strong>TuSimple</strong> reached a deal to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/tusimple-dhl-deal/">integrate its autonomous vehicle technology</a> into DHL Supply Chain&#8217;s operations. As part of the deal, the contract logistics giant has reserved 100 autonomous trucks that are being co-developed by TuSimple and Navistar. The agreement with DHL pushes TuSimple&#8217;s total reservations order to 6,875 trucks, the first of which will be delivered in 2024.</p>
<p>TuSimple disclosed that is it already using its self-driving trucks to haul freight daily for DHL on a San Antonio-to-Dallas route.</p>
<p>A <strong>Waymo</strong> self-driving Jaguar I-Pace that struck a pedestrian in San Francisco <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/waymo-says-self-driving-car-that-struck-pedestrian-in-san-francisco-was-in-manual-mode/">was in manual mode</a>, the company told TechCrunch in response to an initial report posted on Reddit.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Abigail Bassett</strong> gives her first impressions of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/2022-porsche-taycan-gts-cross-turismo-delivers-power-and-performance-in-a-wagon/">2022 Porsche Taycan GTS Sport Turismo</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ample</strong> co-founder John de Souza is our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/amples-john-de-souza-on-the-merits-of-b2b-company-culture-and-investors-who-get-it/">last founder Q&amp;A</a> of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Canoo</strong> is ending its deal with Dutch automotive manufacturing company VDL Nedcar to serve as its contract manufacturer in Europe and instead is exploring a new deal with VDL Groep, another Dutch auto manufacturing company, to produce vehicles in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Lightyear</strong>, a company developing a long distance solar car, signed an agreement with Car-as-a-Service company LeasePlan to reserve 5,000 of Lightyear&#8217;s second model to offer on its platform by 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Kia</strong> said its new EV6 has an estimated EPA range of 310 miles when equipped with a 77.4 kWh battery and rear-wheel drive. The EV6 goes on sale in the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong> executive <strong>Pamela Fletcher</strong>, an engineer who launched the Chevrolet Bolt and who more recently was vice president of the company’s global innovation team, left the company to become an executive with Delta Air Lines.</p>
<p><strong>Nio</strong>, the Chinese electric car company, debuted the ET5, a &#8220;smart&#8221; mid-sized sedan that it says has between 550 kilometers and 1,000 kilometers of range depending on the battery pack size. The interior has a panoramic digital cockpit it calls Panocinema that features AR and VR tech, notably there are custom augmented reality glasses developed through a partnership with Nreal that can project a 201-inch screen out 6 meters in front of drivers.</p>
<p><strong>Proterra,</strong> the U.S. commercial electric vehicle company that produces transit buses and electric charging systems, is opening up its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/proterra-to-build-commercial-ev-battery-factory-in-south-carolina-its-third-in-us/">third battery factory</a> in Greer, South Carolina. The factory should begin production in the second half of 2022 with &#8220;multiple gigawatt hours of annual battery system production capacity,&#8221; according to the company.</p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> had its first earnings report as a publicly traded company. The big news: Rivian is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/rivian-to-invest-ipo-wealth-into-new-georgia-factory-battery-tech/">expanding production capacity</a> of its Normal, Illinois factory from 150,000 to 200,000 electric vehicles a year and building a second factory east of Atlanta that will have a targeted annual production capacity of 400,000 vehicles a year. This Georgia factory will include a co-located battery cell production facility. Construction will begin in summer 2022 with production beginning in 2024. Speaking of Rivian, reporter Mark Harris looked into one of Rivian&#8217;s earliest backers: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/space-florida-shrinking-rivian-stake/">Space Florida</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Toyota</strong> <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/36428993.html">laid out its EV plans</a> — a target of introducing 30 battery electric vehicles by 2030 and for total global battery electric vehicle sales to reach 3.5 million within same timeframe. The company also aims to turn Lexus into an all-electric brand by the end of the decade. And amid its media reveal managed to squeeze in the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/43559/toyota-literally-rickrolled-the-world-during-its-huge-ev-concept-reveal">time to rickroll us.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The relentless march of social media apps&#8217; algorithmic advertising hooks, influencer-leveraged social graphs and UX that begs for endless scrolling have led to viral success and mass-market engagement for the biggest players. But there remains a continuing gap in the market for products that let us create things like photos and share them with selected friends, without all that other social baggage. Today, one of them is announcing a sizable seed round after seeing strong early interest at its launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://beta.lapse.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lapse</a>, an app that lets users form groups, and then lets those groups collaborate, wherever they are, to take spontaneous pictures on collective &#8220;rolls&#8221; of 36 photos that are then &#8220;developed&#8221; &#8212; and only shown to the group &#8212; 24 hours after the roll has started, with a little bit of chit-chat in between, has raised $11 million in a seed round of funding.</p>
<p>Octopus Ventures and GV (previously called Google Ventures) led the round for the London-based startup of the same name, with Speedinvest and individual investors participating, including Soleio Cuervo, an early Facebook designer that has a track record when it comes to social engagement: he was part of the team that designed Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;like&#8221; button.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249611" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This brings the total raised by Lapse to $12.4 million &#8212; adding in a $1.4 million pre-seed that came ahead of the company&#8217;s launch in September, which was led by Speedinvest, with Claire Nooriala (VP EMEA, Snap Inc.), Matt Robinson (founder of Nested and GoCardless), and Ian Hogarth (founder of SongKick) also participating.</p>
<p>That September launch saw Lapse snap up 10,000 users for its beta test, briefly shoot to the top of Apple&#8217;s download charts, and rack up a waitlist of 150,000 &#8212; traction that partly explains why it was just a matter of months for the startup to quickly pull together a healthy seed round from a strong list of investors.</p>

<p>Lapse falls into the category of apps that are gaining attention among users and investors for precisely trying to turn some of the mechanics we&#8217;ve come to associate with social media on their head.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Instagram, TikTok and others continue to rack up millions of users, and those millions of users are really regular users, there is a definite seam of people (and parents of people&#8230;) who are wary of them and their agendas. They&#8217;ve been found to contain a lot of toxic content, and because it&#8217;s ultimately hard to control how they are used (and abused) some believe the solution is to abandon them.</p>
<p>On a less severe note, even those that have found a lot of fun, or even business, in mass-market social media apps tire of their relentless push for engagement and exposure and thus want to explore more private or impactful ways of being &#8220;social.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others in the category include IRL, which was started, the founder has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/messaging-social-network-irl-hits-unicorn-status-with-softbank-led-170m-series-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>, on the premise of people using it to create more meaningful social interactions rather than focusing on sharing media with each other or endlessly scrolling to see media posted by people they don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Created to focus on &#8220;in real life&#8221; physical events, the app kept itself from the usage graveyard by expanding to, ironically, virtual (that is, not IRL) events as the pandemic kicked off and wore on. Raising a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/messaging-social-network-irl-hits-unicorn-status-with-softbank-led-170m-series-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big round</a> earlier this year at a $1 billion+ valuation, IRL <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/social-app-irl-makes-its-first-acquisition-with-deal-for-digital-nutrition-company-aabeze-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made an acquisition earlier this month</a> of a &#8220;digital nutrition&#8221; app, which it said would help it develop more ethically-focused recommendations.</p>
<p>And closer in concept to Lapse is Dispo, which also makes a nod to the disposable camera roll and wanting to move away from the focus on experiencing things just to share photos of those experiences. It lets people only see what pictures they have taken the day after they&#8217;re shot.</p>
<p>The startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/amid-controversy-dispo-confirms-series-a-funding-high-profile-advisors-and-investors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also raised money earlier this year</a>, even as the same forces that propelled it to viral interest (it was co-founded by popular YouTuber David Dobrik) turned sour (one of Dobrik&#8217;s squad was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused of sexual assault</a>) and left many with a bad taste in their mouth (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early investors pulled out</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/early-investors-in-dispo-to-donate-any-profits-from-the-photo-sharing-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave up profits</a>, and Dobrik was also removed with any association with it). The app is not exactly eschewing buzzy social media trends, though: in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/dispo-launches-a-test-to-gauge-user-interest-in-selling-their-photos-as-nfts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September</a> it started a test to gauge user interest in selling their photos as NFTs.</p>
<p>Lapse was founded by brothers Dan and Ben Silvertown, who travelled to Vietnam together and used a point-and-shoot camera while there as a way of disconnecting and unwinding. They found the experience inspiring enough that they decided to see if they could build an app that recreated that idea of less anxious social posing, while still making something that let users take pictures and share them with groups of friends.</p>
<p>While Lapse leans on the same mechanic as Dispo by focusing on delayed views of photos, it takes a different approach in that it never intends for those pictures to be shared with anyone other than a close social circle.</p>
<p>(Now defunct Path &#8212; co-founded by early Facebook employee David Morin to provide a way to share amongst small groups as a counter balance to the wide-angle view taken by his former employer &#8212; turned out to be very prescient, if maybe too ahead of its time.)</p>
<p>Lapse is still very much in early stage mode and there is a lot of room for it to be developed further. The only lens that exists on the app currently, for example, is one that takes static photos, from the back of the camera. But the founders say that a lot of thought has gone into that one lens.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249780" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249780" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2249780" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9745.jpeg?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9745.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9745.jpeg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9745.jpeg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9745.jpeg?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9745.jpeg?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9745.jpeg?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9745.jpeg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249780" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ingrid</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We worked with 30 professional photographers to develop our own image processing agent,&#8221; Ben said in an interview. &#8220;But we are still only on step one on where we want to go with analogue film in what we think of as a 20-step process.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would best describe the filter as having some of the qualities of what a snap might have taken on an old-school point-and-shoot camera. Sounds quaint, and is an interesting way of willfully limiting what has become a very powerful camera experience on the average smartphone, and replacing it with spontaneity but also quite a lot of &#8220;bloopers.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little like the camera equivalent of when people proactively choose to walk instead of take a vehicle somewhere, or intentionally go through the many steps for a complicated meal instead of just buying it from somewhere: you may be making your life more inconvenient, but maybe for a different kind of end.</p>
<p>In my experience, some of the byproducts of using the Lapse filter were unexpected, and hard to manage but not in a terminal, but fun, way.</p>
<p>They included taking very blurry pictures as the camera doesn&#8217;t seem to let you focus, and you can&#8217;t take anything but a very inaccurate selfie (or maybe one in a mirror as I eventually did) since there is no front-facing lens, and there is no video, nor any &#8220;filters&#8221; to play with the image. The ability to snap is surprisingly easy: you take pictures often before you realize that you have, and there are no do-overs.</p>
<p>And my son Abel somehow found a way to take a three-image picture that I never figured out how to take myself.</p>
<p>Those images, when they are developed, are sent into the group chat, where you see them in a super-fast slideshow unless you make the effort to slow things down to see them a little more carefully. And, the app is not without its more conventional social media hooks: you can also save pictures from the roll and share them elsewhere.</p>
<p>Dan tells me that this was initially created to help spread the word about the app, mimicking how, say, TikTok grew by making it very easy to share videos from that app to other platforms and hook in people that way. As it&#8217;s still in its early days, he said they have not yet decided if they will keep that hook or eventually turn it off.</p>
<p>So too are specific questions of monetization still being put off, apart from wanting to stay away from advertising.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have had some high level thoughts about monetization, but that question will come later,&#8221; said Dan. &#8220;The strong hypothesis is that we won’t use an ad-based model because it incentivizes as many users as possible and optimizes time on screen &#8212; which is one of the reasons you get toxic behavior. We want the focus to be on quality versus quantity.&#8221; One idea, he hinted, was a freemium model, &#8220;building an app for users at level such that they love it so much that they’ll pay for additional features.&#8221; One feature will likely be removing the branding on shared pictures: currently these come with a Lapse-branded frame.</p>
<p>Most of all, though, Lapse seems to be embracing the idea of growing slowly and trying to do so without hype.</p>
<p>The app is not making active user numbers public, but I&#8217;ll say that the waitlist of 150,000 is not the full size of the app today, and having investors like GV backing you is one sign that the numbers are good. Those who are allowed in get several invites, and when you get one of these you skip the waitlist. The user engagement has been decent: 15% who download it stay using the app, Ben said. Right now the majority of users are &#8220;Gen Z&#8221; females, with a whopping 79% of users female and 71% under the age of 24. Some 80% of users currently are U.S.-based.</p>
<p>All these numbers, I suspect, will shift as and when the app matures. And in the spirit of having actual choices among different approaches to social apps, I hope that it does.</p>
<p>“Lapse is a next-generation private social network, launched at a time when consumers are fundamentally rethinking their relationship with traditional players,&#8221; said Matthew Chandler, investment manager at Octopus Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;With Lapse, the consumer is no longer the product. This dramatic shift in mentality enables users to communicate freely in private groups, and to provide in-the-moment images of their lives. The product design also means users no longer have the social pressures of portraying themselves a certain way and are instead encouraged to be authentic, which has a profound impact on the way we communicate. We are incredibly excited to partner with Dan and Ben as they build the modern platform for image-based memories.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japan-based messaging app <a href="https://linecorp.com/en/">Line Corporation</a>, which is wholly owned by <a href="https://www.z-holdings.co.jp/en/">Z Holdings</a>, will launch NFT service next year via its new organization LineNext to provide the marketplace for companies and individuals to trade NFTs globally, excluding Japan. Line is separately operating its NFT market beta version through <a href="https://www.bitmax.me/?lang=en">Line Bitmax wallet</a> that is fit for the Japanese market, a spokesperson of Line said.</p>
<p>Line announced last week it has established LineNext in South Korea and the U.S. to focus on expanding the global NFT ecosystem.</p>
<p>The Korea-based LineNext, which has around 100 employees, is working on the global NFT platform strategy and planning while the US-based LineNext is developing and operating its non-fungible token (NFT) platform business. The US office has 55 employees, the spokesperson noted.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249739" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Since LineNext is the platform provider, “transaction brokerage fees will be the main source of revenue, with additional revenue sources planned for the future,” the spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>LineNext is currently in discussions with about 20 global partners for potential partnerships, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>LineNext&#8217;s new global NFT platform will support companies and creators across the globe as they build markets and create communities and ecosystems for general users to trade NFTs.</p>
<p>“NFTs are a kind of technology infrastructure that will transform the digital space and innovate the user experience in all areas, such as content, gaming, social and commerce,” said chief product officer of Line app products (and Line fintech company) Youngsu Ko, who has been appointed CEO of LineNext. “Line has over a decade of proven experience as an innovator, becoming one of the most popular tech companies in Asia. Now we aim to do the same for the exciting new field of NFTs together with our global partners, with the Korea office focused on global NFT platform strategy and our office in the United States focused on the NFT business.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LineNext aims to transform the NFT experience for companies, creators and users by using Line&#8217;s extensive experience developing and growing messenger and blockchain services.</p>
<p>Since establishing <a href="https://blockchain.line.me/">Line Blockchain lab</a>, Line has issued its crypto-asset <a href="https://linecorp.com/en/pr/news/en/2020/3341">Link</a> and operates the crypto-asset exchange<a href="https://www.bitmax.me/?lang=en"> Line Bitmax</a> in Japan and <a href="https://www.bitfront.me/">Bitfront</a> globally. Line also runs a blockchain service development platform, <a href="https://blockchain.line.biz/#/">Line Blockchain developers</a> platform and a beta version of an NFT market on Line Bitmax Wallet in Japan.</p>
<p>More than 1.3 million NFTs have already been issued by various blockchain partners such as Zepeto and Dentsu, introducing intellectual properties, content, and gaming, the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://go-supernova.com/">Supernova</a> is a new app that has now gone live on the Apple and Android app stores billing itself as a new “ethical alternative” to Instagram and Facebook, where most of the ad revenues go to charities. Does it have a chance?</p>
<p>It would be fair to say that after many years of either watching Facebook become a panopticon-like prison which jauntily suggests you join private groups to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/jan-6-capitol-riot-facebook/">topple the US government</a> or doom-scrolling through Instagram, where you and your teens’ mental health is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/18/instagram-investigation-teenagers-children-facebook">slowly eroded</a>, many people would be quite happy with an alternative social media platform with &#8211; please God &#8211; higher-minded principles. A few of these have come and gone over the years (RIP Path) but none have managed to wrestle the masses away from Zuckerberg’s vice-like grip.</p>
<p>Perhaps what people have forgotten is that the only reason Facebook (and by extension, Instagram) are as big as they are is that their advertising revenues prop up these free services. If advertisers had somewhere else to go that could capture the social media crowd with a compelling enough app, Facebook and Insta would start to feel some heat. At least, that’s how the theory goes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249529" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Now, a British entrepreneur, who knows the ad industry inside-out, plans to take on these giants with a solution of his own, designed to appeal to Millenials and Gen Z-ers who are generally led by a desire to support good causes far more than previous generations.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249533" style="width: 478px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249533" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dominic-OMeara-founder-and-CEO-of-Supernova-1.jpg" alt="Dominic O&#039;Meara, founder and CEO of Supernova" width="468" height="429" class="size-full wp-image-2249533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dominic-OMeara-founder-and-CEO-of-Supernova-1.jpg 468w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dominic-OMeara-founder-and-CEO-of-Supernova-1.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dominic-OMeara-founder-and-CEO-of-Supernova-1.jpg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dominic-OMeara-founder-and-CEO-of-Supernova-1.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249533" class="wp-caption-text">Dominic O&#8217;Meara, founder and CEO of Supernova</p></div></p>
<p>Founder and CEO of Supernova, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominic-o-meara-4aa5a6/">Dominic O’Meara</a>, a former Saatchi advertising guru and Bafta Award winner who is largely bootstrapping the startup, said sponsors like ASICS and charities like MQ have chosen to join at the launch because of the app’s “inclusive social network with user safety at it’s heart. It’s exactly this gap that Supernova fills and we’ll be scaling into that gap as the social network that gives back in the months and years ahead.”</p>
<p>He added said: “Our technology and accessibility make it possible for the world to genuinely help each other using social media and the power of advertising. And to see transparently exactly how and where their actions are helping at all times.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Supernova plans to do this by preventing toxicity on its platform (more on how in a moment) and aiming to create a place where users feel “safe, secure and encouraged to have positive, inspiring, life-affirming interaction with their friends&#8230; without having to witness and endure hate, racism, homophobia and extreme politics.”</p>
<p>The business model is simple. It will give away 60% of its advertising revenue to global charities, with the money distributed according to members’ preferences across the following subjects: Climate Change, Animal Welfare, Emergency Causes, Health &amp; Wellbeing, Help the Homeless, Human Rights, Mental Health and Ocean Cleanup. Which causes get the most money is determined by users.</p>
<p>If it can capture 1% or more of the global social media advertising market, says Supernova, it would be passing £600 million a year to charities. By contrast, the equivalent amount coming from Facebook and Instagram would pump out £51 billion. But of course, all that cash currently goes into Zuck’s coffers.</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram famously say they ban hate-speech, but of course, we know this rarely happens in practice. Supernova claims it will have “100% human moderation” to begin with, based on its <a href="https://go-supernova.com/support/communitystandards.html">Community Standards</a>, and even pledges a whole <a href="https://go-supernova.com/support/charter.html">Charter for users</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249534" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249534" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Supernova.jpg" alt="Supernova app" width="1024" height="566" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2249534" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Supernova.jpg 1310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Supernova.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Supernova.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Supernova.jpg?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Supernova.jpg?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Supernova.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249534" class="wp-caption-text">Supernova app</p></div><br />
 <br />
<strong>So what is the app like?</strong></p>
<p>Well, immediately you can see the similarities with Instagram. Users can share photographs and videos along with comments and messaging. Users can follow or be followed (although one or two bugs remain &#8211; my profile appeared to auto-follow users I hadn’t selected).</p>
<p>Users can also set an account to private, explore, follow and block unwanted users &#8211; basically most of the usual social media tools we’ve become used to.</p>
<p>What is different here is in the underlying mechanics.</p>
<p>Firstly, users can nominate in their profile which charitable field they want to support with the cash that Supernova gleans from its ad partners.</p>
<p>Next, instead of inducing narcissism in users, ‘Likes’ work like votes for a share of the ad revenue for charities. When a user’s post is Liked, their choice of charity will earn a bigger slice of the ‘Supernova Action Fund’ as a donation. </p>
<p>When a post gets a Superlike, or a ‘Supernova’, it gets 10x the regular ‘Like’ in votes for the poster’s cause. But there’s a catch, to give a Supernova the user must first earn sufficient ‘Karma Points’, which are somehow determined via the user charter. Presumably this is to incentivize engagement.</p>
<p>So far, global sports brand <a href="https://www.asics.com/gb/en-gb/">ASICS</a> is the first to sponsor Supernova and mental health charity <a href="https://www.mqmentalhealth.org/home/">MQ Mental Health</a> is the first charity selected to benefit.</p>
<p>Next up, unlike Instagram (but more like Facebook) Supernova has a ‘Groups’ facility where users can congregate in, well, groups.</p>
<p>O’Meara claims over £1 million has been invested in Supernova from a ‘friends, family’ funding round, with a larger raise planned for the first half of next year with institutions.</p>
<p>I asked about human moderation. I was told by O&#8217;Meara that it would be done by “a trained team based in the UK and they cover in shifts managed by us 24/7. They are young, smart people mostly computer science grads/ undergrads and our intention is to develop them within the company as we grow, so that our team has an affinity and empathy for the community right from the start.” However, they will be assisted by machine learning as the company scales, he said.</p>
<p>“Supernova will free from the toxic, radicalizing content that is actively promoted through AI on other platforms. As a result, Supernova will certainly not be for everyone, and that is deliberate,” he said.</p>
<p>Will it allow nipples on the platform, which are famously banned from Instagram?</p>
<p>“It all depends on the context and nature of the post and subjects within it, but it would certainly be checked for accordance with our Community Standards. If in breach, it would be removed,” he said.</p>
<p>If the context was a woman explaining breastfeeding, would it be allowed, I asked?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, probably, so long as the intent was clearly informative and addressing a genuine aspect of the subject. If the intent or content was in our view disrespectful/ harmful/ otherwise negative towards the subject and our community, then it would infringe our Community Standards and our Charter and would be removed,” he said.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s in it for advertisers?</p>
<p>O&#8217;Meara said: “Being part of a &#8216;new era&#8217; social media that is doing the right thing is great for their brands (PR) as opposed to being part of an old toxic order that potentially harms their brands. Deloitte tells us that 80% of millennials only want to buy from brands that put others&#8217; interests above their own. Large advertisers are fed up with the social media status quo: I met one yesterday with a global budget in excess of $10BN who told me exactly that.”</p>
<p>“Our product is entirely scaleable and if we reach only 1% of millennials we&#8217;ll serve 40M people with our sponsor&#8217;s ads every day. That&#8217;s quite enough as advertisers are now looking for &#8216;Quality over Quantity&#8217;. The Facebook boycott of 1K+ advertisers spending $4.2BN was an early sign of this and it hasn&#8217;t gone away, there just hasn&#8217;t been an alternative offer available to them and now there is: Supernova,” he added.</p>
<p>Whether Supernova will survive, or perhaps become another “MyEye” &#8211; the streaming social media app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/22/stream-it-like-beckham-global-star-backs-periscopemeerkat-rival-myeye/">launched by David Beckham</a> which suck without a trace &#8211; remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Questions remain over whether being a sort of &#8216;vanilla&#8217; social network where few tough or controversial subjects ever appear will be enough to attract users. And with content moderated by potentially biased humans, will Supernova end up being sued by those who dislike its decisions?</p>
<p>But at least from this first showing, Supernova appears to be off to a good start.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://gdevelop.io/">GDevelop</a> is a game engine that lets you develop a video game without any specific development experience. While the ‘no-code’ trend has been quite popular this year, GDevelop has been around for a few years already.</p>
<p>Florian Rival first started working on GDevelop as an open-source side project. The first public version <a href="https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop">on GitHub</a> was released back in 2014.</p>
<p>With GDevelop, he wanted to make game development as accessible as possible. You can launch GDevelop from a web browser or install it on your computer. You can start from a template, modify it and try it out whenever you want.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249333" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>GDevelop focuses specifically on 2D games as it’s more accessible for both players and developers. When it comes to level design, you can simply drag and drop objects on the scene.</p>
<p>As for game design, you can see all the game mechanisms from the Events tab. Everything is described with a condition and an action — if the player is jumping then animate the character with the ‘jumping’ animation.</p>
<p>There are a lot of actions that come with GDevelop by default. And if you want to do something a bit specific, there’s an extension system that lets you add some logic to your game. Developers can also create their own extension if they want to go further. An extension is a set of conditions and actions, or JavaScript code.</p>
<p>GDevelop leverages web technologies to render the game, such as WebGL, JavaScript and <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/wasm-game-editor-port/">WebAssembly</a>. When you’re ready to export your game, you can export it for the web or turn it into an Android game. On average, half of GDevelop users export their games to Android.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249338" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249338" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/landing-screen-b0da810520d5ca63e72ff25ab7ec0d84.png" alt="" width="1024" height="681" class="size-full wp-image-2249338" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/landing-screen-b0da810520d5ca63e72ff25ab7ec0d84.png 1257w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/landing-screen-b0da810520d5ca63e72ff25ab7ec0d84.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/landing-screen-b0da810520d5ca63e72ff25ab7ec0d84.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/landing-screen-b0da810520d5ca63e72ff25ab7ec0d84.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/landing-screen-b0da810520d5ca63e72ff25ab7ec0d84.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/landing-screen-b0da810520d5ca63e72ff25ab7ec0d84.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249338" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GDevelop</p></div></p>
<p>Over the years, GDevelop has attracted some nice metrics. There are hundreds of games on the <a href="https://gdevelop-app.com/games-showcase/">showcase page</a> on GDevelop’s website. Some games created in GDevelop have become quite popular. For instance, <a href="https://gdevelop-app.com/games/vai-juliette-make-your-own-hypercasual-game-million-downloads-big-brother-brasil-2021/">Vai Juliette</a> reached the number 1 and number 2 spots in the top free download charts on the Play Store and App Store in Brazil. It represents more than a million downloads.</p>
<p>Some developers spend a lot of time working on complex games with GDevelop and release them on Steam or Itch.io. Some brands also use the engine to create promotional games and support a new product launch.</p>
<p>“My dream is that the next Among Us will be developed using GDevelop,” Florian Rival</p>
<p>For all those reasons, Florian Rival is creating a company around GDevelop and is now working full time on the game engine. The startup has recently raised a $1.4 million funding round led by Seedcamp, with Secretfund, Kima Ventures, Ascension, Jabre Capital Partners, The Fund and Foreword.vc also participating. A few business angels also invested, such as Michael Pennington, Ross Sheil, Emmanuel Nataf, Will Neale and Ian Hogarth.</p>
<p>The team of six people is iterating on the open source game engine so that it gets better and better. When it comes to monetization, GDevelop doesn’t want to release a commercial engine. Thanks to the MIT license, game developers still own 100% of their games that they developed using GDevelop.</p>
<p>Instead, the company is thinking about services that could be useful for GDevelop users. For instance, GDevelop could offer a one-click export solution to release a game and monetize it.</p>
<p>Many mobile game developers rely on ads to generate revenue. But integrating ads in your game can be complicated. Developers could choose to integrate ads with GDevelop&#8217;s own ad feature — the startup would keep a cut on ad revenue.</p>
<p>Essentially, as long as GDevelop remains popular, there will be different ways to create revenue streams to support future development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OfBusiness, a New Delhi-headquartered startup that sells industrial goods and provides small businesses with credit, has secured its fourth financing round this year and is now valued at about $5 billion.</p>
<p>Alpha Wave Global, Tiger Global, and SoftBank Vision Fund 2 led the startup&#8217;s $325 million Series G financing round. Alpha Wave Global, formerly known as Falcon Edge Capital, invested in OfBusiness through its new $10B+ fund called Alpha Wave Ventures II.</p>
<p>TechCrunch, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/falcon-edge-capital-eyes-raising-a-fund-of-over-10-billion/"> first reported about Falcon Edge Capital&#8217;s new fund</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/falcon-edge-closes-first-tranche-of-10b-fund-rebrands-as-alpha-wave-global/">rebranding</a>, reported in October that OfBusiness was in talks with Tiger Global and Alpha Wave Global to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/india-ofbusiness-in-talks-to-raise-new-funds-at-over-4-5-billion-valuation/">raise a new round at over $4.6 billion valuation</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249750" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/tiger-global-backs-india-ofbusiness-at-3-billion-valuation/">fourth financing round for OfBusiness this year</a>. The startup was valued at about $800 million in a round it closed in April this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ofbusiness.com/">OfBusiness</a> operates as a raw material aggregator and procurement finance provider. The startup works with banks to offer credit lines to small and medium enterprises that have an annual turnover of over $3 million. The six-year-old startup, co-founded by Asish Mohapatra, a former VC, says it operates in nine business-to-business raw material supply chains.</p>
<p>The platform collects data on customers&#8217; activity that it relies on to underwrite loans to businesses that are using the OfBusiness platform for sourcing raw material and tenders.</p>
<p>OfBusiness has come a long way in the past six years. Within months of its launch, the startup realized that the bigger problem that its customers were facing was working capital. After this realization, Mohapatra began hiring key leaders to build a finance offering. In a podcast last year with an investor, he said when the realization hit him he had little to no understanding of underwriting and how to build a finance business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“OfBusiness is well on its way to create a B2B ecosystem that marries large scale with profitability, health and engagement,&#8221; said Mohapatra in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our march in the last 3 years across all our 3 businesses (B2B Commerce marketplace, Financing and SAAS) has been rapid but there is still long way to go given the depth and unorganized fragmented market structure of B2B in India. We believe that we are in the nascency of the B2B revolution in the country and are privileged to drive it ahead.”</p>
<p>The startup, which has been profitable for the past four years, said its recent expansions has helped it grow its commerce business&#8217; revenue by four-fold this year to $1.7 billion with a net profit of $42.5 million, Mohapatra said.</p>
<p>Oxyzo, OfBusiness&#8217; financing platform that provides cash flow-matched financing to aid commerce clients, recently expanded to various fee income adjacencies that makes it more relevant to its borrowers, it said. Oxyzo&#8217;s AUM is expected to grow 100% this year and has doubled its revenue to $360 million with a profit of $21.6 million. It has been profitable since its inception and is works with about 45 financial institutions as debt partners.</p>
<p>Bidassist, the company’s SaaS offering for marketing, has now grown organically to 2.7 million unique users, making it among India’s largest and most engaged scale platforms for SMBs that are looking for revenue opportunities in the public sector domain.</p>
<p>OfBusiness says its three core offerings work in tandem and create &#8220;a healthy virtuous cycle at scale.&#8221; The startup plans to deploy the fresh funds to make deeper inroads into supply chains on the commerce side, while also broadening its technology stack for its SaaS solutions and financing engine.</p>
<p>Also on the roadmap: exploring the public market. OfBusiness plans to initiate its internal IPO process by mid-next year, the startup said.</p>
