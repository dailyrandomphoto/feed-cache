</div><p id="speakable-summary">For many companies in the United States, a board of directors is a fact of doing business. While sole proprietorships and LLCs are not obligated to have one, C and S corporations must. The board’s goal is to ensure the best is done for the company and its shareholders. While many entrepreneurs see board meetings as a chore, they can be a powerful tool if used well.</p>
<h2>Communicate often</h2>
<p>While board meetings usually happen quarterly, it’s good practice to keep the conversation going in between them. Sending a monthly email update to the board offers multiple advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shorter updates</strong>: Business professionals’ attention spans are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/infographic-shrinking-attention-span-n110801">shrinking</a>. Shorter content is easier to digest, and therefore more likely to be read.</li>
<li><strong>Timely feedback</strong>: A quarter can be a long time, especially for young startups or during challenging times. The monthly format allows the company to receive help or feedback from the board earlier. In business, speed of iteration is key!</li>
<li><strong>Keep them posted</strong>: Keeping directors up to date will avoid lengthy updates during board meetings, ensuring focus remains on strategic conversations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reach out when in need</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			When meeting online, founders should pause often and regularly ask if there are questions — even if moments of silence feel awkward at times — to give directors a better opportunity to speak up.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Board members can also be solicited on an ad-hoc basis &#8212; founders should keep in mind that board members are here to help the company. If you have doubts about a project decision or want a second, informed opinion, reach out to a board member. This is especially true of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/the-hidden-benefits-of-adding-a-cto-to-your-board/">directors</a> who have expertise on a specific topic. A quick five-minute call can be a game changer.</p>
<p>Being a founder can be a lonely experience because it can be difficult to discuss sensitive matters with the team. Board members should sign nondisclosure agreements, allowing entrepreneurs to share confidential information and get a different perspective on things.</p>
<h2>Discuss goals for the next fundraising event</h2>
<p>Founders should make sure to regularly discuss business goals to ensure they reach their next round of funding. Because the industry landscape or economy evolved or the competition stepped up, investors may reconsider their expectations to further fund the company.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As a Battery Ventures associate in 1999, I used to spend my nights highlighting actual magazines called Red Herring, InfoWorld and The Industry Standard, plus my personal favorites StorageWorld and Mass High Tech (because the other VC associates rarely scanned these).</p>
<p>As a 23-year-old, I’d circle the names of much older CEOs who worked at companies like IBM, EMC, Alcatel or Nortel to learn more about what they were doing. The companies were building mainframe-to-server replication technologies, IP switches and nascent web/security services on top.</p>
<p>Flash forward 22 years and, in a way, nothing has changed. We have gone from command line to GUI to now API as the interface innovation. But humans still need an interface, one that works for more types of people on more types of devices. We no longer talk about the OSI stack &#8212; we talk about the decentralized blockchain stack. We no longer talk about compute, data storage and analysis on a mainframe, but rather on the cloud.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problems and opportunities have stayed quite similar, but the markets and opportunities have gotten much larger. AWS and Azure cloud businesses alone added $23 billion of run-rate revenue in the last year, growing at 32% and 50%, respectively &#8212; high growth on an already massive base.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The size of the cybersecurity market has gotten infinitely larger as software eats the world and more people are able to sit and feast at the table from anywhere on Earth (and, soon enough, space).					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The size of the cybersecurity market, in particular, has gotten infinitely larger as software eats the world and more people are able to sit and feast at the table from anywhere on Earth (and, soon enough, space).</p>
<p>Over the course of the last few months, my colleague Spencer Calvert and I released a series of pieces about why this market opportunity is growing so rapidly: <a href="https://ventureinside.com/how-the-shared-responsibility-model-complicates-cloud-security-cb8a7b307195">the rise of multicloud environments</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/data-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-and-vulnerable-resource/">data being generated and stored faster than anyone can keep up with it</a>, <a href="https://ventureinside.com/securing-the-everything-as-a-service-world-eaf5c327c004">SaaS applications powering virtually every function across an organization</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/bring-cisos-into-the-c-suite-to-bake-cybersecurity-into-company-culture/?tpcc=ECTW2020">CISOs’ rise in political power and strategic responsibility.</a></p>
<p>This all ladders up to an estimated &#8212; and we think conservative &#8212; $100 billion of new market value by 2025 alone, putting total market size at close to $280 billion.</p>
<p>In other words, opportunities are ripe for massive business value creation in cybersecurity. We think many unicorns will be built in these spaces, and while we are still in the early innings, there are a few specific areas where we’re looking to make bets (and one big-picture, still-developing area). Specifically, Upfront is actively looking for companies building in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data security and data abstraction.</li>
<li>Zero-trust, broadly applied.</li>
<li>Supply chains.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Data security and abstraction</h2>
<p>Data is not a new thesis, but I am excited to look at the change in data stacks from an initial cybersecurity lens. What set of opportunities can emerge if we view security at the bottom of the stack &#8212; foundational &#8212; rather than as an application at the top or to the side?</p>

<p>For example, data is expanding faster than we can secure it. We need to first know where the (structured and unstructured) data is located, what data is being stored, confirm proper security posture and prioritize fixing the most important issues at the right speed.</p>
<p>Doing this at scale requires smart passive mapping, along with heuristics and rules to pull the signal from the noise in an increasingly data-rich (noisy) world. <a href="https://www.openraven.com/">Open Raven</a>, an Upfront portfolio company, is building a solution to discover and protect structured and unstructured data at scale across cloud environments. New large platform companies will be built in the data security space as the point of control moves from the network layer to the data layer.</p>
<p>We believe Open Raven is poised to be a leader in this space and also will power a new generation of “output” or application companies yet to be funded. These companies could be as big as Salesforce or Workday, built with data abstracted and managed differently from the start.</p>

<p>If we look at security data at the point it is created or discovered, new platforms like Open Raven may lead to the emergence of an entirely new ecosystem of apps, ranging from those Open Raven is most likely to build in-house &#8212; like compliance workflows &#8212; to entirely new companies that rebuild apps we have used since the beginning of time, which includes everything from people management systems to CRMs to product analytics to your marketing attribution tools.</p>
<p>Platforms that lead with a security-first, foundational lens have the potential to power a new generation of applications companies with a laser-focus on the customer engagement layer or the “output” layer, leaving the data cataloging, opinionated data models and data applications to third parties that handle data mapping, security and compliance.</p>

<p>Put simply, if full-stack applications look like layers of the Earth, with UX as the crust, that crust can become better and deeper with foundational horizontal companies underneath meeting all the requirements surrounding personally identifiable information and GDPR, which are foisted upon companies that currently have data <em>everywhere</em>. This can free up time for new application companies to focus their creative talent even more deeply on the human-to-software engagement layer, building superhuman apps for every existing category.</p>
<h2>Zero-trust</h2>
<p>Zero-trust was first coined in 2010, but applications are still being discovered and large businesses are being built around the idea. Zero-trust, for those getting up to speed, is the assumption that anyone accessing your system, devices, etc., is a bad actor.</p>
<p>This could sound paranoid, but think about the last time you visited a Big Tech campus. Could you walk in past reception and security without a guest pass or name badge? Absolutely not. Same with virtual spaces and access. My first in-depth course on zero-trust security was with Fleetsmith. I invested in Fleetsmith in 2017, a young team building software to manage apps, settings and security preferences for organizations powered by Apple devices. Zero-trust in the context of Fleetsmith was about device setup and permissions. Fleetsmith was acquired by Apple in mid-2020.</p>
<p>About the same time as the Fleetsmith acquisition, I met Art Poghosyan and the team at <a href="https://www.britive.com/">Britive</a>. This team is also deploying zero-trust for dynamic permissioning in the cloud. Britive is being built under the premise of zero-trust Just-in-time (JIT) access, whereby users are granted ephemeral access dynamically rather than the legacy process of “checking out” and “checking in” credentials.</p>
<p>By granting temporary privilege access instead of “always-on” credentials, Britive is able to drastically reduce cyber risks associated with over-privileged accounts, the time to manage privilege access and the workflows to streamline privileged access management across multicloud environments.</p>
<p>What’s next in zero-based trust (ZBT)? We see device and access as the new perimeter, as workers flex devices and locations for their work and have invested around this with Fleetsmith and now Britive. But we still think there is more ground to cover for ZBT to permeate more mundane processes. Passwords are an example of something that is, in theory, zero-trust (you must continually prove who you are). But they are woefully inadequate.</p>

<p>Phishing attacks to steal passwords are the most <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/solutions/secure-your-business/business-security-tips/?cmp=knc:ggl:ac:ent:security:8003162844&amp;utm_term=verizon%20breach%20report&amp;utm_medium=knc&amp;utm_source=ggl&amp;utm_campaign=security&amp;utm_content=ac:ent:8003162844&amp;utm_term=verizon%20breach%20report&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw8cCGBhB6EiwAgORey9NsEHC9r5lkOJjXY3z4hn5kmXuHGwTvd-l4GRA3psPS4cGDhFExrRoCdYoQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">common path to data breaches</a>. But how do you get users to adopt password managers, password rotation, dual-factor authentication or even passwordless solutions? We want to back simple, elegant solutions to instill ZBT elements into common workflows.</p>
<h2>Supply chains</h2>
<p>Modern software is assembled using third-party and open-source components. This assembly line of public code packages and third-party APIs is known as a supply chain. Attacks that target this assembly line are referred to as supply chain attacks.</p>
<p>Some supply chain attacks can be mitigated by existing application-security tools like <a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk</a> and other SCA tools for open-source dependencies, such as Bridgecrew to automate security engineering and fix misconfigurations and Veracode for security scanning.</p>
<p>But other vulnerabilities can be extremely challenging to detect. Take the supply chain attack that took center stage &#8212; the SolarWinds hack of 2020 &#8212; in which a small snippet of code was altered in a SolarWinds update before spreading to 18,000 different companies, all of which relied on SolarWinds software for network monitoring or other services.</p>

<p>How do you protect yourself from malicious code hidden in a version update of a trusted vendor that passed all of your security onboarding? How do you maintain visibility over your entire supply chain? Here we have more questions than answers, but securing supply chains is a space we will continue to explore, and we predict large companies will be built to securely vet, onboard, monitor and offboard third-party vendors, modules, APIs and other dependencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While every food delivery company is trying to get an edge on its rivals with discount codes, faster service, and a turn into the realm of spooky with ghost kitchens and dark stores, a startup built on a lighter, social concept &#8212; letting people see what their friends are chomping on, making it possible to order food and drinks for each other and group order, with buyers picking it all up for themselves &#8212; has just raised a substantial Series B and says that it is already profitable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.snackpass.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snackpass</a>, which describes itself as a &#8220;food meets friends&#8221; &#8212; essentially a social commerce platform for ordering from restaurants, with &#8220;snack&#8221;, the CEO tells me, of having a double meaning of eating (of course), and a flirtatious reference to a cutie pie &#8212; has picked up a $70 million, a super-sized Series B that it will be using to continue expanding to more markets in the U.S.</p>
<p>Conceived four years ago while Kevin Tan, the CEO who co-founded the company with Jamie Marshall, was still a student at Yale studying physics, Snackpass has grown by remaining true to its higher-ed roots. The startup now has 500,000 users across 13 college towns, and has seen its growth explode 7x in the last three months alone. This round values the startup at over $400 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest tranche of funding is coming from an interesting group of investors. Led by Craft Ventures, it also includes Andreessen Horowitz (which led its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/snackpass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$21 million Series A</a>), General Catalyst, Y Combinator, and a long list of individual backers that speaks to the attention Snackpass is getting and the place it&#8217;s carving out for itself as a go-to food platform for millennials and younger users.</p>
<p>That list includes AirAngels, the Airbnb alumni investor syndicate; Bastian Lehmann of the Uber-acquired delivery giant Postmates (et tu, Bastian?); David Grutman, a Miami-based hospitality entrepreneur; Draymond Green of the San Francisco Warriors; Gaingels; HartBeat Ventures, Kevin Hart’s venture fund; musician celebs the Jonas Brothers; Shrug Capital (the VC that says it&#8217;s interested in consumer startups that are actually interesting to &#8220;<a href="https://medium.com/@nivo0o0/announcing-shrug-capital-1bfce52fc19c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-tech</a>&#8221; audiences); Stephen Paglucia, co-owner of the Boston Celtics; hip DJ Steve Aoki; Turner Novak of Banana Capital; William Barnes of Moving Capital; and the Uber alumni investor syndicate.</p>
<p>The vast majority of food-ordering platforms these days are focused around delivery and in many cases ways of getting an edge over other platforms in executing on that &#8212; a push that often comes at the expense of margins than are thinner than a Roman pizza. Snackpass&#8217;s big breakthrough, if you could call it that, was to simply dial back from that one-upmanship, moving away from that premise altogether, aiming to disrupt something much more mundane: the queue.</p>
<p>Tan said Snackpass asked its users what they would do if they weren&#8217;t using the app, and they said, &#8220;Oh, I just stand in line to order,&#8221; he told me in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;The market share right now is owned by people standing in line at the register, and placing their order. Our vision is that in five years that will no longer exist, like, there will be no more registers. We don&#8217;t think it makes any sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>He notes that for those who really want delivery, people can opt for that, too &#8212; Snackpass integrates with DoorDash, UberEats and others to fulfill that &#8212; but 90% of the orders on Snackpass are pickup, meaning that not only does the company then not have to deal with its own fleets of delivery people, and the infrastructure of that, but the operating costs to provide that are also not there.</p>
<p>It turns out that actually a lot of young people seem happy to pop out to get something nice to eat. It means they get to socialise, and take a selfie with their food or drink (boba tea figures strongly) at the venue where it&#8217;s being bought. It becomes an experience.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also where the market is in another sense. &#8220;What people don&#8217;t realize is delivery is only 8% of the restaurant industry,&#8221; Tan told me. &#8220;And while it&#8217;s very much competed for by like big companies, and it&#8217;s a huge market, the restaurant industry, is like, much bigger, it&#8217;s $800 billion. And 90% of that purchasing is still offline,&#8221; he continued, referring to the many people who just queue up, order, buy, and leave. &#8220;It&#8217;s anonymous, and it&#8217;s on the verge of disruption. And we&#8217;re focused on that much bigger blue ocean.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its formula seems to be working with its target users. Tan said that the service has 80% penetration with students in the markets where it has launched. The average customer orders four and a half times a month, with some customers ordering every day. &#8220;You can actually see that it&#8217;s like, five to ten times more engagement than the delivery platforms, like UberEats or DoorDash.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s commissions vary and start at 7% and it&#8217;s current suite includes online ordering, self-service kiosks, digital menus, marketing services, and a customer referral program. It&#8217;s already profitable but as it continues to grow (and maybe extend to other demographics) you can imagine it adding and expanding on all of these.</p>
<p>There is something about Snackpass that reminds me a lot of Snapchat, not just that the names have a similar ring to them, and not just that they have resonated with college-aged users (and not just that they both squarely target them). It&#8217;s something of the whimsy of the app, and how it takes a light touch in its approach to do something that might otherwise feel cumbersome, or mundane, or what, basically, older people do.</p>
<p>Right now, there isn&#8217;t much of a social &#8220;user graph&#8221; per se on Snackpass, nor does it integrate particularly deeply with any specific social apps, but you could imagine a partnership there down the line, especially considering that Snap is getting a whole lot more involved with commerce now.</p>
<p>“In building a social experience around food through shared rewards, gifting, and a social activity feed, Snackpass has created a dynamic and attractive restaurant ordering system,” says Bryan Rosenblatt, partner, Craft Ventures, in a statement. “The growth of its marketplace and virality of the product coupled with Snackpass’ outstanding  team and vision, make it the ultimate solution for consumers and businesses alike. We are thrilled to help take Snackpass to the next level with this latest round of funding.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s hard to understand just how steeply the cost of launching and operating satellites has dropped, particularly since the introduction of lower cost launch services from a number of commercial players, and the maturation of the smartphone supply chain. Swarm co-founder and CEO realized just how much the cost curve had changed when she and her co-founder Ben Longmeir realized that they could outfit tiny satellites Longmeir had created as a kind of space lover&#8217;s hobby with the equipment needed to provide low-bandwidth connectivity to low-powered devices around the world.</p>
<p>In this week&#8217;s episode of Found, Sara walks us through how she went from an engineering career that included stints at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Google, to building Swarm as a first-time founder and CEO. We covered a range of topics including how Sara and Ben decided who would be CEO, what it&#8217;s like leading a small but growing team, and how to evaluate your decisions as a founder, and commit to a course of action to move forward.</p>
<p>Sara was extremely candid with us about her experience as a founder and CEO, and this is definitely one of our most open and honest conversations to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Successfully selling a business has much to do with timing. For many entrepreneurs, it’s the high-stakes end game where they cash out and reap the rewards of their efforts. At a certain point, when both buyers and sellers are working hard to close the deal, negotiations can move very quickly. If you’re the seller, this is not the time to discover unanticipated problems in your business.</p>
<p>Distressingly often, these problems are related to employment. Inattention to employment issues can have a significant impact on deals — from preventing closings and reducing the deal value to altering the deal terms or significantly limiting the pool of potential buyers.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Poor compliance, lack of policies or flawed practices mean potential liability exposure or expensive policy revisions and employee retraining — all of which can devalue your business.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Fortunately, such issues typically can be resolved well in advance with a little forethought and legal guidance. It&#8217;s important to get your employment ducks in a row long before you start planning your exit.</p>
<p>What follows is an overview of the three main categories of employment issues that can derail or delay a sale. For the most part, these assume an asset sale, but may vary in the case of a stock sale.</p>
<h2>Compliance</h2>
<p>By far the most significant problem is general employment law compliance. This means creating strong employment policies and practices that are documented, in place and operating long before you pursue a deal. The key area is wage and hour issues — timekeeping and payroll practices, worker classification issues (employee vs. independent contractor; exempt vs. non-exempt), meal and rest periods, PTO policies and payouts at termination.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleerly Coronary, a company that uses A.I powered imaging to analyze heart scans, announced a $43 million Series B funding this week. The funding comes at a moment when it seems that a new way of screening for heart disease is on its way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleerly was started in 2017 by James K. Min a cardiologist, and the director of the Dalio Institute for Cardiac Imaging at New York Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical College. The company, which uses A.I to analyze detailed CT scans of the heart, has 60 employees, and has raised $54 million in total funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Series B round was led by Vensana Capital, but also included LVR Health, New Leaf Venture Partners, DigiTx Partners, and Cigna Ventures. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s aim is to provide analysis of detailed pictures of the human heart that have been examined by artificial intelligence. This analysis is based on images taken via Cardiac Computer Tomography Angiogram (CTA), a new, but rapidly growing manner of scanning for plaques. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We focus on the entire heart, so every artery, and its branches, and then atherosclerosis characterization and quantification,” says Min. “We look at all of the plaque buildup in the artery, [and] the walls of the artery, which historical and traditional methods that we&#8217;ve used in cardiology have never been able to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleerly is a web application, and it requires that a CTA image specifically, which the A.I. is trained to analyze, is actually taken when patients go in for a checkup. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZQzA8F2kMd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/ai-is-ready-to-take-on-a-massive-healthcare-challenge/">AI is ready to take on a massive healthcare challenge</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AI is ready to take on a massive healthcare challenge&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/ai-is-ready-to-take-on-a-massive-healthcare-challenge/embed/#?secret=ZQzA8F2kMd" data-secret="ZQzA8F2kMd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a patient goes in for a heart exam after experiencing a symptom like chest pain, there are a few ways they can be screened. They might undergo a stress test, an echocardiogram (ECG), or a coronary angiogram – a catheter and x-ray-based test. CTA is a newer form of imaging in which a scanner takes detailed images of the heart, which is illuminated with an injected dye. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleerly’s platform is designed to analyze those CTA images in detail, but they’ve only recently become a first-line test (a go-to, in essence) when patients come in with suspected heart problems. The European Society of Cardiology </span><a href="https://ihsmd.org/coronary-cta-as-first-line-diagnostic-test/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">updated guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make CTA a first-line test in evaluating patients with chronic coronary disease. In the UK, it became a first-line test in the evaluation of patients with chest pain </span><a href="https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2020/09/21/19/06/state-of-the-art-review-on-ccta"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTA is already used in the US, but guidelines may expand how </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">often </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">it’s actually used. A </span><a href="https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2020/09/21/19/06/state-of-the-art-review-on-ccta"><span style="font-weight: 400;">review on CTA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published on the American College of Cardiology website notes that it shows “extraordinary potential.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s movement on the insurance side, too. In 2020, United Healthcare </span><a href="https://www.uhcprovider.com/en/resource-library/news/2020-network-bulletin-featured-articles/0520-coronary-cta-reimbursement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company will now reimburse for CTA scans when they’re ordered to examine low-to medium risk patients with chest pain. Reimbursement qualification is obviously a huge boon to broader adoption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTA imaging might not be great for people who already have stents in their hearts, or, says Min, those who are just in for a routine checkup (there is low-dose radiation associated with a CTA scan). Rather, Cleerly will focus on patients who have shown symptoms or are already at high risk for heart disease. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC estimates that currently </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">18.2 million adults</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> currently have coronary artery heart disease (the most common kind), and that </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/risk_factors.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">47 percent of Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have one of the three most prominent risk factors for the disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or a smoking habit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These shifts (and anticipated shifts) in guidelines suggest that a lot more of these high-risk patients may be getting CTA scans in the future, and Cleerly has been working on mining additional information from them in several large-scale clinical trials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of different risk factors that contribute to heart disease, but the most basic understanding is that heart attacks happen when plaques build up in the arteries, which narrows the arteries and constricts the flow of blood. Clinical trials have suggested that the types of plaques inside the body may contain information about how risky certain blockages are compared to others beyond just much of the artery they block. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109718343717?via%3Dihub"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 25,251 patients found that, indeed, the percentage of construction in the arteries increases the risk of heart attack. But the type of plaque in those arteries identified high-risk patients better than other measures. Patients who went on to have sudden heart attacks, for example, tended to have higher levels of fibrofatty or necrotic core plaque in their hearts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These results do suggest that it’s worth knowing a bit more detail about plaque in the heart. Note that Min is an author of this study, but it was also conducted at 13 different medical centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with all A.I based diagnostic tools the big question is: How well does it actually recognize features within a scan? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment FDA documents emphasize that it is </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K190868.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not meant to supplant a trained medical professional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who can interpret the results of a scan. But tests have suggested it fares pretty well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A June 2021 </span><a href="https://www.journalofcardiovascularct.com/article/S1934-5925(21)00081-2/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compared Cleerly’s A.I analysis of CTA scans to that of three expert readers, and found that the A.I had a diagnostic accuracy of about 99.7 percent when evaluating patients who had severe narrowing in their arteries. Three of nine study authors hold equity in Cleerly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this most recent round of funding, Min says he aims to pursue more commercial partnerships and scale up to meet the existing demand. “We have sort of stayed under the radar, but we came above the radar because now I think we&#8217;re prepared to fulfill demand,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the product itself will continue to be tested and refined. Cleerly is in the midst of seven performance indication studies that will evaluate just how well the software can spot the litany of plaques that can build up in the heart.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Making the choice to adopt, or to find an adopting family, is a legally complex, emotionally taxing, expensive and time-consuming process. <a href="https://pairtreefamily.com">PairTree</a> aims to make one part at least considerably easier and faster with its online matching platform where expectant mothers and hopeful adopters can find each other without the facilitation of an agency or other organization. The company has just raised a $2.25 million seed round, a rarity in the industry.</p>
<p>The path to adoption is different for everyone, but there are generally some things they have in common: Once the process is started, it can take upwards of $50,000 and over a year-and-a-half to organize a match. While some of this comprises the ordinary legal hurdles involved in any adoption, a big part of it is simply that there are limited opportunities for adoption, and compatibility isn&#8217;t guaranteed. As many people considering adoption are doing so on the heels of unsuccessful fertility treatment, it can be a lot to take on and a dispiriting wait.</p>
<p>Erin Quick, CEO and co-founder (with CTO Justin Friberg) of PairTree, said that the modern adoption landscape is marked by the fact that nearly 95 percent of adoptions are open, meaning there is ongoing contact between a biological mother and adopting family.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be working together forever, and that makes finding a highly compatible match that much more important,&#8221; Quick, herself a happy adopter, told TechCrunch in an interview. But because of the way adoption is generally done — through agencies licensed by states — there are limitations on how far anyone involved can reach.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so bound by geography,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s regulated at the state level and has been facilitated by state level, not because of state laws — there&#8217;s no rule saying you can&#8217;t adopt out of state — but because the facilitators are small nonprofits. They bind themselves to their geographic region because that&#8217;s what they can serve. We&#8217;re building a platform that makes what people are already doing much easier and more efficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>That platform is in many ways very much like a dating app, though of course the comparison is not exact and does not reflect the gravity of choosing to adopt. But like in the dating world, in adoption you have a cloud of people looking to connect over something highly dependent on personality and individual needs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168876" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/filter-families.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168876" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2168876" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/filter-families.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="708" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/filter-families.jpg 1259w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/filter-families.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/filter-families.jpg?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/filter-families.jpg?resize=768,531 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/filter-families.jpg?resize=680,470 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/filter-families.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2168876" class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of the way expectant mothers can filter and search for compatible adopting families.</p></div></p>
<p>PairTree onboards both expectant mothers and adopters with personality tests — not the light-hearted stuff of OkCupid but a broader, more consequential set of Jungian archetypes that signal a person&#8217;s high-level priorities in life. Think &#8220;wants to travel and learn&#8221; versus &#8220;wants to provide and nurture&#8221; (not that these are necessarily incompatible) — they serve as important indicators of preferences that might not be so easily summarized with a series of checkboxes. That&#8217;s not the only criterion, of course. Other demographic and personal details are also collected.</p>
<p>The adopters are added to a pool through which expectant mothers can sift and, if desired, contact (in this, Quick suggested, PairTree mirrors Bumble, where women must message first). PairTree also does basic due diligence stuff like identify verification and confirmation of other important steps like home studies.</p>
<p>If a likely match is found, all the relevant information is passed to the adoption facilitator, who will be coordinating the other legal and financial steps. PairTree isn&#8217;t looking to replace these agencies — in fact Quick said that they have been huge proponents of the platform, since it can shorten wait times and improve outcomes. She said based on their existing successful adoptions that the wait can be cut by half or even two-thirds, and thus the cost (which involves recurring payments as the agency searches and does the legal work) by a similar amount.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are small nonprofits; they don&#8217;t have a lot of tech chops. When we launched we went to attorneys first, actually, and we were surprised when agencies started reaching out,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>Agencies have been referring their adopters to PairTree, which has led to a lot of early traction, Quick said. And importantly, they&#8217;ve seen great diversity in their early success.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adoption has historically been denied by faith-based systems — LGBTQ families and single women have been subject to discrimination,&#8221; she noted. And in fact just last week a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/17/supreme-court-sides-with-catholic-adoption-agency-that-refuses-to-work-with-lgbt-couples.html">Supreme Court decision</a> held up the right of religious adoption agencies to deny services to same-sex couples. Quick was proud to say that they have already facilitated adoptions by same-sex couples and single parents.</p>
<p>The company will also set aside 5 percent of its net profits, which hopefully will manifest in volume, for the Lifetime Healing Foundation, which offers counseling and support to birth mothers who have gone though the adoption process.</p>
<p>The $2.25 million seed round was led by Urban Innovation Fund, with Founder Collective, Female Founders Alliance and Techstars participating. It will surprise few to hear that adoption is not a particularly hot industry for venture capital, but rising interest and investment in fertility tech may have shed light on opportunities in adjacent spaces. Adoption is one where significant improvements can be enabled by technology, meaning startups can grow fast while having a positive impact.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the money to expand its product portfolio, pursue more partnerships, and perhaps most importantly for its users, build a native mobile app, since 90 percent of the service&#8217;s viewership is mobile.</p>
<p>“We’re grateful to our expert and diverse group of investors who share our vision that adoption should be a viable path to parenting for more people,&#8221; said Quick in the release announcing the raise. &#8220;Like us, our investors believe in the importance of supporting Biological and Adopting Families along with the Adoptees, because adoption is not a single transaction but a journey they’re taking over the course of a lifetime.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://outschool.com/">Outschool</a> founder Amir Nathoo has a message to the edtech sector, which recently found itself under a spotlight thanks to the pandemic: Add your voice, and don’t try to always appear neutral.</p>
<p>The founder of the unicorn business penned a statement, co-signed by other edtech leaders, promoting the continuance of teachers being allowed to teach critical race theory in classrooms across the country. The learning framework, which has been the subject <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/22525983/map-critical-race-theory-legislation-teaching-racism"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of recent legislative debate,</span></a> covers the acknowledgement of institutional, and systemic racism in the United States. Critics of critical race theory say that CTR can add more divisiveness to an already polarized world, while supporters see the framework as key to understanding the role that racism plays in society and how current systems perpetuate inequality.</p>
<p>“As a nation, we must take a stand that teaching the wrongs of racism is not &#8216;divisive&#8217;; it is imperative,” the statement reads. “Many of these new laws will require teaching &#8216;both sides&#8217; of a lesson about race or current events, if permitted at all,&#8221; a nuance that would make it difficult for teachers to condemn history like lynching or Jim Crow&#8217;s legacy.</p>
<p>It goes on to pledge that, “as CEOs and Board Members of education technology companies, we are taking a stand to say that any new law that restricts teaching racism in a lesson is unacceptable.”</p>
<blockquote><p>We stand with the thousands of teachers who have come together to protest these laws restricting racism lessons.<br />
We stand with the millions of learners they will impact.<br />
We are signing this letter today so that teachers and students can openly discuss the experiences of Black youth today in the context of the George Floyd protests of 2020.<br />
Above all, we are signing this letter today to say racism is wrong and that hatred based on the color of someone’s skin, religious beliefs, gender, or sexual orientation is wrong, unequivocally wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Signatures on the statement include a number of notable founders and investors in edtech, giving weight to the statement: </span></p>

<h2>Mission-oriented politics</h2>
<p>There is a growing perspective in Silicon Valley that companies should only get involved in politics when it is related to their mission and can impact their business.</p>
<p>The conversation began with Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publishing a memo</span></a> that banned the debate of causes and politics internally that are unrelated to work. Coinbase has since been joined by Basecamp, and there’s a pseudonymous Twitter account, Mission Protocol, dedicated to helping other startups adopt a code of conduct that “follows in Brian Armstrong’s footsteps.”</p>
<p>“We started this project because existing codes of conduct and conversations around social responsibility didn&#8217;t have a voice for what is most important: staying focused on the good we actually deliver for society through our missions,” a tweet from the account reads.</p>
<p>In an interview, Nathoo said that critical race theory “is clearly related” to its mission, but that his company is also taking an “expansive view of how our community can be impacted.” The company says it intends to engage, and add their voice, to issues around race and inequality.</p>
<p>“Ideally, companies would stay out of politics but that&#8217;s not the reality that we live in,” he said. “We think it’s an abdication of corporate responsibility to try and pretend that there&#8217;s both sides to every argument. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s right, and we intend to take a different path on corporate responsibility than other startups might have taken.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.allhere.com/">AllHere</a> CEO Joanna Smith, who signed the statement, told TechCrunch that the statement is tied heavily to her mission. Her company developed a 24/7 chatbot to help families and kids that have issues with absenteeism at schools. The company focuses on supporting families, through two-way text and in-person intervention, to get better outcomes and lessen learning gaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think every startup has to be aware of the environment within which they operate,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think specifically in education technologies, it would be very difficult to scale a company that&#8217;s directly interfacing and interacting with families and kids, if the company itself is not aware of, or reflective of the needs and priorities of those who they are attempting to serve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have the luxury of putting on blinders to the realities that families and kids live in, which, for AllHere, includes transportation, health care, absenteeism, mental health and, of course, how families see the world,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What the &#8216;nonpolitical&#8217; startup leader teaches us about company culture&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/what-the-non-political-startup-leader-teaches-us-about-company-culture/embed/#?secret=SLCj4OuxsF" data-secret="SLCj4OuxsF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The debate is more complex than pro-Coinbase and anti-Coinbase. For example, both companies present an alternative to how startups should address politics: Tie it to the mission, and view the mission as wide-ranging and inclusive.</p>
<p>Nathoo said that a small number of edtech leaders were invited to sign the edtech statement to start. Of those who didn’t sign, the main reasons were disagreement with messaging, or worry about getting involved in politics.</p>
<p>Edtech startups are in a unique spot to address racism because of the content and mission that many have. Quizlet has a number of free, downloadable lessons for educators to address topics like mass incarceration and policing, the fight for women’s suffrage, and the coronavirus in Black America, for example. Outschool has a number of classes offered about anti-racism, including <a href="https://outschool.com/classes/be-the-rainbow-in-somebodys-cloud-anti-racism-and-empathy-for-kids-4-6-dKHKOA7r?sectionUid=5f6da1d2-1582-41d4-b1c1-a99bbfd9a5d4#abkosjggxe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an $11 one-time class for kids ages 4-6. </span></a>There&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done.</p>
<p>Nathoo expects that Outschool’s business, which was recently valued at over $1 billion, will benefit from this choice because of “greater trust and connection” with the community and staff. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medium, for example, recently lost more employees</span></a> after CEO Ev Williams published a culture memo, in the wake of a failed unionization attempt.</p>
<p>Even with this perspective, Nathoo admits that the company “is not where it wants to be&#8221; on diversity, and thinks that there is work left to be done. It’s up to future employees on if today’s effort, rallying against the diminishment of critical race theory and for more conversations of racism, will either be an attractive, or dissuasive, reason to join the team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The days of a scrolling to the end of your Instagram feed look to be coming to an end. After adding algorithmic suggestions<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/instagram-finds-new-ad-space-at-the-end-of-your-feed-with-launch-of-suggested-posts-feature/"> to the bottom of the app last year</a>, Instagram is running a test that would splice more recommended posts from accounts you don&#8217;t follow into the feed with those you do.</p>
<p>In the next few days, the company will begin testing an expansion of &#8220;Suggested Posts&#8221; which would sprinkle that content through the regular feed. As it stands now, Suggested Posts appear at the bottom of Instagram after you&#8217;ve scrolled through all of the content from people you follow and hit the &#8220;You&#8217;re all caught up&#8221; message that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/facebook-and-instagram-your-activity-time/">app implemented in 2018</a>. Depending on how many accounts you follow, it&#8217;s possible to not run into that message or Instagram&#8217;s recommendations very often, if at all.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ejIxE9bAPn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/instagram-finds-new-ad-space-at-the-end-of-your-feed-with-launch-of-suggested-posts-feature/">Instagram finds new ad space at the end of your feed with launch of &#8216;Suggested Posts&#8217; feature</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Instagram finds new ad space at the end of your feed with launch of &#8216;Suggested Posts&#8217; feature&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/instagram-finds-new-ad-space-at-the-end-of-your-feed-with-launch-of-suggested-posts-feature/embed/#?secret=ejIxE9bAPn" data-secret="ejIxE9bAPn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In addition to boosting the prominence of Suggested Posts, Instagram will test an option that lets users &#8220;snooze&#8221; the feature, removing it from the feed for 30 days. Anyone in the test will be able to offer feedback when a specific post doesn&#8217;t interest them, but it sounds like you won&#8217;t be able to disable Suggested Posts in the feed in a permanent way.</p>
<p>The Suggested Posts expansion will be accompanied by a way for users to shape what they see through managing their interests — stuff like cats, makeup or basketball. If you&#8217;ve seen enough cats, you can toggle that interest off or tell Instagram that you never wanted to see those damn cats to begin with when it shows you the next one.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2169220 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/instagram-suggested-posts-topics.png" alt="" width="2028" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/instagram-suggested-posts-topics.png 2028w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/instagram-suggested-posts-topics.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/instagram-suggested-posts-topics.png?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/instagram-suggested-posts-topics.png?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/instagram-suggested-posts-topics.png?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/instagram-suggested-posts-topics.png?resize=1536,776 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/instagram-suggested-posts-topics.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2028px) 100vw, 2028px" /></p>
<p>A Facebook spokesperson described the expansion of Suggested Posts to TechCrunch as an &#8220;extension&#8221; of the Instagram feed, noting that the ratio of these algorithmic recommendations to posts from followed accounts will be variable based on how someone uses the app.</p>
<p>The test will roll out to a small number of users in English-speaking countries only, though the company declined to specify how many accounts will be involved.</p>
<p>The experiment might not make it into the final product, but from the way the winds over at Facebook have been blowing lately it looks pretty likely. Like we mentioned, Instagram and parent company Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/facebook-and-instagram-your-activity-time/">introduced some tools</a> to give people more control over their own behavior on the notoriously addictive-by-design apps back in 2018, including the &#8220;You&#8217;re all caught up&#8221; message and a way to track time spent.</p>
<p>Those tools weren&#8217;t a sea change for a company that generally values keeping people glued to its services (and its ads) at all costs, but they showed that Facebook was at least mildly self aware of the conversation about social media addiction sweeping through the tech world at the time.</p>
<p>In 2020, it sounds like Facebook is done humoring those concerns. Instagram is feeling the heat from TikTok&#8217;s preternaturally well-tuned endless algorithmic feed and booming success. Like it has so many times in the past, the company is looking to shift its own identity to chase a threatening competitor rather than staying the course or trying something new.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YI73QvuIWx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/facebook-and-instagram-your-activity-time/">Facebook and Instagram now show how many minutes you use them</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook and Instagram now show how many minutes you use them&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/facebook-and-instagram-your-activity-time/embed/#?secret=YI73QvuIWx" data-secret="YI73QvuIWx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new way Suggested Posts work is just a test for now, but mixing algorithmic suggestions into the feed with posts from accounts you follow would be a pretty big change to the core way the app works. As it stands, if people want a truly endless Instagram experience they could turn to the Explore tab or scroll past the &#8220;caught up&#8221; message. Many doubtless did to stave off boredom, to the likely<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/facebook-addiction-research/"> detriment of their mental health</a>.</p>
<p>But under the test, it will be less possible to use Instagram to only keep up with just the accounts that you&#8217;ve got a personal interest in, whether they&#8217;re friends, local businesses or influencers of your choosing. Instagram wants to inject more of what it wants you to see into that experience, or what the company believes you&#8217;d want to see but you just don&#8217;t know it yet.</p>
<p>The end result might not be that noticeable for people who follow huge swaths of accounts already and rarely meet the end of their feed, but it strays even further from the original product — a distant memory at this point — while giving Instagram a way to keep people on the app for longer while serving them more ads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five-year old self-driving truck startup Embark Trucks Inc. said Wednesday it would merge with special purpose acquisition company Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp. II in a deal valued at $5.2 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://embarktrucks.com/">Embark</a> takes a different approach to autonomous trucking: As opposed to manufacturing and operating a fleet of trucks themselves, which is the route rival TuSimple is taking, Embark offers its AV software as a service. Carriers and fleets can pay a per-mile subscription fee to access it. The company includes carriers Mesilla Valley Transportation and Bison Transport, and companies Anheuser-Busch InBev and HP Inc., among its partners.</p>
<p>Carriers purchase trucks with compatible hardware directly from OEMs, so Embark says it has designed its system to be “platform agnostic” across multiple components and manufacturers. The company says its software can simulate up to 1,200, 60-second scenarios per second, and make adaptive predictions using those scenarios for the behavior of other vehicles on the road.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Embark said in an investor presentation for the SPAC deal that it was targeting “driver-out,” or operating on roads without a safety driver, by 2023 and launching at a commercial scale across the American sunbelt the following year. However, Embark still has technical milestones yet to achieve, noting in the presentation that the software still needs to accomplish actions, such as interactions with emergency vehicles and responding to blown tires and other mechanical failures.</p>

<p>Upon closing, the transaction will inject Embark with around $615 million in gross cash proceeds, including $200 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE) funding from investors, including CPP Investments, Knight-Swift Transportation, Mubadala Capital, Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management.</p>
<p>Embark also said former Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was joining its board, likely a boon for a company operating in the autonomous trucking industry, which is still only authorized for commercial deployment in 24 states.</p>
<p>Embark was founded in 2016 by CEO Alex Rodrigues and CTO Brandon Moak, who worked together on autonomous driving while completing engineering degrees from Canada&#8217;s University of Waterloo. After launching out of Y Combinator, the company quickly went on to raise $117 million in total funding, including a $30 million Series B led by Sequoia Capital and a $70 million Series C led by Tiger Global Management.</p>
<p>The transaction is anticipated to close in the second half of 2021. The company joins competitor AV trucking developer Plus in going public via a SPAC merger. TuSimple opted for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/self-driving-truck-startup-tusimple-files-to-go-public/">traditional initial public offering</a> in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/hunterwalk/status/1407711650442924033">this Hunter Walk tweet</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1407711957449334789">the ensuing chatter</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch</strong> recently sat down with <strong>Leading Investor</strong> from <strong>Well Known Firm</strong> to chat about their investing theses, the state of today&#8217;s venture capital market, and why prices are so high for early-stage startups.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been hunting down Leading Investor for some time, so it&#8217;s great to get their thoughts on today&#8217;s startup market and the larger venture capital industry. Let&#8217;s have some fun!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TechCrunch:</strong> To kick things off, the early-stage startup market has been super active lately. How has the accelerating cadence of deal-making impacted how you and Well Known Firm invest?</p>
<p><strong>Leading Investor:</strong> We&#8217;ve made no changes to our process. Everyone who has is weak of conviction and poor of wallet.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Got it, got it. The rapid-fire, early-stage market, though, does seem expensive at times. At least compared to historical norms. Are you worried about overpaying for nascent startup shares?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Every deal that we&#8217;ve been a part of has been fairly priced. Every deal that we didn&#8217;t win was overpriced. Every deal we didn&#8217;t see was stupid.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Cool. Sure. Let&#8217;s talk about the technology market more generally. Where are you seeing the most startup opportunity? Or perhaps more simply, where are you paying the most attention today for future deals?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Please consult our portfolio page. Here is a name of a startup we&#8217;ve backed. Here&#8217;s another. Those are the hot areas and the hot companies. All other areas are ice-cold, overpriced, and generally over-hyped.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> So &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Let me cut you off there to name drop Eric from Zoom, with whom I have a great relationship. Salesforce. Snowflake. On-demand pricing. Historical Twilio reference. Also have you read Recently Published Book? Someone gave me a copy and I read the dust cover. Books are good. I read them.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Right. Turning to the venture capital market, how competitive is Well Known Firm these days? Other firms are offering more services in addition to capital than you are. Does that impact your win rate in competitive deals?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Our firm&#8217;s services are real and impactful and accretive. Other VCs offer services but don&#8217;t deliver. You have to deliver. Delivery is key. We&#8217;re like the AWS of service delivery. Except free. We only demand the right to profit from founder success while enriching ourselves as the cost of our fine, free services.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> All right. Let&#8217;s talk about the exit market. We&#8217;ve seen a pretty active IPO market, and TechCrunch has heard that SPACs are getting incredibly frisky, even pinging Series B-funded companies in case they want to go public. What&#8217;s your take on that?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Here&#8217;s a generic answer that doesn&#8217;t answer your question but ensures that my portfolio companies continue to receive all possible inbound in case we need to float a company that won&#8217;t make it as a venture-backed, private company. Public investors are dumb and will happily hold our bags. They are the valets of the investing world.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Last question, how are returns at your firm? You&#8217;ve raised successively larger funds over the years. Is your IRR holding up as you&#8217;ve taken more capital under management?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Recall that Well Known Firm invested in Very Old Company, so our returns have historically been strong. Regarding Every Deal Since Then, it&#8217;s a bit too soon to tell. But recall Very Old Company that did well. That&#8217;s how we do things at Well Known Firm.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Sorry one more before we let you go. Your firm still only has male partners and nearly all of them are white. Why has progress been so slow in building a more diverse team at Well Known Firm?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Sorry, I have a hard stop that started 15 seconds ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The notorious Clop ransomware operation appears to be back in business, just days after<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/ukrainian-police-arrest-multiple-clop-ransomware-gang-suspects/"> Ukrainian police arrested six alleged members of the gang</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, a law enforcement operation conducted by the National Police of Ukraine, along with officials from South Korea and the U.S., saw the arrest of multiple suspects believed to be linked to the Clop <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> gang.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> It&#8217;s believed to be the first time a national law enforcement group carried out mass arrests involving a ransomware group.</span></p>
<p>The Ukrainian police also claimed at the time to have successfully shut down the server infrastructure used by the gang. But it doesn’t seem the operation was completely successful.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the Clop operation fell silent following the arrests, the gang has this week published a fresh batch of confidential data which it claims to have stolen from two new victims — a farm equipment retailer and an architects office — on its dark web site, seen by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>If true — and neither of the alleged victims responded to TechCrunch’s request for comment — this would suggest that the ransomware gang remains active, despite last week’s first-of-its-kind law enforcement sting. This is likely because the suspects cuffed included only those who played a lesser role in the Clop operation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">Cybersecurity</a> firm Intel 471 said <a href="https://twitter.com/Intel471Inc/status/1405292359286358019">it believes</a> that last week&#8217;s arrests targeted the money-laundering portion of the operation, with core members of the gang not apprehended.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not believe that any core actors behind Clop were apprehended,&#8221; the security company said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>&#8220;The overall impact to Clop is expected to be minor, although this law enforcement attention may result in the Clop brand getting abandoned as we&#8217;ve recently seen with other ransomware groups like DarkSide and Babuk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clop appears to still be in business, but it remains to be seen how long the group will remain operational. Not only have law enforcement operations dealt numerous blows to ransomware groups this year, such as U.S. investigators&#8217; recent recovery of millions in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> they claim was paid in ransom to the Colonial Pipeline hackers, but Russia has this week confirmed it will begin to work with the U.S. to locate cybercriminals.</p>
<p>Russia has until now taken a hands-off approach when it comes to dealing with hackers. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russian-security-chief-says-moscow-will-cooperate-with-us-against-hackers-report-2021-06-23/">Reuters reported Wednesday</a> that the head of the country’s Federal Security Service (FSB) Alexander Bortnikov was quoted as saying it will co-operate with U.S. authorities on future cybersecurity operations.</p>
<p>Intel 471 previously said that it does not believe the key members of Clop were arrested in last week’s operation because “they are probably living in Russia,&#8221; which has long provided safe harbor to cybercriminals by refusing to take action.</p>
<p>The Clop ransomware gang was first spotted in early 2019, and the group has since been linked to a number of high-profile attacks. These include the breach of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/execupharm-clop-ransomware/">U.S. pharmaceutical giant ExecuPharm</a> in April 2020 and the recent data breach at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/accellion/">Accellion</a>, which saw hackers exploit flaws in the IT provider’s software to steal data from dozens of its customers including the University of Colorado and cloud security vendor Qualys.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Video game giant Electronic Arts is continuing to make M&amp;A moves as it looks to bulk up its presence in the mobile gaming world.</p>
<p>Fresh off the $2.4 billion acquisition of Glu Mobile this past April, their biggest purchase to date, Electronic Arts announced Wednesday that they are buying Warner Bros. Games’ mobile gaming studio Playdemic for $1.4 billion in an all-cash deal. The Manchester studio is best known for its release &#8220;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/golf-clash/id1089225191">Golf Clash</a>&#8221; which the studio boasts has more than 80 million downloads globally.</p>
<p>The rather ominously named startup is being jettisoned to its new home ahead of the $43 billion WarnerMedia-Discovery deal where the rest of the Warner Bros. Games division will live post-merger.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Electronic Arts is the second-largest Western video games company with a market cap around $40 billion. Their success has largely come from desktop and console titles, including titles in their most popular franchises like Battlefield, Star Wars and Titanfall. Mobile dominance hasn&#8217;t come easy to the company, which has spent much of the past decade or so trying to keep pace with competitors like Activision Blizzard which struck gold with its 2016 King acquisition. <i></i></p>
<p>Electronic Arts has been on a studio-buying spree as of late &#8212; in 2021 they&#8217;ve announced three major acquisitions worth some $5 billion combined.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s become increasingly obvious over the last few years, as Vladimir Putin has tightened his grip on his country, that Russian entrepreneurs who want to engage properly with the rest of the world have had to leave their mother country. Gone are the days when a startup in Russia might attract attention from many Western investors. The same, alas, is true of Russian-speaking Belorussians, many of whom have left the country after brutal crackdowns there. Ukraine’s economy also remains sub-par due to the ongoing Russian aggression in the East of the country. So it’s fallen to enterprising Russian-speaking investors in and outside Russia to work out the best ways to harness the obvious talent out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.leta.vc/">Leta Capital</a> makes a play of investing in Russian-speaking entrepreneurs based just about anywhere. It’s now launching its third and largest fund to date and says it will invest over $100 million in U.K., European, and U.S.-based, growth-stage tech companies over the next three years. Its focus will be seed, A and B-round investments. It intends to invest in the range of $2-5 million and will be focused on software, IT and internet technologies</p>
<p>The new fund will seek to home in on East European and Russian-speaking entrepreneurs. Particularly those operating out of international hubs such as London and New York.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Leta’s founder and former tech entrepreneur Alexander Chachava says Russian-speaking startups based abroad are often these days overlooked and under-valued by Western VCs and investors, and I dare say he’s right. Prejudice isn’t just about skin color, as we all know.</p>
<p>Chachava says his fund has invested over $45 million to date since 2012, going into 30 technology companies including Synthesis AI, Unigine, InDriver, NovaKid (which I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/novakids-esl-app-for-children-raises-4-25m-series-a-led-by-portfolio-and-learnstart-investors/">covered last year</a>) and 365Scores.</p>
<p>Exits include the sale of Bright Box HK to Zurich Insurance Group in 2017, and WeWork’s acquisition of sales and marketing platform Unomy.</p>
<p>Chachava said: “While we are significantly broadening our geographic focus toward key global hubs, our strategy effectively remains the same: to identify exciting, high-potential technology startups and entrepreneurs, and support them in realizing their international ambitions.”</p>
<p>Chachava says his own research suggests there are in excess of 17,000 Russian-speaking and East European tech entrepreneurs and startups active in the U.K., Europe and U.S.</p>
<p>“Our analysis shows they continue to be undervalued and overlooked for funding, despite often generating significant cash when it comes to ARR. These entrepreneurs are some of the most dynamic and technically skilled in the world, and for investors, they represent a massive untapped opportunity.”</p>
<p>He has a point. Significant businesses such as Telegram, Revolut, TradingView, PandaDoc, and Preply were all started by Russian speakers who are emigres from their respective Russian-influenced countries.</p>
<p>Leta says its first “evergreen” fund of $15 million was fully deployed in early 2020, delivering a gross IRR of 27% per annum to investors. Its second $50 million fund had its first closing in September 2018 and has committed about 60% of its capital, says the company.</p>
<p>Leta will invest out of an entity in the Cayman Islands, but doesn&#8217;t plan to have an office right now, nor will it need it to invest.</p>
<p>As Chachava told me over a Zoom call: &#8220;The last two years, we have not been not traveling too much, our work has been downgraded to Zoom calls. But before that, we spent a couple of months in the US, a couple of months in Western Europe. I was a frequent visitor to London but I don&#8217;t think we need space anymore in our modern world.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>SentinelOne&#8217;s IPO, expected to price on June 29 and trade June 30, is a fascinating debut. Why? Because the company sports a combination of rapid growth and expanding losses that make it a good heat check for the IPO market. Its debut will allow us to answer whether public investors still value growth above all else. And this week, the company gave us an early dataset regarding its market value in the form of an IPO price range. This means we can do some unpacking and thinking.</p>

Furthermore, the level of public-market enthusiasm for loss-making, growth-focused companies will determine the scale of returns for many a venture capitalist, founder and early employee.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s talk about SentinelOne&#8217;s cybersecurity IPO price range; Sprinklr&#8217;s social-media software debut will play foil.</p>
<h2>The price of growth</h2>
<p>It can make good sense to pay up for a quickly growing company&#8217;s shares. This is why you may hear of a startup raising an early-stage round at a very high revenue multiple.</p>
<p>Why put a $50 million price tag on a startup that just crossed the $1 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) threshold? If it&#8217;s growing sufficiently quickly, the math can pencil out. If that startup was growing at 300% per year, say, the revenue multiple that you paid in the round valuing the startup at $50 million would fall sharply over the next year, at which point other investors would probably scramble to put more capital into the firm at a higher price.</p>
<p>Bingo! You just got a markup on your initial investment, and the company has found someone else to lead their next round at a higher price, giving it even more capital to keep its growth game going and make your early investment appear prescient. See? Venture capital is easy.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The same general idea applies to companies going public. Growth matters, and the more rapidly a company is adding revenue, the more money it will be worth because investors can anticipate its future scale (within reason). Some companies that sport quick growth can have other issues that impact their value. Extensive debt, for example, a history of uneven growth, or deteriorating economics could come into play. Or simply very high losses.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, LinkedIn&#8217;s engineering team <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/data-hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> DataHub, a metadata tool it had built to help it organise, search and discover insights from its vast data trove. In 2020, LinkedIn <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/open-sourcing-datahub--linkedins-metadata-search-and-discovery-p" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open sourced it</a>. Now, a startup co-founded by one of the creators of DataHub and by a former senior engineer from Airbnb who helped build the latter company&#8217;s Dataportal, is coming out of stealth &#8212; backed by LinkedIn, among others &#8212; to usher the DataHub platform into its latest chapter: commercialization.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.acryldata.io/company" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acryl Data</a>, as the company is called, is launching today with $9 million led by 8VC, with LinkedIn and Insight also participating, to help other companies use the tools for their own big data needs.</p>
<p>The impetus for Acryl Data comes from the salient fact that big data, and specifically being able to organize, understand, make the most of fragmented big data troves (with information coming from and living in multiple places, be it Snowflake, or Databricks, or Looker, or something else altogether), is a challenge that impacts any organization that has a large digital component in its operations. Traditionally, big tech companies have been some of the more innovative in addressing that issue, with a number of them also open sourcing their technology to make it usable by others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The breakthrough for the founders of Acryl &#8212; discovered before they started the company, when they were still working at their respective big tech companies &#8212; was the realization that metadata held the key to organizing that big data information.</p>
<p>&#8220;The interesting part about metadata is actually that it has become a big data problem,&#8221; said Shirshanka Das, the LinkedIn alum who is CEO and co-founded the company with Swaroop Jagadish (the Airbnb alum who is CTO). &#8220;And so all of the data infrastructure DNA that we have, in terms of building large-scale data collections, streaming, indexing, searching &#8212; those all need metadata management solutions that can actually scale to the demands of the modern enterprise. That, I think, is really our secret sauce, that we&#8217;ve been able to build a metadata platform that takes in all the best practices of doing data infrastructure right, and applied it to doing metadata infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an open source project, DataHub has picked up some significant traction. In addition to LinkedIn itself, Expedia, Saxo Bank, Klarna and many others are using the framework &#8212; essentially a generalized metadata search and discovery tool &#8212; to build their own metadata graph to connect their various data entities together. Altogether the project has racked up <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/datahub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 3,200 GitHub stars</a> and has more than a 100 contributors.</p>
<p>Acryl Data, like other open source commercialization efforts, is setting out to build a toolset that will make that framework easier to scale and apply in more use cases, particularly at those companies that might lack the resources to build these implementations on their own. The first of these, it says, will be a data catalogue that is based on design learnings from Airbnb&#8217;s Dataportal. LinkedIn will be collaborating with Acryl Data, along with the wider open source community, on future products.</p>
<p>“LinkedIn’s unique view of the global economy provides us with the opportunity to improve economic outcomes for hundreds of millions of people around the world through data-driven insights and AI-powered products. To discover the right data, navigate the tens of thousands of derived datasets that our researchers and engineers use every day and manage them well, we rely on DataHub,&#8221; said Igor Perisic, Chief Data Officer at LinkedIn, in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to partner with Acryl Data to continue to advance DataHub with them.”</p>
<p>The opportunity is a big one. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/collibra-nabs-another-112-5m-at-a-2-3b-valuation-for-its-big-data-management-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collibra</a>, a competitor in the same space, last year raised a round at a $2.3 billion valuation. Another, Alation, was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-03/snowflake-backed-data-startup-alation-valued-at-1-2-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $1.2 billion</a> earlier this month. But with a lot of space for innovation left, it&#8217;s interesting to see the people who built some of the most foundational tools in the space getting stuck in as entrepreneurs themselves to meet the challenge.</p>
<p>“The modern data stack needs a fundamental rethink in how metadata is managed,&#8221; said Insight Partners MD George Mathew, in a statement. &#8220;We believe a next-generation, real-time metadata platform is needed, and Acryl Data is the best team to lead this transformation based on their groundbreaking work with DataHub.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin, Ford&#8217;s micromobility subsidiary, has launched its first custom designed and built electric scooter. The company says the S-100T scooters are its safest and longest-lasting, two qualities that it hopes will attract the attention of cities as it aims its strategy at exclusive partnerships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the company launches its service in Sacramento in July, it&#8217;ll deploy 25 of the new S-100T scooters along with its existing fleet. Spin hopes to scale to 350 S-100Ts by August and have more than a few thousand in the market by the end of the year, according to a spokesperson for the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The S-100T joins Spin&#8217;s other vehicles, the original S-100, the three-wheeler S-200 and a new e-bike, which are manufactured in partnership with Segway-Ninebot and Okai. Spin will continue these partnerships in order to maintain a diverse fleet.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin has been working on its own scooter since 2019, when many of the scooters on the road came off-the-shelf and fell apart fast. A Los Angeles Times report found </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-bird-scooters-money-profit-strategy-20190505-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LA-area Bird scooters lasted only 126 days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At that time, the founders decided to really set a new standard not only for Spin itself, but also for the industry on what e-scooter durability should be,” Maxime Veron, VP of product at Spin, told TechCrunch. “So we really set out to create the toughest scooter out there, and that has been the north star for the design, build and testing of the S-100T.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ‘T’ stands for ‘tough,’ Veron added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And we really tested it &#8212; tortured it, I should say &#8212; way beyond the expectation of the industry, and that’s why we expect it to last twice as long as other e-scooters,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin expects the S-100T to last over three years, compared to about 18 months for its S-100. The company reached this estimated lifespan after performing 400 different safety and durability tests, many of which involved pulverizing the vehicle and making it withstand temperatures from -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 149 degrees Fahrenheit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low life expectancy of scooters is one of the main reasons why it’s been so hard for companies to achieve profitability, which is why Spin is focusing its scooter design around durability. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Durability is the biggest lever we have in terms of profitability,” said Veron. “It’s gonna help both our bottom line in terms of making sure that the scooters last longer, and our top line of attracting customers who will love the ride.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veron says the S-100T is designed to be modular, with a single frame design that’s durable and allows for easy repairs and parts replacements, which should help with lifespan and sustainability of the vehicle. Perhaps one day, both the design and Spin’s ownership of the vehicles will also help the company come up with a good end-of-life strategy and design for recyclability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Durability has been the number one, but we will be able over time to improve on all the key checkpoints including end-of-life because we control it all,” said Veron.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thoughtful and high-quality product design is no longer optional. Gone are the days that a startup could launch with a bare-bones app or website. The demand side of the design equation has only grown — consumers are used to beautiful, intuitive products — while the supply side is struggling to keep up.</p>
<p>How are startups supposed to educate themselves in product design, hire the right people for those positions and think about product design as a core piece of their business?</p>
<p>A good starting point is an upcoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">TC Early Stage: Marketing &amp; Fundraising session</a> with Scott Tong on July 8 &amp; 9.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tong was a principal designer at IDEO, a co-founder at IFTTT, head of product design at Pinterest, an EIR at IMO Ventures and is now a startup advisor at Design Fund.</p>
<p>When it comes to thoughtfully crafting products, and ensuring that those designs fit in line with the company&#8217;s broader short and long-term goals, there is perhaps no one better suited to show us how it&#8217;s done.</p>
<p>Tong joins a long list of experts in a variety of startup core competencies who will be speaking at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">TC Early Stage in July</a>. That list includes <strong>Sequoia&#8217;s Mike Vernal</strong> (Product Market Fit Is All About Tempo), <strong>Coatue&#8217;s Caryn Marooney</strong> (formerly Facebook&#8217;s head of comms) and <strong>Superhuman&#8217;s Rahul Vohra</strong> (Growth Hacking). You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">check out the agenda here</a>.</p>
<p>The coolest part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">TC Early Stage</a> is that all sessions are designed with plenty of time for audience Q&amp;A, so founders can get specific, tailored advice about their own business challenges.</p>
<p>These mini-bootcamps kick off in just two weeks so we hope you&#8217;ll be joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">TC Early Stage</a>&#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">Grab your ticket here</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For all that&#8217;s said about fundraising and working alongside investors, rarely do we get to see founders and their investors in candid conversation with one another. Extra Crunch Live is changing that. On the weekly live show, we sit down with founders and the VCs who funded them to talk about how they came together on the deal, what stood out about the other party that led to their commitment and how they operate today. We also (usually) take a walk through their early pitch decks to get a feel for how success starts.</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-emergence-capital-and-retail-zipline?ref=928ff1c911ab">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Emergence&#8217;s Lotti Siniscalco and Retail Zipline&#8217;s Melissa Wong to discuss all that and more. The event goes down on Wednesday, June 23 at 3 p.m. ET/noon PT. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-emergence-capital-and-retail-zipline?ref=928ff1c911ab">You can register to attend right here.</a></p>
<p>Siniscalco is a principal at Emergence Capital, investing in early-stage enterprise software companies. She currently serves on the board of directors at Whistic and High Alpha. Prior to Emergence, she was an investor in financial services and technology at Advent International, a PE firm, and led diligence for Ribbit Capital (also fintech focused) before that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other words, she&#8217;s an expert in fintech and can bring a wealth of wisdom to our conversation around fundraising and startup growth.</p>
<p>Melissa Wong, on the other hand, has spent 10 years in retail communications at Old Navy. It was here that she realized a problem that Zipline Retail, a retail communication and store execution platform, could solve and set out on her own venture.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live also features the ECL Pitch-off, where startups in the audience can virtually &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; to pitch their startup live on our stream. Our expert guests will give their feedback on each pitch. If you want to throw your hat in the ring, you have to show up.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is accessible to everyone, but only Extra Crunch members can access the content on demand. We do these every week, so there are scores of episodes across a wide variety of startup sectors in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">ECL Library</a>. It&#8217;s but one of many reasons to become an Extra Crunch member. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">Join here.</a></p>
