										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite being one of the earliest adopters of using the world wide web to disrupt how its business is done and connect with more potential customers, the recruitment industry ironically remains one of the more fragmented and behind the times when it comes to using new, cloud based services to work more efficiently. A new startup is hoping to change that, and it&#8217;s picked up some funding on strong, early signs of traction.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dover</a>, which has built what CEO and co-founder Max Kolysh describes as a &#8220;recruitment orchestration platform&#8221; &#8212; aimed at recruiters, it helps them juggle and aggregate multiple candidate pools to source suitable job candidates automatically, and then manage the process of outreach (including using tools to automatically re-write job descriptions, as well as to write recruitment and rejection letters) &#8212; has raised $20 million from an impressive list of investors.</p>
<p>Tiger Global led the Series A round, with Founders Fund, Abstract Ventures, and Y Combinator also investing. Dover was part of YC&#8217;s Summer 2019 class (which debuted in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/here-are-the-82-startups-that-launched-on-day-2-of-ycs-s19-demo-days/">August 2020</a>), and Founders Fund led its seed round. Since leaving the incubator, it&#8217;s picked up more than 100 customers, mostly from the world of tech, including ClearBanc, Lattice, Samsara and others, even larger companies that you might have assumed would have their own in-house orchestration and automation platforms in place already.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Orchestration&#8221; in the world of business IT is commonly used for software built for the fields of sales and marketing: in both of these, there is a lot of fragmentation and work involved in sourcing good leads to become potential customers, and so tech companies have built platforms both to source interesting contacts and handle some of the initial steps needed to reach out to them, and get them engaged.</p>
<p>That, it turns out, is a very apt way to think of the recruitment industry, too, not least because it also, to a degree, involves a company &#8220;selling&#8221; itself to candidates to get them interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say recruiting is sales and marketing,&#8221; Kolysh said. &#8220;We&#8217;re comparable to sales ops, but sales is 5-10 years ahead in terms of technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recruiters, especially those working in industries where talent is at a premium and therefore proactively hiring good people can be a challenge, are faced with a lot of busy work to find interesting candidates and engage them to consider open jobs, and subsequently handling the bigger process of screening, reaching out to them, and potentially rejecting some while making offers to others.</p>
<p>This is mainly because the process of doing all of these is typically very fragmented: mot only are there different tools built to handle these different processes, but there is an almost endless list of sources today where people go to look for work, or get their names out there.</p>
<p>Dover&#8217;s approach is based on embracing that fragmentation and making it easier to handle. Using AI, it taps platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed and Triplebyte &#8212; a likely list, given its initial focus on tech &#8212; to source candidates that it believes are good fits for a particular opening at a company.</p>
<p>Dover does this with a mix of AI and understanding what a recruiter is looking for, plus any extra parameters if they have been set by the recruiter to carry this out (for example, diversity screening, if the employer would like to have a candidate pool that is in line with a company&#8217;s inclusion targets).</p>
<p>Dover also uses data science and AI to help calibrate a recruiter&#8217;s communications with would-be candidates, from the opening job description through to job offer or rejection letters. (Why dwell on rejection letters? Because these candidates are already in short list, and so even if they didn&#8217;t get one particular job, they are likely good prospects for future rolls.)</p>
<p>&#8220;No human wants to write 100 cold emails per week but on the other hand, there are many ppl to hit up,&#8221; Kolysh said of the challenges that recruiters face. &#8220;When a company is seeing a lot of growth, it needs to scale fast. You just can&#8217;t do that with a human anymore.&#8221; Kolysh &#8212; who co-founded the company with Anvisha Pai (CTO) and George Carollo (COO) &#8212; said all three founders experienced that first-hand working at previous startups and trying to recruit while also building the other aspects of the business. (They are pictured above, along with founding engineer John Holliman.)</p>
<p>Given how much orchestration has caught on in the world of sales, there is a strong opportunity here for Dover to bring a similar approach to recruitment, based on what seems to be a very close understanding of the flawed recruitment process as it exists today. Whether that brings more competitors to the space &#8212; or more tools from some of the bigger players in, say, candidate sourcing &#8212; will be one factor to watch, as will how and if Dover manages to make the leap to other industries beyond tech.</p>
<p>But for now, its usefulness for a particular segment of the market is also what caught the eye of Tiger Global.</p>
<p>John Luttig, the partner who led the round for Tiger Global, noted in an interview that most recruiting tools in the market today might best be described as point solutions, addressing scheduling, or interviews, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the full stack here that is appealing,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;And it&#8217;s automated, which is particularly valuable for early and mid-stage tech companies, to keep candidates from falling through the cracks. It also saves time from having to build up big recruiting departments. And because Dover owns all that work, those working in recruitment can instead focus on culture building, or assessing the candidates.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The CEO joined us last week at a TechCrunch Early Stage event to share all kinds of insight, from the state of the market to his thoughts on why there's suddenly so much money flooding into VC.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few companies have deeper insights into the day-by-day state of venture capital than AngelList. According to the company&#8217;s data, over 51% of the &#8220;top tier U.S. VC deals&#8221; involve their platform and tools, giving them a remarkably expansive view of everything going on.</p>
<p>AngelList Venture CEO Avlok Kohli joined us at TechCrunch Early Stage to discuss topics ranging from the state of the market to his thoughts on why there&#8217;s suddenly so much money flooding into VC (sending valuations to the sky), and where AngelList could go from here. We started with a presentation wrapping together everything Kohli is seeing in the industry right now, followed up by a largely audience-driven Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve embedded the full interview at the bottom of this post, but here are some highlights:</p>
<h3>AngelList&#8217;s growing focus on founders</h3>
<p>Kohli says he never expected to end up in the venture industry, but the potential for AngelList to grow into something entirely new drew him in:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I definitely did not think of venture as the industry I would be in. What actually attracted me to it wasn&#8217;t necessarily venture, it was actually the makings of a financial platform and being able to build tools and products that eventually extend to founders. When I stepped in, a lot of our tools were built for GPs and LPs — really the funder side — and how you&#8217;d reduce the friction and get more people coming into venture. Really leaning into the solo capitalist movement, and having more LPs coming in.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s also this opportunity to start building founder products, which obviously is near and dear to my heart. I do think there are a lot of things we can do to improve not just the fundraising experience, but also the downstream products that they can use. All the way from banking, to spend management, to cap tables, the whole nine yards. I think there&#8217;s so much we can do there.&#8221; <em><strong>(Timestamp: 10:11)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>When I later asked him to elaborate on what those founder-focused products might look like, Kohli expanded:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Robinhood's huge valuation indicates that its ascent in the last 18 months from breakout unicorn to category-defining upstart is about to be embraced by the public market.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robinhood released <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021013986/robinhoods-1a1.htm">an S-1/A filing</a> detailing its first IPO price range this morning. The company first filed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/">go public in early July</a> after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/">raising billions earlier in the year</a>.</p>
<p>The well-known U.S. consumer fintech giant intends to sell shares in its public market debut at a price between $38 and $42 per share. Robinhood is selling 52,375,000 in its IPO, worth $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion. Another 2,625,000 are being offered by existing shareholders, while its underwriting banks have the option to purchase a further 5,500,000 shares in the transaction.</p>
<p>All told, Robinhood could see shares trade hands worth just over $2.5 billion in its IPO at the top end of its initial price range.</p>

<hr />
<p>We want to know Robinhood&#8217;s simple and diluted IPO valuation ranges, and we want to dig into the company&#8217;s newly released preliminary Q2 2021 results. Then we&#8217;ll do some fun math to better understand just how rich, or not, Robinhood&#8217;s current price range seems to be. From there, we&#8217;ll discuss whether we expect to see Robinhood raise its price range before it debuts.</p>
<p>Sound good? Let&#8217;s get into it.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Robinhood worth?</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ll start by calculating a few valuation marks for Robinhood to help put its $38 to $42 per-share IPO price range into context.</p>
<p>First, Robinhood&#8217;s post-IPO <em>simple</em> share count is expected to be 835,675,280, not including shares reserved for possible underwriter purchase. That share count values Robinhood at $31.8 billion at $38 per share and $35.1 billion at $42 per share. Those figures rise by $209 million and $231 million, respectively, if we count the 5.5 million shares that its banks may purchase as part of the IPO.</p>
<p>But what folks will want to chat on Twitter about the company&#8217;s fully diluted valuation. At the midpoint of its price range, Robinhood is worth more than $38 billion when shares tied up in vested <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-stock-unit.asp">RSUs</a> and options are counted. That figure lands around $40 billion at the top end of Robinhood&#8217;s price range.</p>
<p>Robinhood would therefore be worth $35 billion, calculated using a simple share count, or as much as $40 billion if more equity is counted. Both numbers are fucking huge and indicate that Robinhood&#8217;s ascent in the last 18 months from breakout unicorn to category-defining upstart is about to be embraced by the public market, provided that it prices at least in range.</p>
<p>How do those prices feel, given our read of today&#8217;s market dynamics?</p>
<h2>How is Robinhood doing?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Music app <a href="https://www.musicbreakr.com/">Breakr</a> this week announced a $4.2 million seed round, led by Slow Ventures. The latest raise follows $700,000 in funding led by Andreessen Horowitz’s TxO fund – a round the people behind the service considered a sort of proof of concept as they worked to get the idea off the ground.</p>
<p>It’s clear why Breakr’s offering is an appealing one for investors. The product serves as a way to connect up and coming musicians with social media influencers. Musicians get exposure and the influencers get paid to effectively host an office hours listening session. Breakr, meanwhile, gets a 10% cut from the revenue.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175826" style="width: 916px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175826" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175826" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-7.44.00-PM.png" alt="" width="906" height="1110" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-7.44.00-PM.png 906w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-7.44.00-PM.png?resize=122,150 122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-7.44.00-PM.png?resize=245,300 245w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-7.44.00-PM.png?resize=768,941 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-7.44.00-PM.png?resize=555,680 555w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-7.44.00-PM.png?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 906px) 100vw, 906px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175826" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Breakr</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s a unique approach in an overcrowded music marketplace, where discovering music and being discovered have both proven difficult codes to crack. Though it&#8217;s less about tweaking the algorithm for music listeners than it is getting undiscovered music in front of the right set of ears. Speaking with two of the startup’s six founders, we reminisced about the days rappers stood outside of record stores, attempting to sell mixtape CD-Rs for $5 a pop &#8212; things have come a long way since then, but no one has fully solved the problem of music discovery.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Breakr is a needed tool to efficiently connect artists, influencers and brands,&#8221; I know from first hand experience that this process manually is too time consuming to not only find an array of diverse influencers but activate them as well,&#8221; AMP Technologies&#8217; Marc Byers said in a release. &#8220;They’ve created what I call a mall of influential marketers, where all you have to do is shop what talent fits the taste of your campaign needs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>And while the medium has changed to social media, the hustle and feelings of futility haven’t. Not everyone gets their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNyjpHo8t-E"> Mobb Deep story</a> with Q-Tip stopping and listening to a few bars after coming out of the Def Jam offices. Obviously we need a lot more Q-Tips in the world, just as a general rule. With human cloning technology still lacking, however, Breakr is hoping to offer some approximation of the experience, with added financial incentive.</p>
<p>“If you&#8217;re a world-renowned DJ or A&amp;R at a major label, these artists are already in your emails, and DMS, trying to get your attention,” says CEO Tony Brown, who previously worked for financial giant, Goldman Sachs. “We give them a unique URL, they send that unique URL and say, ‘hey, stay out of my DMS, meet me here. Here&#8217;s the cost. And let&#8217;s talk about it.’”</p>

<p>Influencers charge artists on a sliding scale – likely commanding more based on their following. Breakr says around 12,000 users have signed up for influencer accounts, which the company is currently in the process of vetting. Between 3,000-4,000 accounts have been approved.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve worked with companies as big as Warner and Sony, as small as the SoundCloud rapper, and everybody in between,” adds Inventor and Head of Product Ameer Brown, who was formerly with Adobe.</p>
<p>Rapper, influencer and long-time friend Tobe Nwigwe is also on the long list of co-founders and has been active in helping spread the brand through social media, including hosting his own listening sessions.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as I saw the vision for what the Breakr team was building, essentially the tech-middle-man between influencers and artists, I immediately knew Breakr would be the future,” says Nwigwe. “Having cultural icons like Erykah Badu and Dave Chapelle rock with my music, and organically amplify me on their platforms, was major for me. Now, with Breakr, we make this happen authentically for artists and influencers of all levels.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.recapped.io/">Recapped</a>, a startup building collaborative sales software, announced the close of a $6.3 million seed round today. The deal was led by Charles River Ventures. Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator, CoFound, AirAngels, Prime Set, Twenty5Twenty, Peter Kazanjy, Alan Chunk and other angels also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Recapped was founded by Mark Fershteyn and Ujwal Battar. Fershteyn spent his career in sales, first as an account executive at Citrix and then as vice president of sales at App Academy. He felt firsthand the difficulty of collaboration in the sales space, not only with members of the sales team and other departments within an organization, but also with the buy side of a transaction. That cross-team, cross-company clunkiness leads to challenges around transparency and business planning.</p>
<p>Recapped aims to solve the issue. Its software allows users within an organization to collaborate around a deal. For example, the customer experience (CX) and post-sales team can keep abreast of a deal as it&#8217;s coming together, as can the CEO or CFO. That may help those teams and individuals better project future workloads, for example.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But perhaps most uniquely, buyers are given an almost identical UX as the sales team, allowing both parties to have a collaborative check-list of action items, deliverables, and data to work off of to make sure they cross the finish line.</p>
<p>Salespeople can create a super customizable and interactive landing page with Recapped that they can send to a potential client. That page may include customer testimonials, product videos, and other information to help the client get acquainted with the product. It also includes a check list for the sales process, from delivering a proof of concept to running a pilot to getting sign off from the necessary parties and more.</p>
<p>Though sales side teams must have a seat to use the software, the buyer side simply receives a link and starts working.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179068" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179068" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2179068" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="557" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg 2378w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg?resize=150,123 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg?resize=300,246 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg?resize=768,629 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg?resize=680,557 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg?resize=1536,1258 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg?resize=2048,1678 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179068" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Recapped</p></div></p>
<p>Recapped is meant to replace what&#8217;s known in the industry as a Mutual Action Plan or a Success Plan, typically built and managed with a blend of spreadsheets and email.</p>
<p>Moreover, leadership, finance, and other departments within the selling company can look at the array of deals in progress to get a clearer picture of what will close and when, allowing for easier forecasts for investors and preparation among teams like CX and post-sale.</p>
<p>Recapped launched into beta in 2019, and publicly in the summer of 2020. Since then, it&#8217;s doubled revenue every quarter and expanded from two employees to eleven. Nearly half of those employees are either women or underrepresented minorities.</p>
<p>According to Fershteyn, Recapped is helping its customers close deals 18 percent faster, close 23 percent more total deals, and streamline customer onboarding times by up to 28 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;What keeps me up at night is ensuring that the product is as easy to use as possible while still being incredibly customizable for our customers because everyone has a different sales process and onboarding process and each customer prefers something different,&#8221; Fershteyn said. &#8220;Making it incredibly easy to use while we scale and taking that into the next year and a half as we deploy this $6 million is the biggest challenge.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The New York-based commercial real estate startup is curating a marketplace of pre-approved vendors for tenants and property managers to find and hire the people they need in a compliant way. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Commercial real estate tenants and property managers have to abide by strict liability rules that any vendor entering the property must have insurance certificates and meet other requirements. The approval process for this currently can take days and is still largely done on paper.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://getjones.com/">Jones</a>. The New York-based commercial real estate startup is curating a marketplace of pre-approved vendors for tenants and property managers to find and hire the people they need in a compliant way.</p>
<p>To continue advancing its network, the company announced Monday it raised $12.5 million in Series A funding led by JLL Spark and Khosla Ventures that also included strategic investors Camber Creek, Rudin Management, DivcoWest and Sage Realty. This new investment brings Jones’ total raised to $20 million, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/get-jones/company_financials">Crunchbase data</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jones, founded in 2017, also manages certifications and approvals, moving the whole process online. Its technology can process an insurance certificate in less than an hour and reduce the overall vendor approval time to 2.5 days — from 12 days — with 99.9% accuracy, co-founder and CEO Omri Stern told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The accuracy portion is key. With much of the work being done by hand, current accuracy is at about 30%, he added. In addition, the certifications are lengthy, and it is typically up to property managers to parse through the insurance documents to identify what is missing rather than spending time with tenants.</p>
<p>“In the consumer world, a homeowner expects to go on a marketplace and find a service and hire them,” Stern said. “Office managers and tenants can’t get their preferred vendors through the approval process, so we want to provide a similar digital experience that they can consume and use in real estate.”</p>
<p>He says Jones’ differentiator from competitors is that all of the stakeholders are in place: a group of high-profile real estate customers, including Lincoln Property Co., Prologis, DivcoWest, Rudin Management, Sage Realty and JLL.</p>
<p>Yishai Lerner, co-CEO of JLL Spark, agrees, telling TechCrunch that commercial real estate is one of the largest and last asset classes that is undergoing a technology transformation, similar to what fintech was 20 years ago.</p>
<p>He estimates the U.S. market to be $16 trillion, of which technology could unlock a lot of the value. That opportunity was one of the drivers for JLL to create JLL Spark, where Jones is one of the first investments.</p>
<p>Though Lerner spent time with property management teams on the ground, he became up close and personal with the problem when his wife, while moving offices, found out her vendors were not allowed in the building because they didn’t have the right insurance.</p>
<p>“We learned that property managers spend half of their time just working to verify the compliance of vendors coming into their building,” Lerner said. “We wondered why there wasn’t technology for this. Jones was doing construction at the time, and we brought them into commercial real estate because they had an example of how technology could solve the problem.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Series A comes at a time when Stern is seeing Jones’s SaaS tool take off in the past 10 months. He would not get specific with growth metrics, but did say that what is driving growth is “competing against the status quo” as companies are searching for and adapting workflow solutions.</p>
<p>The company intends to use the new funds on product development in both quicker and easier approvals and bringing on new vendors. Jones already works with tens of thousands of vendors. It will also focus on integration, offering an API that could be used in other industry verticals where compliance is necessary.</p>
<p>Stern would also like to continue building the team. Having brought in real estate experts, he is now also looking for people with backgrounds in fintech, cybersecurity and insurtech to bring in additional perspectives.</p>
<p>“We are building an incredible company with the opportunity to be the next big digital marketplace,” he added.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>It was a big damn morning, so we had to cut some stuff. Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stocks and cryptos are off this morning, as inflation and COVID-19 concerns rise.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/18/zoom-buys-cloud-call-center-firm-five9-for-14-7-billion/">Zoom is buying Five9</a>. The deal is not super expensive, nor is it cheap. But given the huge percentage of Zoom&#8217;s market cap that it represents, it&#8217;s a serious wager from the video conferencing startup.</li>
<li>Carlyle is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/carlyle-to-acquire-live-broadcasting-and-streaming-tech-outfit-liveu-for-over-400m-say-sources/">buying LiveU for around $400 million</a>. TechCrunch broke this news. The deal shows that private equity interest in startups that aren&#8217;t unicorns.</li>
<li>Robinhood dropped a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021013986/robinhoods-1a1.htm">new SEC filing</a> this morning! That means we have a price range and valuation target to play with. More from TechCrunch on the matter shortly.</li>
<li>From India: A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/18/lenskart-valued-at-2-5-billion-following-220-million-investment-from-temasek-and-falcon-edge-capital/">huge round for Lenskart</a>, and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/india-globalbees-raises-150-million-to-build-thrasio-like-house-of-brands/">big Series A for GlobalBees</a>.</li>
<li>And we covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/nigerian-investment-platform-chaka-secures-1-5m-pre-seed-after-bagging-countrys-first-sec-license/">this round from Nigeria</a>. A smaller transaction, but one that could prove to be quite neat, we reckon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok! Chat Wednesday!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kdanmobile.com/">Kdan Mobile</a>, a company that provides a wide range of cloud-based software, including AI-based tech for organizing documents, has raised a $16 million Series B. The round was led by South Korea-based Dattoz Partners, which will also take a seat on Kdan Mobile, and included participation from WI Harper Group, Taiwania Capital and Golden Asia Fund Mitsubishi UFJ Capital.</p>
<p>Launched in 2009, Kdan Mobile has focused on developing content creation and productivity software for mobile devices from the start, founder and chief executive officer Kenny Su told TechCrunch. “We’ve observed more and more industries embracing remote or hybrid work for years now, even before 2020,” he said. “We always sensed that trend would continue.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kdan Mobile has now raised $21 million in total. Since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/taiwanese-startup-kdan-mobile-raises-5m-series-a-for-its-cloud-based-content-creation-tools/">announcing its Series A in April 2018</a>, Kdan Mobile has grown from 70 employees to 200 in Taiwan, China, Japan and the United States. It also passed 200 million downloads and now has more than 100 million members on its platform. More than half of Kdan Mobile’s users are in the U.S. and Europe, 30% from Asia and 15% from Africa and Australia.</p>

<p>Part of the funding will be used to develop Kdan Mobile’s enterprise products, including Document AI, its data processing and filtering technology, and SaaS products like e-signature service DottedSign, PDF software Document 365 and Creativity 365 for multimedia content creation, including animations and video editing.</p>
<p>After focusing primarily on individual users, Kdan Mobile decided to start working with more enterprise clients in 2018 and its software is now used by more than 40,000 businesses and educational organizations. Su said the company’s focus on enterprise was validated with the 2019 launch of DottedSign, which now has more than 300,000 users. During the past year and a half, the number of signatures processed by DottedSign increase by 30 times as companies switched to remote work because of the pandemic. Kdan Mobile also began offering a set of APIs and SDKs so internal developers at large enterprises can integrate and customize its technology.</p>
<p>“We use a lot of what’s called B2C2B approach, or business to consumer to business, meaning that we still try to connect with users at the individual level, but do so in a way that we hope they’ll adopt our solutions at the company level,” said Su.</p>
<p>Document AI was launched in 2021 after Kdan Mobile found that many of its users wanted to reduce the amount of time they spend managing documents. Its features include optical character recognition, smart tagging and search, and protection for sensitive data. Some examples of how Document AI can be used include automating data-entry tasks and creating summaries of research documents.</p>
<p>When asked how its products differentiate from those offered by Google, Microsoft and Adobe, Su said one way is that Kdan Mobile has always created products for mobile first, before designing the user experience for other devices, with the idea of serving professionals who are on the move a lot.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Kdan Mobile doesn’t necessarily see itself as a competitor with those companies. Instead, its solutions are complementary. For example, it creates files that are compatible with Adobe products and is integrated with Google Workspace, Zapier and, in the near future, Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>“In that regard, it’s about helping users where they are, rather than trying to sway them away from existing products or services,” Su said.</p>
<p>In statement, Dattoz Partner CEO Yeon Su Kim said, “We see tremendous growth in the market for software and solutions that empower the post-pandemic hybrid workforce. Kdan’s powerful product suite and the leadership team’s ability to executive have led to its strong momentum in several key markets, including the U.S. and Asia markets.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration and its allies has formally accused China of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">the mass-hacking of Microsoft Exchange servers</a> earlier this year, which prompted the FBI to intervene as concerns rose that the hacks could lead to widespread destruction.</p>
<p>The mass-hacking campaign targeted Microsoft Exchange email servers with four previously undiscovered vulnerabilities that allowed the hackers — which Microsoft already attributed to a China-backed group of hackers called Hafnium — to steal email mailboxes and address books from tens of thousands of organizations around the United States.</p>
<p>Microsoft released patches to fix the vulnerabilities, but the patches did not remove any backdoor code left behind by the hackers that might be used again for easy access to a hacked server. That prompted the FBI to secure <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/fbi-launches-operation-to-remotely-remove-microsoft-exchange-server-backdoors/">a first-of-its-kind court order</a> to effectively hack into the remaining hundreds of U.S.-based Exchange servers to remove the backdoor code. Computer incident response teams in countries around the world responded similarly by trying to notify organizations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/america-small-business-hafnium-exchange-hacks/">in their countries</a> that were also affected by the attack.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/19/the-united-states-joined-by-allies-and-partners-attributes-malicious-cyber-activity-and-irresponsible-state-behavior-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/">a statement</a> out Monday, the Biden administration said the attack, launched by hackers backed by China&#8217;s Ministry of State Security, resulted in &#8220;significant remediation costs for its mostly private sector victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have raised our concerns about both this incident and the [People&#8217;s Republic of China&#8217;s] broader malicious cyber activity with senior PRC Government officials, making clear that the PRC&#8217;s actions threaten security, confidence, and stability in cyberspace,&#8221; the statement read.</p>
<p>The National Security Agency also <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/press-room/Article/2698416/nsa-cisa-and-fbi-detail-chinese-state-sponsored-actions-mitigations/">released details</a> of the attacks to help network defenders identify potential routes of compromise.</p>
<p>Several allies, including the U.K. and the members of NATO, also backed the Biden administration in its findings. In a statement, the U.K. government found Beijing responsible for a &#8220;pervasive pattern&#8221; of hacking. The Chinese government has repeatedly denied claims of state-backed or sponsored hacking.</p>
<p>The Biden administration also blamed China&#8217;s Ministry of State Security for contracting with criminal hackers to conduct unsanctioned operations, like ransomware attacks, &#8220;for their own personal profit.&#8221; The government said it was aware that China-backed hackers have demanded millions of dollars in ransom demands against hacked companies. Last year, the Justice Department charged <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/us-prosecutors-charge-chinese-spies-global-hacking/">two Chinese spies</a> for their role in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/us-prosecutors-charge-chinese-spies-global-hacking/">global hacking campaign</a> that saw prosecutors accuse the hackers of operating for personal gain.</p>
<p>Although <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware/">the U.S. has publicly engaged the Kremlin</a> to try to stop giving ransomware gangs safe harbor from operating from within Russia&#8217;s borders, the U.S. has not previously accused Beijing of launching or being involved with ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The PRC&#8217;s unwillingness to address criminal activity by contract hackers harms governments, businesses, and critical infrastructure operators through billions of dollars in lost intellectual property, proprietary information, ransom payments, and mitigation efforts,&#8221; said Monday&#8217;s statement.</p>
<p>The statement also said that the China-backed hackers engaged in extortion and cryptojacking, a way of forcing a computer to run code that uses its computing resources to mine cryptocurrency, for financial gain.</p>
<p>The Justice Department also <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-chinese-nationals-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion">announced fresh charges</a> against four China-backed hackers working for the Ministry of State Security, which U.S. prosecutors said were engaged in efforts to steal intellectual property and infectious disease research into Ebola, HIV and AIDS, and MERS against victims based in the U.S., Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom by using a front company to hide their operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The breadth and duration of China’s hacking campaigns, including these efforts targeting a dozen countries across sectors ranging from healthcare and biomedical research to aviation and defense, remind us that no country or industry is safe. Today’s international condemnation shows that the world wants fair rules, where countries invest in innovation, not theft,&#8221; said deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online learning continues to see a huge boost of attention and use in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, and today a startup building tools specifically for enterprises to deliver on their internal education remits is announcing a big round of funding that points to the startup&#8217;s own growth and ambitions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.go1.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go1</a>, which provides curated online learning materials and tools to businesses, with &#8220;playlists&#8221; that tap content from multiple publishers and silos, has closed a round of $200 million, a Series D that the Australian company&#8217;s CEO and co-founder confirmed values the startup at over $1 billion.</p>
<p>Barnes added that the funding will be used to expand further in existing markets &#8212; based out of Brisbane, Australia, Go1 has offices in London, the U.S., Singapore and Malaysia, so it wants to go deeper into Europe more broadly and into more of Asia Pacific, he said. Go1 will also continue expanding its suite of services in the wider areas of learning and development training, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, it already offers a host of analytics and AI tech to chart how well that content is used and to further personalize materials, so the idea will be to expand on that more.</p>
<p>SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2, AirTree Ventures and Salesforce Ventures co-led this Series D, with Blue Cloud Ventures, Larsen Ventures, Madrona Venture Group, Microsoft&#8217;s M12, SEEK, TEN13, and Tiger Global also participating. (To be clear it appears that <a href="https://www.businessnewsaustralia.com/articles/logan-edtech-go1-hits-unicorn-status-as-valuation-exceeds--1-billion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there were reports</a> about this Series D closing but no details on the value, the investors, nor confirmation from the company.)</p>
<p>The funding represents a major capital infusion for the startup: prior to this it had only raised about $80 million over the last six years, with the last round, a more modest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/go1-an-enterprise-learning-platform-picks-up-40m-from-microsoft-salesforce-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series C of $40 million</a>, closed 14 months ago.</p>
<p>But it also comes on the heels of impressive growth. Incubated at Y Combinator and based out of Brisbane, Australia, the company currently works with some 3.5 million users and over 1,600 enterprises globally, with companies like Microsoft, TikTok, the University of Oxford, Suzuki, Asahi and Thrifty, as well as many smaller businesses, among its customers. On average, an individual, when actively engaging on Go1, spends between two and six hours per month using the platform, and Barnes told me that its user base has grown by more than 300 percent in the last year.</p>
<p>But in a tech world now full of options for online learning content &#8212; both for K-12 as well as business users &#8212; what is perhaps more interesting is the startup&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>Currently, Go1 has some 150,000 pieces of content available in its library, but it has not created any of that itself. The material comes from some 1,000 publishers and creators, a figure that is growing weekly, said Barnes, and includes not just your standard names in online education like Pearson, EdX, Coursera and Skillsoft, but also Blinkist and the Harvard Business Review.</p>
<p>The point of Go1 is to make it easier for businesses to access and use all these materials without having to negotiate separate deals with the various rights holders, or for users to have to negotiate multiple apps or sites to use it.</p>
<p>Somewhat akin to a streaming service like Spotify, Go1 acts not just as a distributor/aggregator to access that content, but as a channel for those providers, who receive royalties based on how much their content is consumed. (And individual rights holders can also negotiate how some or all of their content is accessed, in the event that they have paywalls that they do not want to break down in specific areas.)</p>
<p>The Spotify analogy goes beyond the company&#8217;s business model: Barnes pointed out that it too calls its curated bundles &#8212; which it creates itself, or lets customers create themselves &#8212; &#8220;playlists.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We started the business six years ago because no one else was doing this, yet there was such a desire to bring together that diversity of content and make it easily available,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The challenge for employers is not just navigating the user experience of juggling multiple sites (which Go1 solves with these curated playlists), but also building learning that is still cohesive and easy to manage, regardless of which department or employee is doing the training.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I create something for the broad diversity of skills for our workforce?&#8221; is how Barnes described it to me. This is what the company addresses with the platform, he added, not only making it easier to create training for different people, but to help them find, and to suggest, relevant content that will interest those users by offering as big a selection as possible. &#8220;We help people find the needle in the haystack,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Where the analogy stops, it seems, is in how Go1 interfaces with the rest of the corporate learning market.</p>
<p>I asked Barnes if he saw companies like Success Factors as competitors, but in reality, Go1&#8217;s ethos is to integrate into whatever education or training platform a company might already use, be it SAP, Workday, Salesforce or Microsoft-based platforms, or something else altogether.</p>
<p>Borrowing another media comparison, Barnes notes that he sees Go1 as occupying the &#8220;Netflix&#8221; button on a remote: regardless of the manufacturer or pay-TV provider, you still have a way to get your Netflix fix; and so, too, is the hope for Go1 in corporate learning and development training.</p>
<p>This also means that while platforms are not rivals, others also aggregating content might well be: that likely makes for an interesting relationship with Microsoft, given that it owns LinkedIn, which has LinkedIn Learning, which also aggregates content from across a wide range of publishers.</p>
<p>It seems that while Microsoft has slowly created more integrations with LinkedIn over the years since it&#8217;s acquired it, this is one area where it&#8217;s also been okay with working with one of its competitors.</p>
<p>“Our team worked closely with Go1 on a Microsoft Teams integration to enable more enterprises to maintain corporate training remotely,” said Jeff Teper, Microsoft Corporate Vice President, Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint, said in a statement. “As many companies navigate in-person work scenarios, a plan for hybrid engagement is critical. Employees and students can access one of the world’s largest libraries of online learning resources with Go1 in Microsoft Teams. Companies can also onboard new talent and ensure essential trainings are provided regardless of employee location.”</p>
<p>One way that Go1 is looking to grow is in how it is used by the individuals that learn or train on its platform.</p>
<p>Another reason Barnes and his co-founders &#8212; Vu Tran (head of growth), Chris Eigeland (CRO), and Chris Hood (CTO) &#8212; started Go1, he said, was because of a pain point one of them directly encountered. Tran was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vutrango1/?originalSubdomain=au" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doing his training to become a doctor</a> at the time, and he found it very frustrating that he had re-do hand washing training each time he started a new rotation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no way to re-share that he’d already done that,&#8221; Barnes said. Go1 is trying to double down on that, increasing the ability for its users to &#8220;own&#8221; those credentials and certifications and re-use them in subsequent places, even when they change jobs. (Again&#8230; not unlike exporting a Spotify playlist, which you can also do.)</p>
<p>It seems that I am not the only one who sees a lot of Spotify resonance in Go1.</p>
<p>“When people think about music, they often think of Spotify and access to unlimited music for one subscription. We believe Go1 is the emerging category leader in providing a similar experience for corporate learning. Powered by AI and machine learning, Go1’s platform provides an intuitive experience, and creates an opportunity for individuals to expand their professional development goals and explore the resources to help achieve them,” said Nagraj Kashyap, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As more consumers embrace plant-based diets and sustainable food practices, Rise Gardens is giving anyone the ability to have a green thumb from the comfort of their own home.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more consumers embrace plant-based diets and sustainable food practices, <a href="http://www.risegardens.com/">Rise Gardens</a> is giving anyone the ability to have a green thumb from the comfort of their own home.</p>
<p>The Chicago-based indoor, smart hydroponic company raised $9 million in an oversubscribed Series A round, led by TELUS Ventures, with existing investors True Ventures and Amazon Alexa Fund and new investor Listen Ventures joining in. The company has a total of $13 million in venture-backed investments since Rise was founded in 2017, founder and CEO Hank Adams told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Though he began in 2017, Adams, who has a background in sports technology, said he spent a few years working on prototypes before launching the first products in 2019. Rise’s IoT-connected systems are designed to grow vegetables, herbs and microgreens year-round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Customers can choose between three system levels and get started with their first garden for about $300.</p>
<p>There is a “kind of joyousness” in being able to grow something, but people are looking for assistance because they don’t want to get into a hobby that will become demanding or stressful, Adams said. As a result, Rise’s accompanying mobile app monitors water levels and plant progress, then alert users when it’s time to water, fertilize or care for their plants.</p>
<p>“People are paying attention to food, and they care about what they eat,” he added. “Then the global pandemic played a part in this, with people leaning into growing their own food.”</p>
<p>In fact, customers leaned into growing food so much that Rise Gardens saw its sales eclipse seven figures in 2020, and gardens sold out three times during the year. Customers purchased close to 100,000 plants and have harvested 50,000.</p>
<p>The company estimates it helped keep more than 2,000 pounds of food from being wasted and saved 250,000 gallons of water since launching in 2019.</p>
<p>The concept of an indoor farm is not new. Incumbents include AeroGarden, AeroGrow, which was <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2020/11/23/scotts-miracle-gro-completes-aerogrow-acquisition.html">acquired</a> by Scotts-Miracle Gro last November, and Click &amp; Grow. Rise is among a new crop of startups that have raised funds that include Gardyn.</p>
<p>However, Rise Gardens is differentiating itself from those competitors by making its gardens from powder-coated metals and glass and are designed to be a focal point in the room. It is also offering ways for people to experiment with their gardens.</p>
<p>“We wanted something that would be flexible because once you have mastered a hobby, you will get bored,” he added. “You can start at one level and they swap out tray lids to grow more densely. We have a microgreens kit you can add, or add plant supports for tomatoes and peppers. You can also build a trellis to vine snap peas.”</p>
<p>Adams will focus the Series A dollars into product development, inventory, manufacturing, expansion into new markets and building up the team, especially in the areas of customer service and marketing. Rise has about 25 employees and plans to bring on another eight this year.</p>
<p>In addition, Rise Gardens’ products will soon be available on Amazon — its first channel outside of its website. The company is also expanding into schools in what Adams calls “version 2.0” of the school garden.</p>
<p>When Rich Osborn, president and managing partner of TELUS Ventures, evaluated the indoor garden space, he told TechCrunch that Adams and his team rose to the top of the list because of their background, data experience and syndication with Amazon.</p>
<p>Not only was consumer demand there for these kinds of products, but the sustainability and social impact created from these kinds of investments couldn’t be overemphasized, he said.</p>
<p>Nishan Majarian, co-founder and CEO of TELUS Agriculture, said he sees a future where there is a spectrum of food growth, and crop management will be at the plant level.</p>
<p>“Ever since Climate Corp. was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/02/monsanto-acquires-weather-big-data-company-climate-corporation-for-930m/">acquired</a> by Monsanto, there has been a massive influx into agriculture to get to the next billion-dollar exit,” Majarian added. “Agrifood is the last segmented supply chain. Every crop is different, every market is different. That makes it local, complex and fertile soil — pun intended — for startups who get capital to solve those issues and scale.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Ashley Sumner designed and launched Quilt, it was meant to be a response to digital social networking, preferring creating authentic in-person interactions between people who didn&#8217;t necessarily know each other before. The app would match members for in-person conversations and informal meetups in their own homes — but when COVID-19 arrived, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/quilt-an-audio-social-network-focused-on-self-care-raises-3-5-million-in-seed/">fundamentals of the model obviously changed</a>.</p>
<p>After first trying out Zoom-powered virtual video meetups as one alternative, Quilt instead settled on creating an audio platform that provided real-time conversation centered around wellness. It might sound like it has a lot in common with the rash of other audio networking startups out there, but unlike the buzzier Clubhouse or its many competitors, Quilt has carefully crafted a very different kind of community thanks to patience and building with intention.</p>
<p>Ashley talks to us this week on Found about making that big change, while also keeping intact the core mission that Quilt has been focused on from the beginning. She also tells us all about her own approach to being a founder and a leader, which is both unique and refreshing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Streaming is the name of the content game these days, and now one of the companies that builds tech to do this from anywhere in the world is getting acquired. <a href="https://www.liveu.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiveU</a> &#8212; whose satellite/cellular hardware and software for capturing and delivering live streaming and broadcasting video is used by over 3,000 large media organizations &#8212; is going to be acquired by private equity firm Carlyle, multiple sources tell TechCrunch, for a value of over $400 million.</p>
<p>LiveU is based in Israel, and the deal was <a href="https://www.calcalist.co.il/technology/article/bkd11sxf0o?utm_source=m.calcalist.co.il&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=Whatsapp&amp;utm_term=39127520&amp;utm_content=Article_Top" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported to be in the works </a>by local press. Our sources say that the acquisition is in the final stages of closing and could be announced as soon as today or tomorrow. A LiveU spokesperson declined to comment on the story, and a Carlyle spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>What is notable is that this is the second time that LiveU has changed hands in the space of two years: the company was previously acquired by Francisco Partners, another PE firm, for at <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/190602/p20#a190602p20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 million</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The quick jump in valuation, more than doubling in 25 months, is due in part to the huge surge of interest we&#8217;ve seen for video content.</p>
<p>It was not that long ago that you only watched live video on television, using a limited set of broadcast channels. Now, we have live, or near-live, or on-demand moving pictures coming at us from everywhere. On-demand and live streamed video can be found on apps (both those dedicated to broadcasting, and those that offer it alongside other content like YouTube, Facebook, and more) and websites; and not just TVs but phones, tablets and computers. It has become the primary medium for informing and entertaining people today and accounts for <a href="https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=144177#:~:text=The%20report%20highlights%20several%20statistics,than%201%25%20of%20global%20emissions." target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 80% of all IP traffic</a>.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that a company building technology to make the process of capturing and delivering that video easier, cheaper and at a better level of quality would catch attention. (LiveU has been used for a lot of high-profile coverage, from <a href="https://www.liveu.tv/en/liveu-news/press-releases/303-20201/liveu-brings-mastercard%C2%AE-sponsored-live-coverage-of-2021-australian-open-tennis-tournament-to-fans-online" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tennis championships</a> through to the <a href="https://www.liveu.tv/en/liveu-news/press-releases/303-20201/liveu-to-distribute-derek-chauvin-trial-live-feeds-via-liveu-matrix-to-global-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Derek Chauvin trial</a>.)</p>
<p>The other reason for the hike, it seems, is that LiveU itself has grown in size through an acquisition of its own. Earlier this year it <a href="https://www.liveu.tv/component/k2/303-20201/liveu-acquires-its-uk-channel-partner,-garland-partners-202103160749" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snapped up its channel partner in the UK market</a>, Garland Partners, for an undisclosed sum, to get closer to its customers in the region. One of our sources noted that this consolidation helped set the course both for LiveU to get acquired itself, and for its valuation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether there were other bidders interested in the company at the same time as Carlyle but the PE firm has been a pretty active buyer and growth-stage investor in the last year, which has been a heady one for funding in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting shifts in consumer and business behavior.</p>
<p>Other acquisitions in Europe (specifically the UK) have included 1e, a hybrid working startup based out of the UK, in deal that valued 1e at<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/carlyle-acquires-1e-com-an-endpoint-and-hybrid-working-specialist-in-270m-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $270 million</a>; and gaming company Jagex for around <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/01/22/buyout-fund-carlyle-swoop-cambridge-runescape-studio-jagex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$530 million</a>. Investments meanwhile have included a <a href="https://www.carlyle.com/media-room/news-release-archive/carlyle-invest-us200-million-kakao-mobility-south-korea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 million stake</a> in South Korean mobility-as-a-service startup Kakao Mobility. LiveU would appear to be its first deal in Israel.</p>
<p>Israel has been a big benefactor of that activity. Avihai Michaeli, a Tel Aviv-based senior investment banker and startup advisor. estimates that startups in the country collectively raised $11 billion in the first six months of 2021, and that has already grown to $12 billion as of today. PE firms are a regular shopper when it comes to Israeli exits, he said, &#8220;to improve them from within, and then sell them for an even higher value.&#8221; Other examples have included Francisco Partners acquiring MyHeritage in February for around $600 million.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll update this story as we learn more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The universe of Indian firms attempting to replicate Thrasio’s success in the world’s second largest internet market just got bigger. Three-month-old GlobalBees said on Monday it has raised $150 million in a Series A financing round led by FirstCry.</p>
<p>Lightspeed Venture Partners also invested in the new financing round, which is $75 million in equity and $75 million in debt. Even with a $75 million equity raise, Monday’s announcement makes <a href="https://www.globalbees.com">GlobalBees</a>’ round the largest Series A funding in India.</p>
<p>Founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitinagarwal1976/">Nitin Agarwal</a>, formerly of Edelweiss Financial, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/supam-maheshwari-a735a5/">Supam Maheshwari</a>, a founder of FirstCry, GlobalBees acquires and partners with digitally native brands across categories such as beauty, personal care, home and kitchen, food and nutrition, and sports and lifestyle with a revenue rate of $1 million to $20 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>New Delhi-based startup then helps these firms scale and sell to marketplaces (such as Amazon and Flipkart) and through other channels in India and outside the South Asian market, Agarwal told TechCrunch in an interview. He said GlobalBees has already acquired or partnered with over a dozen brands and they are selling both in India and outside of the country.</p>
<p>“We have created and engaged with brands in the past and realized that most of these brands reach a scale after which it becomes too difficult to scale them,” he said. “Supam and I have been talking about this for several years, trying to find ways to disrupt this market. We think there’s an opportunity to create a new house of brands that is digital native.”</p>
<p>Agarwal said GlobalBees will attempt to build a distribution and enterprise ecosystem in the online space similar to how traditional firms have established those connections in the offline world. (Not all brands GlobalBees engages with will get acquired on day one, Agarwal said. Typically, some brands get acquired in a span of three years or so, he said.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The time it takes for D2C brands to go from 0 &#8211; 100Cr (about $13 million) in revenue has more than halved over the past few years,” said Harsha Kumar, Partner at Lightspeed Venture, in a statement.</p>
<p>“We believe that this creates a unique opportunity to create a brand house much faster as well. With their past entrepreneurial stints together and their experience in building one of the largest ecommerce platforms in India, the duo of Supam and Nitin is the perfect team to go after this idea. Lightspeed is thrilled to be part of this journey!&#8221; said Kumar, who is joining the board of GlobalBees.</p>
<p>Scores of <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/06/india-thrasio-amazon-flipkart-acquire-brands-mensa/">startups in India today are trying to replicate</a> what is popularly known as the Thrasio-model. Mensa Brands, a similar venture by former fashion e-commerce Myntra chief executive, recently raised $50 million in equity and debt. 10club, another similar startup, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/10club-raises-40-million-seed-funding-to-replicate-thrasio-model-in-india/">raised $40 million</a> &#8212; though much of it is in debt. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/">reported</a> last month that UpScale, another prominent player in this space, is in advanced talks with Germany’s Razor Group to raise capital.</p>
<p>Like Thrasio, several of these firms are trying to acquire brands that sell midrange to high-end products in categories where competition is limited. In fact, some of the categories that are common among these brands are so underappreciated that even Amazon and other e-commerce firms have not explored them through their private label ecosystems.</p>
<p>GlobalBees&#8217; Agarwal agreed with this assessment, though he added that not all brands are operating in niche categories.</p>
<p>New York-headquartered Thrasio, which has raised over $1.3 billion in equity and debt since December last year, had acquired or otherwise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/">consolidated about 6,000 third-party sellers</a> on Amazon as of earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;India is at the cusp of a D2C revolution with an estimated market size of $200 billion in the next 5 years. Indian brands have shown great promise in the recent years, and we believe that GlobalBees is building great assets to accelerate the growth of digitally native brands in the country,” said Vikas Agnihotri, Operating Partner, SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement.</p>
<p>Agnihotri, alongside Atul Gupta of Premji Invest, Sudhir Sethi of Chiratae Ventures and Kshitij Sheth of Chrys Capital are also joining GlobalBees&#8217; board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Robinhood raised its $3 million seed round in 2013, it was a couple of months old with huge ambitions of democratizing securities access to the underserved and unserved. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robinhood has since taken the world by storm and grown to serve more than 30 million users with its zero-commission trading</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, we&#8217;ve seen such growth trickle down to other regions across the world, inspiring similar businesses. Robinhood is no exception. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> platforms have sprung forth to bring stock trading opportunities in their respective markets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, at least four platforms offer both local and foreign stocks to individuals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="https://chaka.com/">Chaka</a> is one such platform. Today, it is announcing the close of its $1.5 million pre-seed round to power digital investments for individuals and businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pre-seed round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Breyer Capital, while 4DX Ventures, Golden Palm Investments, Future Africa, Seedstars, and Musha Ventures participated. It&#8217;s the second joint deal for 4DX Ventures and Breyer Capital in the space of two weeks, the first in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/egyptian-social-e-commerce-platform-taager-raises-6-4m-led-by-4dx-ventures/">Egyptian social e-commerce platform Taager</a>.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a well-known fact that even before Robinhood, the average American actively participated in stock trading. According to a survey by Gallup, about 60% of Americans owned some form of stock in 2000; that number was down to 55% in 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was partly due to the global financial crisis that occurred in 2008. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crash also affected the Nigerian capital market and because </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerians lost a lot of money during that period, stock trading is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> frowned upon by most of the public</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet for the average Nigerian </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">interested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participating</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in trading local stocks is hard; and practically impossible for foreign ones</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tosinosibodu">Tosin Osibodu</a>, while in the U.S., recognised this problem and came back to Nigeria to start Chaka </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launching the company in 2019. According to Osibodu, Chaka </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wanted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to create opportunities for Nigerians to invest in dollar assets and at the same time allow foreigners to invest in Nigerian assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If there&#8217;s more demand in the market, over time, we expect there&#8217;ll be more supply. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you fast forward over a long period of time, we expect that our local capital markets will continue to grow,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We will provide borderless digital access to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solutions, and so it&#8217;s not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Nigerians investing in the market, it&#8217;s about making the markets accessible for people </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">locally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and globally.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the most part, Chaka has executed on one front. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform Nigerians access to more than 10,000 stocks and ETFs trading on local and foreign capital markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The CEO maintains that the platform has levelled entry barriers for borderless investments in Nigeria by providing customers with compliant access to the capital market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The thing about markets is that they have demand and supply with barriers to entry. We&#8217;re committed to lowering those barriers in local markets and by lowering barriers to investing for retail, more people will come to the market. In fact, more people came into the Nigerian stock market through us last year than any other broker. It&#8217;s like a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">demand-supply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> flywheel,&#8221; the CEO added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaka&#8217;s local assets </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are registered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) Central Securities Clearing System (CSCS) and regulated by the Securities Exchange Commission of Nigeria (SEC). Dollar assets, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are regulated by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the US FINRA and the US SEC.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April this year, digital investment platforms </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/nigerias-sec-warns-investment-platforms-to-stop-trading-unregistered-foreign-securities/">caught</a></span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/nigerias-sec-warns-investment-platforms-to-stop-trading-unregistered-foreign-securities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in crosshairs with Nigeria&#8217;s SEC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The regulator declared their activities illegal and warned capital market operators working with them to renege on providing brokerage services for foreign securities. Unlike Robinhood which offers online brokerages, Nigerian investment platforms do not. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaka, for instance, partners with Citi Investment Capital in Nigeria and DriveWealth LLC in the U.S. to issue stocks and securities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Nigeria&#8217;s SEC, the bottom line was to bring the activities of these platforms under its purview as part of its efforts to safeguard the investing public. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Osibodu claims Chaka had always engaged the SEC since the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was formed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019, it did not seem that way last December when</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the regulator <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/01/06/sec-vs-chaka-regulation-may-be-coming-to-investment-tech-platforms/">singled out</a> the two-year-old company for &#8220;selling and advertising stocks.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event set the precedence for the regulator&#8217;s all-out attack on other digital investment platforms, giving Chaka enough time to <a href="https://medium.com/chaka-ng/our-commitment-to-regulatory-compliance-cc75ed9c900d">engage and conclude talks</a> in about half a year. And last month, Chaka <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/06/23/chaka-license-sec-nigeria-stock-trading-app/">acquired the first fintech license issued by the SEC</a>, making it the only investment platform operating as a digital sub-broker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we launched, we kept SEC in the loop. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, over the last six months, we&#8217;ve engaged with them, showed them our business models, the benefits, the markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now we&#8217;re proud to have SEC&#8217;s first fintech license. We believe that the most important thing is that the market has clarity and understands the regulations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be registered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we&#8217;re thrilled </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to have broken new ground and cleared up what it takes to be able to offer services in the market,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new license, the company can swiftly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">focus on what lies ahead. Osibodu says the license expands the scope of what Chaka can achieve. He asserts that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaka can power </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brokers and provide access to different digital investment offerings in addition to being a digital sub-broker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asides from Chaka&#8217;s traditional stock trading app for retail investors, it also offers</span><a href="http://chaka.com/license"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaka SDK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which allows asset managers and financial institutions to offer digital investments and</span><a href="http://chaka.com/license"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaka for Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for direct business onboarding and trading tools for institutional investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://breyercapital.com/jim-breyer/">Jim Breyer</a> of Breyer Capital, commenting on the investment said, &#8220;We are proud to combine efforts with a company that is levelling the investment playing field for Nigerians [and Africans at large]. We&#8217;re confident in the value Chaka provides through its digital tools, and we look forward to playing our part in supporting Chaka’s team on their mission to drive borderless investments in Africa.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osibodu says the company will use its pre-seed investment to expand footprints to Ghana and other West African markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Improving its technology and services and securing partnerships with major financial institutions, including apex ones, is also a priority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As we advance, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> something that we&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> very focused on is how do we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">continually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reduce access barriers, and we are proud of the initiatives that we&#8217;ve brought and are to come. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch this space for more partnerships, even with apex institutions in our markets as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blackstone is acquiring a majority stake in Bangalore and San Francisco-headquartered edtech startup <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com">Simplilearn</a> for $250 million.</p>
<p>Simplilearn operates an eponymous online bootcamp to help people learn data science, AI, machine learning, cloud computing and other skills that are in demand in the market.</p>
<p>The startup has partnerships with several universities and colleges including IIT Kanpur, Caltech, and Purdue University and students enrolling and completing these courses get a certificate from these institutes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The 11-year-old startup, which runs 1,000 live classes each month, says it has helped over 2 million professionals and 2,000 companies including Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon across 150 countries.</p>
<p>The startup, which was last valued at $80 million in its 2016 Series C funding round, counts Brand Capital, Kalaari Capital, Helion Venture Partners, and Mayfield among its early backers. It had raised about $34.4 million prior to today&#8217;s deal, according to insight platform Tracxn.</p>
<p>Kalaari Capital, Helion Venture Partners and Mayfield Fund have taken exit as part of the new transaction but the leadership team of Simplilearn haven&#8217;t sold their stakes, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pandemic has only accelerated the need for digital skills and the industry has demonstrated absolute readiness for upskilling online. Hence, this is the most opportune time to take the next big leap in our journey to build the world&#8217;s largest digital skilling company,&#8221; said Krishna Kumar, founder and chief executive of Simplilearn, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe Blackstone can add significant value to our company because of their scale, commitment to building businesses, and global network, which will enable us to develop partnerships with businesses and universities as Simplilearn continues to expand around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The acquisition comes months after Blackstone-backed Aakash Education Services, which runs coaching centres across the country, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/byjus-acquires-indian-tutor-aakash-for-nearly-1-billion/">acquired by Byju&#8217;s</a> &#8212; India&#8217;s most valuable startup &#8212; for nearly $1 billion. Blackstone has since also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">made an investment in Byju&#8217;s</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Blackstone&#8217;s first private equity investment in Asia in a consumer technology company. [&#8230;] We are excited to partner with Krishna Kumar and Simplilearn&#8217;s top-notch management team to accelerate growth and build the world&#8217;s pre-eminent digital learning company, and we expect this to be the first of many such investments in Asia,&#8221; said Amit Dixit, head of Asia for Blackstone, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Temasek and Falcon Edge Capital have led a $220 million investment in Indian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/softbank-lenskart-india/">omni-channel eyewear retailer Lenskart</a>, valuing the Bangalore-based startup at $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>The new investment, which includes primary and secondary transactions, is part of a new round Lenskart unveiled a month ago when it raised $95 million from global investment fund KKR. Bay Capital and Chiratae also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>Peyush Bansal, founder and chief executive of <a href="http://lenskart.com">Lenskart</a>, said the profitable startup &#8212; which sells eyeglasses and contact lenses online and through about 750 physical retail outlets across the country &#8212; has seen a surge in sales of eyewear products in the pandemic year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, which counts SoftBank among its investors, sold about 8 million pairs of eyewear last year.</p>
<p>Now the firm, which claims to lead the market in India, plans to scale its operations in Southeast Asia and Middle East. The combined market opportunity for eyewear in these regions will be about $15 billion by 2025, the startup said, citing its own projections.</p>
<p>“We’re already the largest eyewear player in India and in the top 3 in Singapore. Lenskart envisions to have 50% of India wearing its specs over the next 5 years and become the #1 eyewear platform in Southeast Asia and Middle East over the next 18 to 24 months through organic and inorganic expansion,” he said.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-loses-37bn-because-of-poor-eye-vision-Study/articleshow/20367747.cms">industry estimates</a>, more than half a billion people in India are affected by poor vision and need eyeglasses, but only 170 million of them have opted to get their vision corrected.</p>
<p>The firm also plans to deploy some capital to broaden its technology stack to create a more personalized experience for its customers. The startup, which recently launched ‘Lenskart Vision Fund,’ said it is also looking to invest in other younger firms that are operating in eyewear, eyecare and omnichannel retail spaces.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to join Peyush and his team in this journey and look forward to working closely with Lenskart’s team in helping them scale their business internationally, especially in the MENA region” said Navroz Udwadia, co-founder and partner at Falcon Edge Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>The new investment comes at a time when Indian startups are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">raising record capital</a> and a handful of mature firms are beginning to explore the public markets. Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">raised $1.3 billion last week</a> in the South Asian market&#8217;s first consumer tech IPO in a decade.</p>
<p>Paytm, the pioneer digital payments startup, as well as its rival Mobikwik also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/paytm-files-for-2-2-billion-ipo/">filed for IPOs last week</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zoom is taking advantage of the impressive rise in its stock price in the past year to make its first major acquisition. The popular video conferencing firm, which was valued at about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/looking-back-at-zooms-ascent-a-year-after-it-filed-to-go-public/">$9 billion at its IPO two years ago</a>, said Sunday evening it has agreed a deal to buy cloud call centre service provider Five9 for about $14.7 billion in an all-stock transaction.</p>
<p>20-year-old Five9 will become an operating unit of Zoom after the deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2022, the two firms said.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is Zoom’s latest attempt to expand its offerings. In the past year, the video conferencing software has added several office collaboration products, a cloud phone system, and an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/zoom-introduces-all-in-one-home-communications-appliance-for-599/">all-in-one home communications appliance</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The acquisition of Five9 &#8212; which has amassed over 2,000 customers worldwide including Citrix and Under Armour and processes over 7 billion minutes of calls annually &#8212; will help Zoom enter the “$24 billion” market for contact centers, the company said.</p>
<p>“We are continuously looking for ways to enhance our platform, and the addition of Five9 is a natural fit that will deliver even more happiness and value to our customers,” said Eric S. Yuan, founder and chief executive of Zoom, in a statement.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Joining forces will offer both firms &#8220;significant&#8221; cross-selling opportunities in each other&#8217;s respective customer bases, the two firms said.</p>
<p>“Businesses spend significant resources annually on their contact centers, but still struggle to deliver a seamless experience for their customers,” said Rowan Trollope, chief executive of Five9.</p>
<p>“It has always been Five9’s mission to make it easy for businesses to fix that problem and engage with their customers in a more meaningful and efficient way. Joining forces with Zoom will provide Five9’s business customers access to best-of-breed solutions, particularly Zoom Phone, that will enable them to realize more value and deliver real results for their business. This, combined with Zoom’s ‘ease-of use’ philosophy and broad communication portfolio, will truly enable customers to engage via their preferred channel of choice.”</p>
<p>The two firms will do a joint Zoom call Monday to share more about the transaction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While working as the chief operating officer of a pizza chain in Vietnam, Taku Tanaka saw how difficult it is for restaurants to connect with farmers. Many small F&amp;B businesses can’t buy in large volumes, so they rely on nearby markets or multiple suppliers who only sell one category. In turn, this means farmers are disconnected from the end customers of their products, making it hard to predict selling prices or plan their crops. Tanaka founded <a href="https://www.web.kamereo.vn/?lang=en">Kamereo</a>, B2B platform with its own warehouse and last-mile delivery network, to focus on those problems.</p>
<p>Based in Ho Chi Minh City, the company announced today that it has raised $4.6 million co-led by food conglomerate CPF Group, Quest Ventures and Genesia Ventures. The capital will be used for hiring, building a new warehouse management system, user interface upgrades and expanding into Hanoi next year.</p>

<p>Before founding Kamereo in 2018, Tanaka was COO of Pizza 4Ps, which grew from one location in Ho Chi Minh City when he joined to 10 stores three years later (it now has more than 30 locations in Vietnam).</p>
<p>Kamereo works with about 15 farmers, including cooperatives, and serves more than 400 active customers, ranging in size from family-owned restaurants to chains with more than 20 locations. Despite COVID-19 related movement restrictions and temporary business closures, Kamereo says it has grown by 15% every month over the last 12 months. It currently has about 100 employees.</p>
<p>F&amp;B businesses use the platform to order from multiple farmers. Kamereo handles supplier negotiations, order processing and management, and fulfillment. Tanaka told TechCrunch that the company operates its own warehouses and last-mile delivery network because it is cheaper than working with third-party providers.</p>

<p>Most of Kamereo’s last-mile deliveries are done by motorbikes since Vietnam has many small roads that are inaccessible to trucks. Tanaka said one drawback is how many goods can be delivered in one trip. Since drivers need to make multiple trips each day, Kamereo plans to expand its micro-warehouse network in Ho Chi Minh City so they don’t need to travel long distances. Its tech team is also building an internal system to manage inventory, fulfillment and last-mile deliveries with the goal of minimizing variable costs.</p>
<p>In a statement about the investment, Quest Ventures partner Goh Yiping said, “Kamereo sites in one of the largest food production hubs of Southeast Asia, and there is much room to grow in solving many of the inefficiencies of the supply chain today, improving farmers&#8217; livelihood outcomes and procuring the best products for businesses and homes.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2yP4yLk9xM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>As the pandemic dwindled enough to get in our car with dogs, SiriusXM, and our children in the rear view mirror, we drove to South Carolina. Tina had endured the last year and almost another half while her mother languished with aging pets, her husband in a facility, and eventually his death. As the miles melted away, we alternated between MSNBC, the Beatles channel, and a mixtape of soul, Steely Dan, and Bill Withers.</p>
<p>For years, we&#8217;d dreamed of a way to live from anywhere, and now the pandemic had made our reality a shared one. We&#8217;ll see how much this sticks as companies try to find a way to mix this digital acceleration with some semblance of business life as we knew it. But as we reached the driveway in Charleston, we were tired enough to not care much how the captains of industry would work things out.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;d calculated the journey to leave on a Monday and arrive on a Thursday, three 16 hour days and then a day to rest before recording the next Gang session. Instead we left on Tuesday and arrived the night before the session. Surprisingly, the combination. of a three hour time zone shift and the ease of recording on Zoom, two M1 Macs, and enough WiFi to get away with it added up to a relaxed session. I&#8217;ve been using blur mode on Zoom for some months now, so everything felt just about normal. I even got to joke with a few of the guys who could not quite tell which coast we were on.</p>
<p>The dogs locked in to their summer digs with alacrity, roaming the fenced in back yard for a quick check and then settling into strategic spots surrounding us on our bed. Our daughters heated up the Facetime video link with tales of boyfriends and babies (our oldest is in her six month) and extended life seemed possible. When reality intruded, it somehow arrived with a gentleness we hope to get used to. Dinner with our youngest&#8217;s godparents was careful — no masks but no hugs either— as we ease our way into the new next.</p>
<p>Our first show here was followed by a train wreck of dueling agendas and uncomfortable management parries. The show started in a jocular fashion as Brent Leary tried to apologize (sort of) for his comments on one of his shows about the Gillmor Gang. It seems, he joked, that our show was rudderless and frequently a good opportunity to nap on air.</p>
<p>But then Brent said he hoped neither Tina nor I was watching this unspooling in realtime, which of course I was. Now I was both pissed off and actually more amused. Brent&#8217;s instincts fall somewhere between Harpo Marx&#8217;s brilliant silence and an unerring ability to bat back a question designed to prove he wasn&#8217;t engaged with a comment that proved not only that he was but that he chose not to say anything. Brilliant, devastating, and kind all at once. So I seized the moment to call him and say of course I was watching.</p>
<p>The next Gang recording session featured Brent&#8217;s repeated attempts at an apology or at least an explanation, but I kept interrupting him. The result was a funny but diffuse beginning to the show that devolved into a debate about social media and the First Amendment that we often can&#8217;t seem to avoid. As usual, no light was shed, and the show remains unreleased.</p>
